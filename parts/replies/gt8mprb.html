			<div class="markdown"><p>What is also interesting is if you look at all the historical paths of hurricanes, they don’t seem to have any commonality to them. </p>
<p>I’ve always understood chaos theory as real life systems with a lot of variables (that matter) are impossible for us to predict currently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only currently, its about the limits of predictibility in general. Sure having better measurements and knowing more and having more computational resources can give you better predictions. But the main problem stays, you cant know the position and movements of every single Atom accuraly, but to make perfect predictions you need to. So the question becomes, when will the unknowns take over and my prediction become worthless? Chaotic Systems are examples where this happens extremely quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about Chaos is that it can emerge in relatively simple systems -- with only one or two variables. That's what makes the findings surprising: simple systems can exhibit wildly unpredictable behavior as they evolve over time (sensitive dependence on initial conditions). Unknowns due to hidden variables aren't necessary to make the thing act crazy. The theory lays out criteria for identifying systems, even simple ones, that will display chaotic behavior. You can tell when you have a reasonable expectation of accurate prediction (weather systems in the near term) and when you should give up on trying to predict (the random number generator in a video game).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The double hinged pendulum is an excellent example of chaos theory.</p>
<p>When let go at seemingly the same position, the resulting path of travel for all points of the pendulum appears to be random. Even the slightest difference in input results in a completely different output.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I particularly like the pendulum example, because unlike the sandstorm example that clearly has tons and tons of independent variables (sand grains and wind), the pendulum seems like it has only a couple of independent variables, but it also gives rise to chaos very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are getting at the crux of the matter here. The biggest misconception of Chaos I see most often is &quot;...the system has too many variables to track...&quot; But the random number generator in a program can use only one variable (system time in seconds, say), iterate it in a chaotic equation some number of times, and generate a list of randomly distributed values. When we're being pedantic we'll say the list is 'pseudo-random' because if we use the exact same seed value we'll get the exact same set of numbers. But, for practical purposes, we couldn't have predicted those numbers in any other way, so... random. It's not like I can look at a Minecraft world seed and tell you what the terrain will look like.</p></div>		</li>
