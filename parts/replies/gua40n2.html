			<div class="markdown"><p>If the gates are close enough together, don't we get electrons &quot;jumping&quot; and thus becoming an error or mistake? I suppose it really just comes down to your definition. Mistake implies a decision which implies consciousness to me so perhaps they can only perform something in error</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats... Well I'm not sure if it's wrong but I'm more not sure it's right. &quot;Computers&quot; are really complicated and there are in fact things than can go &quot;wrong&quot; due to all kinds of non-human related things. Well designed systems mitigate this but it's pretty not correct to say that computers can't make mistakes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is incorrect although I guess you could say that computers don't make mistakes, computer hardware designers do.</p>
<p>Go listen to this, it's fascinating.</p>

<p>since all the numbers are binary, you only need to perform a 2 bit operation. logic gates from the article can be implemented with transistors.</p></div>		</li>
