			<div class="markdown"><p>Tropical rainforests (Amazon, Congo. etc.) actually have open understories. That's because the canopies are dense enough to limit the sunlight that reaches the floor. It's only at the edges (for example, when viewed from a river, or at the edge of a clearcut or village) that it is dense. Secondary forests can be dense as well, but in the mature stage the understory clears out. Many explorers wrote of the &quot;dense jungles&quot; they encountered because they were viewing them while traveling down a river.</p></div>		</li>
