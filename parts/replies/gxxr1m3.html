			<div class="markdown"><p>Australia had a spate of these sorts of killings/incapacitations in Sydney. The state government urged the press to refer to them as coward punches and they did. Many many less of them since then (as well as some draconian laws about pubs closing at 3, no admittance to any pub after 1, drinks in plastic cups only after 9pm, not to mention the shutdowns due to Covid-19) but anyway, coward punches is what they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Queensland created a whole new kind of murder to address this. Apparently a lot of the suckerpunchers were getting the lesser punishment for manslaughter so they created a higher charge for death resulting from a strike to the head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was drunk and being a dumb ass. The guy came by the party and wasn’t invited, when he was going to leave,
My friend came out of the house and just punched him. Surprised everyone. I don’t keep up with him anymore. Truly unfortunate for everyone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The word you are looking for is &quot;killed&quot;. </p>
<p>Murdered requires intent to kill. Manslaughter does not. </p>
<p>Killed is neutral and doesn't care about intent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The legal definition of murder does not require intent to kill; this is a fairly common misconception.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justia.com/criminal/offenses/homicide/second-degree-murder/" target="_blank">https://www.justia.com/criminal/offenses/homicide/second-degree-murder/</a></p>
<p>“Similarly, when a defendant does not intend to kill, but acts with a complete and utter reckless disregard for human life, or “depraved heart,” this mental state is also sufficient for second-degree murder.”</p>
<p>In fact, the person can be held liable for murder even if they didn’t directly murder the person:</p>
<p><a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/penal-code/pen-sect-189.html" target="_blank">https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/penal-code/pen-sect-189.html</a></p>
<p>“(e) A participant in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of a felony listed in subdivision (a) in which a death occurs is liable for murder only if one of the following is proven:</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>(3) The person was a major participant in the underlying felony and acted with reckless indifference to human life, as described in subdivision (d) of Section 190.2 .”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Punches to the back of the head should never be advocated, it is a shameful and reckless thing to do. These hits are colloquially known as &quot;coward punches&quot; in Australia as only a fucking coward would resort to such extreme measures regardless of whether it is self defense or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arguably, I'm not even sure it would be self defense if the person is facing away from you. If the person is facing you, you'd have to be really lucky, or super well trained, to get enough force to impact that area while simultaneously fending off an attacker. That also opens up to that grey area where/when self defense stops being self defense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn’t self defence to strike someone facing away or walking away from you. The criteria for self defence is generally pretty specific. Provocation, not so much, but provocation doesn’t generally get you off, just mitigates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A boy I used to be friends with got into an argument on a night out a few months back. A 20 year old boy stepped in to try and defuse the situation. As he walked away, my “friend” ran up and punched him in the back of the head. “Friend” is also a boxer and absolutely should’ve known better. The boy died from that single punch. Heartbreaking.</p></div>		</li>
