			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered how they actually get the rope from one side of a ravine to the other. Like in Temple of Doom when Indiana Jones cuts that rope bridge down, that was across a massive chasm that couldn't have been easy to build over. How would they have originally gotten the rope across that span?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 ropes were often used. Where each rope would be thrown to the middle of the chasm, and somebody at the bottom would tie them together.</p>
<p>COPY PASTE FROM A LOWER COMMENT OF MINE</p>
<p>One huge benefit to ancient bridges is their length. A cannion/ravine is far shorter than soemthing like the Golden Gate Bridge. Early bridges didn't need supports inside the water/hole, and could be entirely supported at just each end. </p>
<p>A second benefit is they do not have to take earth curvature into account. While older civilisations were aware of curvature, exact, precise measurements of the measurements were not easy, and so a bridge over several miles wouldn't be considered, as flexible, sturdy materials that could curve a degree or so would be needed, which couldn't me mass manufactured.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Classic example: [Alexander the Great and Tyre](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_(332_BC" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_(332_BC</a>)  ). Tyre was the wealthiest city of Phoenicia (the ancient traders who circumnavigated Africa). The Phoenician fortress was an island one kilometre off the coast. I say WAS an island, Because now it's just a bump in the coastline. Because Alexander the Great decided that a kilometre of sea was not going to stop him. </p>
<p>When we ask &quot;how did the ancients do this&quot; the simple answer is &quot;by being more bad-ass than us.&quot; Like, the people of Tyre thought they were invincible, and taunted Alexander by capturing some of his soldiers, taking them to the top of the high city walls, and killing them in sight of everybody. The sea would protect them, right? So Alexander simply filled in the sea and crucified 2,000 Tyrians on the beach, before selling everybody else into slavery.</p></div>		</li>
