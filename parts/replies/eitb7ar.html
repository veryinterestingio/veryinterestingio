<p>Well, if you were standing on a basketball you would be tall enough to look down and see the curvature. I think the OP is asking how small a 'moon' would have to be for this type of shape to take form if standing on the surface looking out towards what we call the horizon on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct ,before actually seeing a curvature what you can notice is that the horizon looks lower than your eye level.    I realized this looking at the sea from top of a building .
My altitude over sea level was 150m total. I looked at horizon and noticed it looked lower than horizontal with my eyes.  I initially thought the earth is too large for this angle to be visible with naked eye,  however later I calculated and the angle between horizon and horizontal  at that height would be 0.4 degrees which is small but well within what the human eye can detect.
In the moon considering you would already need to be at a tall spot to begin with this should be much more noticeable </p></div>		</li>
