			<div class="markdown"><p>if you re-watch an episode of friends, take note of the number of locations filmed it.   there's the girls apartment, the boys apartment and the coffee shop.   ..  and they're three sides of teh same soundstage.   everything else is either a nondescript set made up from what they could find in the props department, OR it's stock footage.   </p>
<p>everything in that film you just watched as filmed just for that film. </p>
<p>similarly, there's ZERO cgi, and zero practical effects in 90% of situational dramas, and even police procedurals will only have one &quot;fx&quot; piece, right at the start, which will have minimal practical effects, ..  and even then it will only show up in the rest of the episode as still photo's, or as a run-on flashback scene that could have all been filmed in one take/one session.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>exactly. And even on a show like friends, every now and then they will have a bottle episode that only takes place on one of those $0.03 just so they do not have to have all of the extra time and effort to set up the other two sets, movie actors around, and all that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with Seinfeld. Yes they spent a fortune building a NYC street. But it's only a small section of street and they reuse it a lot. Any street you see in Seinfeld is that exact same small stretch of street just dressed slightly different.</p></div>		</li>
