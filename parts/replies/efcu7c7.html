			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi.  One shouldn't burn plastics at all. That can release toxins into the environment. If you have recycling at all just follow your local recycling guidelines. Don't put anything you aren't sure can be recycled into recycling because it creates contamination and reduces the possibility that other recyclable plastics can actually be recycled.  If you aren't sure that something can be recycled, put it in the trash. Yes it will end up in a landfill but that's considered the least offensive of the options. <strong>--Rebecca</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd wholeheartedly agree for city dwellers, but remain to be convinced that where we are it is a problem. I have a scientific background, though, and some understanding of combustion science. I am more than happy to be convinced if there are good arguments against burning in my situation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The combustion temperatures and conditions in a fireplace produce mostly complete decomposition, but with the high concentrations of halides in the plastic, you will inevitably produce a trace amount of highly toxic products that will be localized inside your fireplace and you will come into contact with them. There will be a lower concentration of moderately toxic halocarbon compounds that will not be done reacting after they burn. They will continue to react with atmospheric water, producing even more biologically active compounds. There will be little danger of the compounds that come out of your chimney. </p></div>		</li>
