<p>As of this week, the DPRK has reported no new cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is rather a bit of disagreement on that, the fact <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2021/01/what-is-the-truth-about-covid-19-in-north-korea/" target="_blank">North Korea keeps tightening restrictions</a> despite the obvious economic cost the regime can not really afford would seem to say they definitely do have some cases.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past year, North Korea has increased the number of tests and has on occasion locked down entire cities such as Kaesong, Hyesan, Nampo, and Pyongyang</p>
<p>“It is unreasonable to say that there is no coronavirus case in North Korea”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might not be a total disaster but I don't think that sounds like a place that would have recorded zero cases by now. You can never take anything that regime says at face value, always look for independent sources. Sure sometimes the real truth is somewhere in the middle but it's almost never what the DPRK's line is.</p></div>		</li>
