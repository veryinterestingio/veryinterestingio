			<div class="markdown"><p>I have already asked this above, but seeing as you're an expert....!</p>
<p>Any idea what physical properties of silver and gold make them so good for high-end flutes? It is not just ostentation, they seem to be more resonant than cheap nickel flutes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that flutes are wind instruments, so the primary source of sound is standing waves in a tube of air. The tones produced primarily depend on the geometry of the flute rather than the natural frequencies of the flute itself.</p>
<p>Of course the flute itself is a structure and does vibrate. The vibration of the flute does interact with the standing air waves to boost the tone. Selecting a different material, say silver alloy vs. silver plated brass, is going to make a subtle difference. I already mentioned material damping (tendency for free vibration to decay more quickly) will make some difference. Silver alloy isn't as stiff as brass, and it's heavier, so all else the same, the silver flute will have lower natural frequencies than brass. And finally, build quality is going to make a difference in lots of respects, geometric accuracy, losses at valves, etc. Chances are that $2000 flute is going to be built much better than the $399 student special.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, the material is clearly not the primary factor in sound production, but it undoubtedly has a subtle (though obvious and important to a flautist) effect on the tone.</p>
<p>Material damping sounds like it might be the key (related to coefficient of restitution perhaps? Parroting a term I learned on this thred)... </p>
<p>I am beginning to suspect that the effect might be so subtle and hard to study that it is effectively a mystery, more art than science.  Indeed some people are perfectly confident declaring (a priori, based on simple physics) that the effect is non existent, and professional flautists who say otherwise must be deluded.  This would mean that you could make a flute from any material whatsoever, and it would sound identical to a flute of the same dimensions made of any other material... I don't think so somehow!</p></div>		</li>
