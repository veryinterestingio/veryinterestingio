<p>Salt is so prevalent on the earth that creatures which need salt to function would be favored by evolution over creatures that need something rare like gold, and then within the creatures that need salt, the creatures which can recognize the taste are going to be favored over those that can't, and creatures which like the taste will be favored over those that don't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but people over assert 'favored by evolution' type statements where they have no relevance and its a huge pet peeve, so i avoid personifying evolution. it's a broad theory of a highly generalized processes based on multiple hypotheses/observations, which doesn't have capacity to favor things. but thats just semantics i guess.</p></div>		</li>
