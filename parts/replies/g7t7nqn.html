<p>May have to look into that more because it seems obvious that some people seem to rely more on logic and reason than others who often rely on intuition and emotion. It could make sense on the most basic level for a brain to be hardwired to make a decision on instinct or emotion instead of waiting to process the information logically.</p></div>		</li>
