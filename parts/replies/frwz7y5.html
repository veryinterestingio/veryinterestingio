			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less. The general goal of most private equity is a quick re-sale of the company or its parts. Often this includes cost-cutting measures and selling off unprofitable portions of the business. </p>
<p>Private equity is not typically in the business for the long term. They want to enter, and then exit out quickly and make their money. For some of the businesses that get big headlines when they fail, if you look back at the history, they may have traded hands between different PE groups a number of times before it finally collapses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bain Capital (Mitt Romney) did something like this as normal operating procedure.</p>
<p>This is also what happened to Toys ‘R Us.</p>
<p>Borrow money to buy controlling interest in a company.</p>
<p>Make the company you just bought into responsible for paying off the loans.</p>
<p>Charge the company management fees while running it into the ground.</p>
<p>Drop a grenade and bounce while the company is being dismantled by bankruptcy to pay back the loans.</p>
<p>Also, take a look at Puerto Rico.  Lots of hedge funds have been loaning the local government money knowing that they won’t be able to pay it back for the purpose of foreclosing on real assets such as land and infrastructure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're mixing part of the story to create a narrative that is a lot more complicated.  Bain owned ToysRUs for 12 years.  They lost somewhere around a billion dollars on the deal after the $200 million in fees.  As in their personal investment not the debt they put on ToysRUs.  There were also companies like Staples and Firestone tires that Bain probably saved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>cool video, but I don't like how he makes things more confusing in an effort to simplify it.  Case in point: is there any possible way to increase profits by PAYING interest?  That is nonsensical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/rodifJlis2c?t=57" target="_blank">Step 4.  Borrow a pile of money from banks.  Since interest payments are deductible from company income, presto, the company shows even bigger profits.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say without corporate debt, I am running a business with $100K in profits.  So I borrow a bunch of money - say $10M - and my interest payments are, say, $100K.  Now my profits are ZERO.  Not bigger.</p></div>		</li>
