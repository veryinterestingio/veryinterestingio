<p>Deer are red-green colorblind and extremely sensitive to movement. </p>

<p>Which is apparently why tigers are orange. Their main prey sees them as green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually with deers, you gotta pay much much more attention to your sounds and smells than colours, which is really not what you would normally pay attention to :)
Funnily enough this is related to humans too, I mean spraying yourself with perfumes or washing with adidas sports shampoo isn't the best idea, whether you wanna go hunting or ambushing soldiers in the forest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are sensitive to sound and smell, but movement is also huge with deer, especially the males. Does are curious and will stare at you quizzically, while bucks will bolt at the sight of anything that seems out of the ordinary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's right and you are right.</p>
<p>He's right because he's talking about deer vision, which is what the OP's question is about. Deer are red/green color blind and have very poor eyesight compared to humans, we have very sharp eyes, only a few species have better eyesight than humans(birds of prey being a prime example).</p>
<p>But just like how we have better vision than deer, Deer have much better sense of smell and hearing than we do. Their nose is so much better than ours, that people will think a forest is completely devoid of deer, when all that's happening is the deer can smell a human sweating and they're avoiding the area. </p>
<p>The same is true for their ears. I've been 100 yards from a deer(a football field away) and had them look right at me when I set my phone down on a piece of wood. It's unreal how good their sense of smell and hearing is.</p>
<p>But in regards to OP's question about Camo, the vision stuff is still all true. You don't even really need camo as long as you wear darker colors and don't move. Back in the 1800's <a href="https://www.wideopenspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hunting-photos-1.jpg" target="_blank">people didn't even have camo and shot tons of game</a>.</p></div>		</li>
