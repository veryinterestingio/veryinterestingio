			<div class="markdown"><p>I can say anecdotally that being touch deprived in my early twenties had a profound effect on my emotional stability. I'm talking years of really only getting small touches here and there, but nothing that I'd classify as &quot;affectionate&quot;. I found that hot showers and body pillows + weighted blankets helped the most, even though it was very fleeting. The first time I found myself in a relationship, I felt so much calmer and relaxed in my day-to-day life. And better at concentrating too.</p>
<p>Physical loneliness is a big problem for many, many people. And there's no real way to alleviate it like general loneliness, where there's online interactions or parasocial relationships with Youtubers or live streamers. Nobody can give me an <em>actual</em> hug right now, for instance. Just words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was actually thinking about asking a friend of mine to cuddle a while back. Nothing untoward and it wouldn't be awkward for us to do so but I definitely feel the need to be touched by someone I'm comfortable and can relax around.</p>
<p>It feels like a legit need sometimes and I'm nearly 30.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Society tends to tell us adults need to be independent in every way, but the reality is that our biology says otherwise. Everyone needs some level of connection. Some people need very little, and some people need a lot. Being close with another person, physically and emotionally, is something I need to feel completely fulfilled and content. I can be happy alone, but I'll always desire for someone to be with me. That's just our nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a friend who talked about this and said people will get massages to have some sort of physical contact and that helps. It's something I never thought about since my family is pretty touchy-feely. I never ever thought about what it would be like to not be touched. It sounds awful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went out and got a massage once exactly because of that. That was back when I was in a darker place. I mean, it was also just a nice experience that made my neck and back feel great, but it was motivated at first by a desire to be touched.</p>
<p>It's not so bad at first, but being alone for long periods of time was <strong>bad</strong> for me. Luckily social interaction helps a fair amount (which I had to work hard to build over time), but it only gets you a fraction of the way. Over time I got numb to it, which is not so great either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Failure to Thrive can also have biological causes - in 1st world countries most cases are abuse/neglect, but metabolic conditions or things like celiac disease can cause it too. My son had it, even though we were frantically bringing him to the doctor from 6 months on. Was diagnosed at 12 months after 9 days inpatient at the children's hospital.</p>
<p>When they first diagnised FTT we were terrified they'd think we were neglecting him, since everything online nowadays says it's caused by abuse, but they nearly instantly reassured us that it wasn't the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't realize that it was still used to refer to anything other than neglect cases. Celiac's is rough. I used to nanny for a little girl who has it. She wasn't diagnosed until age 6. I hope your son is doing better now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Failure to thrive just means the person isn't progressing or maintaining health. It is used most often for infants that aren't gaining weight or meeting developmental milestones, or for elderly that stop eating and are losing weight inappropriately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that failure to thrive is the generalized term for ‘the child fails to develop as expected’  which can also include biological growth and causes as well. The cause of failure to thrive has to be worked out next to fix it.</p></div>		</li>
