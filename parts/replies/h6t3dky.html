			<div class="markdown"><p>The only good and true answer so far. I'd add that the voltage raise when you apply current can be modelled as equivalent series resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but it kind of shows why you can't simply increase current without increasing voltage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting into the why would be even more unnecessarily complex. </p>
<p>I thought about using the ole' water analogy but I couldn't think of a good one. I guess in this case the battery could be a pressure vessel but I can't think of one where once you reach the max pressure you can just keep adding to it without further increasing pressure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That implies that we could do it, we just don't for longevity. That's not the case.</p>

<p>Yet this is exactly how batteries did charge in the not too distant past. They would overvoltage, continuing to &quot;fast&quot; charge until fully charged (often with a charger that was effectively binary and dumb). This would damage the cells -- though there is a wide chasm between &quot;damage capacity and reduce longevity&quot; and &quot;burn your house down&quot;, though the latter did occasionally happen -- but it charged quickly.</p>
<p>The whole notion of slowing the charge and maximizing battery life is a relatively recent invention.</p>
<p>So yeah, your charger could charge your phone's final 20% faster. Quite a bit faster. And it's unlikely that it will catch on fire. On the flip side, you could expect the more traditional very short battery life that used to be the norm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My battery absolutely does not discharge at a constant rate. If the first 80% went at the rate of the last 20%, It’d be dead in an hour after a full charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the state of charge estimation is not accurate and does not represent what is actually going on inside the battery. The phone isn't drawing more power when the battery is low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you expand on this? Why can't phone software accurately estimate capacity at low charge? My final 15% often lasts minutes. I have wondered why and can't find a clear explanation. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's to do with the battery state-of-charge estimation in whichever device you're using. The battery itself will discharge at a constant rate under a constant load. If you put a 5 Watt load on the battery it will discharge at 5 Watts until it's empty.</p></div>		</li>
