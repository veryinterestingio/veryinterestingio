			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly ADHD. Everyone keeps saying ADHD means you can’t focus but that just isn’t true. </p>
<p>It’s the quest for dopamine. If the current task doesn’t help with that goal, your brain context switches. But if something does produce a dopamine response, then the brain can become hyper focused. </p>
<p>I like to think of it as a super power with built in kryptonite. I use it to hyper focus on things like learning, building, art, etc. The enjoyment from completely these tasks allows me to use it for self betterment. The down side, as with all super powers, it comes with other crappy ADHD side effects like anger and irritability.  Or worse when the hyper focus is on something completely irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really related to ADHD but it’s interesting to read about the PFC. I’m pretty sure it’s not fully formed until your 20s. Yet we expect young children (not just ones with ADHD) to sit and focus and plan and not act impulsive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Teenagers literally do not have the mental capacity to fully regulate their thoughts yet. I think it is no surprise that a lot of the schools who do great work with their desires (allow a lot of playtime and freedom to do what they want) rather than against them.</p></div>		</li>
