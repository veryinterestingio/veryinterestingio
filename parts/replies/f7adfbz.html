			<div class="markdown"><p>Lithium batteries strongly dislike staying at or around 0% or 100%. This is why batteries can charge from 0-75% in 20 minutes but take another 45 to get that last 25%. It works similarly too when going down to 0%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite... Most lithium batteries are charged using constant current up to around 60-70%, with the voltage raised to whatever is needed within some limit.  Constant current is what lead-acid and NiCad's generally always use.  To charge the last part, they switch to constant voltage, with the current dropping as the battery continues to charge; this is slower at getting charge into the battery.  During this second phase, spiky &quot;dendrites&quot; tend to form inside the battery; these are liable to damage things if the battery gets banged around or exposed to heat.</p></div>		</li>
