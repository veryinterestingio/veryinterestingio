When reheated though, they will leave the dormant state and begin to multiply again, spoiling your formerly frozen goods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all bacteria creates spores and not really when freezed. Sporulation occurs when nutrients are low making the bacteria dormant and extremely resistant to heat, dehydration and toxins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, thank you. Sporulation is triggered when cells encounter stressors like extreme temperatures, high salt, etc. A great example of these bacteria is Clostridium botulinum (pardon my lack of italics here for technical notation), the toxin of which is used for Botox, but is also extremely dangerous in high doses. Because C. botulinum can form highly resistant spores, and grows in anaerobic conditions, it can survive a lot of pasteurization and other antibacterial treatments. Although rare, it’s a very high risk contamination causing <a href="https://foodborneillness.com/botulism_food_poisoning" target="_blank">botulism poisoning</a>. </p>
<p>Freezing definitely does not kill bacteria although it may weaken them a little. It really depends on the genus, species and/or strain. </p>
<p>So, when a frozen food is thawed out and left to sit, bacteria can begin growing again at fast rates. E.g, thawing frozen chicken at room temp on the countertop will likely let Campylobacter bacteria reproduce and can cause serious food borne illness if the chicken is then not handled and cooked properly. </p>
<p>This is why we nerds in the (frozen) food industry really want consumers to follow cooking instructions on frozen food items; if you don’t cook it to ~160F, you may be risking a food borne illness. Yes, the food industry obviously does what we can to mitigate this risk. That said, when a plant is manufacturing millions of product packs per day, it is impossible to entirely eliminate this risk. Thus, it is the food-handler’s obligation to ensure food safety in the final steps prior to consumption.</p>
