<p>I know its not relevant to this question, but is there an easy explanation for RNA and how it works with your dna?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Effectively RNA is a little chemically different, and is single strand vs double strand of DNA. But RNA in the body is mostly used for protein synthesis, not the entire cell, so think of it if DNA was blueprints to your house, RNA might be the instructions for one set of lights, etc. The body uses DNA and &quot;transcribes&quot; to get those RNA instructions printed out and then sends them out to be made into proteins.</p>
<p>Viruses also use RNA and some of them are able to utilize an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to essentially make the single strand RNA into a double strand (DNA) and then it will splice that in and that can exist in your cells as they undergo mitosis and reproduce with that spliced in DNA. HIV is an example of a retrovirus</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me offer a slightly different analogy than the ones already presented.</p>
<p>You DNA is a cookbook - a very old family cookbook with thousands of recipes printed on good paper. When you want to make a bunch of a given recipe you don't want to have that cookbook open for long, getting damaged, so instead you make a quick copy of the recipe or actually many copies of the recipe so multiple cooks can make a lot of the food. They are on thin paper and will be thrown away once no longe needed. </p>
<p>The cookbook is DNA, the copy is RNA. The cooks here are ribosomes translating the RNA in peptides (strings of amino acids that fold into proteins).</p>
<p>Chemically, RNA is more prone to braking down than DNA. DNA is doubles stranded so and error on one strand still has the other strand as a reference for repair (it's more complicated than that). RNAs are shorter meaning they have less end protection and are not in the packaged structures that hold DNA. RNA also has an extra hydroxyl (-OH, that's an oxygen and hydrogen group branching off the ring at the core of the RNA). DNA bases have one hydroxyl and that is where one base attaches to the phosphate group on the next base (the 3' end). That  hydroxyl can chemically interact with the RNA backbone (the bonds holding the bases together) and break it.</p>
<p>So overall DNA is a highly protected reference and site of regulation for which genes are transcribed. DNA is transcribed to make RNA. RNA is a throwaway copy, which still has regulatory elements but is far shorter lived. RNA is translated to make polypeptides which fold into proteins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback off what iceOrb<br />
said, our cells use RNA as temporary memory. A section of DNA is read, the corresponding RNA is generated, then used to recreate the DNA sequence necessary for the protein. Imagine a bomb defusal where the guy who needs instructions is in a different room than the manual.</p>
<p>The manual is DNA, the guy reading the manual is like RNA, the defusal guy is like a ribosome. Somehow the info needs to get through quickly and correctly, and whatever is doing the work don't have the manual in front of them. RNA manual guy makes it possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there is the telomerase enzyme which prolongs the telomers, negating the degradation of telomer ends . It is not active in most differentiated cells (protection against cancer), but in most stem cells. Cloning is commonly done with stem cells.
Also there have been publications that show telomerase could be activated artificially to increase telomer length. This can be used to revert cells to pseudo stem cells, which can be used for cloning.</p></div>		</li>

<p>DNA doesn't &quot;degrade&quot; in the sense of being broken down. As we age, cells have more time to accumulate harmful mutation either through errors in DNA replication or things like UV light exposure causing DNA bases to dimerize. DNA is maintained through an aptly names &quot;proofreading&quot; system. But more time and more cell replications increases the chances for errors because like any proofreader, this system isn't perfect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proofreading is only one aspect of the systems that prevent mutations. There are repair systems that repair various types of DNA damage, without proofreading being involved. Nucleotide excision repair is one example.</p>
<p>This is necessary because errors can arise not only during replication, but also from direct DNA damage.</p></div>		</li>
