			<div class="markdown"><p>I messaged a local 70mm IMAX a while back and the theater director responded that a 2hr film master is ~$250,000 and every copy (for every theater showing it in 70mm IMAX) is ~$65,000.  </p>
<p>So yes, there is a reason only people like Nolan still use it.  </p>
<p>The new IMAX w/ laser theaters are replacing 70mm IMAX, they use dual 4K HDR projectors and are filmed on specific Arri ALEXA cameras. These theaters have a 12ch sound system, which is far behind the Dolby Cinema dual 4K HDR laser theaters which have Dolby Atmos systems ranging from 64-128 speakers. Nolan still only does 5.1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, very expensive, relatively speaking. And simultaneously, the pool of talent and companies who work with it are less and less, the hardware more obscure, and the theaters with the projection equipment to display it are more rare. Consequently it trends to an ever more boutique and expensive proposition.</p>
<p>Let's just take <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2015/12/youll-never-guess-how-much-those-massive-the-hateful-eight-70mm-prints-weigh-43032/" target="_blank">one facet of it</a>, keeping in mind that digital films can be distributed on one or a few hard drives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Chapin, all of the prints and projectors will be delivered and set up in theaters by Wednesday, December 23, just two days before the roadshow presentation opens in theaters. His team of four has been setting up the prints at a “platter farm” in Valencia, California seven days a week leading up to the release. Each print was delivered to the farm as a 1,000 ft. load and assembled into 20 rolls per print. The prints and reel are then loaded into a shipping case (5 ft. x 5 ft. by 1 ft. thick) that weighs around 400 lbs. total. Out of the box, “The Hateful Eight” print and reel clock in at a hefty 250 lbs.</p>

<p>Not quite, in practice it's less than 8K, but more than 4K, however film is more grainy than digital at the same light level.</p>
<p>Ultra Panavision 70 has about a 48mm recording width so it's smaller than 645 medium format (54mm wide). There are numerous digital to 645 comparisons online if you google it. </p>
<p>Also 65/70mm film is generally shot with anamorphic lenses so the horizontal resolution is slightly less than the vertical resolution in the projected image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a well-developed 35mm print has an equivalent resolution of like 6k, so 70mm would be something like 24k. IMAX actually uses 70mm film sideways, so the width becomes the height which can double the resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It stores it on chemicals on the tape, so you could argue that each molecule is a 'pixel'. This is an issue in semiconductor manufacturing, where the images are so small that they only have a few molecules of chemical, and end up looking pixelated. However normal video aren't anywhere near the 'resolution' limit of those 'pixels' yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's probably a clumping action going on with the molecules, so there's going to be an average resolution due to the granularity of the clumping. I imagine it'd look something like this.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lenses weren’t as good back then tho, and the multiple steps of optical printing kills resolution too. </p>
<p>You can get amazing results out of 35mm, but even in ideal cases you’ll get diminishing returns going over 4k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Large format still film is huge. 4x5 inches per frame for starters. The resolution depends on how it's scanned. But, yeah it's massively better than digital in terms of appearance of film grain, tonal range and enlargement potential.</p>
<p>Additionally, the dynamic range is often maximized by using a technique called the zone system. Essentially exposing for the shadows and developing for the highlights. In most natural light this is essentially precise overexposure and precise underdevelopment. This technique involves a ton of test exposures with a particular film stock and lots of measurements using a densitomiter to predict when the highlights will finish developing in the tank, rather than simply going by recommendations by the maker of the development fluid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that series. I loved the movie Chronos, 1985. I'm a still shooter, so I don't know what 70mm looks like. 35mm is a 24mm by 36mm rectangle on a long reel. I'm not sure how you would &quot;turn it on its side&quot; and still have a reel of film at all. In stills, we have 2 1/4 inch as the next step up, so the small edge is roughly 6cm. You might be thinking of shooting the camera vertically and exposing 2 35mm frames in the space of one 70mm frame.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In terms of resolution, 4x5 film is the equivalent of 100-150MP digital backs. It's massively better than some consumer cameras but there are digital backs which can now match the resolution. </p>
<p>If you look up comparisons between colour film and digital the first thing you notice is that digital is much cleaner, so it's definitely not better when it comes to grain if you're talking about colour film.</p></div>		</li>
