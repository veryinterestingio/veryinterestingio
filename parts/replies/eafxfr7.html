			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s because you have 2 types of muscle in your eyelids, smooth &amp; skeletal. We don’t consciously control the smooth muscle, &amp; it stops exerting itself based on what hormones are being produced. So when your body is tired, hormone production changes, &amp; now that smooth muscle is receiving signals to stop working. So skeletal muscle takes over &amp; works to keep our eyelids open, but it doesn’t usually fly solo, so it tires quickly.</p>
<p>But it doesnt take much to get your body producing “eyes open!!” hormones again, so that’s why you can “snap” back out of it, because your smooth muscle starts picking up the slack again.</p></div>		</li>
