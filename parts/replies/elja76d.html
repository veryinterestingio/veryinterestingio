			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so sure about <em>no</em> negative health effects. My flavor of this condition is more of a scream than explosion. Sounds like a banshee screeching in my head just before waking up. Having an occasional nightmare shortly before this happens is a recipe for waking up confused and terrified.</p>
<p>That is absolutely no way to start a good day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have experienced EHS 3-5 times and its pretty terrifying. It really depends on the person but for me, the syndrome is usually triggered by sleep paralysis. Instead of seeing some random ass demon, I experience <em>loud</em> sounds. These noises happen all at once and usually include bombs, fireworks, gunshots, nukes, kids crying/playing. While it <em>sounds</em> terrifying and may be to others, personally, I don't get scared. I <em>do</em> experience a lot of pain from the noises though. On the brightside, I also feel like a soothsayer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea sometimes I'll hear a really loud pop inside my head and I'll jump right up.</p>
<p>When I was in my teens I was experimenting with Brain supplements like 5-HTP and Tyrosine. I didn't quite realize that Tyrosine was a stimulant, so a few times I would take it right before I went to sleep and shot up like a rocket.</p></div>		</li>
