<p>Edit: this is in contrast to a cooked piece of dough like a bagel or donut, which expands outward from its local center in all directions, closing the hole.  I don't have a good physics explanation for this difference.</p>

<p>Good observation! Note that the bagel/donut isn't a uniform, unconstrained material. Its hardened cooked/fried surface could certainly apply stresses on the still-cooking interior, which has different material properties. In addition, if it's being cooked on a tray, it's certainly not unconstrained. These are a couple key differences from the scenario being posed in the original question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A donut floating in oil is pretty unconstrained.  And I would think the inner wall toward the center of the hole would have similar properties to the outer wall.  Not trying to beat up your answer, just trying to understand the phenomenon!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I view a floating frying donut as similar to a balloon filled with a complex fluid: A huge difference in material properties between the fluid and expanding interior and the essentially solid skin. No guarantee of uniform thermal expansion when the material properties aren't uniform! I think Nature finds the happy medium here in the form of slight expansion of the outer diameter and slight contraction of the inner diameter as the interior expands to its final texture. A more complex scenario than the original question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note there isn't an actual centre of expansion, but rather that every point gets further away from every other point. Imagine the coordinate axis starts in the bottom left then we expand the metal plate by shrinking our units along the axes slightly. We could have done the same but putting the origin in the top right. In fact we could have put the origin at <em>any</em> point and it would still work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point actually, geometric enlargement will &quot;pan&quot;/translate the object across but still preserve the distance ratios. I looked into it and maybe &quot;accounting for internal stresses&quot; is what the difference is. I wonder if the texts mention an explanation for this difference between the real and theoretical behaviours</p></div>		</li>
