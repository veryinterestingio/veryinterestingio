			<div class="markdown"><p>That too! Less with the shower unless I'm in there a long time. I assume it's skin irritation, but eating spicy food throws me off though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you have mentioned sounds quite similar to mine which is possibly 'Cholinergic Urticaria'. Male 27 here. Basically what my dermatologist said was there are certain elements which trigger the development of anti-bodies in body by the immune system. Those triggers can be anything like environmental factors or some food item too. It varies individual to individual. A blood test specially having 'IgE test' was prescribed and it came out quite high, which means there were a whole lot of anti bodies present in my blood. For me the itching used to be present in the winters and only if I did something to heat up my body like exercise, hot shower, spicy food, etc. Summers were fine. Doctor prescribed some medicines and told that it takes couple  months atleast to treat it, else the symptoms might bounce back. Now, waiting for winters to see if the treatment worked or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like it's probably allergy to heat. Not sure about allergy to heat, but I was allergic to cold for years, and if you're lucky it will one day go away as mine did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be an allergy to heat or your own sweat. Do you get the same effect when exercising?</p>
<p>Could also be a drying effect. Too dry skin can be itchy, so if it’s not an allergy maybe try using lotion more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much when exercising, unless it's intense work out and my body heat rises in general. I have tried moisturizer and it's made the bumps go down. But i still get that sensation, not as bad, but it's still there. Now looking back, it may be dryness. The spots where the bumps are are always dry and flaky. It's worse when i grow out a beard, the lotion doesn't reach the skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think it’s just general dryness, try beard oil for when you have a beard. It’ll not only condition your beard but keep your skin moisturized as well. I’m not sure what your routine was with the moisturizer, but if you were only putting it on when you were having problems, that may also be part of the issue, as you could just need to make sure to moisturize everyday. Personally, I’m like that. If I don’t moisturize or cleanse my face every day I get dry skin and acne, it goes down when I do it during the most problematic times but doesn’t disappear completely unless I’m consistent. If your routine was everyday though, you should try to contact a dermatologist, it could be something like eczema instead.</p></div>		</li>
