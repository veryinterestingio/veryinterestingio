			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pacific is pretty much the same really; it's also roughly hemisphere-sized. You would have had hotspot island chains like Hawaii, but those aren't preserved. </p>
<p>For me at least, I'd probably find the Cambrian sea life adorable. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hallucigenia&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXgdfut5LhAhXL64MKHVScB5oQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=775#imgrc=WPSYKFWiX63L0M:" target="_blank">I mean look at this cutie!</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not a coincidence. For reasons we don't really understand, every 200-500 million years all, or at least almost all, of the continents collide into a megacontinent before seperating again. Pangea was just the most recent cycle and there have been as many as a half-dozen previous and in a few hundred million more years its likely the Atlantic ocean will close again and another megacontinent will form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the Atlantic can't close, the Mid Atlantic Ridge is where new crust comes up from the mantle. The Pacific will eventually close, since the 'ring of fire' around the Pacific is all subduction zones, where the crust is forced back down into the mantle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We know a decent amount about the supercontinent cycle and have a relatively small set of hypotheses to explain why it operates the way it does, e.g. reviews in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987112001570" target="_blank">this paper</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S167498711200103X" target="_blank">this paper</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128036891000079" target="_blank">this book chapter</a>.</p></div>		</li>
