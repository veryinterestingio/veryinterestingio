			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohh so that‚Äôs why it also sounds higher pitched since when it can vibrate, it has a higher frequency. Interesting, thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. There‚Äôs some specifics with Bernoulli‚Äôs Principle that can explain in more detail what‚Äôs happening, but it is an ELI5 thread after all, lol. You should check this out for more detail:</p>

<p>It includes some drawings of the internals for visualisation and explains it in the context of singing (I‚Äôm a chorus teacher, that‚Äôs how I look at this stuff). üòÅ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what causes our voices to change so much as we age. I know people who when they were in their 20s sounded way different than in their 30-40s and obviously once we get 60+ we sound like dick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you age, your vocal cords change in size and thickness, all through your life. Around puberty is the biggest change, when an influx of hormones causes the entire laryngeal space (the voice box basically) to change shape quite drastically. Everything gets bigger and this has an effect similar to the difference between a string on a violin vs. a string on an upright bass - when they have the same tension on them, the upright bass produces a lower sound than the violin because more of the string is vibrating.</p>
<p>Around 30 is when your voice finally settles from puberty. Yes, it takes this long; the majority of the settling happens in the first few years but your voice never officially finishes growing and settling until 30, which is why you even sound different at 22 vs. 35, for example. The body basically has to re-learn how to use the autonomous muscles which control the larynx after their growth spurt, and that takes a lot of time. </p>
<p>Around 50 is when another voice change occurs, but this is primarily due to degradation instead. The body‚Äôs mucus production doesn‚Äôt work as well, and can over or under-produce lubricants that help the vocal folds slide smoothly past one another. This and a few other random things that can occur (differences in shape of the pharyngeal cavity, or the back of your mouth, primarily) change the overall sound of your voice.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - losing your voice to shouting is just swelling caused by abrasion. Any two places where skin rubs against skin for long enough, no matter how much protection (mucus, oils, etc.) will eventually start to rub raw. Something similar happens when you rub your hands really fast against one another to heat them up - yelling at a concert is doing that to your voice... for hours. üòÇ</p></div>		</li>
