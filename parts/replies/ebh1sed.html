			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't even gone through &quot;tragic&quot; experiences and yet my &quot;gut feeling&quot; goes off quite often when I'm out walking around. At this point, I just accept my gut feeling will go off every time I'm around strangers that don't fit in just the right amount (As in even someone that looks too normal throws me off). Some people rarely notice the false positives, but I get them A LOT</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fear is a response to the unknown when it might be dangerous, curiosity is a response to the unknown when it's deemed as safe. </p>
<p>When you notice something out of place and get the gut feeling, flip the fear to curiosity. Actively ask questions in your head. Ex. What's different about this person? What do I not know about this unusual aspect? Race, clothing style, body language, etc. Then find the answers. By doing so, you'll alleviate the fear response and you'll come across less unknowns over time as you learn about them. </p>
<p>It'll also help decrease biases and give you a more accurate perspective of the world. Being curious has helped me learn about different cultures, religions, worldviews, and lately, mental illness. It helps me connect with people I wouldn't normally connect with. It'll also do wonders for your social life and networking. </p></div>		</li>

<p>All through my life I've had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would tell me what it was.&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; said the old man, &quot;that's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the Universe has that.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think some of it might be a response passed down from your parents like that of mice. Some phobias and such are a natural reaction and is why so many peopleâ€™s reaction to a snake is to jump and move away whether or not they have ever seen a snake. </p>
<p>I believe fight or flight is partially based on what your ancestors did. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a big part of the answer. I have a voice that always tells me I should do this or do that, like remembering to lock my door or don't put the cup so close to the edge. I always think I must listen because <em>every</em> time I don't I regret it! That's wrong, that's just confirmation bias. I ignore that voice all day every day and I only remember ignoring when it told me not to do something, didn't listen, and whatever bad thing happened.</p></div>		</li>
