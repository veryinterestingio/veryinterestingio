			<div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of all lineages have gone extinct, but all the ones we have evidence for appear to be &quot;our&quot; kind of life. Presumably at one point there might have been an alternative form of life that didn't use the same DNA or RNA that all life does now, but if so it died out (or was out-competed by &quot;us&quot;) billions of years ago, long before it became complex enough to leave fossils or other evidence behind. </p></div>		</li>
