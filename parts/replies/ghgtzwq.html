			<div class="markdown"><p>In my case, the 1st shot of the vaccine (taken December 5th) resulted in two weeks in a positive test for IgM and negative for IgG (this was a qualitative test, not quant, sadly). I have since taken the 2nd shot last Saturday, will wait a few days and take a proper quant test.</p>
<p>The vaccine manufacturer says that they have observed the proper levels of IgG on weeks 5-6.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, this class switching seems to occur earlier in Covid-19 than other contagious disease (possibly due to prior immune priming by other coronaviruses), but the earlier and stronger the class switching, the more severe the illness. Not sure what to make of that.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IgM actually will get switched to a more specific immunoglobulin, such as IgG. So in the course of making antibodies, the body first makes a lot of non-super-specific antibodies in infection, IgM. IgM is good at polymerizing with each other so this coats viral antigens. But later the class is switched in an infection that is more specific.
So basically the only memory you can get for Ig is from specific isoforms such as IgG IgA and IgE.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way someone explained it to me to memorize it is IgM = M for miserable, IgG = G for gone.  Of course that's not the actual definition just a memory device.</p>
<p>Typically with any virus your body starts to fight it by generating IgM antibodies, while you're miserable with the virus.  They're basically a lightweight, fast attack/defense squad.  Over time it starts to develop IgG antibodies that are typically better at ending the infection and preventing or decreasing a future one.  That's like sending a battalion of troops to end the conflict and occupy the area, sometimes forever.  The IgM antibodies will go away but the IgG lingers around after the infection is <em>gone</em> to prevent reinfection for some period of time.</p>
<p>Not every infection works this way, but it's a good rule of thumb.</p></div>		</li>
