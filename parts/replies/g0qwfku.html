			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I understand correctly, the TLDR is that getting sick with flu increases heart attack risk, flu shots help stop some infections, therefore reducing population risk of heart attacks? </p>
<p>Or is the effect on a more individual basis? Like, say 10 people have the flu, 5 had the vaccine, and 5 didnt, are the people who had the vaccine better off in some way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand it is a bit of both. </p>
<p>The more healthy individuals that exist the less a disease spreads. </p>
<p>And individually,
Ideally the 5 with the vaccine would have either antibodies / white blood cells that would know how to respond over the 5 that didn't have the vaccine. </p>
<p>However there is also biological, behavioral, and social factors in health as well. Which translates to things like happiness, stress, depression, physical fitness, diet, social exposure, etc that all play a role in how your body responds to sickness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK43745/#!po=62.5000" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK43745/#!po=62.5000</a></p>
<p>People often treat health in a singular dimension (take x pill or put a bandage here) and fail to associate multiple factors to the overall health.
A vaccine by itself doesn't mean you'll be guarenteed to overcome a sickness but it is a pretty good mid term place to start.</p>
<p>Or to think of it in another way:
You build this vehicle you ride out life in, and determine what fuels, fluids and maintainence you perform on it all can have an impact on how it responds in an emergency. </p>
<p>If you got a jalopy of a vehicle you can ask yourself how it got to that point. And if everyone is driving a jalopy when the next accident happens, it is going to be a whole lot worse than if they were driving good vehicles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also add that there's probably some selection bias here as well, people who get flu shots are probably more responsible and look after their health more than those that don't? Or? Plus at least some of the heart attacks will be in people you assume wouldn't get flu shots probably, like say addicts, severe alcoholics, homeless, etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't one of the factors the amount of fluids the body will store? A weak heart has trouble getting all the fluids out of your system, and if you're hoarding fluids in your lungs because of a disease might not help either and results in even more strain on the heart. But you are probably correct, it isn't one factor but many.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No the study does not simply correlate vaccination and decreased risk of having an MI, it investigates it thoroughly and comes to a conclusion. The flu increases your chance of having MI and the vaccine prevents the flu.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CDC report on flu vaccine effectiveness studies from 2004-2018 shows average effectiveness to be about 40%, and has ranged from 10% to 60%  over the last 15 years.</p>
<p>To be clear, it's not the actual vaccine that prevents mai and stokes -- it's not getting the flu.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that this is a very strict definition of “effectiveness”. It looks at (very simplified) how many people hospitalized for flu-like symptoms actually had flu, and what proportion of each had the vaccine. Not hospitalized? Doesn’t count. Weren’t tested for flu? Not included. Had the flu, but sick for a day instead of a week? Vaccine doesn’t count as effective. </p>
<p>And - to the point here - if the flu vaccine prevented every heart attack in the country, that’s not counted at all in the efficacy studies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, a lot of things can mimic flu like symptoms and people just dismiss it as the flu when it could’ve been something else entirely. Same thing with the cold. Dozens of pathogens can present similarly. So much so it’s not worth testing for if you’re not immunocompromised, elderly, or infantile.</p></div>		</li>
