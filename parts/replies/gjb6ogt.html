			<div class="markdown"><p>They need to take samples to be analyzed. I assume they'll be checking wet markets and wildlife looking for coronavirus positive animals to try and pin down the source. We've found similar coronaviruses in the past in bats, but they are looking for family members of SARS-COV-2. The analysis can be done anywhere you've got enough computing power and a lab to run the sequencing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you be sure where a new sample fits into the  story? I know the chance of a human infecting a bat is low but there are cases where humans probably infected animals like cats and minks. Wouldn't the virus have changed too much by now to be a useful evidence?</p>
<p>What I guess I'm trying to ask is, given two undated samples of a virus, can you determine which came first?</p></div>		</li>
