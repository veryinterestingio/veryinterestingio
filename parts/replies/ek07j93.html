			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Language is the distinguishing factor. Verbal stimuli acquire functions through a variety of processes and can act in place of actual environmental events to produce “distressing/distressful behaviour.” This underlies the “mysteriousness” of mental health problems, because the verbal stimuli are covert and their acquired functions may not be obvious, even to the individual in question. </p></div>		</li>
