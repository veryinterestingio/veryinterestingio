<p>Unfortunately, even though it looks like a regular body protein, it’s misfolded, and when it come into contact with correctly-folded versions it causes them to misfold too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why saying there is no evolution in prions ? I suppose that when they 'impose' their misfold on another protein there is a possibility of change, and that the prions that are more able to get to the 'target' proteins have more chance to 'reproduce'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prions are capable of evolution. Even though amino acid sequences are stable, different 'strains' have measurably different characters that are due to confromational differences. Those conformational differences are passed on to other proteins when they are misfolded. That provides a mechanism for heritability, variation, and differential fitness, the key ingredients for evolution. Your supposition is completely correct, _PM_ME<em>PANGOLINS</em> is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Prions DO evolve. </p>
<p>&quot;A single prion protein sequence can be the basis for a variety of biologically distinct ‘prion strains’ or ‘prion variants’. In mammals, the amino acid sequence of PrP is well conserved (van Rheede et al. 2003), yet prion strains show distinguishable incubation times, different abilities to infect species other than the source of the infection, differing symptoms and signs, distinct areas of the brain affected and structural differences in the altered form of the PrP protein.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Prion variants are relatively stably propagated, and since prion variants are based on differences in prion protein conformation (not sequence), there must be some mechanism by which the prion amyloid can act as a template to determine the conformation of a monomer newly joining the end of an amyloid filament (see below). Prion protein sequence places limits on the prion variants that are possible in a given animal, but because prion strains/variants differ in their biological properties and are each self-propagating, evolutionary forces can shape and select which variants are found in nature.&quot;</p>

I suppose that would depend if ferritin level was a single limiting factor in uptake of prions</p></div>		</li>
