			<div class="markdown"><p>Pothos, bamboo, arrowhead plant, tradescantia, and smaller philodendron species might be good options.  </p>
<p>If you want the plants to last longer, adding a water fertilizer (one marketed for lucky bamboo usually works) can extend the life. Eventually any plant growing out of just water can run out of essential nutrients if they're not provided, though that can take a long time. That's probably what happened with the plants originally in your vases. That being said, aquaculturing is never a guaranteed success and it might take some trial and error to find the right plant and nutrient combination</p></div>		</li>
