			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. How do we concentrate on prevention, especially for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease? That is key to raise personal responsibility around lifestyle choices re eating, drinking, smoking, exercise etc. This can be done by organizations such as the one I run the <a href="https://www.ccalliance.org/" target="_blank">Colorectal Cancer Alliance</a>. People need to get screened for Colon Cancer, it is 90% preventable when caught earlier. It’s “the preventable cancer.” This same type of mindset can be said for other cancer, heart disease and diabetes as well. -Michael Sapienza</p></div>		</li>
