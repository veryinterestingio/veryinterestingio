			<div class="markdown"><p>I got tested in Australia three weeks ago and they asked for no swab throat swab and blood test. I asked why they needed blood (I don’t like needles) and they said it was to make it more accurate.￼￼￼ I refused the blood test (just did other 2) but I can see that people would just not get tested at all if they knew he had to have blood taken.￼</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really not as bad as you think. I'm sick and got a covid test as the symptoms were the same (turned out to be not covid, but bronchitis). </p>
<p>It's basically a deep tickling in your nose that feels like a sneeze is stuck, and the throat sensation is like when you shove a finger in your mouth and touch the back of your throat.</p></div>		</li>
