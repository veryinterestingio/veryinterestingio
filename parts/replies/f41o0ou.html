			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the air is a relatively small effect for the wick. The wick is actually liquid-cooled; it draws up melted wax, and as that wax evaporates it draws in more. Because it takes a significant amount of energy to boil wax, as long as there is some in the wick the temperature won't rise above the boiling point of the wax (which is far below the ignition temperature for the wick). This is the same reason you can boil water in a paper bag over an open flame without the bag catching fire.</p></div>		</li>
