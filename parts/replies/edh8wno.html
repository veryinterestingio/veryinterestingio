			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is because 6 is considered a “perfect number” because all of its factors add up to be the actual number (1+2+3=6). I’m unaware of any other numbers that do this without looking it up. </p>
<p>As an American that hates not using SI units and thinks everything should be base 10, it drives me nuts that time is base 60. I wonder how difficult it would be to create a time system that uses 10 new-hours per day and 10 new-minutes per new-hour and of course, 10 new-seconds per new-minute. Likely, it would result in a very confusing system until everyone became accustomed to it. I know Americans would not adapt. We can’t even settle on km/hr as a speed for roads</p>
<p>Edit: many people have commented the same thing (without reading other comments) that internet time was a thing (beats) that also ignored time zones and the swatch tried it too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To excliptly say: 60 can be nicely divided with 2 (=30), 3 (=20), 4 (=15), 5 (=12), 6 (=10), 10 (=6), 12 (=5), 15 (=4), 20 (=3) and 30 (=2).</p>
<p>I wouln't say that it's handy because it's quickly divisable at glance, but because it is easy to divide when using that number base.</p>
<p>I think users of metric system have no problem visually dividing one meter in three equal parts. But if you divide it by 3 each section is 0,333... meters, annoying. But with base 60, the same length can be divided to three sections of 20.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually really significant that 60 <em>evenly</em> divides by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30.  That means you get nice, intuitive whole numbers for most of the common divisions you do in everyday life.  It's not just an arbitrary stopping point - it's the most intuitive stopping point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans only &quot;recently&quot; started using numbers in the way that we think about them today.  In fact, whole civilizations existed where most people only used the numerical concepts 1, 2 and &quot;many&quot;. The concept of time existed, but people didn't think about &quot;now&quot; as 12:48 PM; it was more like &quot;a little past midday.&quot;  Fractions, but in non-numeric terms, were much more important.  &quot;I'll give you a quarter of what I grow if you let me farm your land.&quot;  &quot;Each of my (3) sons will get an equal portion of my cattle&quot; etc.   Also, approximately, half of the day has light and half was dark; and mid-day is half of the light period.  So, halves and halves of halves all make sense to people.   For example - if it was about halfway between midday (when the sun is at its highest point) and the beginning of the night (when the sun goes down) a person may take note of the relative time and wish convey the concept to someone else.  &quot;It has been a while since midday, and it is a long way back to the cabin; so we should start gathering the sheep and herding them back to the barn.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words  - &quot;A point in time that is equidistant between noon and when it gets dark&quot; is much simpler and universally applicable for an agrarian society than &quot;3:00P&quot; (or &quot;18:00&quot; for modern Europeans). So, the concept for 3:00P existed long before a universally accepted way to measure and describe it.</p>
<p>Early apparatuses that acted like clocks also used fractions more than actual numbers, because it was easier to build and aligned with the natural concepts that people were used to.  A sundial is the most obvious, with the shadow being part of the way between one point and another.  However, an hourglass or water-clock used similar fractional concepts vs numbers.  When towns started to construct things that told the population the time, it made sense to use a round design and a pointer... (just one pointer though, since minutes were not initially relevant and made things much more complicated..) Obviously, there were many reasons why a digital readout was impossible and impractical, and something like a mechanical bar-graph would have been much harder to construct since it would have to reset ever day, or half day.   A day is cyclical, so a device that displays the time is logically round.. and we already know that most people will think about any give time as a portion of the circle, not an arbitrary number.</p>
<p>If we accept that a time display device (a clock) should be a circle, we can think back to  a sundial to answer the question - &quot;why does a clock go around 2x/day, not just once more slowly?&quot;  Midday (noon) is indicated by a hand pointing straight up, when the sun is directly overhead.  And the end of the daylight period is indicated by the hand pointing down.  So, it makes the most sense to display the time with a hand point to a relative place on a circle that is completes 2x day.</p>
<p>We now need to think about how to divide up and label the various points on the clock.. and we need to do this for a population that does not spend much time dealing with numbers.    Logically, we need halves and quarters. And we probably want to go at least one smaller.  So, 8 might work (8 could be noon and midnight, with 4 being equal to what we call 6-oclock), but 12 units are a little more granular without being too much.  If people are dividing the day in to 12 and 24 hours (vs 4 and 8, or 5 and 10 units) it naturally leads to 60 vs a base-10 number.  It also better aligns to some of the more complicated math and astronomy that naturally corresponds to 60 and 360, which other have mentioned </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that the 24 hour day was <em>not</em> universal in ancient sundials. The Vedic period used a 30 hour day; the Chinese divided the day into twelfths and hundredths. </p>
<p>I'd imagine that western timekeeping units became universal with the export of mechanical clocks from Europe. </p></div>		</li>
