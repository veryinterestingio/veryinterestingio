<p>My working theory is that i tend to remember details associated with events that made an emotional impact on me.</p>

<p>This would make you like any other human. It's easier for <em>everyone</em> to form more-accessible memories when those things connect with the less-cognitive parts of our brain. If something is associated with your safety or well-being (like fear of injury or feelings of belonging), that's important in a different way than a social obligation. This is why people who study languages often work so hard to connect vocabulary and the like to personal experiences -- they want to make an emotional connection.</p>
<p>You'd remember the conference times better if you imagine how hurt your spouse/kids will be if you miss them, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why women remember everything someone says or does, and have instantaneous retrieval? Because women are always emotional about everything? ü§î </p>
<p>I'm joking of course, but is this a potential possibility?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hyperbole, but there is some truth there. On average, women tend to be more emotionally invested/involved in a social interaction than men (although there are plenty of individual exceptions on both ends of that statement), which means they're more likely to have a clear memory of that social interaction.</p>
<p>Likewise, men tend to be more emotionally invested/involved in shared interests among a social group rather than the social interactions themselves; which you can see quite clearly in male sports fans being able to recount details of the game they watched with friends (or had an expectation of discussing with friends later).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My five-year-old had trouble with right and left. We‚Äôd point out that he always drew with his right hand but that wasn‚Äôt enough to make the association.</p>
<p>One day I told him that if he wanted to remember left and right he should hit me in the face. He was skeptical but after some reassurance he went for it.</p>
<p>I pointed out that he‚Äôd used his right hand, so that must be his ‚Äúdaddy-slapping‚Äù hand.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs had little trouble since.</p></div>		</li>
