			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a dumb question, does Maillard reaction apply to soft boiled eggs? I seem to have no trouble cooking them in boiling water which I think should be 100C?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maillard is the reaction that causes food to turn brown, and is most related to sugars. This applies to lots of foods like searing a steak, bread crusts, or caramel.</p>
<p>Cooking an egg is coagulating the proteins. The white coagulates at \~60ºC, yolk at \~65ºC. Coagulation is also what causes most meats to &quot;cook&quot;. Acids will also cause most proteins to coagulate - which is why many marinades for low-temperature cooking include acids, and poaching an egg is much easier with a little vinegar in the water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thus, the perfect temperature for sous vide eggs is about 62-63. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a dumb question, no such thing.</p>
<p>Think of maillard reactions as browning, not cooking.</p>
<p>Maillard reactions brown sugars (sweet and delicious) and proteins (savory and delicious).</p>
<p>You're totally correct that boiling doesn't allow the temperature to reach browning temperatures. Doesn't matter how long you boil it's never going to brown.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter how long something sits at 100C it won't have any of the maillard reactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, cooking is similarly breaking down the food to make it more digestable (and also killing salmonella and other germs), but it won't reach the browning process. So if you overcook an egg, it's yolk will only turn green (because iron in yolk and hydrogen sulfide in the egg white creating iron sulfide).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The inner most part would need hours and hours to get to 165C. You want the middle to come to 50-60-70-80, depending on what you're working with.</p></div>		</li>
