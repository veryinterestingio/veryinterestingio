			<div class="markdown"><p>My ex father-in-law (we're still close and good friends) raises longhorn cattle, with those crazy-sharp horns that span 6 feet. They can walk past you with those tips an inch from your face and never touch you. Ex-pop says &quot;they always know where their horns are goin'.&quot; Funny to watch him not flinch or jump back when he's feeding them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that is an amazing video, but I would not want to be the diver who filmed it.  All that frantic sword-waving, you could get accidentally impaled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen this in person. A few swordfish had a bunch of small fish cornered against the beach, which was very steep, at the north end of Captiva Island, FL. They wave their bills back and forth to bludgeon their prey. The small fish were leaping frantically onto the shore (where they obviously cannot breathe) trying to escape. I was no more than 10 feet away from the swordfish. It was surreal...</p>
<p>The “point” of the bill isn’t for impaling, it’s just a natural shape that’s purpose is “a longer bill would be silly, so we’ll just taper off to nothing here...”</p></div>		</li>
