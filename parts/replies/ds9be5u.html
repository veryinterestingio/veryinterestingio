			<div class="markdown"><p>To my understanding, no.  This is a Mersenne prime, meaning it equals 2 to some positive integer P minus 1.  Because it is known that this <em>sometimes</em> (rarely) results in a new large prime, it is fairly easy to keep incrementing P and check if it results in a prime.</p>
<p>I say &quot;fairly easy&quot;... this is still a very, very large number and takes quite some time to compute.  You can only do so many of these each day, even with a super computer.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is unlikely that all the numbers between this Mersenne prime and the last one have been checked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  This program only looks at numbers that are in the form (2^p) - 1 where 'p' is a prime number.  These numbers are more likely to be prime, but there is nothing to say there aren't other primes it didn't check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst other comments have conjectured that it is unlikely that these two primes are consecutive, in fact we know this is definitely not the case due to Bertrand's Posulate.</p>
<p>&quot;I've said it before, and I'll say it again, there's always a prime between n and 2n.&quot; </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_postulate" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_postulate</a></p>
<p>M<em><em>{77232917}</em></em> (the prime just found) is over 2^3025636 times as big as M<em><em>{74207281}</em></em> (the previous largest prime), and so we know for certain that there are at least 3,025,636 primes in between them!</p>
<p>In fact, the number of primes between them is likely to be significantly larger. From the Prime Number Theorem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem</a> , we can estimate that there are roughly 2^{74207257} primes in between the last two primes we have found - this is a number with over 23 million digits, almost as large as the newest prime found itself!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so if a lot of the value is derived from the people with brains coming up with the algorithms/techniques to find the prime numbers, than why should I, as a person without a brain, devote my idle CPU capabilities to the seemingly rather neutral cause of actual labor of long calculations? Honest question as I believe I remember reading about more than a few various different causes where the actual computation capabilities were going to direct public use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one thing to come up with an algorithm/technique for doing massive computations in parallel with intermittently available cycles; it's another thing to actually run it, improve on it, or come up with the next idea. That's the step where you really need those idle CPUs and the data you get from seeing how it's all going. And such algorithms/techniques could have other applications beyond number theory, so it's a pretty valuable thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verification of the algorithms/implementations for finding new primes</li>
<li>Testing the stability of new hardware, or a system under stress</li>
<li>Byproducts of the search. For example, in some cryptosystems the need for multiplying very large integers very fast arises. This need led to fast(er) methods of doing integer multiplication.</li>
<li>To learn more about primes. The prime number theorem came up after looking at tables/listings of primes.</li>
<li>To test conjectures. Mathematics may not be an experimental science, but conjectures can definitely be proven by experiment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, sometimes, finding primes is just a sport. Some of us enjoy throwing a javelin really far, others want to find Mersenne primes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you should be cautious with the phrase &quot;conjectures can be proven by experiment.&quot; Sure, getting experimental results can provide evidence that a conjecture may be true, but until an actual proof is provided, we can't say anything for certain about the truth of a conjecture. </p></div>		</li>

I think that if scientific endeavor could be articulated in those terms (rather than, &quot;This is a job and what have you done for me lately?&quot;), perhaps it would receive funding, respect, and publicity that is somewhat more commensurate with the motivations of people that actually engage themselves in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who actively tries to factor some of those multi-million prime numbers it's generally for the reason of advancing human knowledge.  That and if you find one there's a prize of between $5,000 and $100,000 USD depending on the size of the Mersenne prime found.</p>
<p>Worth noting is that it took me around a year and a half of idle CPU time on one of my i5-4590 cores to completely factor one <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/report_exponent/?exp_lo=332297893&amp;full=1" target="_blank">suspected 332 million digit Mersenne prime</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: It turns out that it wasn't a Mersenne prime.  No cash/fame for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RSA primes are usually between 128 and 2056 bits (roughly 40-680 digits in base 10). These are usually found by randomly generating a number then probabilistically checking if it's prime (see <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller–Rabin_primality_test" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller–Rabin_primality_test</a>).</p>
<p>The prime number theorem says that the number of primes under N is approximately N/ln(N). That means for a 601 digit number, there are roughly 1e596 (please excuse my mental math, buts its in the right general area) primes below it. And for a 600 digit number, about 1e595 primes below. That means there are roughly 9e595 600 digit primes. </p>
<p>That gives us a good chance of randomly generating a random 600 digit prime within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>It is also is FAR too many to store or iterate though. For scale, a petabyte is about 1e12 bytes. If we could somehow store 1 number per byte, that would mean 1e583 petabytes. Thats an unimaginably large number. Modern processors operate at 3e9 operations per second. Even with a trillion processors going,  that would take on the order of 1e577 or so seconds, which is about 1e570 years. You'd be well past the heat death of the universe at that point.</p>
<p>You would also CAUSE the heat death of the universe many times over during the process, but that's an entirely different result...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technical, you would cause heat death of the universe only once. There would be no memory of you nor the calculation the next time around. Your quest would die with the universe.</p>
<p>But really, before making dramatic statements about a calculation outliving the universe, one must consider the accelerating rate of calculation. Modern technology is inefficient at leveraging entropy gradients to information processing capability. Since we’re talking about heat as a limiting resource, we’d need to look at some theoretical information processing potential given present current state of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A 4096 bit RSA key is the product of two primes around 2048 bits each, and thus around ~620 digits long each. It turns out that a number that's approximately as big as <em>n</em> has about one in ln(<em>n</em>) chance of being prime, so the prime numbers are actually pretty dense; there are approximately <em>n</em> / ln(<em>n</em>) primes up to <em>n</em>. Thus, to answer your question of whether we could list all primes up to this one: <em>very no</em>.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective about one in every 3,000 of <em>all</em> the natural numbers up to 2^4096 is prime! You couldn't make a list of all 2^4088 of these primes. Likewise, we cannot make a list of all approximately 2^77,232,899 primes less than this new prime 2^77,232,917 - 1 that we know about.</p></div>		</li>
