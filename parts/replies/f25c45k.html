			<div class="markdown"><p>Bedrock is any type of rock, but what makes it bedrock is that it's attached as one piece down through the lithosphere to the Earth's mantle. If a large rock layer isn't attached, no matter how much area it covers, it's a boulder or boulders and not bedrock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bedrock is just the solid layer of rock (various rock types depending on geography/depth) beneath &quot;loose, soft&quot; material. A complex mixture of loose stones is what a geologist might call conglomerate: a coarse-grained sedimentary rock composed of rounded fragments (&gt; 2 mm) within a matrix of finer grained material. That is a commonly found type of rock strata (layer).</p></div>		</li>
