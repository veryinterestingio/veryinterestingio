			<div class="markdown"><p>Their art teacher was wrong, but only because <em>Magenta</em>, Yellow and <em>Cyan</em> are the true subtractive primaries, what you call primary pigments, not Red, Yellow and Blue.</p>
<p>RGB and CMY are inversions of each other, they are the same just with different frames of reference. It’s not incorrect to call any of them primary colors, the trick is just to clarify if you’re talking about the additive or subtractive primaries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other way.  <del>Blue</del> Red and green make yellow.</p>
<p>Whenever you think you see yellow, what you are really seeing is light that stimulates your blue and green cones almost equally.</p>
<p>One way to do this is with light in the yellow part of the visible spectrum, which will stimulate both the <del>blue</del> red and green cones almost the same.</p>
<p>Another way to do this is mixing light in the <del>blue</del> red part of the spectrum with light in the green part of the spectrum with near equal intensity.</p>
<p>Your brain can't tell the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were to translate the subtractive colors into reflective (additive) light you’d result in Blue(255,0,0)+Yellow(255,255,0)=“Pseudo-green”(123,255,0)</p>
<p>CYMK = (0,255,255)(255,255,0)(255,0,255)(0,0,0)
K=black - used to control luminosity </p>
<p>This is why CYMK equals a larger gamut of printed colors; you have more light reflectance available to use. </p>
<p>You’re both right. It’s two different mechanisms used to control the end result. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the art teacher wasn't wrong. the primary colors for pigment are blue, red and yellow becaue using them you can create any other color. light or ink are just different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't make cyan or magenta with those pigments. But you can make the whole spectrum with CMY. that's why printers are CMYK not RBYK. Have a look at the cartridges / toner modules in a printer and check out the wiki article on color theory.</p></div>		</li>
