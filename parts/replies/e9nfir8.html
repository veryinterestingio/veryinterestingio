			<div class="markdown"><p>While there is not uniform distribution on the natural numbers, the heuristic they're using is useful in doing probability-based things in number theory, and the way they are doing it is &quot;correct&quot;. For instance, technically it doesn't make sense to talk about the probability of a number being divisible by 2, but we can make sense of this statement and use it as a productive heuristic, since the probability of a number in [0,N] being divisible by two is 1/2 + O(1/N) so in the limit the probability &quot;should&quot; be 1/2 even if it doesn't really exist.</p>

<p>I don't think that is true.</p>
<p>His/her question can also be posed for picking a random real in the interval [0,1], and there a uniform distribution <em>is</em> possible. So their particular question is not in itself the reason why this is mathematically impossible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd like to see proof, because you can't map real numbers to natural numbers - one is countable, one isn't.</p>

<p>Is it? You're not thinking of limited precision floating point RNGs, are you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>edit: I understand what you're saying about whether or not it's possible to &quot;choose&quot; a random real number, but I agree with the poster below that this is more of a physics issue than a mathematical one.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, for any continuous interval [a, b], the probability density function of the uniform distribution is defined as f(x) = 1/(b-a) for a≤x≤b and f(x) = 0 for all other x. To calculate the probability for any interval between a and b, we can integrate to find the area under the probability density curve. So, for any individual point on this interval, its probability is indeed defined as 0. In addition, since this is a uniform distribution, any two intervals between a and b that are equal in length will have an equal probability.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, what? If you're arguing that you can't apply a uniform distribution on a finite interval, then you're arguing that a uniform distribution cannot exist. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. If this is questionable to you, you really need to pick up a book on basic probability theory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What is different? The set of real numbers between 0 and 1 is not countable, the sum 0+0+0... approach doesn't work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's true, of course, but it's not the entire reason, since for instance there is no uniform probability measure on the entire real line, even though that's also an uncountable set. The 0+0+0+... proof by contradiction does work for the real line, if we write the real line as the disjoint union of the countably many sets [n,n+1)  where n runs through the integers.</p></div>		</li>
