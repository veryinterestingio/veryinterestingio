			<div class="markdown"><p>Even before Edward Jenner made the cowpox observation, people knew that those who survived some diseases, like smallpox, you generally couldn't catch them a second time. in fact, a more primitive type of smallpox &quot;vaccine&quot; was available: if you infected someone with old scabs from smallpox survivors, that person would (most of the time) get a much milder form of smallpox and be protected from the disease once they recovered. This practice was called variolation. It's major drawback was that there wasn't a well-established way of selecting which people's smallpox scabs to use and how to properly age them in order to weaken the virus. Because of this, variolation wasn't very widely available, and carried a significant risk of giving the patient full-blown smallpox and killing them. Edward Jenner's method of vaccination was revolutionary because it was easier to implement and much safer (because cowpox itself generally doesn't cause severe symptoms).</p></div>		</li>
