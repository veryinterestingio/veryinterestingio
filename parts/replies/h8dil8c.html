You just take a set of files that is a few gigs of the same pattern, compress it down to basically nothing, copy that zip multiple times into a new file, compress again, rinse and repeat until your zip is hundreds of terrabytes stored in a few megs, then copy the zip to someone else's computer and recursively decompress it to fuck over the computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's completely possible! I actually did this (albeit not as well) as one of my college coding projects.</p>
<p>You're able to grab the midi file of any song. I converted that to text, used my program to clean and parse the text, and then pull out repetition in key pattern/note numbers. I did one both with and without note duration, but either didn't have the time or didn't have the knowledge to do an analysis with accounting for key or octave changes with the same structure (or even just with a &quot;tweak&quot; like doing A B C on repeat, and then a single emphasis like is A B C#.</p>
<p>My study wasn't very indepth, but I did a quick check of the top 10 most popular songs from each decade back to the 1890s, and ran the code on them to determine various complexity measures (to see if modern music really is less unique and more repetitive than people say. The grand result was that older music was more melodically complex, and modern music was more instrumentally complex. I'm sure someone with a better music background would be able to create more meaningful measures, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s been a while, but I used to do a little work in “Music Information Retrieval”, which (essentially) uses a bit of fancy math to turn music (tempo, melody, cords, etc.) into data points. to give an oversimplified example (which tbh is about all i can remember about what i learned anymore), imagine take a MIDI file of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas” and assign each note a corresponding numerical value. you can then take that data and do all kinds of pattern finding and visualization and charting and graphing and so on, so forth. analyzing the patterns in that data is one of the ways Spotify generates those “for you” playlists! so, to answer the question, yes :-)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is a bit how you can do a complex analysis to find an image's fractal dimension, but it is an open secret that you can also just use a lossy compression and look at the file size, since compression quality relates to fractal dimension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the lyrics are repetitive... But Around the World is incredibly complex in its arrangement and harmonic structure. They're constantly bringing in new sounds, frequencies, drum patterns, samples. So the text file of the lyrics might compress 98% but the audio data won't. There's a lot going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True! I like this song and Daft Punk, didn't mean to say that the repetitive lyrics make it a dumb song or anything like that. Obviously this approach was purely based on lyrics,  which means it doesn't take the factors into account that you described.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, depends on how badly we abuse the numbers.</p>
<p>Compressing 32-bit 192k 5.1 PCM (36.8mbit) down to a &quot;mere&quot; 700kbit would be plenty doable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this. Imagine I'm paying for something that's $10. I can give ten individual $1 coins, or I can give one $10 bill. The amount of work that goes into paying 10 coins is greater for both me, who needs to find 10 individual coins, and the cashier, who needs to count 10 coins to confirm.</p>
<p>Something similar to this is happening when you copy/transfer files. Even though you can probably drag and drop a folder that contains tens of thousands of files. Each one of those files needs to be negotiated individually for transfer. But if you zip it, it's treated as one single file and it only needs to be negotiated once.</p>
<p>You can see this happening when you copy game files for backup very often. A game usually contains tons of small files. If you copy it directly, the speed is usually slow and goes up and down a lot because of the negotiation. But if you zip it without compression before copying. It will often take less time to zip+copy than copying directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not “lag” but the start stop of copying a file takes time. </p>
<p>Transferring 100 1MB files is much slower than 1 100MB file because there is overhead when starting and stopping the transfer of a file</p></div>		</li>
						<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mirxia" target="_blank">mirxia</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I guess? Depends on what you mean by lag. When you click on a link to start a download. The transferring already isn't initiated immediately. There's always a second-ish that it takes to communicated with the server before you actually see it displaying download speed. Assuming the software you use to download only allows one active download at a time. Then yes, it will definitely have to go through that communication phase for every single one of those 1200 loose files. Which would only happen once if they were in a zip archive.</p>
<p>And of course, this also happens when you're copying files locally. The only thing that got removed compared to downloading is the latency between your computer and the server. But even in this case, your computer still needs a bit of time and computing power to communicate with itself for every single file you copy. And as you increase the amount of files you copy. The time can add up drastically.</p>
<p>So to sum up. It's not that there would be additional &quot;lag&quot; just because it's a queue of multiple files. But that there's an already existing communication phase that happens before transferring, which would need to happen for every single file. And because of that, more file = more communication time. Causing it to take longer to download than if it was a single file.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there's acceleration for copy/pasting and uploading/downloading. If I'm driving to a destination, a big fat file is like a highway where you can accelerate to full speed, a bunch of smaller files is like traffic lights. Every file has to start at zero speed. In fact when you get loads of files too small you never make the most of your internet connection (taking a sports car through the city). It's very frustrating. </p>
<p>Part of my job is IO support for a company. I deal a lot with moving data around the network as well as Aspera and Signiant high speed data transfer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I'm backing up my drives it's better to zip all the files first? Semi-relatedly, will this increase the amount of data in the source drive then, because there's the original files in the folders, and copies of those files in the zip file?</p></div>		</li>
					<ul class="replies">
		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mirxia" target="_blank">mirxia</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on your priority.</p>
<p>If your absolute priority is speed (typically when moving files between computers), then yes, it will be fast if you zip them <em>uncompressed</em> before backup. Uncompressed is very important here. Otherwise you will be spending more time compressing them.</p>
<p>But say I want to backup my RAW images. I can just copy them and it will take a while or I can put them in a zip and it will be faster. But the thing is I would want to be able to access those files and edit them sometimes. And extract -&gt; edit -&gt; put it back in is just annoying to do and you wouldn't be able to see which image is which when they are in a zip file archive (because the file name is usually just a number). So it's just more practical to copy them directly in this case.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes it will, but after you made your backup, you can delete either or both. <del>Or you can zip it directly on your backup media to begin with.</del> So it's not really an issue I would say.</p></div>		</li>
