<p>An alternative inert atmosphere should not affect them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about pressure? Like if one were to die exposed to a vacuum?</p>
<p>Or, for that matter, what if you were in a spacesuit that still had some amount of pressurization, but much less than earth?</p>
<p>Clarke's third book in the Space Odyssey series had a character who was revived after 1000 years in space, and I just want to know if the body would really have remained intact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most gut bacteria don’t need oxygen and often can’t survive in a oxygen rich environment. Inert gases like nitrogen or argon won’t do much. A pure oxygen environment would be deadly to many bacteria however, given that the oxygen reaches the bacteria in the first place</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also not a whole heck of a lot left of him. I was surprised to learn the other week that all his organs have been removed and he's just basically skin, bones and a lot of mortuary putty/wax. There's photos of him going into his yearly embalming preservation bath where you can see his entire belly/chest cavity open and empty. Still impressive but not a whole body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there an appreciable difference between a body which froze to death and sat in the freezing environment vs a body which died prior to hypothermia and sat in the same freezing environment?</p>
<p>In other words will this putrification process be noticably less in a body which died by hypothermia compared to someone who was normal temperature at the moment of death? (Because they hypothermia gave a headstart to the mummification process)</p>
<p>I don't know why I'm so curious about that but I guess I just need to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The time frame for putrefaction to occur is about 3 days to start taking hold. So long as the body is chilled before that point, it doesn't matter much if the C.O.D was hypothermia or other causes.</p></div>		</li>
