			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with fish.  I have seen a two headed fish fry before, you probably get one out of every hundred thousand eggs or so.  They don't usually live long because they can't swim effectively, and as a result they can't eat effectively</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dunno about birds but a two headed fish strikes me as almost dead on arrival, simply because being hydrodynamic is so important in general to a fish. Having two heads would be a massive impediment to movement when it creates a lot of drag. Also might make it hard to obtain food in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bred tilapia for years, tilapia can have 500 - 1000 offspring per breeding. I used to save the two headed ones and put them in a separate fish tank in my house because I felt bad for them. Even with very little other competition, the two headed ones wouldn't survive much longer than 5 - 6 months (our breeding stock tilapia were 5 - 6 years old). Fish babies are so, so much smaller than sexually mature fish and at a certain point they are fighting against their increasing size, which yeah a two headed fish shape is not very conducive to moving around efficiently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In chick hatching groups I see two headed birds more commonly than reptiles, I know that's anecdotal but if an egg is a double yoke and gets incubated or divides incorrectly the result is a two headed chick or one with multiple limbs or both</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me that mammals and birds can also consciously “respond and remove it”, since they rear the animal after it’s born. They can refuse to feed the deformed offspring, or in the case of birds, yeet it from the nest. (Fun fact: that’s the first time I’ve used the word “yeet”. Did I do it right?)</p></div>		</li>
