<p>Man, tell that to the shitty Visio soundbar/surround system I bought. Even with music mode on, the satellite speakers only play incredibly tin-y high ends. The speakers are fully capable of doing more though(it'll play full frequency audio when it does the speaker identification test)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah some of the choices are.....not the best. Also they may have decided to minimize surrounds since sometimes people would prefer the recording as close as intended (from a single stereo source, not all around you) that way the stereo image as intentionally placed can be appreciated.</p>
<p>Also the logic developed by the cheaper systems isn't great anyway.</p></div>		</li>
