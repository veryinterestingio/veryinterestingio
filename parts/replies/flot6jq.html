<p>Edit: I did not deserve gold for this but considering the context I feel like I should spread the love for the economic velocity or whatever.</p>
<p>Edit 2: So if gold is 500 and I give 250 to 2 users instead of 1 does that help more?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two economists were walking down the street one day when they passed two large piles of dog shit.
The first economist said to the other, &quot;I'll pay you $20,000 to eat one of those piles of shit.&quot; The second one agrees and chooses one of the piles and eats it. The first economist pays him his $20,000.</p>
<p>Then the second economist says, &quot;I'll pay you $20,000 to eat the other pile of shit.&quot; The first one says okay, and eats the shit. The second economist pays him the $20,000.</p>
<p>They resume walking down the street.</p>
<p>After a while, the second economist says, &quot;You know, I don't feel very good. We both have the same amount of money as when we started. The only difference is we've both eaten shit.&quot;</p>
<p>The first economist says: &quot;Ah, but you're ignoring the fact that we've engaged in $40,000 worth of trade!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

The way you explain money passing through hands benefitting everyone is actually quite helpful and something many people probably take fore granted  üòÖ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to view is the amount of value added production a country produces in a given time. So if a mining company extracts and sells ore, that creates some value to the GDP. When a refinery takes the ore and smells into steel beams and sells it, that also adds to the GDP. When. Those steel beams are made into a warehouse, you guessed it, it adds to the GDP. </p>
<p>It's also just a good, single number you can look at to evaluate the general health of an economy. If things are going well, lots of stuff is being made (or services rendered) and the GDP is high. When the economy is going slow, less stuff is being made and the GDP is lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't, directly, if by 'value' were talking about the value of individual items. Its 'first order effect' is that it affects our aggregate economic activity (the most common measure being GDP). The individual prices or values of goods don't change, but the quantity purchased of those goods drop leading to lower activity. Overall activity is price times quantity. So instead of adding up 100 haircuts at $50 each, you're only adding up 50 x $50.</p>
<p>But indirectly (second and third order effects) is that it does affect value. If you have less people demanding a good (like the haircut in my original example) the price will drop. So the 'value' of that haircut will drop. Which means now we're only adding up, say, 50 x $30. The economy is very complex and there are lots of interactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shouldn't the economy balance it out eventually when the price is lower the demand will automatically go up. So it would stay 50 x 30$ for a short time before it shoots back up to 100 x 30$?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason GDP matters, lifted from OPs example, is that each transaction is assumed to be beneficial for the recipient, i.e., what they gain is worth more than $50 to them.  This is termed consumer surplus in economics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense, because if you're spending some amount of money, I'd assume that you want that thing more than the same amount of money, so you're &quot;getting more&quot; than what you already had. And the person who sold it values that money more than what they sold, because they're profiting and can get that item a decent amount cheaper.</p>
<p>So there's a sort of gain on both sides, where each values what they received more than what they had?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it is combined with production. That same $50 has incentivized multiple people to add value to the economy in the form of a good or service. GDP isn't a measure of money, it's a measure of production.</p></div>		</li>

First, you can accrue interest in a bank account. But more importantly, the bank can then use that money to invest in businesses and the economy leading to, you guessed it, a higher velocity of money!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Filipinos are also inherently not inclined to saving. I read somewhere that people from tropical climates are accustomed to using up what they have without much long-term consideration since their weather is the same all-year round, so they could just get back tomorrow what they just spent today. Non-tropical climates though have &quot;evolved&quot; to save up on resources, since not doing so could spell death and hardships during the winter season.</p></div>		</li>
