			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically, colorblind folks (at least the common red-green type) still have functioning rods, so they would be able to see the laser. And they have functioning blue and red cones, which will still fire slightly even in response to a green laser. So the laser will still be present perceptually, but it might look like a desaturated tan color ( because none of the cones are firing very heavily).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Color blind here...I can see them both and probably guess the colors correct, you shoot both of them at the same time and I won't be able to tell them apart, will typically see the green as &quot;brighter&quot; than the red and will be able to distinguish. Beyond 20ft, they all look Brown</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly. For example red-green colourblindness means that you see both red and green as the same colour. So a red-green colourblind person could see both red and green lasers, but might not be able to tell them apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true, it's that you have less of those cones and the color tends to be less saturated. We can still pretty easily tell the difference when the colors are at their most pure, but it can be made difficult when you start adjusting it's shade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally tru, but not exactly - in my case, tritanomaly, the blue sensitivity is shifted towards the green, so I effectively can't see some of the shorter wavelengths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the misunderstanding probably comes from the poor naming of the condition itself: &quot;colorblind&quot; really sounds like you should be &quot;blind&quot; to &quot;colors&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
