<p>Hm what’s the last part supposed to mean? A proof is a finite list of certain formulas. What do you mean it should be finitely enumerator?</p>
<p>Completeness applies to first order theories, and they are by definition axiomatic.</p></div>		</li>

<p><del>The axioms from which the proof is derived must be recursively enumerable.</del></p>
<p><del>See the True Theory of Arithmetic for a counterexample.</del></p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Actually wait, this only comes into play for incompleteness. For completeness, you are correct that &quot;finitely enumerable&quot; doesn't add anything here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but I don’t think that’s a requirement for the completeness theorem to hold. It does require a well-ordered language, though.</p></div>		</li>
