			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, if they were to put the track back to how it was when the GT40 was setting its times then the engineers would change the gearing in the TS050 to create a higher speed. but slightly slower acceleration, It isn't that the car can't go faster, it is that it doesn't need to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it would still accelerate quicker than the GT40 did.</p>
<p>It must be added though, an internal combustible engine isn't all that complicated. They had pretty good understanding of it back then. Sure, you can use better materials now and change certain things, but at some point the law of diminishing returns kicks in. Getting a car to 250 mph and beyond isn't simply &quot;a bit more than 200mph&quot;, it's multiple times more difficult, technology wise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This not true, and it unfairly trivializes the research work of so many people.  </p>
<p>Internal combustion engines (ICE) dynamics are still a huge area of research, more than ever today.  They are incredibly complicated.  The fact that they are (in many cases) serviceable by a moderately trained technician is itself an engineering marvel.</p>
<p>Engines can be so, so much more capable than even a couple decades ago.  What we knew about ICE in the 60s, and what we were capable of making them do, completely pales in comparison to today.</p>

<p>We are not at that point - a search for “average horsepower vs. displacement” or “vs. fuel consumption” over the years will convince anyone :)  We have done so much more than “change materials.”  There are great textbooks and literature review papers on many aspects of ICE design, so a dedicated person can read up on the way things have changed.  You’ll get a taste of the active research problems too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Above is the actual answer. </p>
<p>To OP: We could, but motor sports has evolved to keep the excitement to danger ratio as high as possible, if the track was unchanged and teams were allowed to run ‘equivalent cars’ to the GT40, it would be a bombastic bloodbath with top speeds somewhere like 250mph</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At Indianapolis, Indy cars were hitting 280mph on the straights in the seventies.   Some of the engines that were being used had 1100 to 1200 horsepower.  Despite the amount of power, the first 45 second (200mph average) lap did not occur until 1977, the cars had to slow down a lot for the turns.  Better aerodynamics, better tires have resulted in faster speeds.   Engine rules, wing size limits, limits on fuel, other things, are constantly   changed to slow the cars down to keep the drivers safe.</p>
<p>The current rules limit engine displacement to 2.2 liters, the engines put out around 650 horsepower.</p>
<p>The current record for fastest lap, 237.498 mph (based on lap time), was set in 1996, the rules have been changed several times to slow the cars down.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  Forgot my point, the first 200mph lap was set by a car that hit 270 or so down the straights but only about 160 or so in the turns, this was in 1977.   </p>
<p>In 2019, the 231mph lap was done with a car that was hitting only about 244mph or so down the straights, but was going through the corners at just over 200mph.   Lower horsepower, but vastly improved cornering speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, definitely higher. F1 cars can hit 230 in races, and that's on a 900HP turbo V6 with a hell of a lot of work being done in the rules to slow them down. The main one being severe fuel flow and capacity limits that keep them around 12K RPM, where the V8s were pushing 21K. Put another way, if they could bypass the fuel restrictions, there's probably another 500HP in those engines, and with a long enough straight (another restriction - lots of chicanes added to long straights) they should easily clear 300MPH. </p>
<p>LMPs have similar headroom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've probably seen this as it seems like you are a fan of Le Mans. But I recently watched the Porsche 919 EVO(which I know has less restrictions than its Le Mans brethren)destroy the fastest lap at The Ring. It looked cartoonish is was going so fast. I never thought any race car could corner so quickly. It was amazing. Great explanation by the way for ELI5.</p></div>		</li>

<p>BMW-Sauber had gone years before the 919Evo with an F1 car and their engineers reckoned they could smash the record with a time in the early 5 minutes but never attempted it.</p></div>		</li>
