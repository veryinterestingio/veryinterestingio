			<div class="markdown"><p>If you haven't watch &quot;Behind the Curve&quot; on netflix,  this is exactly what happens.  </p>
<p>Dude gets a $20,000 laser gyroscope to detect the rotation of the earth.  Detects it accurately (15° per hour, 24 hours x 15°= 360° per day, or one rotation of the earth which flat earthers deny happens)  then proceeds to assume something called &quot;sky energy&quot; is affecting the machine and giving false readings. ALSO later says on camera they shouldn't tell other flat earthers about it because it would &quot;ruin their message&quot;. </p>
<p>Bunch of twats if you ask me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for explaining! This is slightly confusing to me since everyone has a bit of a different answer but still clears up misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The thing is, her pov is along the lines of: &quot;their facts don't add up&quot;, i think she doubts the idea spacecrafts ever truly flew to the moon if earth is flat, she doesn't believe either the high temperature nor the idea of them surviving in such temperatures if its so hot. She obviously never studied physics enough to understand this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to consider the possibility that to her, it <em>doesn't matter</em> if the Earth is flat or round. You and her have different goals in discussing the topic. Your goal is to convince her of truth. Her (unstated, likely unconscious) goal is to have a topic on which she can feel good about herself for being a &quot;skeptic&quot;. I would bet that arguing the facts will never convince her until and unless she has an <em>emotional</em> reason to care more about the truth of the matter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Flat Earth&quot; has degraded to a haven for idiots who refuse to be swayed by reason—hardened commandos fighting a thought war. You will lose every argument with them because they weren't having an honest argument in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
