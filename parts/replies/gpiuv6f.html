			<div class="markdown"><p>The correct answer is that we know fuck all about biology, despite extensive research. Laymen like to think scientists know everything, hence the common belief that a &quot;cure&quot; for &quot;cancer&quot; can/does/should exist, but just doesn't because of corporate greed. Ask any scientist working in a biological field and they will tell you how little we truly know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For every type of cell you have, there is a specific cancer for it.  They range from mostly treatable until it metasizes (spelling as I have been drinking) to 'Well fuck.  I guess it will kill you eventually.'   (The cancer stages is IV and I)</p></div>		</li>
