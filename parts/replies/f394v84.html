			<div class="markdown"><p>People in my family generally sneeze <em>at least</em> 3 times every time. If I sneeze less than 3 times, it's usually a sign I am getting sick. I often hit 3-4 sneezes with my all-time high being 16. It was scary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The best way I can describe it: think of sneezing as an orgasm. </p>
<p>Both have a “build up” feeling until the involuntary reflex kicks in. If you achieve orgasm, then stop receiving stimulation, the orgasm will be weak and short. Continue receiving stimulation and the orgasm will last longer.</p>
<p>Similarly, if your first sneeze didn’t dislodge the snot that was touching the hairs inside your nose that cause the sneeze reflex, you’re still receiving stimulation, thus more sneezing occurs.</p></div>		</li>
