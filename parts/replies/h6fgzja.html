			<div class="markdown"><p>Really nicely explained thanks. Two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is spacetime non-euclidean because the speed of light is constant or is the speed of light constant because space is non-euclidean. Or is this a nonsense quesiton</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is spacetime non-euclidean? Is it the only form it can be? Why does it cause such nonintuitive fact that speed of light is constant? </p>
</li>
<li>Why does flipping the sign of one coordinate (-) create an easy solution?</li>

<p>If your Universe has a velocity which is constant to all observers, you must drop Euclidean rotational symmetry applying to timelike dimensions. So a constant speed of light implies non-Euclidean spacetime, but usually we'd say that the specific type of spacetime we live in happens to be non-Euclidean, and also is of the type that happens to have a privileged constant speed.</p>

<p>&quot;Why&quot; questions are sometimes hard to answer in physics, especially when to refer to the most fundamental features of existence. You'd have to ask whatever Creator you believe in. If you'd ask me, I'd say it's because of causality. In our universe, cause always precedes effect, regardless of which observer you ask. This is incompatible with full rotational symmetry of spacetime, since if my spacetime-velocity vector is pointing forwards in time according to you, I can simply perform a 180Â° rotation of that vector and now I'm going back in time. Timetravel would not just be possible, it'd be trivial, there'd be no notion of cause and effect. What is the future to me, might just be what is to the left of you.</p>
<p>In our universe however, you can't rotate your spacetime-velocity around. You can tilt it by boosting your velocity, and time will go slower or faster accordingly (this is called time dilation in special relativity), but you can never flip it around, it'll always point towards the future. Causality gives our universe order, makes it understandable. Enforcing that is to me the most important reason there's a non-Euclidean element to spacetime. But I didn't make the universe.</p>

<p>Physicists and mathematicians really like quadratic forms, i.e. roughly speaking sums of squares. They show up everywhere, in number theory, in differential geometry, in linear algebra, in Lie theory, in differential topology, ... So it'd be really nice if we could keep writing the square of the spacetime-distance as a sum of squares. It can't be a sum of just positive terms, because that's exactly what yields a Euclidean space. Hence instead of a sum of all positive squares, we add one negative square. Almost all of the math just keeps working, we just have to keep a few exceptions in mind, so this would make us really happy. Most importantly, it allows us to write the spacetime distance with a metric tensor, which is what put Einstein on the track towards General Relativity.</p>
<p>Physicists didn't make the universe of course, but lucky for us the universe seems to be understandable and describable by elegant math. It sometimes just takes us a while to figure out how to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. So that the speed of light is constant for every observers is just equivalent to causality being similar to every observer? </p>
<p>Btw if the time component is complex, it results with squaring in the -t^2 component. Can this be explained by Noneucliden geometry/constant speed of light</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can give a partial answer to 3. It boils down to two things: 1. mathematical truths regarding the properties of distances and 2. truths in our phrasing of the problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Maths states that locally, in a small area around a point, distances can be measured by taking the square root of some quadratic function (a so called quadratic form). This only leaves us the choice of coefficients. Most importantly, an euclidean space has only positive coefficients (to be exact: the underlying quadratic form can only have positive eigenvalues)</p>
</li>
<li>We phrased the solution such, that coefficients are simple. We did not pick arbitrary coordinate systems, but one with units seconds/lightseconds so that the coefficients are +1 or -1. Other units would give a different result. We have also added quite a big assumption: We assume that space is flat - therefore the coefficients are the same no matter where we are (you can cross the &quot;locally&quot; above and turn the &quot;small area&quot; into &quot;the whole universe&quot;). This is not true in reality, gravity changes this a lot. So, this result only holds for an empty universe, or one with equal mass everywhere. Around a black hole, don't use this metric, it is wrong!</li>
</ol>
<p>Putting 1 and 2 together, we have only one choice left to turn our space non-euclidean: we have to use a negative coefficient. we can't use negative coefficients in the space dimension, because we know that this is locally eudclidean. so the only choice we have is a negative coefficient in time.</p>
<p>//edit a small addendum to 2: the point about gravity mostly affects the space component and indirectly time. But there is also a big global assumption about time: the passage of time does not change. For example, time could constantly speed up. But this is something we can't really know because we live in space and traverse through time. you would need an observer outside our space and time to see whether we move faster and faster through the time coordinate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if these answers are anything close to correct, but no one else has responded so I am taking a guess:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I was taught that the speed of light is the maximum speed any object can move in the universe. That's a fundamental constant of the universe itself and light moves at that universal maximum as opposed to the speed being a specific property of light. I do not believe we know why there is a maximum speed on objects but I think we know light can move at that maximum because it has no mass. So I think we could say if there were no maximum speed for the universe then spacetime might become Euclidean, but I'm pretty sure that is a nonsense sentence. It is similar to saying &quot;if there was no gravity we could all fly&quot; but our universe could not exist without gravity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See the above. I don't think we can answer &quot;why&quot; anymore than we can answer why gravity exists. It is simply a law of the physical universe we have discovered and can measure.</p>
</li>
<li>I think this is an artifact of mathematics more than an explanation for how to make spacetime euclidean. The original comment's math example using seconds and light seconds works if you change the equation from <code>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</code> to <code>a^2 - b^2 = c^2</code>. If you have a &quot;line&quot; from (0, 0) to (5 seconds, 5 lightseconds) and &quot;rotate&quot; that same &quot;line&quot; but inverse the argument in the Pythagorean equation then every rotation the seconds and light seconds must be equal. It effectively forces the sum of the coordinates to always be equal to the number of seconds squared or the acceleration through spacetime.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody would :) It's why in the 250 years between Newton and Einstein, nobody ever proposed it.</p>
<p>It only happened when Einstein for completely different reasons came up with the Lorentz transformations, and the Polish mathematician Hermann Minkowski looked at those and said &quot;Hey, those look exactly like hyperbolic rotations. Huh, what if...&quot;</p></div>		</li>
