<p>And I can't say anything about prices where you are, but generally all-in-one's cost more than 2 separate units, have reduced capacity, longer cycle times, and aren't as efficient or reliable.</p>
<p>Basically, if you can fit 2 units you should.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So assume you have a family of 4 and you're doing 6 loads a week.  I say six loads, but that's in our full size washer.  Those combo machines generally have much smaller capacity so make it 8+  loads.  Assume an hour to wash and an hour to dry.  In my full size washer dryer I can get 6 loads washed and dried in 7 hours.  With a smaller capacity combo unit its going to take me SIXTEEN HOURS to wash the same amount of laundry. God help you if you have a larger family.</p></div>		</li>
