			<div class="markdown"><p>I am sorry to hear about your family member’s experience. You raise a lot of good points. This is why NIMH is supporting research for innovative treatments that work faster (for example, esketamine—with symptom relief in a couple of hours instead of weeks) but also intervention research to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacologic, psychosocial, somatic, rehabilitative, and combination interventions on mental and behavior disorders in real-world settings. To help your family member find a provider, you may want to visit the NIMH Help for Mental Illnesses webpage: www.nimh.nih.gov/findhelp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly? Say what needs to be said to go inpt. Then they will do a referral to outpt and the pt will have to be seen within five days and then they can become a regular pt of the clinic. That’s the fastest route, if you don’t have walk in clinics or mental health EDs</p></div>		</li>
