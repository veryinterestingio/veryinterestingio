			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes indeed! And that is probably due to the differences between the autonomic nervous system (the part you can't control) and the central nervous system (the part that says &quot;I want to sleep&quot;).</p>
<p>Diet, activity level, medications, timing, and a thousand other factors go in to how the autonomic system works. Maybe stop drinking coffee past early afternoon? If that applies to you. And not my professional medical advice of course, just a thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact! I partially paralyzed on one side of my face due too complications at birth. It's suuuuuper slight, but you can see it off i open my mouth wide, as one side opens way further. </p>
<p>It's also noticable in the eye muscles though, as when i get tired one eye twitches a lot, and if I blink for an extended period off time, one eyelid won't actually open 'naturally'. I have to actually 'widen' my eyes. </p>
<p>When I sleep, many times one eye simply won't close all the way. My mom always called me 'petey one-eye' because of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if I'm the only one who does this, but I use this to gauge how close am I to falling asleep. If my eyes close on their own when I relax my eyelids, I'm sleepy enough, if they stay half open I'm probably going to be awake for a while.</p></div>		</li>
