			<div class="markdown"><p>The main killer in regards to those who died of Spanish Flu were actually secondary bacterial infections that took advantage of a weakened immune system and lungs damaged by the initial viral infection, we have no way of knowing if cytokine storms happened in response to only the viral infection, the secondary infection, or both, but we do have loads of evidence pointing to secondary infections being a <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/bacterial-pneumonia-caused-most-deaths-1918-influenza-pandemic" target="_blank">principle contributor to much of the deaths from that pandemic</a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Young people are susceptible to secondary bacterial infection after a Covid infection in 2020 as well, but they generally respond better to treatment for such than older and more infirm people who make up the bulk of the deaths in the current pandemic.</p>
<p>1/5 Young adults require hospitalization for Covid today, mostly due to the pneumonia that this disease causes, and secondary bacterial pneumonia that often accompanies it. In 1918, those young people would have far higher chances of succumbing to the disease than they would today.</p>

<p>We also don't have a clear picture of how many mild and asymptomatic cases of Spanish flu there were in 1918-1921. We only know of the medically significant cases and estimates derived from the numbers of those, which make the mortality rate appear higher as result... </p>
<p>We do know that much if not most of those who are infected with one of the various strains of influenza are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms that are often mistaken for a common cold, and that was probably also the case for that flu as well, but we had no way of knowing that for certain as we didn't even know that viruses even existed and caused illness back then.</p></div>		</li>
