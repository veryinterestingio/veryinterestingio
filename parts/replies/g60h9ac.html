			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a result of all of your muscles tensing up in preparation for the response. The chest compression is a result of you tightening your upper core muscles, and the tightness in your throat is a result of all of your neck muscles tightening up. Those feelings aren't inherently an advantage, they're a side effect of those responses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like someone else commented, the lump in your throat is muscles holding the glottis open to maximize air flow. This is also what causes people to gag.</p></div>		</li>
