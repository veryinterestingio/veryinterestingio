			<div class="markdown"><p>For me I feel it was very thin and irritated skin at the end of the nail.
Then one time u decided to fucking not go to the doctor and let him slice open my big toe but to just go to a professional medical foot thingy. She cleaned it out. Wrapped it in iodo and tadaa. For 5 years clean of toe problems. Before that I would get an ingrown nail every few weeks or months at least. </p>
<p>Thank you toe lady</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First step is to keep the area clean as can be, because gangrene and septicemia are bad. Next step is to find a different doctor.</p>
<p>You have a recurring medical problem which is not only adversely effecting your quality of life greatly, but it is actually potentially putting your life at risk. Your current doctors are not fixing it. Find ones that will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try wrapping it in iodo and waiting it out.
Don't touch it. And try to rewrap a few times a day. For me it worked pretty well. Else you might really need surgery. So if it doesn't get better after you don't touch it for a while and wrap it in iodo you probably have to meet up with a doc. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, Evolution doesn't just remove things because they are no longer necessary. It would remove it if it were beneficial to remove it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they actually do a lot to protect your finger from the billion tiny impacts your fingers make every day. if you've ever seen someone who's permanently lost a fingernail, you'll notice it's way more calloused. </p>
<p>this isn't debilitating, particularly as a 1-off, but if we didn't have nails, our fingers would need to be larger and less sensitive to put up with the constant abuse. you'd also have worse grip. the nail provides a small amount of backing to your finger tips, improving contact with what you're holding. </p></div>		</li>
