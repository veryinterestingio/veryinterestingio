			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is not just incorrect, it's badly incorrect, and it's clear they have little to no knowledge about neuroscience. You cannot &quot;shut down&quot; neurotransmitters, that makes no sense. Motor neurons are not responsible for sending signals to the brain, either, in fact they do the exact opposite. They send signals FROM the brain TO the muscles or lower motor neurons. His comment is basically gibberish.</p>
<p>Source: degree in neurobiology and physiology. </p>
<p>That being said, I don't personally know why we tend not to sneeze during sleep. Chances are that it does have to do with a specific circuit being shut off while we're asleep. Basically, I would assume the neurons responsible for initiating a sneeze are inhibited by inhibitory neurotransmitters released from a different neuronal circuit in the brain that is excited during sleep. But I don't really know. The brain has a lot of counterintuitive ways of making things happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your response. I got really angry at the first comment since it is wrong lol. I'm also studying neuroscience and my educated guess is that sensory neurons in the nose still sense the stimulant and that is still sent to its respective regions in the brain. However during REM sleep, voluntary muscles like those used during sneezing are inhibited through GABA and Glycine inhibitory neurotransmitters and the motor signal coming from the brain is inhibited. This may be why we can smell certain things in our dreams and we can be awaken by strong smelling substances. It's just that sneezing is not a priority when sleeping and actually disturbs your sleep so it is inhibited unless strongly stimulated or not in REM sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, they got the idea right, just the structure wrong. During REM the circuit that “activates” the motor neurons are “disabled” which is why we generally don’t act out the things we do in our dreams. While no conclusive answer has been confirmed, the theory still holds as an answer as to why we don’t generally sneeze when sleeping. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just thinking about this but in terms of anesthesia. Does the same apply to coughing? I'm supposed to get some oral surgery and I have a pretty bad cough. I was thinking about what would happen if someone was under and they had a coughing/sneezing fit during a root canal or something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are due to get oral surgery under a local anaesthetic, you should be ok but I would let the dentist know in case you need to cough during the procedure. If it’s an elective procedure, he may want to postpone it. </p>
<p>If the operation is due under a general anaesthetic, you should tell your anaesthetist/anaesthesiologist about your cough. I would imagine they would want to postpone the surgery. Unless of course it is urgent. </p>
<p>Yes, patients can cough under general anaesthetic. This is usually because they are not deep enough. The drugs that we use obtund the cough reflex so you would just be given more. If the surgery is delicate and any sudden movements would be dangerous (e.g. brain surgery, inner ear surgery) then the anaesthetic technique can be modified to make sure this definitely does not happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thank you. I appreciate the valuable information. I'll be doing the local anesthesia and was just curious how it works with the general anesthesia. You shed some light on things I didn't even consider. I'll be sure to talk to my dentist, than you friend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a medical professional by any means, but I would definitely inform your dentist. Root canals are somewhat open surgery. Sure it gets cleaned out thoroughly, but having a (possibly) infected throat next to it seems like a bad idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP is wrong:</p>
<p>Source on this? What do you mean by certain neurotransmitters shut down? During REM sleep glycine is released into the spinal cord which ultimately leads to muscle  paralysis. Your answer doesn’t explain why we don’t wake up with the urge to sneeze and then sneeze, since the irritant detector nerves isn’t based on a muscle</p>
<p>Also, what about during non-REM sleep? Your answer doesn’t explain that either. We’re only in REM sleep for something like 20% of the slew cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you have some pretty bad sinus/allergy problems. When you’re standing up the mucus will drain from the sinuses and down the back of your throat; when you lie down it will no longer drain and will instead pool up. </p>
<p>I would highly recommend using a saline sinus rinse before bed to help clear all of that crap out. If you have a history of sinus infections add in a couple drops of baby shampoo to assist in breaking down the bacterial biofilm which will inhibit the efficacy of antibiotics. (I’m serious; there are studies out there proving this works) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glycine is a neuro inhibitor. It inhibits nerves, not muscles. You appear to think that it has a direct effect on the muscles themselves, which is not the case. It relaxes muscles by inhibiting the nerves that control them. It is feasible for it to do this to the nerves involved in the cough and sneeze reflex too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it’s plausible that glycine can inhibit neurons in the brain stem which are responsible for detecting irritants in the nose. You think it’s from the olfactory nerve or from the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve? </p></div>		</li>
