			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we only have so many neurotransmitters, we have to use them carefully. As a result, serotonin does much more than simply improve your mood, much like dopamine does more than simply make you euphoric. In fact, too much serotonin will kill you: it's called seratonin syndrome, and it's caused by a toxic overproduction of serotonin. You'll recognize the symptoms as the side effects of an anti-depressent, but with serotonin syndrome, they're far worse: shakes, sweats, vomiting, fever, hyperflexia... eventually, serotonin syndrome leads to seizures and rhabdomyolysis, or muscle breakdown. That alone gives us a clue about serotonin's multitool existence, but it's far from a complete picture.</p>
<p>It shouldn't surprise you to learn that the way SSRIs work, their &quot;mechanism of action,&quot; is complicated. However, it might surprise you to learn that SSRI's mechanism of action is poorly understood. </p>
<p>We do know that, if mood improvement only required an increase in serotonin at the synapse, SSRIs would be effective in days, not weeks. One <a href="https://psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/antidepressants/ssris/mechanism-action-ssris/" target="_blank">theory</a> calls out the down-regulation or decrease of 5HT1A receptor sites, gradually reducing the level of re-uptake over several weeks of physical adaptation. Other lab studies showing that SSRIs reduce inflammation might be the answer. Or maybe SSRIs fire the sigma receptors, and we don't fully understand those either. Brain science has come so far, and it still has so far to go. It's an exciting time. </p>
<p>Today, you can get genetic tests to try and predict which psychiatric medications you'll respond best to, but we can't say for certain why they work... not yet, anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a way to genetically test to see the number of 5ht receptors in the brain? Specifically 5ht2a receptors and the like. Or perhaps the tolerance of those receptors? Sorry if that’s a dumb question, I’ve just always wondered this and never known a place to ask!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would know about it quick, it hits you fast and hard. It's a medical emergency and it's not something you would overlook. I'm not sure how fast it could kill you, I would hazard that it can be quick if its severe enough. If it's killing you you would notice the fever higher than 104 degrees, or the seizures ect, it's not going to be subtle.</p>

<p>You only get it really from crossing the wrong drugs (or herbs). You can look at the wiki page about it for a list of some meds that can cause it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you read about them successfully growing brain tissue in a lab that will form crude connections between cells. I feel like in the next ten to twenty years there will be an explosion of knowledge into the hows and whys of the brain as studying living systems has been one of the biggest roadblocks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I’m a pharmacy student and I’m going to be a little pedantic here. So the serotonin receptor that causes nausea/vomiting is the 5HT3 subtype. <em>Activation</em> of this receptor by serotonin causes the vomiting. </p>
<p>Zofran technically does not decrease total serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft. It is actually a 5HT3 receptor antagonist. So it blocks the receptor and prevents serotonin from ever causing the nausea/vomiting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the reason many side effects tend to decrease/go away with time is because of desensitization of involved &quot;systems&quot;.</p>
<p>This may not be the case in this specific situation with ssri/nausea, but the body has the ability to adjust to new normality. An example would be how it builds tolerance to certain medications, such as opioids/opiates. In that specific scenario, the body both adjusts (lowers) its endogenous production of substances, as well as gets better at breaking down the active substance of the medication. </p></div>		</li>
