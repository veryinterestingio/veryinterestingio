			<div class="markdown"><p>Fruit fly here. The scientist is right. Most likely we come in from outside, because we're attracted to the smell of rotting fruit. We have a life cycle (egg to adult) of 10+ days, and some of our  developmental stages are quite large (our late stage larvae and pupae are up to 1cm long). So for our eggs to develop to adult flies you'd have to wait for us for 10+ days, and also you would have to overlook our large white larvae crawling around in your fruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, we get fruit flies even in winter. If it's -20 C outside, no fruit fly is going to survive, let alone be hunting for food. How would you suggest these fruit flies appear?</p></div>		</li>
