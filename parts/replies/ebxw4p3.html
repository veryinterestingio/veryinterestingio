			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Mine has gotten faster and less comprehensible with every year of med-school. Thank the gods that prescriptions and patient notes are mostly on computers now; the senior docs’ handwriting looks like ancient Sanskrit interposed with Dwarven runes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, as a Doctor, my handwriting is terrible. And not like some others where it progressively gets worse with time/seniority (likely because they feel they don't have time to write clearly). Mine has always been terrible. I used to lament the fact that my friends had such beautifully crafted handwriting during high school.
At the very least, it is legible (I know most Doctors' is not).</p>
<p>And yet, my hands are perfectly steady, can operate no issues at all. Can also paint miniatures in exquisite detail often requiring a toothpick or single hair from a paintbrush for finishing touches with little difficulty. Is my handwriting just laziness??? Odd anyway. I certainly wasn't lazy with the other elements necessary for academic success.</p></div>		</li>
