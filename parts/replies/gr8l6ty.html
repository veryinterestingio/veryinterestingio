			<div class="markdown"><p>u/ml55y The emulsifier type clearly affects the absorption of CBD into the bloodstream. And to be clear, this was surprising to us. When we initiated the study, we expected the water-soluble formulations to exhibit similar absorption profiles, with smaller particle size correlating, at least weakly, with better absorption. Obviously, that’s not what we found. Emulsifiers clearly matter much more than particle size when it comes to bioavailability. We’re working hard to isolate the ideal ratio and selection of ingredients to maximize CBD absorption and this study is one step towards making that a reality. The best absorbing product in the study also had the largest particle size. That was a discovery! Now that we have a better sense of the direction and magnitude of these factors, we’re excited for further research to better understand them.</p></div>		</li>
