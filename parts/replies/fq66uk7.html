			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also just use some razorgrass! I watched a doc on tv years ago that followed a tribe of indigenous people in the Amazon and they had some pretty neat styles and graphics. And they only used a blade of grass!</p>
<p>Edit: I would also like to point out that it would probably be exceptionally difficult to find record of this in our fossil records, so it is possible that grooming in this way could extend far back into our past, before any other kind of evidence we have. Neat little thought!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point.  Of course plant materials are used in a myriad of ways in personal grooming.  I can imagine a convergence of tech in basket weaving, rope, and haircare at a certain point in pre-history.  But I don't have any specific evidence to point out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived there. In stone age jungle tech, bamboo is the tool of choice- it can be shaped easily for sure, but it also breaks and crushes into sharp shapes naturally. Virtually any exposure to a growing bamboo patch will reveal this, so the line of discovery there is really just one step- oh hey this is sharp af, that'll come in handy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in Japan last year one of the temples I visited, the Higashi Hongan-Ji, had a <a href="https://jpninfo.com/39660" target="_blank">rope</a>  made from human hair.</p>
<p>I am not sure if there is a peer reviewed article about it but some of the hair ropes from this time period are in the collection the British Museum found <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_1890-1009-1" target="_blank">here</a> . </p>
<p>“Hair ropes (kezuna) were used during the re-construction of the Goei-do and Amida-do of Higashi-Honganji temple, completed in 1895. Ropes made of hair mixed with hemp were stronger than conventional ropes and were used for transporting and hanging the large roof beams. 53 such ropes were sent from regions across Japan, using hair donated by female devotees. The largest was 110 metres long, with a circumference of 40 cm and weighed 1,000 kg”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an excellent question.  I do not know those specifics.  I do know that there is evidence that Neanderthal had &quot;rope tech&quot;.</p>

<p>They were twisting the inner fibres from tree bark and they braiding it into simple string or twine, and it may have been used in conjunction with another stone tool, though that is speculative.  Human hair might have been seen as less useful for this purpose, due to its material properties.</p>
<p>I do know that mammalian hair in general is rare in the fossil record.  I'm not sure the reasons are fully investigated but here's an interesting essay on it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are Aboriginal Australian peoples who make string/rope from human hair. We have archaeological evidence of it that goes back at least 6500-7000 years but it has probably been done for a lot longer. Google “hairstring” if you want to look into it further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite part about this sub is that phrases such as “May have,” “evidence suggests” possibly,” and “we don’t know for sure” are thrown around shamelessly.  I really love that about science.  It’s a breath of fresh air from the political subs where everything they say is “known fact,” “absolute certainty,” and “YOU are wrong!”  Not sure what my point is, but I was just having this thought and wanted to share it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s difficult for most people to accept not having the answer.  People want to believe that we have it all figured out because the alternative to that is facing the reality that you don’t even know a fraction of 1% of all the things there are to know.  When I was a teenager, I remember I knew everything.  I had it all figured out and wasn’t afraid to tell everyone.  I look back on that and cringe.  I was such a know-it-all punkass.  Every year I get older, the more things I realize I don’t know increases exponentially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it too is because we haven't uncovered everything!</p>
<p>I remember once in my art history class, these archeologists uncovered some new pieces of history that contracted what we originally thought was the case (unfortunately I can't remember what it was as it was too long ago). But basically a section of the textbook was now outdated because we discovered new pieces of history! We are essentially* trying to tell the story of a puzzle when we only have a few pieces. It's definitely interesting the theories we as a society come up with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>People whose self-image is fragile enough that it has to be true because it's what they believe ... well ... some of them may dabble in science and it's a tendency that may even crop up on some topics for some otherwise-reasonable scientists, but in general discussion you'd probably be right to expect them to be easy to spot by the flame wars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It reminds me a lot of religion.  I was involved in the Jehovah’s Witness religion (or simply “The Truth” is what you would refer to it as among fellow JW’s) for about 5 years and they brainwash you into believing that if anything contrary to their teachings is making sense to you then you are being influenced by Satan.  So you actually fear opposing viewpoints because they make sense and you think because they are making sense to you that you are weak and being manipulated by Satan.  Then you feel guilty which makes you more afraid.  </p>
<p>When you become so invested into a belief, sometimes even though you know in your heart that it might be wrong, you fear that knowledge so much that you just double down and actually start to brainwash yourself.</p></div>		</li>
