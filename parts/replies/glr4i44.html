			<div class="markdown"><p>I really like this answer. The distinction between money and value is an important concept that I’m not sure I totally understood before you stated it that way.</p>
<p>Value is arbitrary, money is concrete and physical. The value we assign to money is the social construct that’s useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True but the US government says you have the legal right to access to that $1,000 so you can use it if you want. If you have $1000 worth of stock, there’s no guarantee you can get $1000 from them. Their value can be based on any number of factors that can change at any time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is spot on. As for why <em>value</em> can change in the blink of an eye: People's opinions can change. Value is a subjective construct. Your question is less about economics and more about human psychology.</p>
<p>Edit: Note also that the entire reason money exists is to <em>prevent</em> it from being rapidly created or destroyed. Value of something specific can suddenly change. But if money is used as the common intermediate in <em>all</em> trade, then the value of money is tied to the average value of the market as a whole - rather than the value of any particular good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dollars do not have fixed value. All currencies and assets, and good are in a constant flow of changing value. If a dollar had a fixed value, we'd still be buying cheeseburgers for 5 cents.</p>
<p>In your example of buying a $1 stock, and then selling it for $100. Depending on when you bought and sold it. That $1 and $100 may buy you the exact same amount of bread or whatever.</p>
<p>I call this out, because it gives the assumption that converting stock or whatever into cash, somehow locks in the value, and that is a dangerous financial misconception. There is a reason why portfolios are invested across many things. It is a better way to ensure your value stays more stable.</p></div>		</li>
