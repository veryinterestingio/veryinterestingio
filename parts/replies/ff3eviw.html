			<div class="markdown"><p>If you drive enough moisture out of them then bacteria and mold cannot live in them so they will basically never rot. They could still be eaten by insects, which was absolutely a problem, but it was a fairly effective method of preserving them. However, there are a couple of problems with trying to simply bake them once to that level of dryness. Ovens were often heated by burning a fire ahead of time, and then raking out the coals and baking in the residual heat. This made sure it didnt get to hot, but the temperature would go down over time and was very hard to get consistent. The only alternative would be to burn a fire continuously in a large oven, and then you would risk burning things because the heat would be higher. So to get a consistent dryness on something like a ships biscuit, instead of trying to bake it all in one go they would bake it multiple times for a shorter duration, letting them cool between each bake, both to ensure that it was actually dry enough, and to avoid burning it.</p></div>		</li>
