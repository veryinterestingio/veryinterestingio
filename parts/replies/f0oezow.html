<p>Satellites are basically “things that orbit” while moons are “things that orbit planets”</p>
<p>Any free-floating moon would be called a dwarf planet or asteroid.</p>
<p>Case in point: Ganymede, one of Jupiter’s moons, is larger than the planet Mercury.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's more to the definition of a planet than just size, but if Ganymede was not a satellite of Jupiter it would likely be a planet, not a dwarf planet.</p></div>		</li>
