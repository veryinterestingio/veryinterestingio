<p>I feel like a very good portion of ELI5s are VERY easily googled, but most people just feel like they aren’t good at googling and don’t bother.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, makes his suicide much more understandable and  relatable. My understanding is it was an aggressive form, and he had already lost the ability to ride his bikes (a favorite pastime of his, because of balance issues) as well as other cognitive losses.  Think how devastating it must be for someone with such a quick wit, to sense it all ebbying away from him. Yeah he made the right choice, he should just have let everyone know.</p></div>		</li>
