			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard that psilocybin mushrooms were like a “visual enhancement tools” to ancient hunter gatherers. And that taking them during the tribe’s pre-hunting rituals could’ve increased their success during the hunt. </p>
<p>I remembered this while taking a walk one evening after eating 3 grams of mushrooms and I started trying to spot animals and all of a sudden I was noticing tons of animals and I was able to effortlessly track squirrels running around without losing sight of them even though they were behind objects while running through the trees. </p>
<p>It was really fascinating. And then I would just spot a single, long vine and I could effortlessly single out that vine from all the others and see exactly where that vine snaked it’s way up and down the tree. </p>
<p>It seemed anything that I wanted to focus on just lit up in my mind’s eye. Like a long crack in the road, once I picked one out it’d just “light up” and I could spot exactly where that crack’s line went and it’s relation to others. </p>
<p>And a fly was flying around and I could watch it fly around without ever losing sight of it! Even when it was really far away I could see it clearly and watch it land and take off again. It was so interesting. </p>
<p>So I really do believe that if you were hunting with a spear or something, mushrooms could’ve really helped people out. When I was watching that squirrel run through the trees it felt like I knew it’s path and where it was headed because I could see it so clearly. It almost felt like I was in “the squirrel’s mind” watching it run and jump through the trees. </p>
<p>It was a great experience. I tried doing the same thing when I wasn’t on mushrooms and I would quickly lose track of squirrels darting through the forest. And picking a vine out and following it was hard. It’d just blend in with the surroundings.</p>
<p>But on mushrooms it was like whatever vine I picked, the <em>entire</em> vine would “light up” in my mind and it stood out from its surrounding no matter how long it was or what other vines were intertwined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After all these explanations, though, I still don't grasp how my brain would, for example, superimpose, monochromatic, blue-on-blue, Native American<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ef/fc/cd/effccd23cd41b9333e3a6e3501704330.jpg" target="_blank"> geometric zig-zag patterns</a>, just in the blue part of the sky, not in the clouds.</p>
<p>And on a different occasion, with my eyes closed, generate the effect of flying through an endless stream of random, perfect, cartoon-like, brightly colored, 3D geometric (not in a patterned formation) objects in a pitch black matrix.</p>
<p>While on other occasions, no geometric phenomena at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I studied neurobiology. Worked more in development than vision, but I have some relevant knowledge. </p>
<p>In short, part of your visual system is <em>always</em> identifying these visual patterns. Always. Usually, that information gets passed to a different part of your brain that sifts through it, labels it, and uses it to build an image of the world in front of you. This image is what we usually consciously 'see'. Not the raw visual data coming from our eyes, but the processed, labelled, and corrected image our brains create of the world. For example, we have very little actual colour vision outside the very centre of our eyes. However, you see colour in your peripheral vision because your brain fills it in. </p>
<p>This part is more conjecture than proven science, since the research on the effects of hallucinogenic drugs is somewhat sparse still. I'd imagine you see geometric shapes in particular because of the way a set of visual nerves work in identifying edges. Basically, you have specific sets of nerves that detect lines of various angles. Like, there's a clump for 90 degrees, another for 95 degrees, etc. Their whole job is to look for any sign of an edge. Other bits of brain wiring compile these edges into shapes. Usually you don't have conscious access to that unprocessed image. Perhaps these drugs are occasionally giving you conscious access to those processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont think anyone knows for sure, but I think one possibility is that hallucinogens can take the parts of our brains that do pattern matching and trick them into firing randomly, essentially. So you can be looking at a wall and the rest of your brain is firing normally, but the part of your brain that is able to recognize what stripes look like gets tripped erroneously by the drug, so you start seeing stripes in the wall even though they aren't really there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can’t let people elevate their consciousness en masse if you want everyone to keep being a productive member of the modern individualistic capitalist society. Alienation is real and a lot of people would be a lot happier in a lot simpler of a world with better community.</p>
<p>No but really, laws basically exist to maintain a status quo and clearly too many people near the levers of powers are worried about the potential negatives are of eliminating those laws. Whether that’s cause of the concern for the social impact or because they need the drug war to maintain their police state is anyone’s guess</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously not all drugs are cool.  We had government sanctioned opioids that were passed out like candy on valentines day for years.  It destroyed a large portion of decent society and continues to.</p>
<p>Then there are drugs in which zero negative effects have ever been found, yet are continued controlled scheduled substances, because they offer no medical value (of course, since they can't be researched), and have a high chance of addiction (mostly lies). </p>
<p>Most hallucinogens fall into that category.  Not all mind you, but most.  As to why they are illegal?  LSD?  Not addictive at all, no known medical side effects, no known cases of overdose.  Psilocybin?  Not addictive, no known medical side effects.  Though if we're being intellectually honest, I'm sure people have been harmed by eating toxic mushrooms they thought they could trip on.  </p>
<p>You can go down the list.  MDMA (when it's not spiked), DMT, Dextromethrophan, Ketamine, even PCP.  These are all drugs that are controlled substances and with the exception of DXM and Ketamine entirely illegal.  Yet none are addictive, none have adverse medical side effects associated with the substance itself.</p>
<p>So why are they illegal?  Probably because the government wanted to send a big giant Fuck You to Tim Leary and his pals.  He was advising people to be nonconformists and that made a lot of people nervous.  It's that simple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with all that you've said here apart from 'none have adverse side effects associated with the substance themselves.' Granted the experience I've seen with Ketamine is in the thick of things, but there seemed to be some addictive and adverse side effects- such as the requirement for more to take your body out of the perceived pain level which is now it's baseline, the need to stretch constantly and troubles weeing, even as far as needing a catheter to pee. </p>
<p>The rest I agree 1000%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because some drugs in particular swerve your consciousness so strongly off the typically predetermined &quot;societal&quot; path that it makes the population go against any governments pre set agenda. </p>
<p>Think back to prohibition during the Vietnam war. Everyone was supposed to cheer for the government and the troops for fighting the &quot;enemy&quot; but televised news reporting became a thing and the hippies that took LSD and shrooms were wide awake at the realization that the whole premise was BS. Mass protests ensued and the troops were demonized for abiding by their orders (who sadly don't have a choice in the matter, but when you take mushrooms you're conscious that your individual autonomy should give you the right to throw down your weapon if you feel that the people you're shooting don't actually deserve it. Sadly autonomy is not a quality you're meant to keep during your military service). </p>
<p>To add to that there were projects meant to use LSD as a mind control substance and after testing it on unknowing troops and civilians it concluded to have the exact opposite effect, so it's use was classified as dangerous and &quot;not serving any medical use&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
