			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I thought 2 was the main effect, but when I posted most of the answers were talking about 1, and I saw <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/scps/about/staff/pdf/darkerwhenwet.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> paper linked. Do you have any citations that say 2 has more effect?</p></div>		</li>
