At some point they go bankrupt, and everyone is fired or goes home, but there’s still a lot of paperwork involved in shutting it all down smoothly. So you can hire a company that will do that for you. This guy had been “CEO” of hundreds and hundreds of companies as he put the dirt on their graves and made sure the groundskeeper was thanked</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a small company out of college with a couple employees.  I had won a bit of money in a competition.  Needless to say, I wasn't ready and we didn't build correctly so ran out of money before having anything to show.</p>
<p>I thought I shut down correctly, then received 2 years later a bill for $45k for not paying into workers comp for the last 2 years.  Was easy to thankfully correct, but lesson learned is don't leave things open bc someone will expect something still.  Can't even imagine the liabilities with a larger organization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lawyer here. Handled some bankruptcy law but by no means an expert. Below is some insight into how bankruptcy generally works with a few friendly analogies to help understand it.</p>
<p>To piggy back on this, the CEO or leaders are often paid their target and compensation bonuses that are due in the contract before bankruptcy is actually filed, because once bankruptcy is filed a &quot;stay,&quot; or freeze on the finances of the company is put into place. The stay is designed to put a pause  on the company's business, which includes preventing the company, its officers, and outside creditors from siphoning assets for their own benefit. </p>
<p>Think of it this way. The bankruptcy stay is like saying, &quot;okay, the cook has said he/she can't manage his/her kitchen. Between ordering ingredients, cooking and taking and fulfilling orders, he/she is in over their heads, so let's put a pause on this and focus on serving the people whom the cook has already agreed to serve lunch. Let's stop taking orders, call everyone back, tell them what's up and that they can pick up their order at noon.&quot; </p>
<p>Once the stay is in place, professionals such as lawyers and accountants review what the company has and what it owes, then creates a line of priority, like &quot;a lunch line.&quot; Creditors generally eat before shareholders, and generally the older debts are paid first. </p>
<p>Establishing priority among creditors can be a lot more complicated and exhausting. People &quot;who placed orders  might start yelling about why did you even take my order, refunds, or even demanding you also pay for the lunch they had to order from your competitor.&quot; It can get really messy. More on that later. </p>
<p>Anyway, you could think of it like creating &quot;a lunch line&quot; with the goal of &quot;using all the ingredients in the kitchen to serve as many lunches before they get cold.&quot;</p>
<p>The CEOs and leaders, like all employees, would be creditors entitled to bonuses and compensation earned to date under their employment contract. Employees seeking to collect earnings generally go near the front of the lunch line.</p>
<p>Similarly, the lawyers, accountants and professionals involved with the bankruptcy are also definitely getting eating.</p>
<p>After all, they helped &quot;get lunches out,&quot; so for policy reasons, we don't want to discourage people from helping any cook feed people, especially if he/she is in desparate need of their help.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the cook always eats last. He/she are the shareholders. The rationale is if shareholders are the ones that would benefit the most from a successful kitchen, they are also the ones that would lose the most from a failing kitchen. </p>
<p>Additionally, most bankruptcy cases are filed &quot;prepackaged,&quot; or in other words, they're created a restructuring plan to resolve outstanding debts. A prepackaged bankruptcy often includes selling assets and paying outstanding debts, like employment contract bonuses.</p>
<p>You could think of a prepackaged  bankruptcy as the case when the professionals say &quot;okay, these people are definitely gonna be in the lunch line, and there's plenty of food to serve them (because of what their priority would be in line), so let's just call them back and tell them not to worry. Then we work down the list and as we slowly run out of ingredients, let's see if, for example, the next person on the list would be happy if their turkey sandwhich they ordered didn't have lettuce, and keep moving down the list. That way, we'll have a shorter line to deal with at lunch, and, depending on the number of outstanding orders, the ingredients on hand, how much time we have before noon, we might not even have a lunch line at all. People would just show up and we give them what we agreed to give them in a quick and orderly fashion.&quot;</p>
<p>Filing prepackaged bankruptcies streamlines things so everyone can carry on with their day. You could say they just shorten the line and any fighting about who is in the line, what their spot is, and what they get. It helps avoid the worst case scenario of it becoming &quot;crows fighting over a dead carcass.&quot; </p>
<p>In other words, filing prepackaged bankruptcies make it simple and save everyone (the company, creditors, shareholders, debtors, the court and lawyers) money, i.e. &quot;the food,&quot; and time, both of which are usually precious and can be scarce in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Basically, if the bonuses are already in the CEO and other leaders' contracts, which is common, and if they earned it under the contract, which they often do, then they're lawful creditors to the company. So, like any other creditor, the lawyers typically see that they're compensated as part of the prepackaged bankruptcy before the company actually files for bankruptcy. Sticking with the analogy, &quot;they'll call them and make sure they get their turkey sandwich toasted with lettuce, tomato, and mayo, or see to it they get as near to it as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>In short, it's just a common practice for restructuring nowadays. In the final analogy, it helps make sure &quot;everyone gets what they ordered for lunch or as close to it as possible with minimal headache, so they can carry on with the rest of their day.&quot;</p>

<p>What makes everyone else so angry is the head officer knows it's coming so he/she makes sure to siphon their assets off before it's too late. It's akin to insider trading and mind boggling to see the architect of the disaster allowed to profit for a job horribly done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>JFC no. Ffs the point of bankruptcy is to enable the orderly disposition of all debts. A contract can’t weasel around a bankruptcy court just because it says, “Dibs!”</p>
<p><strong>The actual reason why CEOs still get paid</strong>:  The mission of bankruptcy is to maximize the value of a company to ensure that creditors receive the maximum possible repayment according to the rules of bankruptcy law. A company is <em>usually</em> worth more as an ongoing concern than as a pile of office chairs. (That’s why it’s better to have a Chapter <del>7</del>11 (wtf is wrong with my brain at 6:30 am?) reorganization than a Chapter <del>11</del>7 liquidation.) But it can’t remain a going concern if it stops paying payroll, utilities, etc. That’s why <em>current</em> debtors—those whose debt was incurred after bankruptcy was filed—are entitled to prompt payment while old debtors stand in line to see what they’ll collect. The old debtors aren’t needed to keep the lights on. New debtors are. That’s why employees, including CEOs, get paid. Because a company needs senior leadership to keep running and paying off debt. </p>
<p>Obviously that’s super simplified. CEOs do negotiate lots of highly questionable sweetheart deals. But the fundament reason why they get paid at all is what I explained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, new debt has a senior claim to assets over old debt which has a senior claim over equity. Losing key employees is an indirect cost of bankruptcy so the company is basically forced to pay them more to avoid a &quot;brain drain&quot; </p>
<p>Btw, you have chapter 7 and 11 backwards. 7 is liquidation, 11/13 is reorganization.</p></div>		</li>
