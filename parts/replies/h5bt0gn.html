			<div class="markdown"><p>First thing that popped into my mind as soon as I saw the question. I'm a cancer researcher, and this is the wildest story that we've ever heard. Anyone in the field of oncology knows this story very well!</p>
<p>For anyone interested in reading the actual paper/case study that was <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1505892" target="_blank">published in NEJM</a>.</p>
<p>Talk about bad luck. Eesh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That paper has such a scientifically dry way of describing (for good reason I suppose):<br />
&quot;Invasion of human tissue by abnormal, proliferating, genetically altered tapeworm cells is a novel disease mechanism that links infection and cancer.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, you would be a good person to ask.  If transplant tissue were to become cancerous (and one could somehow ascertain that the transplanted tissue was the source of the cancer), could the best treatment option for wiping out the cancer be stopping immunosuppressants?  Obviously this would create other problems for the patient, but wouldn't the immune system do a better job eradicating this type of cancer than cancer that originated from the patient's own cells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Theoretically, yes. If you were to stop the immunosuppressants, the immune system could be activated and it MAY attack the cancer. However a) you are putting the patient at significant risk of transplant rejection that could potentially kill the patient faster than any cancer would and b) cancers more often than not, have immune evasive properties of their own. So, removing immunosuppressants might not even be all that helpful. There is whole field dedicated to studying immune evasion in cancers and I am by no means an expert on it (I'm more focused on therapies).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious what happened to this patient and what treatment was like. Since it was tapeworm cancer, would antiparasitics treat the parasite and the metastasized cancer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First they thought it was a slime mold infection so the patient was receiving antifungal and HIV drugs until his kidneys failed. Meanwhile they extracted the tumor DNA and found out it was tapeworm cells but the patient died 72 hours later so there was no specific treatment for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The patient was receiving tenofovir for the treatment of HIV infection and amphotericin B for histoplasmosis, and renal failure developed. The patient declined hemodialysis, and the delivery of palliative care was begun in May 2013. A molecular diagnosis was provided 72 hours before he died, and specific treatment was not attempted.</p>
