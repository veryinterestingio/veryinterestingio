			<div class="markdown"><p>I also question the idea that we need this group of people to know about long-term effects of the vaccine, if they exist. </p>
<p>First, it's only one year that separates them from the rest of people that are beginning to be vaccinated right now. Second, I struggle imagining that they all will develop symptoms <em>one year exactly</em> before the rest of the population. Lots of variance in people's bodies, so it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect 20-30 years from now, some people vaccinated today may develop these hypothetical problems before the trial groups vaccinated earlier this year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that you can still use time series variation to study the long term effects even if 100% of the population is in treatment. Sure, you wonâ€™t be able to attribute it to the vaccine with certainty but you can still say something.</p></div>		</li>
