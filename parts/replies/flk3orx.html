			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually the opposite. Infiltration through soil will generally increase the salinity of rain water. Our bodies need salt and minerals, that's why spring water tastes so good to us. It'll never get salty like ocean salty - that is the result of millions of years of low salinity water flowing into the ocean, then pure water being evaporated, leaving saltier and saltier water behind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick dirty google search seems to say thay that isnt particularly true.</p>
<p>Your logic is sound, but you also have to factor in that we have had several salt flats occur, taking (prolly) hundreds of millions, if not billions of tons of salt out of the immediate ocean.</p>
<p>Some sites said that the ocean used to be twice as salty as it is now, others say the opposite, but im done pooping at work, so thats the end of my detective work.</p>
<p>Edit - Should mention that there are almost certainly different processes that remove salt, but I am far too much of a layman to know those processes in any real depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of springs, it really depends on the geology of the spring.  Some are fresh water but there have been countless brine springs that have been valuable sources of salt throughout history.  If such a spring was found people would exploit them by drilling pipes in and driving water underground and then they'd capture the brine water that escaped.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, though it’s worth remembering that there are also Earth processes which <em>remove</em> salts from the oceans and that we are pretty much in a stable rate of influx v outflux for all the salts at the moment. This equilibrium has been the case for several million years, probably the last significant change of major dissolved ions was the post-Mesozoic rise in the Mg/Ca ratio, from around 66 million years ago. </p>
<p>It’s thought that the earliest oceans on Earth were actually a <em>lot</em> saltier than today’s, due to the lack of evaporative basins which subsequently became isolated from the oceans (ie. removed large amounts of salts). These only cane about with the formation of continental landmasses, a while later than oceans in the broad history of the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is more salty than rainwater.  less salty than ocean.   rainwater GATHERS salt from the ground by dissolving it.  then that barely salty water runs downhill all the way to the ocean, taking the salt with it.   that's why the ocean is salty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is misleading. Aquifers are not typically formed in cavities in the ground. In fact, it is very rare to have cavities in the ground.     </p>
<p>A better way of thinking of aquifers is “wet dirt”.   Rain water seeps into the ground through soil, but it can’t keep seeping down forever. If it hits bedrock or a layer of soil that has a lot of clay in it, then the water will pind and stop seeping down, resulting in all the soil above the bedrock/clay becoming soaking wet.  The water can slowly seep sideways too, wetting all the dirt around it. It can take a long time, but eventually this groundwater can travel over great distances.   </p>
<p>A spring happens when you have an aquifer (wet dirt) sandwiched between two clay layers. The water can’t go anywhere except sideways since it can’t move through the clay.   So you might be in an area that doesnt get a whole lot of rain or snowmelt, but it has an aquifer sandwiched between clay, and the water has traveled a great distance.    Now, if you dug a hole that breaks through the top clay layer, your hole will fill up with water.   If the pressure is high enough, it could even become an artesian well, which means the water will bubble up right to the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also like to add that groundwater can move very slowly through cracks and pores in rock, but they have to be connected to each other, and it can take a very long time.  Rarely are there actual cavernous underground rivers and reservoirs (though it is possible)</p></div>		</li>
