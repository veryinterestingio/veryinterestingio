			<div class="markdown"><p>This. And this is the same reason why we don’t have it for humans. We simply don’t care enough to make it happen. If you were willing to donate hundred of millions or maybe billions to it. Then it will happen. Otherwise, the benefits simply are too small to justify the costs, which can be used elsewhere more effectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it just isnt worth it (not in terms of money) to vaccinate humans here.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it cant spread human to human</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>very few people get infected anyway</p>
</li>
<li>any vaccine WILL have side-effects</li>
</ul>
<p>reason 2+3 together mean that if you vaccinate everyone against salmonella you might end up with side-effects causing more harm or roughly equal amounts of harm as the salmonella.</p>
<p>while if we &quot;destroy&quot; the virus in chickens then it cant spread between them, cant spread to us and we have no negative side-effects. so there the &quot;money-saving is bad&quot; argument definitely holds true.</p></div>		</li>
