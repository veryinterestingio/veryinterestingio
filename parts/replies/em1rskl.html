In the US, the officer does not need to follow you for evidence. The radar is sufficient. The calibration of the radar SHOULD be checked daily and, ideally, after every speeding citation.</p>
<p>I say SHOULD because many officers just don't do it. If you fancy taking a speeding ticket to court, I'd say challenge the calibration and testing the calibration of the radar unit. Make the officer prove that it was done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a ticket, went and filed to get a whole punch of stuff about the radar and calibrations and such.  Prosecutor meet with me before hand and just dropped the speed down so it wouldn't add any point to license. I never had to go to actual court and I got what I wanted out of it.  To file the request for paperwork cost me the same as the amount saved by them lowering my speed.  So in the end the cost didn't decrease, but insurance not knowing about it due to no points saved in the long run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never understood how radar can ever be admissible as evidence, especially the dash-mounted type. Even if the device is calibrated, there is still no way to affirmatively tell which object is moving at the indicated speed.</p>
<p>Laser is a little more definitive, but I heard a story a while back of somebody getting out of a laser citation because the beam still is conical and at the distance sighted could plausibly have picked up the vehicle behind him.</p></div>		</li>
