			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to add onto the Sears and Toys-R-Us situation because you leave it sort of open as to whether their owners were trying to bankrupt the business when they very clearly were not.</p>
<p>What happened in both the Sears and Toys-R-Us situation was that Sears/Toys-R-Us were going to go bankrupt.  But before filing for bankruptcy those companies negotiated with their creditors to see if they could privately come up with a deal that would let the companies continue to function.</p>
<p>The deal that they ultimately came up with in both cases was that a PE firm refinanced all of the company's debt.  Or in other words - the PE firm paid off billions of dollars in debt that the companies held.  The PE firm then took on new debt equal to the amount that they paid off, but with terms that extended when payments on the debt was due.</p>
<p>Corporate debt doesn't work like consumer debt where you pay off a fixed amount each month until the debt has been fully paid off.  Corporate debt works by the company paying a very small amount of money every 3-4 months as interest.  Then at the end of the loan's term they pay the <em>entire principle</em> of the loan off in one big chunk.</p>
<p>So say that I'm a company that borrows $100 at 1% interest with over 10 years.  Every 3 months I pay 25 cents in interest.  Then 10 years after I took the money out I have to make a single $100 payment, at which point the loan is repaid.  If I can't make that $100 payment on the exact date it is due 10 years from now then I need to declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Sears and Toys-R-Us were in a situation where they were at the end of their 10 years and couldn't come up with the $100 to pay off the loan, so the PE firm did it for them in exchange for new debt that was due in another 10 years.</p>
<p>But the PE firm isn't refinancing the debt for free - in exchange for taking the risk of refinancing billions of dollars in high risk loans it takes a controlling ownership interest in the company.</p>
<p>In order for this to happen the pre-existing owners of the company have to agree to it.  The reason they agree to it is that if they don't then their ownership interest in the company is worthless anyways because the company will have to immediately declare bankruptcy.  By turning over control to the PE firm the existing owners are buying time until that happens and giving the company a real chance to return to profitability.</p>
<p>The PE firm has no incentive to drive the company into bankruptcy either - although they're paid out first during the bankruptcy they still lose the vast majority of the money they invested into the company if it goes bankrupt.  PE firms would much rather have their ownership interest in a healthy, functional company than to be the principle creditor in the bankruptcy of a dead one.</p></div>		</li>
