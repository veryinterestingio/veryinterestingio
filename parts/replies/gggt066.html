			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, the forces that cause the sticking consist of two different types. The first is London forces which arise from the fact that electrons move within atoms and molecules and due to this movement can sometimes find themselves closer or further to one end of the molecule, this creates a temporary charge imbalance and the molecule will have a more negative end and more positive end. Again this is only a very temporary phenomenon and the dipole changes orientation constantly. All the molecules in a substance will have dipoles and attract neighbouring molecules much like nearby magnets will attract one another. </p>
<p>The second is called Permanent Dipole Dipole Interaction (DPPI). This is where some atoms attract electrons more strongly than other atoms. Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Fluorine attract electrons the most and can form a very strong type of DPPI called hydrogen bonds, as you find in water. The fact that some atoms attract electrons more than others can mean that in a molecule such as water where one end has an oxygen atom and the other has two hydrogen atoms the electrons cluster around the oxygen atom and create a permanent dipole in the molecule. This dipole attracts neighbouring molecules in the same way as above.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>One thing I didn't mention that might be important is that London forces can sustain themselves for a short while because if two temporary dipoles act one one another then the positive end of one atom will pull the electrons from the other keeping them at the near end and vice versa, the negative end of the one atom will push electrons away keeping them at the far end and sustain the dipole</p></div>		</li>
