<p>TL;DR - The &quot;kind of drunk&quot; you get from alcohol has to do with the mood and environment in which you consume it rather than the source of the alcohol itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that regard, alcohol isn't so different from psychedelics, where what matters are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_and_setting" target="_blank">set and setting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, the drug dose does not produce the transcendent experience. It merely acts as a chemical key — it opens the mind, frees the nervous system of its ordinary patterns and structures. The nature of the experience depends almost entirely on set and setting. Set denotes the preparation of the individual, including his personality structure and his mood at the time. Setting is physical — the weather, the room's atmosphere; social — feelings of persons present towards one another; and cultural — prevailing views as to what is real. (Timothy Leary)</p>

<p>There are over 300 compounds in tequila. There is far more at play than placebo, set and setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many of those compounds act upon the central nervous system in a meaningful way? Which, if any, of those compounds alter the effects of ethanol on the body?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terpenes are very well known to have psychoactive effects, like myrcene which is a sedative and anti inflammatory.   Alpha-pinene is a known pain relieve and anaesthetic.  Alcohol is loaded with these and there are hundreds of them.</p>
<p>The tiny varying amounts of other alcohols like isopropyl will also change the way you feel and react.</p>
<p>Saccharides effect the way we feel, our moods and brain chemistry.</p>
<p>Alcohol fermentation leads to some wild chemical concoctions.  Beers have tons of terps coming from the hops and additives.  Tequila gets its from the agave, while vodka is almost tasteless because grain has fewer and less variety of these compounds.</p></div>		</li>
