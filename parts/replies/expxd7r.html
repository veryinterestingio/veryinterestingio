			<div class="markdown"><p>Are a majority of the fires intentional? I realize that the year-to-year data is substantially different, but what about over the course of the last 25 years - is this year still an anomaly or is there any sort of trend?</p>
<p>Also, since it seems that these are mostly intentional for economic proposes, is this why we haven't seen any international involvement?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't something I've studied in depth, but as far as international responses I did see a news report yesterday that Germany and Norway were withdrawing millions of dollars in aid funding.</p>
<p>As far as whether fires are, and have been, set deliberately, I imagine that can be really hard to verify in many cases. Natural wildfires do of course happen, often caused by lightning strikes, but given that we have a long and well documented history of Brazilian and international companies wanting to suck the country dry of its resources, and so many documented accounts of mining companies (among others) carrying out awful murder strikes against indigenous populations, it's not hard to believe that what's happening now is pretty much more of the same, except much more than usual due to Brazil having a President who very clear about his contempt for the environment and those who want to protect it.</p>
<p>Probably wouldn't hurt to look around for Twitter accounts (as a starting point) belonging to Brazilian and other environmental activists. They're going to be the ones, often as not, who have the latest on-the-ground news and updates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the sheer number of fires this year is absolutely unprecedented</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have a source for this that is not one of the numerous articles claiming this without stating they are using data that only dates back <strong>six years</strong>?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>INPE monitors from 2013. The <a href="https://ipam.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NT-Fogo-Amazo%CC%82nia-2019.pdf" target="_blank">IPAM</a> report, with data from INPE, is unambiguous.</p>
<p>MODIS has data dating further back. You would be right that the <em>fire alerts</em> are not &quot;unprecedented&quot;: <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2019/08/satellite-images-from-planet-reveal-devastating-amazon-fires-in-near-real-time/" target="_blank">https://news.mongabay.com/2019/08/satellite-images-from-planet-reveal-devastating-amazon-fires-in-near-real-time/</a></p>
<p>At the end of the day, neither fact detracts from the environmental destruction that is happening.</p></div>		</li>
