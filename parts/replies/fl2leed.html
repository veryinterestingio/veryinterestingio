			<div class="markdown"><p>They are different. &quot;Spectral analysis&quot; would probably refer to techniques such as near infrared spectroscopy, where light of different wavelengths is shined onto a sample and the absorbance measured. Different compounds absorb slightly different wavelengths of light so the composition can be determined from the spectrum. </p>
<p>A Mass Spectrometer uses a different method where the product is put through a reaction to create charged molecules, then different solvents and magnetic/electric fields are used to determine the mass from the time it takes to go through the equipment. All this information is used to infer the composition. </p>
<p>They both have their pros and cons but they are fundamentally different techniques. NIR is a quick and easy method but isn't as detailed as Mass Spec. Data collected via Mass Spec and other bench methods would be used to calibrate an NIR for most commercial purposes, since Mass Spec is much more expensive (since it requires trained technicians to get any sort of useful data).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that work with cooking?</p>
<p>If you have, for example, oil and potatoes, and you make french fries, is the total calories the same before <em>and</em> after cooking, even though some of the potato has changed?</p>
<p>(assuming you ate all the potato and all the oil)</p></div>		</li>
