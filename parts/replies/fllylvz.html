“Why do bats carry so many dangerous diseases?”</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/iJ2jDPgvbTY" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/iJ2jDPgvbTY</a></p>
<p>It’s fascinating. From what I recall: bats have a hyperactive immune system because they don’t have much inflammation because it would affect their flight. So this coronavirus evolved to survive in bats, but when it infects us, our immune systems go into overdrive because they struggle a lot more. So it’s the immune system response to the virus that ultimately kills people in this case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Considering the complexity and the enormous gaps in our knowledge, I bet immunologists will be able to do some truly strange things in 100 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yeah, but to be fair if we talk about who developed it first, fish had a 500 million year head start on humans.  Personally I think the cooler thing is just how much of our immune system (and everything else) we inherited from our fishy ancestors.  In fact, who developed it first is moot, modern fish and humans inherited it from the same common ancestor around the same time we invented jaws.  So in fact &quot;we&quot; developed it at the same time as fish, because that's just who we were back then.</p>
<p>A nerdy but fun read on the evolution of our immune system can be found here:  </p>
<p>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3805090</p>
<p>Or for a layman friendly tale tracing our common ancestors back up the family tree try The Ancestor's Tale by Richard Dawkins and Yan Wong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The common information being given out is that a person who believes they are or maybe be infected because of where they were or who they were with should wait 14 days to see of symptoms to appear.  If they don't appear by then, they probably will not.</p>
<p>If symptoms appear, then the person should wait 10 days from the onset of symptoms or 72 hours after the last time they had an elevated temperature (without taking drugs to control it), whichever is LATER.  This is regardless of when they believe they were infected</p>
<p>A carrier this was asymptomatic would probably have the same immunity (at least 1 to 2 years for this strain).  However, it's possible they weren't a carrier at all, and there's no commonly available test at this time to show that you DID have the virus but no longer DO have it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to that question is the same as the one to the OP. Likely yes unless research shows evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>Carriers of most other viral diseases, like the common cold or the flu, usually develop immunities afterwards, the immune system still works the same as in people with symptoms.</p>
<p>So probably yes until further research. </p>
<p>Remember, this is a new virus, we can't know everything about it immediately. Scientists are gonna need some time to completely understand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Viruses can mutate. Influenza mutates so much that the need for yearly vaccines is needed. Sars-cov is a slow mutating virus. Not sure but i believe there are currently 2 mutations right now? Rumor? Please correct me if im wrong! So there may be more than just 1 vaccine when it comes available.</p></div>		</li>
