<p>EDIT: whoops. I read &quot;gravitational&quot;, &quot;lensing&quot; and assumed we were talking about lensing of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I would say the reverse: the graviton would have to be massless because the gravitational force is long range and propagates at the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theoretical reasoning for gravitational waves propagating at the speed of light is from general relativity, which is a classical theory, which means quantum mechanics, and specifically gravitons, dont come into the reasoning here.</p>
<p>Instead in general relativity there are the Einstein Field Equations, which are basically the central equation to GR. It describes how energy and mass (and pressure and stress) curve spacetime. </p>
<p>There are particular solutions to this equation called vaccuum solutions, which are when the energy and mass is zero. Solutions here are how spacetime can be curved when there is &quot;nothing&quot; there.</p>
<p>For example, flat space, no curvature, is one solution.  This solution is called the Minkowski metric.</p>
<p>Another is space in the vicinity of a non rotating, uncharged black hole. This is still a vacuum solution because other than at the singularity, there is no mass or anything in space. This is called the Schwarzschild metric. If the black hole is rotating, you get the Kerr metric, which is a lot more complicated. </p>
<p>You can get another vacuum solution by taking flat empty space and perturb it slightly. By assuming the change is small, you can simplify the equations and what comes out is a wave equation, similar to the wave equation for electromagnetic fields. Like all wave equations, the speed of the wave can be easily derived, and you get c, the speed of light. (Note: not all wave equations in physics have the same speed. It's just that in the wave equation, there is a coefficient that is directly related to the speed of the wave. In both the electromagnetic and GR case, that speed is the speed of light)</p>
<p>For EM fields, you take Maxwells equations, assume no charge or currents, and you can derive a wave equation. The same is true here, only you use the Einstein Field Equations, assume no mass or energy, and you also have to do a lot of simplifying.</p></div>		</li>
