			<div class="markdown"><p>The 16 year old NASA article claims it'll be on top of the geographic north pole in 2030, while current articles (<a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-02-compass-magnetic-north-pole.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-02-compass-magnetic-north-pole.html" target="_blank">https://phys.org/news/2019-02-compass-magnetic-north-pole.html</a></a>) claim it's on the way to Siberia. Other articles from NASA seem to indicate we're due for a reversal. (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-poleReversal.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-poleReversal.html" target="_blank">https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-poleReversal.html</a></a>) but NASA also predicts that in 100 years, due to the magnetic field losing 5% strength per year, we're going to have nothing left.

<p>To summarize: I don't think anyone really truly knows what's going on. (On a side note; Can't say I've ever seen a government scientific article written in comic sans...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Third link says the magnetic field is currently reducing by 5% every 100 years, not every year, and indicates that the field regenerates its strength relatively quickly (sometimes in less than 10000 years.) I'm curious what effects would occur on our equipment and bodies from a weakened magnetic field due to solar flares and such not being impeded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The third link provided by that guy ends with saying it's 5% every hundred years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presently, Earth's magnetic field is weakening in strength by 5% every 100 years. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In it, there is also an explanation that Earth's magnetic field weakens until &quot;zero&quot;, then bounces back up, increasing rapidly in strength over tens / hundreds of thousands of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think when 2 magnets (earth and compass) are in proximity the smaller magnet with rotate so the magnetic fields align, thus the poles align. End to End the opposite poles attract, because that causes the fields to align again.  End to End Like poles repel because the fields are not aligned.</p></div>		</li>
