			<div class="markdown"><p>autism with tourette's is the weirdest. I don't know what is a stim and what is a tic because I have a hard time processing anxiety or uncomfortableness, so everything feels like a stim when some things are tics, I just don't know because I don't feel anxious to do it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most bodily functions have a “satisfying” effect when they’re completed successfully, and a discomfort if they aren’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To go into a little more depth on a topic I've always found quite interesting:</p>
<p>As I understand it, these effects are described as being (or at least being a part of) positive and negative 'feedback loops' in physiology. When your body knows that something needs to be removed (such as irritants or waste), a feeling of discomfort occurs to try to force you to do the thing that will get rid of the substance. Then you get a little reward for doing the thing.</p>
<p>Knowing that you're going to get a reward, in turn, makes you more likely to do the thing promptly, which is good for your overall health.</p>
<p>In the case of waste especially, the discomfort continues to become more and more intense until waste elimination finally happens. Your body doesn't want your bladder to rupture, after all!</p>
<p>The discomfort of an interrupted sneeze does seem to go away relatively quickly, but I suspect that this is because sneezing usually isn't as urgently necessary as getting rid of waste.</p>
<p>Itching works this way too; you itch when there is an irritant present, and this is a survival mechanism. While most day-to-day sources of itches are just nuisances, there are some that can be very dangerous, so itching is your body's way of making sure to try to keep the dangerous ones away. (In terms of survival, it's almost always better to spend little/no energy on being a little <em>too</em> cautious than to do nothing at all. Those in the evolutionary tree who tended towards 'do nothing at all' behavior are dead.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your body doesn't really know the difference between a troublesome bit of dirt and, say, a mosquito bite... so it keeps wanting you to get rid of the irritant of the mosquito bite even though you can't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I read (probably on reddit) that mosquitos inject an anesthetic and an anticoagulant to be able to drink in peace and get away before you feel anything. And the anticoagulant is what causes the itching later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also may help with detecting infection.  It's keeping your attention on it, so if something goes out of whack you'll potentially catch it early enough to do something about it.</p>
<p>That's potentially really useful when it comes to parasites that embed themselves in you as well, like ticks and botflies.  Catching those early can make a big difference.</p></div>		</li>

Once was because I was heading out to the doctors office and I stopped to go, then I remembered mid stream that I absolutely HAD to take a urine test right when I got there because it was late and their lab was going to close.</p></div>		</li>
