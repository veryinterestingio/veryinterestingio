			<div class="markdown"><p>During the Carboniferous Period atmospheric oxygen was close to 35%.  According to the second paper I cited above, above 30% oxygen even plant matter with an 80% moisture content (!) will burn.  Today, a green, living forest needs to be extremely hot to burn, and even then it normally burns slowly.  Back then, not so much, even in rainforests and swamps.  Millions of years ago there were some epic fires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing had evolved to eat lignin so nothing rotted. There were massive piles of dead plants, which is where coal came from. And since these things have evolved now  coal isn't being produced.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coal <em>is</em> being produced, just not as much.</p>
<p>Biomass can be sequestered in other ways that are still active to this day. e.g. peat bogs. Over time, peat will turn into lignite coal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that wood-rotting organisms (fungus?) were responsible for breaking down dead trees and plants before termites came along.<br />
There was however a period prior to this where no organisms to break down the wood/plant matter existed and it just accumulated on the forrest floor, eventually being buried by dirt and other plant matter. Fast forward a few million(?) years and this plant matter is now known as oil deposits which we turn into fuel.  </p>
<p>Edit: It makes coal not oil, thanks to other redditors who know better than me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ummm. No. Buried plant material does not produce oil. Coal is formed when plant material is buried in a reducing environment. Oxidation prevents the formation of peat (which, with further burial, becomes lignite and coal).  Oil is formed when kerogen derived from algal material is buried.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Termites can't break down lignin themselves, they rely on symbiotic fungi (<em>termitomyces</em>). Fungi remain the primary group responsible for breaking down lignin and cycling back wood into the food chain (some bacteria can also do it, but less completely and efficiently).</p></div>		</li>
