			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the superconductors is made thicker that should lower the gradient of the magnetic field. Would that raise the threshold of permissible current density? Also what if the superconductor's geometry is that of a thin walled pipe. With sufficiently large OD could we get away with small overall mass (per unit of length)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An actual condensed matter physicist can probably give you a better answer, but in regards to your first the critical current is proportional to the radius of the wire so making it thicker will allow you to pass more current through it without quenching the superconductor. Everything else I am uncertain of. I imagine if you made the geometry of the superconducting material a hollow pipe the magnetic field inside the &quot;pipe&quot; would muck things up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The magnetic field produced by the current is only one factor. You also have vortex lattice flow to deal with. That just depends on the actual current density flowing through the wire, not magnetic fields around it. For this purpose you can sometimes actually want to intentionally add defects into a superconductor to pin the vortex lattice and prevent it from moving (and dissipating energy). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of dissipation, could a coil or coils be used as an energy storing device? We take a close loop superconductor, induce current flow and that stores energy in it, which could then (presumably) be extracted through interaction with another coil (with a useful resistive load in series) by means of magnetic field generated by the superconducting coil. If that were the case, what energy densities would be achievable? Anything in the realm of making the contraption useful? Since there's no such thing in existence yet, I presume the answer might be 'no', but then again, why?</p>
