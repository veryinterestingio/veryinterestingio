<p>This is clearly demonstrated when you see fights where one fighter gets a surprise blow </p>

<p>This is super obvious with body shots.  Yeah, if you see them coming you can absorb them pretty well.  When you get caught with one you didn't see its a fight ender.  Source:  Did Amateur boxing for about 6 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why heavy weight fights are much slower.  The consequences of a unexpected blow are much greater when the guy throwing it is a monster.   When I boxed I weighted 225-235 during training but come fight day I made sure I was down to 200 so I could fight as a cruiserweight.  I fought a couple heavy weight fights and when the other guy outweighs you by 50lbs you have to be a much better fighter then the other guy to even stand a chance (at heavy weight I lost 2 won 1)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree.</p>
<p>I did snowboarding for like 10 years and got pretty good at it.</p>
<p>When I started, falling from almost still was enough to make me consider quitting, the pain was enormous. 10 years later I could fail a 10+ meter jump and end with no scratch. There is so much you can do to absorb and mitigate, even the way you exhale while taking a hit can make the difference between a broken rib and feeling nothing</p></div>		</li>
