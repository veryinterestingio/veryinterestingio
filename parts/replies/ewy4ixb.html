			<div class="markdown"><p>This is relatively accurate and I'm sure varies coast to coast. I grew up in interior BC logging town and have seen my fair share of tree planters.</p>
<p>Generally the most typical hippy people, probably some overlap with the &quot;toque and dog&quot; crowd.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible some of these people tree plant in the warm months turn go on EI for the winter and snowboard/ski.</p></div>		</li>
