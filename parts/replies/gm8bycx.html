Each successively younger group is treated with increasing caution, with under 5-year-olds being treated very carefully. That’s not necessarily because they’re more susceptible to problems, but because problems in children are perceived as worse than the same issue in an older person. (You can justify it as years of quality of life affected, but I don’t think it needs to be spelled out. No one wants to harm children.)</p>
<p>So working down those increments is going to take time. Especially since the perceived need for vaccination of very young children is low (while there are certainly serious outcomes, they’re far less common than in older people), I wouldn’t expect a big rush to test age groups under 5.  It will come eventually, but hopefully before that there will be widespread vaccination in adults and the virus circulation will be much lower anyway. </p>
<p>(Of course, if virus circulation is low, clinical trials will take longer too - the main reason the clinical trials so far have gone so fast is the widespread infection meant they could quickly hit their goals. It’s conceivable that the vaccines could be approved based on safety trials plus correlates of protection once those are available, but this is just speculation.).</p></div>		</li>

<p>FDA has predefined ranges for pediatrics, but it's not broken down that far.  Just &quot;children&quot; 2-17, infants at 1 month to 2 years, and neonates below that.  It doesnt mean you're forced to test the full range of any population,  but the requirements for the subset of subjects that fall in any category will have some different testing requirements.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for medical device the age range for pediatrics goes up to 21.  Don't know why.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Given the evidence that suggests that newborns have COVID antibodies passed on by their mothers,the push to test younger kids will likely lessen over time too.    Obviously we don't know how effective those antibodies are or how long they last but much about how this thing seems to suggest that even the smallest &quot;head start&quot; given to the immune system hugely diminishes the severity of the disease.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So our very youngest will also start to have increased protections.  This isn't much help if you've already been born, but to some extent protection is coming from both directions of the age spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s important to note that none of the vaccines being used are currently FDA approved at this point.  They are only authorized for use under the Emergency Use Authorization act, outside of clinical trials, until such time the complete FDA approval, or there is no longer a public benefit from them being authorized.  Right now the main public benefit is for older individuals who have exponentially more risk as the age increases, basically it’s statistically not important for younger people to get this vaccine at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydroxychloroquine was approved under EUA. The EUA was revoked when it was determined to be ineffective. </p>
<p>I am just guessing here... but an EUA would <em>probably</em> be revoked if there was no longer a public health emergency. I don't think we will see that here for the 2 big vaccines because they will probably have full approval before the pandemic is over. It might happen if a few more vaccines become authorized to fill the gaps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are missing an important element of public health by withholding the fact that young school-aged people are the main carriers of typical viruses that infect and seriously harm or even kill the more susceptible and vulnerable people, such as the flu. In fact, it could be argued that we are approaching this whole thing backwards and should be vaccinating those most likely to spread covid instead of those most vulnerable to it. I’m sure many data models have been drawn out to see where mortality drops and they likely chose to protect mortality at the expense of higher infection rates, but we know that covid has long term effects even in asymptomatic ppl so what the hell.</p>
<p>Tl;dr whose to say who benefits the most from the vaccine currently?</p>
<p>Edit: just so we stay within the scope of my post, I’m modeling my statement behind who should we vaccinate not as a blanket catch-all in all cases but as a thought of why and who we typically prefer to vaccinate to prevent spread of typical pathogens. I recognize the arms of the current studies conducted by the respective companies and nih were reviewing efficacy based on ability to prevent moderate to severe disease and the limitations of data gathered there, and that we have limited info on how a vaccinated population affects transmission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vaccine isn't even studied for halting transmission or even infection by the virus. Its emergency approval and research is for a 95% reduction in severe symptoms. Giving it to younger populations first would have us just crossing our fingers that maybe it happens to stop the spread. Going for high risk individuals and the older population is the right move since those people are most likely to have severe symptoms.</p></div>		</li>
