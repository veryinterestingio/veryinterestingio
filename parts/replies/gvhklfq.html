			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story:</p>
<p>I was traveling around once and stopped in Moscow for a few days. I have always been fascinated with Russia and was very excited to be there.</p>
<p>I was walking around Moscow Smiling and grinning and greeting people and most definitely noticed that I was not being received very well. Everyone looked at me funny and avoided eye contact or avoided me. </p>
<p>I was pretty bummed about this. I asked my host about it and he told me people dont smile because it is seen as &quot;suspicious.&quot; I think he also said that it is an unfortunate thing that started in Soviet times when everyone was suspicious of eachother and the secret police. Also that there was nothing to smile about.</p>
<p>I thought it was going to be a lonley stay in Russia That is, until I started drinking with some visitors. I matched every shot they had and shared some great stories with them. We drank from sundown to sun up.</p>
<p>I think they were surprised I was so eager - and able - to drink with them likey they usually did.</p>
<p>Great times. Things became fun at that point. Except for my travel mates who did not drink and didnt like me drinking either. Not to mention one night of heavy drinking (two whole bottles of vodka and only picked fish as a chaser) was followed by a lengthy walking tour of Moscow in the summer sun.</p></div>		</li>
