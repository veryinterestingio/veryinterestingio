			<div class="markdown"><p>That's only a receiver. I don't think you'd be allowed to use a sufficiently powerful radio transmitter on an airliner.</p>
<p>You could plug the rtlsdr into your laptop during cruise and record the telemetry of your own flight, but that just makes another black box. If you have onboard wifi, you could probably stream it to the cloud (not sure if that's legal though).</p></div>		</li>

<p>ADS-B</p>

<p>But ADS-B isn't what a black box records. ADS-B transmits flight positional information, speed, heading, etc. and is used to show the nearby flights on CDTI.<br />
The black box records two things, flight data, and voice from the cockpit. It's often the voice that's the thing that helps piece together an accident, as you can hear pilot and co pilot communicating during an emergency. Flight data helps to figure out what control were being used, how the plane was reacting to those signals, etc.<br />
Certainly knowing where a plane was going and when it disappeared from view is helpful, but it's not what a FDR records.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about this issue after hearing about another airplane crash and how beneficial the audio would be. Unfortunately the necessary bandwidth for audio is too much. But then I thought the aircraft could be fitted with some speech to text technology. That stuff is getting pretty good. Text files are a fraction of the file size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not necessarily real time needed.  highly compressed and encrypted bursts would suffice for a voice record capture.  potentially the current sat phone constellation would work, potentially might. need additional capacity.
another potentially available are the internet satellites, probably better than the sat phone.  several US carriers already have Internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct.  It should also be noted that &quot;flight data&quot; contains all variables that the Flight Management System (FMS) is using for calculations.  This is a staggering amount of data being captured on the millisecond level.  This not only includes their GPS and the position of the flight surfaces, but also data moving through thousands of sensors, such as pitot tubes, engine temps and pressures, and radar and other aircraft tracks.  The Black Box itself doesn't hold data for a long period of time but must overwrite it after a fixed period because it's so large.  For a central database to hold all this information for all aircraft real time would not be feasible at this time in our technological development.  It would take something like the entire Microsoft Cloud to achieve this, with a vast amount of bandwidth for transfer.  This is not only due to the vast amounts of data being collected, but the vast amounts of flights each day.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While ADS-B transmits some data like aircraft position, it by no means transmits all the complex data that a flight data recorder does. The &quot;black box&quot; is there to capture many parameters with a higher rate so that small details can be observed. As others have pointed out an ACARS system is more akin to broadcasting actual aircraft system data, but it too does not have the bandwidth to transmit that much data that rapidly.</p></div>		</li>
