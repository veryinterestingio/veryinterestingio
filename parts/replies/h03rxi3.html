<p>I think I would prefer discovered over invented.  </p>
<p>I'm too long out of school to remember enough to know where one might draw the line between basic and advanced,  but lots of this stuff goes pretty far back into 1000s of years BC.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The fact that the tools we invented (math) describe the world accurately (~ thanks to physics) doesn't make it anything less than an invented tool. We never ever looked at nature and discovered numbers or functions in it : we invented mathematical representations of the things we saw in nature and managed to make them accurate enough to somehow predict their evolution.</p>
<p>Lets take an example of basic mechanics to illustrate my point : you SEE a metal ball falling from a certain height, its speed is increasing as the fall continues, you suppose this is linked to its weight (you're a genius and just intuited Newton's second law). Then you INVENT a mathematical description of the relevant parameters using measures (measures are clearly invented, we never &quot;found&quot; an object of 1kg) of them : </p>
<p>-mass &quot;m&quot; in kg of the metal ball</p>
<p>-weight &quot;w&quot; equal to m times a constant called &quot;g&quot;</p>
<p>-position &quot;h&quot; in meters from the original position</p>
<p>-how fast it's falling : speed &quot;v&quot; in meters per second</p>
<p>-how fast the speed is increasing : acceleration &quot;a&quot; in m.s^-2</p>
<p>-time since the beginning of the fall in second &quot;t&quot;</p>
<p>You suppose ma=mg =&gt; a=g. The tool we invented to describe the link between a and v is the derivative and primitive, and same for v and h, so we apply these tools to a and find that : v=gt+0 , h=(1/2)g(t^2 )+0. Now we can measure stuff, verify our hypothesis and that our tools work. All the stuff we measure is not a discovery, it is not the reality, just representations of it, wether they are accurate or not will never change this.</p>
<p>Saying we discovered math implies that it describes the intrinsic nature of reality, there is a debate on that point. (But it is the most constringent so the weight of proof falls on people defending that point.) This debate became relevant with the birth of quantum physics, but not with what we were talking about (calculus, geometry, mechanics...).</p></div>		</li>

<p>actually I didn't realize it when I made my statement, but apparently invented vs discovered it is a long running debate over the centuries.  As it is a philosophical issue whose answer varies with context, I'll have to agree with better educated people than myself that it is some of both.  From my quick reading seems to come down to</p>
<p>Invented: Math is a language, and like any other language, a creation of man, that is used to describe nature</p>
<p>Discovered:  describing nature is not inventing nature. Isaac Newton didn't invent gravity.  He discovered a way to describe gravity.  Or another example, the relationship of a radius to the circumference of a circle was not invented, but rather discovered.   </p>
<p>I'm in over my head and I'm sure I'm not doing justice to either side of the long running debate.</p></div>		</li>
