			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy, just imagine some dark future dystopia where there's a commercial market for purchasing cloned copies of your enemies' consciousnesses so that you can inflict torture and humiliation to them at will, while the enemies' &quot;real&quot; selves walk around in the real world totally indifferent, probably to later come home and do the same to their personal collection of enemies. Kinda like if The Purge and Minority Report had a Black Mirror baby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Locked in is my worst nightmare too, but that is just motor loss. M I doubt a reasoning conscience could persist for long without ANY sensory input. It would be the craziest trip any psychonaut has ever taken. One day, once the singularity happens, people may recreationally “brain in a vat” trip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean...would it be all the different from dreaming?</p>
<p>I don't ever remember feeling the blankets on my skin or the sound of my fan in my dream. I know the brain is still processing input but it seems irrelevant in the dream. </p>
<p>The only input the brain in a jar would receive is its own thoughts. It's like a feedback loop at that point. </p>
<p>People are saying that it would be horrifying and maybe they are right. But, it might not be. It might possibly be freeing in a sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>[Obligatory &quot;<em>I'm not a medic</em>&quot; is obligatory]</p>
<p>When dreaming, your brain turns off some switches, but you're still alive and receiving feedback from everywhere in your body. In a jar, your brain will also <em>not</em> receive all the feedback from those everywhere: there's no breathing, no pulse, no equilibrium, no heat [have you ever woken up because it's too cold?]. The body has many panic switches that sends immediate responses when any of those fail, imagine being trapped in your thoughts as you try to breathe, but there are no lungs to get that signal.</p>
<p>You don't die nor lose consciousness because the jar keeps you alive, but the brain is receiving a constant &quot;lung not working&quot; emergency error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have chronic back pain from a severe spinal injury.  When I lay still for too long my mid back below my shoulder blades starts to hurt and if I lay long enough like that it gets really really bad.    </p>
<p>When I'm tired enough I can sleep through the pain but every time that happens I can feel the pain in my back in my dreams.</p></div>		</li>
