			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always loved this aspect of running events. It's different than scoring a personal high in a basketball game or other sports where so many more variables (including own and opposing team strengths and strategies) impact your performance. In track and field, it's a competition for medals sure, but also a competition with the clock and yourself. It adds a different dimension to a &quot;good loss.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer seems the most correct, it considers the psychological aspects within the race. The first paragraph lays out the most common 4x4 strategy. There are multiple other ways to run the this race strategically. My favorite was: 1-the consistent runner, 2-the hunter or the big guy, 3-the survivor, and 4-the guy who hates losing. 1’s goal is to run a solo 400 fast regardless of the pace of the other runners. 2’s goal is the make a strong break at the back stretch and catch anyone who is ahead of them. 3’s goal is to simply keep the race close, or if you’re worried about another team’s 4 grow the gap as much as possible. 4’s goal is don’t lose. With this layout, ranking the fastest runners: 4, 2, 1 or 3.  But those runners also need to be able to recognize their roll and adjust as the race develops. 4x4 strategy is a lot of fun to talk about and everyone has an opinion. Coaches liked to play games with their athletes to see how they race in different roles against different levels of competition. I’ve seen relays where the ranking went 1, 2, 3, 4; but you won’t see that at a championship race.</p></div>		</li>
