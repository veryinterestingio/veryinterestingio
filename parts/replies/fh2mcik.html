<p>When you dont use your muscles you lose them..when you are old, I dont think a 29 yr old who breaks their hip is at risk of dying.  But when an elderly person is lying in bed for a couple months dealing with the break, they may find that it becomes way more difficult or impossible to get out of bed afterwards.</p>
<p>Once they lose their strength its a pretty fast downward spiral.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's exactly the issue, they SHOULDN'T be in bed for more than a day or so max. I work as a PTA at a nursing home and it seems like a lot has changed in the theories about recovering from an injury like that. Not to generalize but older people tend to be of the mindset that when you get hurt you just need to &quot;rest up&quot; and lay in bed to get better. This is the exact opposite of what should happen. I think back in the day people had an injury like that and they'd be lying in a hospital bed for weeks at a time. You need to get up and walk/stand ASAP!   </p>
<p>The only thing I would add to your post that it isn't just elderly who lose function. I think it's hard for us younger people to understand because even if we're sick or completely lazy and sleep in for 12 or 13 hours, you're never actually laying in bed for like 24 hours straight. You're still up and moving around and going to the bathroom. I guarantee if a 30 year old literally stayed in bed for 24-48 hours straight and tried to go straight to the gym and work out at a normal pace they'd probably pass out or injure themselves. Muscle atrophy is no joke, along with your body adjusting to not having to work very hard to pump blood when you're lying flat to dramatically kicking it up a notch when you're standing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, this reminds me.  I had a surgery not go ideally a few years back to remove my colon.  It ended up falling apart and I got sepsis, but the point of all this was that I was unconscious for a few days and heavily out of it for a few more.  Combined with being pretty sick and weak coming in and I was functionally paralyzed from muscle weakness after.  I straight up could not move my legs, or sit up or anything, and it took maybe a month of rehab before I could even stand with assistance, and another 2 months to where I was walking unassisted (and still severely limited in range due to tiredness).</p>
<p>It really drove home how ridiculous those depictions of comas are where someone wakes up and just stands up before realizing they can’t walk, or is walking within a day or so.  I WAS sick going in but still walking fine, but a few days unconscious gave me a taste of being a paraplegic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I broke my neck in an auto accident 5 years ago, at age 76, and had to have my spine fused (C3 to T3) and reinforced with an orthopedic prosthesis. They had me up the day after surgery, walking the halls. I was released to a week of rehab 4 days later, before going home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom has stage 4 cancer, and the cancer destroyed her hip. She had to get a hip replacement and they were adamant that she start standing up/walking the day after surgery.  It definitely surprised me!  </p>
<p>She got discharged fairly quickly and set up with a Physical therapist and had a bunch of exercises she had to do.  She was pretty depressed (understandably so from the cancer prognosis), so to help motivate her, I trained her cat to sit on her walker when she did laps walking around the house (in exchange for cat treats). It only took part of a day for her very food-motivated cat to figure it out.  So if she hadn’t done any exercise in a while, her cat would jump on the walker and look at her expectantly. </p>
<p>The next time her physical therapist showed up she was amazed not only at the cat happily jumping on the walker and riding with her, but with the progress my mom had made in recovery.</p>
<p>A LOT of older people really do still believe the best thing to do is lie in bed to rest, but I hope people start being more knowledgeable about their health.</p>
<p>My mom recovered from her surgery fine and last time i saw her a month ago she had just had another surgery on her kidneys, and she’s still walking just fine!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m an RN on an orthopedic unit. Doesn’t matter who you are, the sooner you are up and moving after a joint surgery (repairing a fracture or choosing to have a joint replaced). Depending on how the joint was fixed, the orthopedic surgeons will put different weightbearing restrictions on the affected limb, but oftentimes they are encouraged to get up and out of bed within hours of surgery and to put full weight on the leg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it definitely is best for surgery! I guess it depends how severe the break is whether or not your are non weight-bearing or weight-bearing as tolerated/partial weight bearing. But even so, you need to be up and moving around ASAP!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a doctor I'm obviously familiar with these kind of things, so when my wife's grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's I knew she had somewhat of a deadline since average time to death is around 7 years post diagnosis. Anyway, fast forward around 10 years and she breaks her hip so I think well this is it now. But she gets out of hospital and doing ok. A week later she had another fall, (having forgot her hip was broken and couldn't stand on it), and breaks her other hip! At this point I'm looking up funeral costs. Ends up recovering completely. Almost 3 years later she finally passes away at 93. Crazy tough woman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She'd worked on a farm in North Sweden most of her life so was fairly toughened but she ate fika (small meal of pastries basically) every day so not a great diet and was definitely on the plumper side, although Alzheimer's took its course. She'd also beaten colon cancer I believe, some many years before I knew her</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously though, she just died of old age in the end, passed away in her sleep. Exact cause would never be investigated at that age. Good way to go. I actually forgot to mention she'd survived colon cancer before all of this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you've worked in rehab, maybe you could give me some pointers for my aunt. She has a host of other health issues - diabetes, heart failure, kidney failure - all of which predate her fall in early January. She broke her greater trochanter and had screws put in. It took a week for them to do the surgery and she was in the hospital for 18 or 19 days total from her fall to getting discharged to a rehab. At the hospital they didn't have her up near as much as we thought they should, but now in rehab they've had her walking and doing stairs daily.</p>
<p>Outside of her PT and OT what are things that she can do or we as family can do to keep her progress going in the right direction?</p>
<p>She's having issues with edema in her legs so they have been wrapping them during the day and when she is in bed she keeps them propped. But she is trying to be sitting up in a chair more than in bed. She still has pain moving the leg that was injured and it doesn't help that it's the same leg with a bad knee.</p>
<p>It sounds so discouraging to write it all out, but I will say this woman is a trooper. She is much stronger than she gives herself credit for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should talk with the team that is already working with her to learn about what you can do outside of therapy times. We can offer general advice but since she is already under professional care, they should be the ones advising you how to help her. She may have particular precautions or safety concerns that we outsiders could not know. They may also have specific ways you could help her given her and your particular abilities. They should also give her a plan for when she goes home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She can still sit up in a chair but I'd invest in a recliner or put a chair or something under her feet to keep them propped up while she is sitting up. I'd also limit her salt intake (excess salt can cause swelling, therefore more swelling in her legs), and probably limit her fluid intake during the day. Regular drinks with meals and a water in between, but not too much else. I know it might be hard especially being a diabetic as it tends to make the mouth dry, but they have sprays and mouthwashes to help with that (biotene). With the heart failure and kidney failure you've mentioned, these are both factors that contribute to the swelling. Once she goes home, I'd continue walking everyday, even if it's just a little bit. Something is better than nothing. I hope these suggestions help! Best of luck to your aunt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same circumstances, as 3 years ago my dad was admitted to the hospital with the flu, not a broken hip (he was 78). He had CHF and COPD, and they suspected c-diff (but that was never confirmed). They said he was a fall risk so he wasn't to get out bed without help. He also was diagnosed with end stage renal disease while admitted. Needless to say after a couple weeks he lost his ability to walk (yes I had kept encouraging him, making sure he had a walker, but he was stubborn). Even with PT and rehab he never regained mobility and I'm sure dialysis took a toll too. He died 11 months later as his body just finally gave out.</p></div>		</li>
