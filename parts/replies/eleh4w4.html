<p>Why? Does it need a certain number to overwhelm your immune system?</p>
<p>And how is the body able to overcome an already established infection? Is it “simply” a matter of ramping up white blood cell production and producing them faster than the bacteria are able to multiply?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I wanna start by saying that according to the raw, scientific data, there is a minimum number of germs needed to cause infection. We have numbers and experiments showing that there is some specific number for each specific germ for the &quot;average&quot; person that is needed to overwhelm your immune system. We can just infect mice with specific amounts of bacteria and see that this is true. There are a lot of reasons why one germ will need more than another and I will do my best to explain some of them and hopefully answer your question.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the variation between germs are the tactics I mentioned, but I only listed a few. There are very many more.  Its important to keep in mind is that these tactics are hard coded in their DNA and different germs may or may not have them.  So one germ may not have acid resistance, while a dangerous strain of E.coli could.</p>
<p>I'm more of a microbiologist, so my knowledge is more in line with the perspective of bacteria, but I'll try my best to respond from the immune system's perspective too.</p>
<p>A major tactic that I didn't mention is immune evasion.  An immune system can't stop infections if they can't see them. A lot of different diseases work this way, a good example being HIV. The virus hides in cells so that it can't be wiped out, but this isn't its only method and other germs have multiple methods as well. A few include changing their appearances and releasing molecules that mess up your body's signals. Any successful human pathogen is using some kind of method to hide from or respond to your immune system. So it isn't just an all out brawl where the superior numbers win. You could have an absurdly high number of white blood cells and still have an unchecked infection. Its like thinking you could kill superman if you only had more soldiers with guns. Sometimes its just futile.  In fact, too strong of an immune response can kill you before the germ itself can. Of course both of these cases are worst case scenarios, but its important to remember that people die from these things everyday.</p>
<p>Its also important to note that if you don't have immunity to a specific germ, your immune system can't respond effectively. It takes a while to develop antibodies, just like it takes a while for a tailor to make you a custom suit. In the time it takes for antibodies to develop, a germ many have already exploded out of control, especially if its got many successful ways of avoiding your white blood cells. </p>
<p>So what about the unsuccessful germs? Generally it works like you said. Your body ramps up white blood cells and if you don't have immunity to whatever germ, it will work on making specific antibodies. To my knowledge, there's only 2 times you'll see a weak germ over run your immune system. The first is if an absurd number of bacteria get inside you all at once, such as in the case of getting stabbed in the bowels and having all that gut bacteria leak into your abdominal cavity. The second is having such an absurdly weak immune system that any random germ can run amok. This second one is what we commonly see in people with AIDS. They generally aren't killed by the HIV virus directly, but by some other germ that is normally harmless, but no longer has anything stopping it from growing out of control.</p>
<p>So to be clear, there's a specific number of germs needed to make someone sick and overwhelm their immune system, <strong>but it depends on a thousand different variables and any specific number I could give you would be an average for a specific strain in an average person</strong>. To be honest, you could probably fill several PhD level courses with just this one topic and that's excluding all the prerequisites like like immunology and microbiology or virology or fungal biology or parasitology. But hopefully I've managed to cover at least some of the basics and clear things up a bit.</p></div>		</li>
