			<div class="markdown"><p>I quite agree, the bugs must go first. Historically I have not found out how the bark was de bugged. And bugs in bark was known 'way back'. It is note worth that none of the 'barked on' studs of my house show any insect damage at all. The exposed posts inside the house, are red pine, and were de barked and shaped by an adze, without much skill. I found quite a bit of the barks still on the post-which made identification of the species much easier</p></div>		</li>
