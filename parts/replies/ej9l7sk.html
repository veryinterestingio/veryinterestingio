			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still curious why some people do it more than others. If I don't crack my joints, they lock up. And if my joints get injured or are used more frequently, they crack more than usual. There is nothing more refreshing than releasing the building background noise of pressure in your joints by cracking everything head to toes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you regularly &quot;crack&quot; joints it becomes not only a psychological habit, but also your body adjusts to it meaning it becomes the norm for the ligaments and muscles surrounding the joints.<br />
Think of it this way, before a person starts cracking they went years without ever doing so.<br />
And felt no need to or stiffness, etc.<br />
They stretched the joint without cracking it leaving no stiffness.<br />
As soon as you start regularly  cracking the joint however, that becomes your go to stretch so to speak.<br />
If you decided to no longer crack them, then after a few months your body will get used to that being the norm again.<br />
I started off when I was about 10-12 with just my knuckles and over the years got to the stage where everything from my toes to my neck would need to be cracked all the time.<br />
Through some physio on my back and shoulder I got out of the habit of cracking them as I was instead regularly stretching the muscles surrounding the joints and that became the norm.<br />
I had to stretch my back 4 times a day to heal an injury, and the muscles and ligaments simply got used to that motion.<br />
My spine still cracks occasionally, but I no longer feel the need to pop everything from my hips to my skull every few hours.     </p></div>		</li>
