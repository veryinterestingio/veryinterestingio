<p>You couldn't cause atrial fibrillation, which is more a problem of the electrical wiring in the atrial chambers of the heart, rather than a problem of the normal pacemaker of the heart (SA node).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Benefits? There might be some collateral ones such as control of anxiety or some metabolic processes (e.g., accessing the mammalian reflex). And of course there is a better understanding of your own mind and body. This is particularly beneficial for some physical problems and mental disorders. </p>
<p>Dangers? Unlikely, but you never really know what you can elicit when you access subconscious pathways in your brain. Although small, there are always some risks to meditation. A “bad trip” is not limited to psychedelics. </p>
<p>AFIB? Not really. The actual heart beat is independently controlled by the heart itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I was in at the start of a surgery, before I was knocked out I focused on the heart monitor that was beeping every beat and was able to lower it to around 42 Beats per minute. One of the nurses saw what I was doing, tapped me on my head and said &quot;Stop that!&quot;. It immediately went back up to around 70 BPM. Only time I've ever don't that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s called a vagal maneuver. Taking a deep breath and bearing down, or exhaling forcefully through pursed lips can stimulate the vagus nerve which will slow your heart rate down. It’s not going to convert a-fib back to a normal (sinus) rhythm though.</p></div>		</li>
