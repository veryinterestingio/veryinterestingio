			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had quite a few ELI5s rejected by the bot. Mostly for being too short. But a few for not being simple enough. </p>
<p>I always figured that a short, simple answer is best. If OP doesnt understand or if they would like to know more, they are welcome to ask.</p>
<p>But wow, there are a lot of replies here that, I agree, would go way over the head of a 5 year old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s simplified a little too much here, to the point where it’s wrong.</p>
<p>It’s an insulator, because of that it has poor conductivity, or more simply air in the blanket is poor at taking on heat. This incorrectly suggests the opposite.</p>
<p>People are confused because it’s all relative, a hot rock will feel warmer than a hot blanket, and a cold rock will feel colder than a cold blanket. Because a rock will either give or take heat faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will agree that it would be incorrect for an ELI15, but for an ELI5 it is sufficient to the task.</p>
<p>Terms like insulation and conductivity makes many eyes glaze over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well no it’s entirely false because you say your body heats a blanket quickly. I’m saying no it does not. And in reverse if it was hot it also couldn’t heat you quickly.</p></div>		</li>
