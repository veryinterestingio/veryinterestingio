			<div class="markdown"><p>Been shot, can confirm. The SAPI plate shattered under the strike, but dispersed enough of the energy that the Kevlar pad under it was able to &quot;catch&quot; the bullet and the fragments of the plate. The kevlar is lighter, but only effective with light strikes. The plates stop up to 30 cal (if I recall correctly), but are heavy as hell and make moving a pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afghanistan. Was on patrol, just walking down the street, someone with a rifle was playing sniper. Knocked me flat, and terrified me, but other than cracked ribs, no harm done. Got back to the trucks, and when I got to take off the vest, the plate fell out in three big pieces and lots of little fragments. Bullet was in the kevlar vest, along with little slivers of the ceramic. Felt like getting kicked by a horse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good way for this to make sense:</p>
<p>A bullet hits you with momentum.  It gains that momentum from being pushed out of a gun barrel by expanding gas.  Which is itself pushing on the back of the gun barrel.</p>
<p>So if you <em>shoot</em> a pistol, the same momentum imparted into that bullet is imparted into your hand with the recoil. Equal and opposite and all that.  The difference is the energy is dissipated over a longer time (accelerating out of barrel vs impacting at full speed) and it is spread out across your hand through the grip rather than focused at a single point.</p>
<p>Same energy.  Greater distance spread over greater area.</p>
<p>Thus, the point of armor then is to absorb the impact over time and spread it over a large area.  To make it feel more like you're shooting the bullet rather than getting hit with it.</p></div>		</li>
