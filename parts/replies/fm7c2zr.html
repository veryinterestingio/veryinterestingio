			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a pretty rough example until the &quot;dad works at&quot; bit. Then it became rock solid.  </p>
<p>The fact that such knowledge came from a non-public source is the kicker here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could a rich person that has insider information just tell a mate to buy shares and then recoup the profits under the table in cash or something?  </p>
<p>I just refuse to believe that the extremely wealthy play by the rules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAL but that just pushes the insider trading charge to the mate instead of the rich person directly, and now they are both in trouble for conspiracy. Also, it's likely that the cash going back to the rich person would be illegal in some form. Most likely by not paying taxes on income or something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is why I'm actually in favor of leaving this issue alone.</p>
<p>I'd rather see them doing it than handlers with leverage because they can't make money independently. Someone else who we did not vote for will be able to manipulate much easier if we make the only route to profiting/protecting wealth from privileged information a game of proxies.</p>
<p>Banning legislators from trading will just add to the problem. We want them in the driver's seat, even at the cost of unfair advantage, not at the end of (even more) puppet strings. Term limits would improve things.. but we should not make politicians even <em>less</em> financially <em>independent</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, you could be the CEO of a company that makes respirators. You could find out, because you live in a fictional country with a fictional, responsible government that has learned that a virus is going to hit that country and has started preparing by giving you advance notice of this information that is being kept quiet to avoid panic, that you're about to receive billions upon billions of dollars of government orders for respirators. Even better, you know that your company is only DAYS away from getting approval from the FDA for some other respiratory treatments that are almost certain to be in MASSIVE demand once this virus hits. You only know how soon it's coming because you have a buddy in the FDA who got his mitts on the coming report and gave you info you weren't supposed to have.</p>
<p>You can't trade on that knowledge, because it will be obvious that you were using what your fictional responsible executive branch told you to make a fucking killing in the markets. So you come to me, a guy you know from middle school who has questionable ethics, and tell me about this. It's great because the link between us is tenuous, and not many people know that we've remained &quot;friends&quot; for years because I'm your hookup for party drugs.</p>
<p>We make an agreement - you'll get me access to hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest in your company's stocks, I'll buy them right away, and I'll sell for massive amounts and share that with you. 10% to me, 75% to you, and 15% assumed to pay for the money. It's free money to me, so I agree. </p>
<p>You get me a credit line through a banker buddy who likes your parties. It'll be about 15% of the sale price to pay back the bank and pay its legitimate interest, along with a wink and a nod about the extra &quot;interest&quot; that is going to be paid on that credit line to your banker buddy for looking the other way on my creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is all massively illegal, and you and your banker buddy don't want anyone to know about any of it. Because I'm the only one of the three of us who has a proven ability to spend time in prison and come out the other side doing OK.</p>
<p>I buy $300,000 worth of stock. The virus hits. You get the government contracts for billions of dollars worth of respirators, because one fictional state needs 300,000 respirators, another needs 200,000 respirators, and on and on, and you have the capacity to build the best and cheapest respirators in short time. Better yet, the FDA approves your other respiratory therapies, which show promise in early tests of treatment of the virus! This is going to be HUGE. The stock price goes through the ROOF! In short time, the stock price increases by a factor of 8! The stock is worth $2.4 million, and I sell it!</p>
<p>Oh, hey, I just realized that I only get $240,000 out of that $2.4 million. But if I pay back the bank what I actually owe, about $330,000, and keep the rest, I get $2,070,000.</p>
<p>Wow, 2 million bucks sounds better than $240,000. I tell you to fuck right off and all.</p>
<p>So what do you and the banker do? Well, first you get pissed. You want your big payday, and your banker buddy wants his lesser but still agreeably nice payday. So you come to my house to tell me I better pay. </p>
<p>My buddy Vinny tells you that I already told you to fuck right off and all, and now he repeats the invitation to fuck right off and all. Difference being that Vinny is a big, ugly fucker with a massive facial scar and a number of guns and knives on his person, as he was &quot;security&quot; for my party drug operation and I've already shared a &quot;few&quot; dollars from this interesting new venture with him. So when he asks you to fuck right off and all, you decide to do so for the time being.</p>
<p>Now what? There's no written contract to enforce, because you couldn't have evidence of this massively illegal thing out there. You can't go to court and ask to enforce anything else about the deal, because it was massively illegal and doing so would just be an invitation to throw you in prison. I've already paid back the bank completely, following my contract with the bank to the fucking letter, so it can't sue me. Plus, why would your banker buddy want to rock the boat? He's not <em>out of pocket</em> any money, he's just in the same place he started with a little disappointment thrown on top, with the added bonus of getting caught up in criminal charges if this whole thing comes crashing down.</p>
<p>Well, hell, you're rich! You can hire your own big, ugly fucker with scars and guns and knives, right?</p>
<p>What the fuck good is that going to do you? I'm not stupid enough to have all of this money stuffed in my mattress. It's in a bank in the Caymans somewhere. Just down the street from the very nice little villa I'm currently renting, and you don't even know where I've gone, so you can fuck right off and all.</p>
<p>You're sitting there with a thumb up your ass, knowing that the only thing that can ever really come of this whole deal is criminal charges if anyone ever gets curious about my new-found wealth. I guess you'll have to just cry yourself to sleep on the massive piles of bonus money you get from your company after these enormous gains this year and worry that I'm going to come along and blackmail you with my surreptitiously recorded details of our highly criminal activity when I finish using this pile of money for high-end hookers and blow.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The potential for enormous ill-gotten gains out of this comes with enormous possible penalties AND a decent possibility of not even seeing the gains you've &quot;earned.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
