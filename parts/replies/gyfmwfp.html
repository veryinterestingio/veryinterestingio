			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not an expert by any means, but I’m fairly certain there are specific techniques and rules for how to translate a 3D image into a 2D painting that aren’t completely obvious. So even very naturally talented artist have to rely on technique ‘discoveries’ of previous artist. Think of it kind of like the progress of science, ancient astronomers discovered some truly incredible stuff, but they didn’t have calculus and other more modern inventions and discoveries that contemporary astrophysicist use to come up with their absolute mind boggling theories.</p>

They had basic engineering and drafting - it's hard to build large projects from plans if you don't - but real perspective drawing is a lot harder than the &quot;3D&quot; that you can dash off at a drafting table, and even that would be hard to do freehand and mostly from memory.</p></div>		</li>
