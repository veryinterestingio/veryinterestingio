I wouldn’t try something like this without my doctor telling me to. Just curious and figured I’d ask some people who are way smarter than I am.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Source: US Internal Medicine Physician - There is a large body of scientific literature that supports an evolutionary explanation for fever. The explanation follows the observations that there are optimal temperatures for bacterial reproduction and viral replication. It happens that 98.6 deg F is the perfect incubator. Probably because pathogens evolved to optimize mammalian hosts. The fever is hypothesized to be an evolutionary adaptation that was advantageous to the organisms that genetically mutated the response. When the body temperature rises outside of optimal it slows bacterial reproduction and viral replication and gives the immune system an advantage. The bugs don’t die faster, they reproduce slower and the immune system wins. Low temperatures are just as effective but a physiologic process to lower body temperature is more difficult to safely and naturally establish and would be a less likely successful spontaneous adaptation. It would also cause the host to require more energy to return to normal temperature making it a less ideal adaptation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So as a follow up question, is it <em>hypothetically</em> better to leave a low grade fever untreated? (NOT asking for medical advice)</p>
<p>Also, why does the body sometimes go haywire and a reach brain damaging levels if it’s an evolutionary benefit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, no worries! It’s a great question. I just really didn’t want people taking medical advice from comments on the internet, so I wanted to keep that theme clear. Keep on being curious my dude</p></div>		</li>

<p>We're pretty sure that treating fever symptoms with antipyretics does no harm and also doesn't slow recovery. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this really true? Wow, I never expected that. It goes completely against the &quot;common knowledge&quot; I have on the topic.</p>
<p>I knew that too high a fever was dangerous, which is where antipyretics come in, but I never knew a low fewer didn't help itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a small addition to be made : </p>
<p>What can be dangerous is anti-inflammatory meds (which are anti-pyretics, but not all anti-pyretics are anti-inflammatory). In certain cases it can help the infection spread by preventing your immune system from fighting it properly. It can rarely have dramatic consequences.</p>
<p>That's why you should never take NSAIDs like Ibuprofen or Aspirin during a fever without medical advice. On the other hand, Paracetamol, which doesn't have an anti-inflammatory effect, is mostly safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, yeah okay. Then it aligns better with the &quot;common knowledge&quot; part. I was not aware of the split between anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretics. I thought they were the same, but thinking about it it does make sense that there is a difference, even if they often overlap.</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this post as it actually sort of answered the question I had in response to all the crazy responses to this topic. Namely that I was wondering whether the elevated body temperature served any actual function in fighting disease, or if it was simply some byproduct (I can’t think of a better word to explain what I’m thinking) of metabolic processes occurring within the body / immune system as a response to infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering the same. I've always thought that the fever was more of a symptom/byproduct of the body fighting of the infection and not directly what fought it. And from my understanding that is how it is? Haha sorry, a lot of technical terms here that I don't really understand</p></div>		</li>
