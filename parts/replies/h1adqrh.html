			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll provide an addendum.</p>
<p>&quot;Heat&quot; can be broken into three bands. Short, Medium and Long wave infrared. The hotter the object, the more shorter wave, higher energy per photon, infrared will be emitted as per the blackbody radiation. Things in the high hundreds and thousands of degrees F are short wave emitters, mid hundreds are medium wave, and things around 150-250 are long wave emitters.</p>
<p>This is important because that high energy short wave is a lot easier to detect, and early heat sensors were predominately built around this. On jets, the only thing this hot are the afterburner plume or the turbine blades <em>up</em> the engine. This put constraints on how and when infrared missiles could be employed - when the target was in an afterburning state or when the shooter was &quot;looking up the tailpipe&quot; of the target.</p>
<p>Later, sensors that could detect and prosecute medium wave infrared radiation were much more flexible in their employment. The exhaust trail of a jet is ripe with high temperature byproducts, and the engine heat would saturate through the body of an aircraft and provide enough radiation to be detected. This gives a wide range of aspects and elevation in which sufficient heat could be detected - pretty much everything except staring right at the aircrafts nose (with fighters, at least).</p>
<p>Infrared tech is now going towards long wave radiation, where the skin friction of the air on the frame provides sufficient heat that can be detected. The biggest issue with this technology is the photons are quite a bit lower energy, and both internal thermal noise in the sensor and random fluctuations the atmosphere (foreground and background) contribute enough noise that the tracking problem becomes difficult. Not impossible, but difficult. At sufficient range, a target may only be a few pixels large, and if an errant photon from the horizon hits the sensor it could contribute enough energy to be about the same size of the target. Advanced filtering and other techniques are required to optimize how these sensors perform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Addendum:</p>
<p>Modern heatseakers also have sensors that detect UV, to distinguish between the sun, fuel byproducts and flares.</p>
<p>This is necessary as modern flares very closely mimic the engine signature IR emission, but they have a very different UV emission spectrum and intensity. This has been implemented on the newer generations of the Stinger, among other missiles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another addendum: modern IR missiles are so resistant against flares as to basically render them useless. Combat aircraft still use them though to counter MANPADS, which have less sophistication in the seeker head so that it can be portable, and older threats that don't have such sophistication.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the focus is on IRCM and DIRCM:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_Infrared_Counter_Measures" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_Infrared_Counter_Measures</a></p>
<p>They work by flooding the seeker head with light, essentially blinding it. Their effectiveness is a mixed bag though because it needs to know the exact wavelength that the missile seeker is sensitive to in order for it to work, and most modern missiles detect multiple wavelengths at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From someone who worked on adjacent tech for a few years, this is the best response I’ve read so far. Modern aircraft can best avoid IR missiles using Infrared Suppressors. These are designed for the low band (direct IR, or line of site to engine hot parts) and medium/high band (plume dilution, or cool the exhaust plume by mixing cold, outside air with hot exhaust gas to reduce overall IR signature). </p>
<p>At the end of the day, missile go fast, plane need hide to fly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, most missiles travel far faster than the aircraft they're targeting</p>

<p>As long as that plane isn't the SR-71</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know, but for the sake of a simplified explanation this was easier. You'll note many people have added helpful addendum that slowly go more in depth. I also didn't go into some of my personal favorites such as the gyroscopic stabilization used on sidewinder or the techniques used to command such high G maneuvers without stalling the control surfaces. Its really interesting stuff, but it doesn't help someone who is unfamiliar with IR missile design understand what is actually happening.</p></div>		</li>
