			<div class="markdown"><p>My opinion is this: People are really worried that these blood clots are being seen in one in a million people who are taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. That’s what people are really concerned about. However, we know that blood clots are super common in people in the U.S. Half a million people here have died of COVID-19, and the data would suggest that 100,000 people have died of pulmonary embolism. It’s a very common thing to have happen. So, if you’re saying that blood clots happen to one in a million of people who have this vaccine, blood clots happen to a lot of people even if they didn’t have the vaccine. I wouldn’t be surprised if one in a million people were injured in a car crash after getting the vaccine – but would people correlate the car crash and the vaccine? Here is an article to learn more: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-astrazeneca-vaccine-blood-clots-safety-experts" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-astrazeneca-vaccine-blood-clots-safety-experts" target="_blank">https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-astrazeneca-vaccine-blood-clots-safety-experts</a></a><br />
Blood clots are super common; it would be very different for an uncommon disease. If you don’t want to get COVID-19, I would do everything possible to get the vaccine when it is your turn and it is available. The risk of dying from COVID-19 is likely higher than getting a blood clot from the vaccine. The ISTH released a statement on this that I would encourage everyone to read, as well: <a href="https://www.isth.org/news/556057/ISTH-Statement-on-AstraZeneca-COVID-19-Vaccine-and-Thrombosis.htm" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.isth.org/news/556057/ISTH-Statement-on-AstraZeneca-COVID-19-Vaccine-and-Thrombosis.htm" target="_blank">https://www.isth.org/news/556057/ISTH-Statement-on-AstraZeneca-COVID-19-Vaccine-and-Thrombosis.htm</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope asking a further question by replying to a comment is okay but here it is :
Would you recommend to get the astra zeneca vaccine anyway to someone who already suffered from thrombosis and pulmonary emboly, which was caused by the pill and an unfortunate gene mutation so prone to react to medicine that can cause blood clot as side effect ? I know that statistically the risk is very very low to get a blood clot from the vaccine but with such past experience wouldn't that be better to avoid it ?
I've never been afraid of vaccine or anything but suffering from a pulmonary emboly was not fun and I can't help but wonder haha. Thank you in advance if you take time to reply !</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you should take from his reply is that there is no reason to suspect a correlation or causation between blood clots and the Astra Zeneca Covid-19 vaccine. Why? Because the blood clots were happening in the same or less instances in the vaccine study than in the general population of people who didn't get the vaccine. You wont be more at risk for blood clots than the population who didn't get the vaccine at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. This is in addition to the arterial thrombosis (AKA COVID toe) that we have seen at an increasing rate. I have personally treated at least 3 (maybe 4?) people off the top of my head that developed an arterial thrombosis with active COVID. Two of them died terrible deaths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you heard of Denmark's new guidance on aspiration during vaccine injection? Apparently some small percentage of people can have large blood veins in the deltoid muscle and aspiration during vaccine injection (i.e. pulling back on the plunger to verify that the needle isn't in a vein) may avoid potential clotting problems.</p>
