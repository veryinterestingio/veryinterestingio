			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of an apples and oranges comparison there. A big part of the sinking process also has to do with the fluid in a lime simply being more dense than water. Sure, it helps that there's more fluid there by volume as well(which gives limes even More reason to sink), but yeah, at the end of the day, the fluid that makes up a lime is just denser. Because pulp is still very dense with the juice involved(you're never gonna get it all out and still have it be classifiable as pulp and not &quot;Tiny shreds of what was once a bit of a fruit), it sinks as well. Consider that the pulp of a fruit(which is just the &quot;meat&quot; of the fruit, if we're honest, given a less attractive name in the juice circles) is fluid by majority. So again, because there's still fluid in that pulp, lime pulp, bearing lime juice, will sink because it's denser, whereas lemon pulp, containing lemon juice, which is less dense than water, will float.  </p>
<p>I imagine you could create an interesting experiment to demonstrate this. Dehydrate some lime pulp as much as you possibly can, then try to rehydrate it in lemon juice. Press it out slightly, then put it in water and see if it sinks.</p></div>		</li>
