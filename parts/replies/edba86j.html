			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot to mention that on the first dive bombers fitted with these, the pilots hated them with a burning passion.  There was no way to turn them on or off so even in regular level flight, they would whine incessantly.  Imagine flying around with that thing screaming in your ear for a few hours.  At around the third iteration, they finally added a flap to control if it was on or not.  The pilots understandably liked them after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The warning was a big part of the idea. It's hard to do anything about a stuka already in a dive, so it's better the enemy on the ground focus on the diving stuka and not on the 2 following it but still in level flight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should also mention that the P-51 mustang also had a very distinctive whine as well, which it turns out was related to the recessed gun ports that were mounted on the wing. You can use pressurized air to blow a stream across the gun barrels and reproduce the harmonics associated with the P-51 in flight.  It's really quite neat.</p>
<p>IIRC, I saw it on a documentary on Netflix about bring old aircraft back to life, though the name of it escapes me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Between the supercharger, engine, air ducts, and overall profile of the P-51, it has such a unique and distinctive sound... Its truly incredible. If anyone here is interested in old warplanes and has the opportunity to go to EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, WI, do it. Its like no other airshow in the world. Oh, and Friday is the warbird day there. Fyi. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coolest thing about the P51 is that they designed its radiators such that they generate thrust.<br />
The thing about jet engines is that the heat doesn't have to come from combustion. So if you design the cooling system correctly, you can run a low-power ramjet on the waste heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, that Rolls Royce Merlin (and its Packard cousin) was something special. Twelve cylinder symphony. </p>
<p>The Merlin <em>saved</em> the P-51, which, when first introduced, was powered by a weak Allison engine. The RAF relegated it to tactical recon and ground attack roles, and the USAAF was doing the same, until a test pilot said &quot;Hey. Stick a Merlin in it.&quot; And the rest, as they say, is history. </p>
<p>The Merlin went through the entire war pretty much an unchanged design - save for a few tweaks, including Packard's tweaks to suit its production methods - and has got to be THE aircraft engine of the war. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was fairly common to tape over wing gun ports in fighter aircraft that had barrels that didn't protrude (Mustangs weren't in that category, as the barrels of all 6 machineguns stick out of the leading edge), in order to provide a small reduction in drag and increase fuel economy ever so slightly. When the guns were fired, the tape simply blew away. I've read that ground crews would listen for the whistle of exposed gun ports as the aircraft returned to land - if it was present, it meant that fighter had fired its guns.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/EDV8Gbd.jpg" target="_blank">Mustangs did indeed have their gun ports taped over, at least in service.</a>  It tends to look awful because of those slightly protruding guns, so you don't see it on modern restorations.</p>

<p>And there are mentions of Mustang gun port taping in various books, more as a throwaway line, in various pilot biographies, including those of Chuck Yeager and Donald Lopez among others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Nazi's still knew their old testament biblical stories, and the Jericho trumpet is part of the early christian story, just as Abraham and Moses and all the rest of them are - which christians still believe are important religious stories.</p>
<p>I think it's safe to say that the Nazi's were a little short of logic anyhow.  Being an anti-semite doesn't exactly give you a strong foundation for applying logic to the world around you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with the first thing you said, only I don't think it has to do with a lack of logic; on the contrary, actually. They knew how to manipulate people and instil fear, so using a name that evokes a terrifying biblical mental image would definitely work.</p></div>		</li>

The simple fact of the matter is Nazi and Nazi ideological ideas can manifest in even the smartest person on the planet. Racism is not limited just to stupid people sadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simplest explanation is, as you say, that those stories were part of Christian lore. The only point at which anti-Semitism began to crop up wwe particularly after it became the official faith of the Roman Empire. With Constantine shaping it to his whims, and the introduction of Gentiles into the faith, that signalled the final separation of Judaic tradition and Christianity. Old Testament never lost its relevance and it was the Jewish refusal to accept Christ and the New Testament as the natural progression of the Abrahamic faith that stoked much of the distrust and anti-Semitism. Using the literary device of the trumpets from the Battle of Jericho as the inspiration is only superficially inconsistent with the party's views, really.</p>
<p>There were other cobtemporaneous reasons for which Europeans deepened their distrust (their insularity where they lived, different traditions, just plain difference. Add in that whole tradition of Christians being barred from money-lending and you have a basis for bitterness which, even as money-lending broadened beyond the Jews, it would surely linger on.</p>
<p>Plus, as evidenced by modern discourse, people love a good scapegoat. All in all, the name is totally understandable. But hey. Not a whole lot of point trying to rationalise the conduct of Nazis. Granted, the whole of Europe was blatantly complicit in much of the eame antisemitism at the time anyway. As was North America. Just without the camps.</p></div>		</li>
