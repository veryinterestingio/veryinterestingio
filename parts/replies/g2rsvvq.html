			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, most production of commercial antibodies in horses should have relatively minimal effects on horse lifespan as referred to in your cited articles. However, brown recluse toxin does seem to have a pretty dramatic effect that is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5299669/" target="_blank">somewhat</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041010114001330?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">backed</a> in the <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/engineered-spider-protein-used-for-anti-venom-vaccine-against-brown-recluse" target="_blank">literature</a>. The literature is admittedly sparser, which I assume is in part because brown recluse antivenom isn't available in the US and most of the existing research has been done by a few research groups in Brazil.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why not?  I know there are brown recluse spiders in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prevalence is lower in the US, and the actual species in the US (L. reclusa) is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5396866/" target="_blank">smaller</a>. In 2014, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26624241/" target="_blank">NPDS</a> logged about 1300 brown recluse exposures, none of which resulted in death.</p>
<p>The species found in Brazil and Chile are L. laeta, intermedia, and gaucho, which are larger and can cause more severe envenomation. As it turns out, visceral loxoscelism is still <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18064371/" target="_blank">pretty</a> <a href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0036-46652002000300005&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en" target="_blank">rare</a> there, but evidently it's enough of a problem that there is ongoing research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very important indeed.
I had failed at finding other sources too, and I thought I didn't probably know well enough where to look, but now you're making me reconsider it a bit.
Could it be possible that venom from the loxoscelens reclusa affects horses' lifespan in a way that snakes and other spiders don't? </p>
<p>I'd think the quote is took directly from the biologist who is representing the anti-venom center, in other words not just casually made up, but supported by their data. Yet I can't be sure at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that it's not a quote. The article merely states it as a fact, without providing a source.</p>
<p>Sloppy journalism.</p></div>		</li>
