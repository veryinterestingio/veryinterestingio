			<div class="markdown"><p>You also lose all control of where you're drilling.  I was working on a directional crew and we were about 4000m along in a 2000m deep well when suddenly our inclination went from 90 degrees to 85 degrees over the course of 10 meters because the drilling motor was basically just hanging into a cave.  Kind of lucky we didn't get stuck but we had to pull out and pump down cement so we could drill around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, this is somewhat unrelated to the question since it was accidentally drilling into a salt mine but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_iZr2-Coqc" target="_blank">result was incredible</a>. The salt mine was under a lake. An oil company drilled in the wrong spot in the lake, puncturing into the salt mine. Since salt dissolves in water and the salt deposit was enormous, there was nothing to stop the water from flowing in. Eventually the ENTIRE lake disappeared. See the video for more details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I immediately thought of. Not only did the lake disappear, but barges loaded with trucks disappeared down into the hole. Most of those ended up popping back out at the end. The video is much more descriptive than any factual text account could ever be. It doesn't seem like something I expect could happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a significant hazard to the general public going about their business. We have the occasional sinkhole here in central Texas because of development above these caves. About 20 hidden caves were discovered underneath a nearby school and major road a few years ago, delaying construction due to safety concerns. They had no entrances until we made them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some endangered spiders and centipedes that crawl around in a chain of caves connected to these above mentioned. I actually attended the school the commenter mentioned, the school had an independent entrance to these caves in a courtyard, sometimes the biology classes would hold classes out there and I think at some point earlier on in the schools years students were allowed to go down there guided by teachers.</p>
<p>As another note, the cave system &quot;found&quot; by the construction workers while working on the roads was actually a discovery of a heck of a lot larger expansion of the caves already known. </p>
<p>For some time students have not been allowed in the caves due to the endangered species, and on a side note, that school was NEVER supposed to have been built. The caves already known provided structural threats, and the new found expanse of the caves means at some point there will be sinkholes and that school will &quot;cave&quot; in on itself</p></div>		</li>

<p>Organisms in A cave system that got sealed millions of years ago in romania  evoloved differently. Besides microbes, the system also contains multicellular organisms such a water scorpion.
