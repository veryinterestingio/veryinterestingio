			<div class="markdown"><p>Libido is modified by various things, including levels of stress, hormones, chemicals in the brain, DNA, upbringing, current mood, satisfaction (how often you have sex or an outlet of some kind), diet and vitamin intake, etc.</p>
<p>On top of that, not everyone responds the same way to these stimuli, eg some people get higher libido under more stress, while others must be relaxed to get into the mood.</p>
<p>TLDR: It's essentially randomized based on several factors. Mental and physical health and hormone-affecting things like birth control or depression medication/drugs play the biggest part, and adjusting those will often directly adjust libido up or down.</p></div>		</li>
