<p>QLED-screen are basically still using ”normal LCD’s”, but rather special LED’s for the backround light.</p>

<p>No. All commercially available QLED screens use regular backlights with a photo-emissive quantum dot layer that acts basically as a filter to turn the light from the backlight into pure basic colors.</p>
<p>Edit: Not sure why this would be downvoted. There are no ”special LEDs” used as backlights in QLED displays. Quantum dots are used between the backlight and the color filter.</p></div>		</li>
