			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a shepherd's pie recipe once that talked about the best shepherd's pie every sentence. Every sentence mentioned the best shepherd's pie, especially the author's love of shepherd's pie and how she grew up eating the best shepherd's pie. The recipe was for what she claimed was the best shepherd's pie recipe for shepherd's pie.</p>
<p>The shepherd's pie wasn't even fucking good, it was underseasoned and excessively watery.</p>
<p>My favorite example of this bullshit was a pear cake recipe that had, I shit you not, a <em>full fucking photo album from the author's wedding before the ingredients.</em> I wish I could find it because it's a work of art but it seems to have vanished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Highjacking top comment.  Get recipes from brand websites.  The flour company wants you to buy their flour.  If you’re reading their recipe on their website, they don’t want to advertise anyone else.  That means the only ads on the recipe page will be “use 2 cups of King Arthur Flour” or the like.<br />
On top of that, they don’t want their brand associated with crap food, so you will get tested and achievable recipes with one unobtrusive ad and no filler to game the search algorithm</p></div>		</li>
