<p>I think something that is missed about the &quot;Grievance Studies&quot; work is that you can do this anywhere. Peer Review is not well suited for malicious actors and you can publish basically any garbage in any field if you submit enough papers and try hard enough. But because there is a community of people who intend to show that certain fields are <em>without value</em>, they focus on those fields and draw a conclusion that doesn't follow from evidence. Yes, people have been able to publish wild nonsense in sociology journals (and phil journals, as in the original Sokal affair). But it would be foolish to conclude therefore that research published in said journals is all woo and without value. </p>
<p>I am 100% confident that given enough effort I could publish some arbitrary nonsense in a CS conference. But this doesn't make the news because it doesn't play into an existing narrative.</p>
<p>The &quot;Grievance Studies&quot; authors also tip their hand <em>very badly</em> in how they presented their findings. They were absolutely not dispassionate in their approach or analysis. Their media highlighted text in many of the <em>rejected</em> versions of their papers as evidence of their claims. Their work should be considered an act of directed journalism at best, not scientific critique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The argument of Lindsay et. al. was <strong>not</strong> that arbitrary nonsense is easy to publish in &quot;grievance studies&quot; journals.</p>
<p>In fact, they explicitly said, that they hit a wall with arbitrary nonsense papers, ie. they could get them into low ranked journals, but not the highly ranked ones.</p>
<p>However, they started having consistent success with the highest ranked journals, once they started applying a certain kind of language and logic to the otherwise intentionally absurd ideas in their papers.</p>
<p>That suggests, that the problem with &quot;grievance studies&quot; cuts deeper than generic problems with peer review and the publication process.</p>
<p>If someone not trained in CS can get nonsensical papers dressed up in fashionable lingo into a <strong>top</strong> CS journals <strong>consistently</strong>, I'd say yes, CS has a big problem, too. But, I see no evidence of that. And also, even if there was, that would not lessen the problem in the &quot;grievance studies&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
