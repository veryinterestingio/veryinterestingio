<p>We see in humans that people who miss out on REM sleep (because of interruption, sleep disorders, etc.) will over-compensate for missed REM when conditions are favourable, with what we call 'REM rebound'; i.e. instead of 30 minutes of REM every two hours, they might exhibit, say, two, one-hour REM periods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this why daily consumption of THC is said to negatively affect memory? I used to stop dreaming completely when smoking weed daily and would get phases of extremely vivid and intense dreaming when quitting for a couple weeks. Definitely didn't enjoy the rebound especially because I hate dreaming in general. Never felt that it impacted my memory though and don't see much difference since quitting for good.     </p>
<p>Sorry if this is kind of unrelated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. THC suppresses REM sleep which is why many regular users report issues with short-term memory; REM-rebound is what users experience on tolerance breaks, though the overall quality of sleep on these breaks tends to be worse in the interim due to their brain's dependence on the sedating effects of THC. The preponderance of light (N2) sleep and lack of deep (SWS) induces exhaustion, which in turn leads to compensatory deeper sleep in the following days as the brain re-acclimates to 'normal' sleep. </p>
<p>As a side note, the reason people report 'better' sleep when using before bed is that THC promotes SWS (at the expense of REM sleep) and improves total sleep time. It is undeniably worse for cognition, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really fascinating to hear from a real expert.  Do you know anything about people who typically only sleep around 6 hours per night?  I read about a gene that has something to do with this, and I think my oldest daughter and I may have it.  Or maybe that the gene allows people with less sleep to function better with less sleep than those without it?  I canâ€™t quite remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Query:</p>
<p>Why is it that it seems that the most vivid and lucid dreaming, parts you remember with clarity always seem to occur just before waking up.. whether naturally or by any form of outside interruption (Alarm, sudden noise, someone waking you, ect)?</p>
<p>They say to try to write down your dreams since you're likely to forget them shortly after waking up... but for me, my best, clearest dreams feel like they happen just before I wake up, no matter how long I've been asleep.</p>
<p>is REM sleep usually the last cycle of a night's rest?</p>
<p>Sorry if the question is confusing, don't know the best way to word it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>REM sleep is the last stage in each cycle, and it's normal to wake briefly after each period of REM ends. <em>When</em> that period of REM occurs will dictate your 'sleep inertia' (how drowsy you feel and how long that drowsiness lasts).</p>
<p>There is inherent variability in both the length and depth of each cycle which is mediated partially by melatonin. Melatonin induces muscle relaxation, lowers core temperature, and promotes sleep cycling - most people with a 'normal' chronotype exhibit a peak around 3am which is when your deepest sleep occurs. Your brain is suppressed and sedated, so waking from REM at the end of your third cycle is more likely to result in a rapid return to sleep, whereas waking from REM after your fourth cycle - when your melatonin levels have waned substantially and are on their way down - will result in wakefulness. </p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kx03q7/do_animals_that_sleep_in_multiple_short_naps_such/gj7t9dz/" target="_blank">adenosine</a> is at its lowest level immediately before you rise, which promotes mental acuity. </p>
<p>So the short answer is that your last cycle is your lightest because sedating hormones have worn off, and waking from REM means you're more likely to remember what you were just dreaming about. In general, REM arousals tend to carry higher sleep inertia because of the jarring disconnect between dream and wake states, between accessory muscle atonia and activity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this also depend on where in a time zone you are? For example, within the Central European Time (GMT+1) zone there is a wide range of longitudes and therefore considerable variation of the &quot;real&quot; time that one would get on a sundial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You likely don't any sensation of time outside of dreaming, so even if it was hours between your vivid dream and the alarm clock it would feel instant. There wouldn't be any period of subjective time between the events, so from your perspective you were dreaming immediately before waking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually it feels like the dream has ended abruptly, in the middle of some event. Do you mean it happens this way when we enter another sleep phase? Why doesn't the brain &quot;wrap up&quot; the dream before moving on from REM to something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polyphasic sleep drastically reduces REM latency in humans so it's certainly possible. </p>
<p>That said, humans experience accessory muscle atonia while in REM - movements while dreaming are indicative of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep_behavior_disorder" target="_blank">sleep disorder</a>. How that pertains to other animals, I don't know.</p></div>		</li>
