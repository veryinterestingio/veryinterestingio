			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Violet</em> is the color of light at the shortest wavelength end of the visible spectrum, not a combination of Reds and Blues.</p>
<p>Red is the color at the opposite end and Blue is just before Indigo, which in turn is just before Violet. You are right when you say Red+Blue gives you magenta and purples* but you might be thinking about RGB addictive color theory which is not quite the appropriate model to describe what happens when we are looking at the sky which has more to do with scattering and interference patterns.</p>
<p>Computer monitors can't produce spectral violet.</p>
<p>* I'm leaving out psychovisuals for the sake of brevity but this is not quite the whole story. The words pink, purple or magenta do not describe light frequency intervals, they are &quot;illusions&quot; resultant from the fact that we perceive light through specialized neurons called photoreceptor cells (these are the rods and cones you might have heard about) which are each stimulated by specific wavelengths. You can look it up if you are interested, this is a fascinating subject!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except they do, in additive color theory. Open paint. Create a custom color with RGB values R: 90, G: 0, B: 180. You'll get <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AMFyeL8.png" target="_blank">this</a>.</p></div>		</li>
