			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a pretty large penis, but also very mild, nearly unnoticeable hypospadias (a ~semispherical divet about 3-4mm from urethra i.e. my protovagina). I know they both have to do with hormones in utero but it seems like there should be a negative correlation.  Maybe I got lucky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's an unusual combination but it's actually a mix of genetics, hormones, AND environment.</p>
<p>First: essentially all babies are first formed as &quot;female&quot;. That means that the gonads (sex organs) first develop as ovaries. </p>
<p>This is where the Y chromosome comes in. The Y chromosome had way fewer genes than the X, but its main genes are called the SRY genes. The SRY genes cause the &quot;masculization&quot; of the gonads of the fetus, essentially making them stop going down the ovarian development pathway and instead develop into the testes. This is also when is believed that the proto-clitoris is masculanized into the penis. (There's not a lot of research on the clitoris unfortunately yet for us to exactly know if that's how it works but the essential shape and location to the penis makes them very similar.)</p>
<p>The weirdest part of this though is that the switch from ovaries to testes isn't a hard switch! Research now shows that there's a weird in-between form we call the &quot;ovo-testes&quot; that occurs in which the gonads can go either way. So I would assume that you may have some aberrant signaling that caused a delay/incomplete masculization step that's left behind the hypospadias. The exact cause of this I can't answer because it's very dependent on environment and what genres are being turned in and off, which is a very dynamic process during development.</p>
<p>Now going back to GnRH signaling, the penis didn't grow in utero because there's too much estrogen bring produced by Mom. That's why the post-natal mini-puberty is so unique to male babies. The majority of penis growth occurs after birth. On average, that mini-puberty when GnRH signaling is on lasts about a month. So I would assume that you're genetically predisposed to a larger starter penis size or you had a longer mini-puberty.</p>
<p>TL;DR : development is cool and dynamic and requires a mix of information from your genes and environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Body hair is related to secondary effects of sex hormones; estrogen and testosterone. GnRH itself doesn't directly control that. Weirdly enough though, body hair density can be an inheritable trait.</p></div>		</li>
