			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a bad idea. Mustard will probably just irritate the skin and probably cause infection. I'd just put antibiotic cream with non-stick dressing till you can get to a doctor if it's big enough.</p>
<p>Trust me. I didn't go to a doctor for a second degree burn (maybe 4 inch radius and deep in certain spots) for about a month and paid for it with a staph infection. Even with twice a day changing of dressings. The silver cream they give you works much better than what you can get OTC or at home. And I got some oral antibiotics. Then I wore a compression sleeve for a few months for the constant itching that burns love to dole out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm is using antibiotic cream nonchalantly a good idea? Not sure if I'm talking out of my ass but wouldn't that contribute to antibiotic resistance?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Silvadene is also an antibiotic but specifically for burns.</p></div>		</li>
