			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a gold geologist, so adding a bit to your comments.</p>
<p>Age and type of rocks is also very important with finding gold deposits. Exploration geo's try and make ore genesis models to assist with exploration targeting.</p>
<p>West Australian rocks from a massive gold production region called the Yilgarn Craton are pretty much the oldest rocks on the planet. Dating back to not long after the planet formed ~4.5Ga. Current papers discuss most gold occurring in several &quot;waves&quot; several hundred million years apart, with concentrations often occurring from tectonic activity (simply put), being structurally hosted and the gold moved around through ground &quot;water&quot; of differing chemistry and pressure. Rocks move up and down over geological time, as do water tables and fluids. A drop in pressure means the fluid can no longer carry in suspension the same &quot;load&quot;. (I'm trying to keep it simple).</p>
<p>At the same time in places bordering plate subduction zones it is possible to find &quot;bonanza&quot; gold deposits in some of the youngest rocks on the planet. Countries such as the Philippines, Chile, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia (California falls into this category to an extent)</p>
<p>Then there is the likes of the West African craton, which is responsible for a huge amount of gold in countries like Ghana, Mali, Guinea in the Birimian Greenstone belt and is around half as old as the Yilgarn rocks, but gold deposition time frames are not so far apart as West Australia. These deposits are also usually structurally hosted.</p>
<p>To look at even younger current day gold deposition, then &quot;black smoker&quot; hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor churn out plumes of various metals such as lead, zinc, gold etc in real time.</p>
<p>[Yilgarn Craton for those interested] (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ga.gov.au/webtemp/image_cache/GA18908.pdf&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjHloeBgb_jAhWi63MBHU1RATgQFjAFegQICBAB&usg=AOvVaw0Dj-aeArGKM0z1e_LyS_RS" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ga.gov.au/webtemp/image_cache/GA18908.pdf&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjHloeBgb_jAhWi63MBHU1RATgQFjAFegQICBAB&usg=AOvVaw0Dj-aeArGKM0z1e_LyS_RS</a>)</p>
<p>In short, there are so many different ore genesis models, but they all require a source, a mobiliser/ enricher and a trap/ change in conditions to become an eventual economic deposit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is quite a diverse topic as stringer formation (stringer \~ narrow vein) does occur in multiple geological settings. </p>
<p>One good example are the carbonate veins produced as a result of sediment build up and burial in bottom of the sea or a large lake. Practically as the thickness of the sediment pile increases with more and more material settling down (both rock material and biological matter) the bottom of the sediment pile is subjected to more and more pressure. There is a point when pressure and temperature (T goes up with depth) are high enough to start dissolving some of the burying material that includes calcium in some form. Pressure also makes the sediment layer deform so that spaces are created for the now dissolved elements to be transported in liquid solutions and are later precipitated in open spaces. Here is an example of how cracks in sedimentary beds could form: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rmF4bY7VMk" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rmF4bY7VMk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rmF4bY7VMk</a></a></p>
<p>As for the explanation for observing the veins in such shallow depths, that is most certainly due to erosion of the overlying rocks and/or plate tectonics (mountain building etc.) which effectively does uplift the veined rock from depth to present land surface.</p></div>		</li>
