			<div class="markdown"><p>So, potentially stupid question: </p>
<p>The way I make my coffee is I take a sauce pan, put in a glass of milk, and then boil that. Then I just mix in a tablespoon of instant coffee (<a href="https://www.target.com/p/nescaf-233-taster-s-choice-house-blend-light-roast-instant-coffee-7oz/-/A-13481365?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&amp;AFID=google_pla_df&amp;fndsrc=tgtao&amp;DFA=71700000012732781&amp;CPNG=PLA_Grocery%2BShopping_Local&amp;adgroup=SC_Grocery&amp;LID=700000001170770pgs&amp;LNM=PRODUCT_GROUP&amp;network=g&amp;device=m&amp;location=9004497&amp;targetid=aud-1015938909496:pla-812706826442&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;ds_rl=1246978&amp;ds_rl=1248099&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA5IL-BRAzEiwA0lcWYtsrfQXVDJtIJ6U11p0QI-ibavaEhbhFam3q5FQo2hQ3Ox8bahDf1hoCOBcQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">this one</a>) and then I just mix that in.</p>
<p>I just want to know, am I doing something stupidly wrong here? Idk I just want to be sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with heating liquids in the microwave is that they don't always get heated evenly.  As the microwave and the mug (or whatever) turn, the liquid can stay still (i.e. turn inside the mug, but stay still in space).  This can lead to pockets that become superheated.  When you move the mug to take it out, you can disturb the superheated pockets, cause them to mix with the colder pockets, and end up with a violent explosion of whatever you were heating.  So be careful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you have misunderstood the superheating effect. Microwave ovens do have issues with uneven heating due to standing waves. But these are in the orders of magnitude of the wavelength at 12cm. So a cup of water does not suffer much of these effects. And it is not a sudden cutoff between where the microwave heats and where it does not but a slow gradiant between maximum and minimum.</p>
<p>The effect you are talking about is caused by lack of nucleation points. In order for water to boil it needs somewhere to start bubbling from. This can be a small crack or a piece of dust. But if you have exceptionally clean cups and water then there may not be anywhere for the water to boil from. This is when you end up being able to heat the water to warmer then boiling without actually boiling the water. If you then add a nucleation point to the water it will all boil quite suddenly.</p>
<p>However milk have lots of nucleation points as it contains lots of tiny lumps of fat, protein and sugar. So you would not be able to superheat milk.</p></div>		</li>
