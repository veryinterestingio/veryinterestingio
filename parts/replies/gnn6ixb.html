These are essential information for measuring the composition of an atmosphere or learn about cloud coverage. So imaging is revealing a lot more than the existence of planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ok, the star light is at first order good old Planck radiation, entirely polarized. Planets have two types of radiation: they scatter the light form their host stars and they radiate the heat in the infrared. The scattered part from the planet (visible and near infrared light) will be linearly polarized. There are polarimeters out there that can detect very precisely the small contribution in linear polarisation from the planet in the presence of all the light from the very bright host star ...</p></div>		</li>
