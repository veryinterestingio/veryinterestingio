<p>Most people either don't take the time to dig through the details of earnings reports or they don't have the knowledge necessary to interpret them .. or both.  </p>
<p>For anyone interested, there's a good book called Financial Shenanigans written by a forensic accountant that is a very good overview of things to look out for when attempting to evaluate the long-term health of a company.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was a bunch of buzz when someone shared their observation that an Altria owned (or co-owned?) plane was flying up to a Canadian airport near publicly traded weed companies. It was mostly speculation without someone on the ground seeing who is using the plane.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But you arent competing against those people are you? When you purchase/sell, you are competing against the multibillion dollar firms who manage trillions in assets. You arent competing against Uncle Joe who spent 10 grand on the stock market. Uncle Joe isnt going to find arbitrage opportunities; it is going to be the huge firms. For the rest, who dont own &gt;1billion$ to invest; reading The Financial Times is realistically just a hobby/intellectual pursuit. All the common man needs to have is basic common sense and knowing to reduce risk/not being greedy.</p>
<p>The amount of difference in gains from studying trading strategies and books, etc to invest any small sum would be so small that any rational person would rather spend that time at improving whatever craft that is their main livelihood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Arbitrage has no place in an investment strategy.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can fly drones over oil refineries to see how much stock is in the tanks too. The tanks have floating roofs so they go up and down depending on how much is stored. There are also webcams focused on flare stacks, gas flaring is a sign that a unit is being started or stopped.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Satellite imagery is also an option. There are companies you can pay a few hundred/thousand dollars to take a picture of an area at a certain time via satellite.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Commodity traders use satellite images to estimate global oil reserves of oil companies. So yes, it is used and is super interesting! As an aside, these satellite based estimates are sometimes more accurate than the numbers the companies have themselves.</p></div>		</li>
