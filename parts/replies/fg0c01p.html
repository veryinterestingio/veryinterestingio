<p>Question about this: Since there is a lot of data about transportation means and usage available nowadays and even detailed map data, couldn't you also build statistical models of large areas, even whole countries or the whole world, that take those into account? I think I've seen such models, but I was wondering how fine-grained they are. For example, using mobile phone location data you could in theory even get estimate of pedestrian movements and how many others they could possibly infect, etc. There are also many mobile apps with live data from public transport of many major cities, so there should be plenty of data sources.</p>
<p>Wouldn't this make the models more accurate?</p></div>		</li>

In general the task goes from having a simple set of differential equations that you can write out by hand and for which you calculate the stable equilibria to having simulations that quickly become too much to run on a single laptop.
I can't actually speak to what folks have done for this outbreak--I'm guessing there are many, many people trying to model the spatial spread/risk of nCoV-2019 using a bunch of different methods, including using data sources you mention. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6227252/" target="_blank">Here's</a> a recent review paper that summaries common methods for modelling pandemics.
One other thing--it's worth keeping in mind George Box's quote &quot;All models are wrong, but some are useful.&quot; There is no amount of data you could throw into a model that will tell you exactly how something like this is going to play out. You don't necessarily need an insane amount of granular data to model where public health resources should be best deployed. Heck, you probably don't even need a mathematical model for that.</p></div>		</li>
