			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting answer. Slightly off topic, what do you think about the role psychedelics in treating depression? There's so much of anectodal evidence that it's hard ignore.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This seems like a weird way to simplify it, when in another response below this you mention Pharmacological treatments as something able to show significant gains...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what about controlled treatment/experiments they’re doing with psychedelics in the presence of psychotherapists? It seems like that is becoming more prevalent and has shown some promising results in treating specifically PTSD and anxiety. I’d have to go dig for studies but I’ve seen a couple pop up on r/ science the last couple months.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hey there, fellow Clinical Psychologist. I have to imagine this statement is an extreme generalization but just to clarify, does this mean you think psychotropic medications shouldn't be used? Hopefully you don't think that someone with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder or other disorders with a large biological component should not be taking some kind of psychotropic medication to help manage symptoms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally (clinical depression and 1 major suicide attempt/involuntary sectioning plus a bunch of self-harming) it really depends on how you personally react to what is around you.  I had 3 therapists aswell as months of CBT along side a few medications. They were citalopram, sertraline and eventually settled on mirtazapine (UK names).  Roughly its been a long journey. The first medication and therapy when i was around 17 (10years ago) things got better but i was acting out of adolescents and eventually refused treatment as i was &quot;better than this&quot;. I was not. I got serious about it again in 2015, sertraline and talk therapy wasnt working. Moved to mirtazapine and talk therapy and it was different but still rather low. Talk therapy was alright, until it wasnt the right fit for me. Internalised bias of this is worthless stopped my progression with it. I opted for lifestyle changes and CBT, admittedly i hardly stuck to my original plan and then factors resulted in the whole sectioning episode. After this, i got serious about never going back. A lot of mental work, grinding out motivation even though i didnt want to, eating better, exercise as well as a maximum dosage of mirtazapine slowly but surely pulled me out. It took around 2 years of solid work. Personally identifying factors around me that were harmful and removing myself from those (a lot of drug and alcohol abuse.) Now, im still on medication but looking to taper off soon. I will say its hard to back yourself but the main thing i thought the entire time is, now is the only thing i control, the past has happened and the future depends on right now. Always now, only now. Its a struggle but out of darkness cometh light. There isnt really a time frame but if you desire to improve you can. Glhf</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid explanation.</p>
<p>As one suffering with major depression I can share that lack of drive and <em>motivation</em> to learn is also a consequence. </p>
<p>Also a combination of meds and therapy for me has been most helpful than either alone. I had my <a href="http://www.darthcontinent.com/2017/12/discovering-my-genome.html" target="_blank">DNA</a> analyzed as well and discovered that I'm genetically predisposed for certain kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor" target="_blank">SSRIs</a> are some 7 times less effective for me. Once I found an effective regimen of medication, that with counseling helped; just being able to talk to a complete stranger helped me put things in perspective and helped me follow the counselor's lead on developing both short- and long-term action plans.</p></div>		</li>
