			<div class="markdown"><p>So not sure about all of East Europe but I know when Poland got into the EU their stock market and GDP took off for like 5 years as they were getting some payments from other EU members that I cannot remember the specifics of anymore.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also this is the time period where China really started becoming a middle-class country and was buying everything and the world had not caught up to their demand yet. Any country that was commodity-rich (ag,oil, mining) really benefited from this time period.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>China's per capita per person median income is $1,700 versus the world average of $10,000 and the USA's $15,000. They are not a middle class country, not even close. They do have some areas in cities that are middle class but even there they still don't have a lot of cash for discretionary consumer spending, at least not at the level someone in the west would enjoy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The period between 1995 and 2000 saw almost all of the current Eastern European EU member states receive approval to begin the process of joining the Union, eventually acceding to it by the early- to mid 2000s. The liberalisation of their markets and the push to meet economic targets set by the EU as a prerequisite for membership meant that their economies accelerated much faster than the rest of the global economy did at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Balkans specifically it was finally a time of relative peace after the tumultuous 90s. When the future of the region and the state of infrastructure are both in peril and refugees and displaced people are struggling to find safety the economy is bound to suffer. And these wars and state disintegration occurred after the fall of communist Yugoslavia as well as communist global power. So the 2000s found the Balkans to have a lot of room for growth, new opportunities for trade and development, and cheap workforce eager for prosperity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was gonna say I thought the US was already experiencing a downturn before 9/11 rather than a direct result.<br />
Definitely wasn't following that closely because I was in middle school.<br />
Just remember people's parents starting small businesses in the late 90s and getting hit pretty hard around that time.</p></div>		</li>
