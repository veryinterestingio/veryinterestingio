			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note. If all you took were those two extra strength tylenols (500 mg), your liver is fine. Thanks for sharing your story.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For a grown man I know 1500mg of tylenol within an hour isn't good for you, but it -shouldn't- cause any permanent damage assuming you don't do this often, or much at all.</p>
<p>But I was still a teen at the time, so I imagine it might've been worse for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People have taken much more Vicodin or Percocet and lived to tell the tale. Like multiple grams more. Not saying it's healthy or ok to do, but it's been done. 1500mg of tylenol once isn't gonna do anything unless you have severe liver problems. The highest recommended daily dose is 4000mg, iirc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you are in your teenage years its actually better than when you are older. I sprained my hip and my doctor told me to take 3-4 tylenol because my metabolism would just consume it faster. He said that if i only took 1-2 than my metabolism would process it too fast for it to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At that point in time I was living with my mother and mother's side grandparents in a big apartment. (Dad passed away when I was 4)</p>
<p>I &quot;told&quot; my mother almost immediately when she woke me up.</p>
<p>I wrote told in quotation marks because I told her I'd stayed up straight for &quot;days&quot;.</p>
<p>She called me an idiot and berated me but didn't ask me to be any more specific. I saw no reason to say anything else that might've gotten me into trouble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted elsewhere here about a 100hr stint I did and I can say it wasn't fun. </p>
<p>What's interesting is I'm just coming of the back of a marathon run of sleepless nights. Last week I had 5hrs sleep over 5 nights and then finished it with 48 straight hours awake. The thing you mentioned about EVERYTHING being physically tired, despite no exercise, is so very true. I was remarking to my SO Friday night after I'd finished my last exam how tired/sore everything was. I felt like I'd torn my hamstring it was so tight and tender, naturally my back ached a lot, my forearms/shoulders felt like I'd just come off a 10 weights session and my ankles/feet like I'd run a marathon. </p>
<p>It took until today to feel normal again :/ Weird how a lack of sleep does that to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm: I've stayed up most recently between 36-72 hours before, I wrote in a journal to keep myself occupied during the quiet hours. It took me minutes to write a single letter, and I remember blacking out and having to reread what I had been writing to remember what I was trying to write down. </p>
<p>I've also had a parent wake me up worried since I'd been asleep for a day or so. Time travel is weird. </p></div>		</li>
