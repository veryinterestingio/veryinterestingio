			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is a very important distinction from colorising something that was originally black and white.</p>
<p>A lot of early 70s colour BBC programs were filmed on colour videotape but because the videotape reels were so big and expensive, overseas sales of the episodes were done on black and white telerecordings (aka kinescopes) which were 16mm films made by pointing a film camera at video screen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it was BBC policy to re-use video tapes after a certain length of time, so the original colour masters got wiped and all that remained was a B&amp;W film version.</p>
<p>Fortunately a side effect of the telerecording process was that the original analogue colour signal in the picture created a visible artefact known as chroma dots, which on a high resolution scan could be used to re-create the original colours and mix it with the black and white film recording.</p>
<p>Here’s a short example of the kind of quality the colour recovery can give, you’d almost never know it was made from a black and white recording! <a href="https://youtu.be/br7tiYYSonU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/br7tiYYSonU</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume that it was future proofing or something. You had colour cinema at that point, I'm not sure about how widespread colour television was. Colour TV broadcasts existed in the US from the 50s so its possible that it was a consideration.</p>
<p>But then again, the way they treated the doctor who tapes and others of the time makes me question that assumption.</p></div>		</li>
