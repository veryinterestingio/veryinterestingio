Although the ice sheets extended further south than they do now, they didn't cover the entire continent.  The range of Alligator probably expanded and contracted as climate warmed and cooled, but the southeasternmost part of the continent was always warm enough for alligators.</p>

<p>Alligators are, in general, more cold-tolerant than crocodiles.</p>
