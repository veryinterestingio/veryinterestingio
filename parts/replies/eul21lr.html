			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm only familiar with common mode rejection in the context of electronics, and in those cases you're generally dealing with something far less &quot;noisy&quot; and complex than a nuclear detonation.
This isn't so much a case of two waves constructively or destructively interfering; it's a complex interaction of high and low pressure regions, driven by enormous shockwaves. The reflected shockwave travels in the low pressure region created in the wake of the primary wave. As a result (in the case of something with such an enormous and long-lived shockwave as a nuke) this shockfront can effective merge with the primary, and thereby increase the overpressure region ahead and low pressure region behind. It's not a matter of the shockwave itself constructively or destructively interferfering with its reflection; if it happens (I don't honestly know) it's a drop in a huge bucket and doesnt' matter for the purposes of Mach stem formation and result for drag sensitive targets. </p>
<p>It's a subject with a <em>ton</em> of depth, but if you enjoy this subject, it's worth it. </p>

<p>The highlight as it regards your question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reflected shock wave is formed which travels behind the incident wave. Because the air behind the incident wave is hotter and more dense than the air in front of it, the reflected wave travels faster than the
incident wave. Under certain conditions, the reflected wave may catch up to the incident wave, merge with it and thus reinforce the incident shockwave (See figure 1). The region in which there is a separate and distinct reflected shock is called the regular reflection region. The region where the shock wave is reinforced by the reflected wave is called the irregular or Mach. reflection region. The top of the Mach stem is called the triple point. At  this point, three shocks (the Mach stem, the incident wave, and the reflected wave) converge.
...</p>
<p>In recent years, laboratory experiments have discovered that there are several different forms of Mach reflection, namely single Mach reflection, complex Mach reflection, and double Mach reflection. The phenomenon observed at large distances (about equal to the HOB) is the single Mach reflection. At very close distances and high overpressures,complex Mach reflection and double Mach reflection may occur. These effects further increase the overpressure on  the ground and thus may increase the danger to reinforced structures on the ground. Because this* -report primarily concerns the effects seen by airborne vehicles, the single Mach reflection will be assumed in all cases.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth adding that not only are you wasting a lot of the bomb's energy digging a hole, you're also creating a heck of a lot of fallout by detonating at ground level. </p>
<p>So what is Fallout? It's fine dirt and dust that gets kicked up by a nuclear explosion, and becomes radioactive. If you breath it in or ingest something contaminated by it, it gets deep inside your body where it can cause radiation poisoning and cancer. It's the single most dangerous aftereffect of a nuclear blast. (See &quot;Black Rain&quot; in reference to Hiroshima and Nagasaki)</p>
<p>When you explode a bomb at ground level, the force ejects a lot of debris straight up into the atmosphere, which becomes fallout. This material then gets picked up by prevailing winds, spreading a dangerous radioactive cloud far from the epicentre of the explosion. Including places where you don't want it to be. You can check out <a href="http://www.nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/" target="_blank">NUKEMAP</a> to see exactly how far these clouds can travel given a particular bomb yield. Needless to say, if you ground detonated a Trident missile, same used on US and British nuclear submarines, in downtown New York, depending on the wind speed, the fallout could reach as far as Boston or Washington DC. </p>
<p>Airburst bombs also produce fallout. But it tends to push material down and out, rather than straight up. So it's usually confined to the bomb's blast radius.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The way I understand it, airburst produces no meaningful fallout, even right below. There is only the bomb material itself to &quot;work with&quot; and it manages to be vaporized into such fine particles that the radioactive dust just stays suspended in the air, dispersed in three dimensions.</p>
<p>On the ground there's a lot more material interacting with the fireball, producing larger particles that the radionuclides can piggyback on, and which are too heavy to be carried by air currents, so they fall out (hence, fallout).</p>
<p>There is also a component of fallout that consists of neutron-activated radionuclides. If it's on the ground, there's plenty of material nearby to activate, which also ends up in those larger dust particles.</p>
<p>In the air, you only have, well, air around the bomb, and while it's obviously just as possible to activate nitrogen and oxygen nuclei in the air, they will stay as just individual atoms/molecules, and just like the fine particulate of the bomb material, will not fall out of the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, airburst produces less fallout.  Ground impact radiates every single atom of dirt, the mushroom cloud lofts it into the air, and then it descends following wind patterns.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The point of the nuke is the overpressure wave, (and maybe in this day the EMP),  not the thermal pulse, or radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The long term ramification in the use is the key. You are generally trying to devastate a place so that eventually you can take it militarily. Making it a giant radioactive wasteland makes it harder to do that. The fallout tends to move, alot. High level winds can carry fallout half way round the world. </p>
<p>Nuke someone with a ground burst and you will piss off everyone to the right of them on the globe. Including probably yourself if you do more than one or two. </p>
<p>So it comes down to reason for the nuke, part of a single, startegic strike as an opening gambit in a war, or a religious or last ditch fuck you to your enemies. For instance I would bet that the US/Russian cold war retalitory strike were gonna mostly be ground targets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short term physical damage of the bomb will be maximised as an airburst in order to take advantage of the shockwave. If you are looking to cause long term effects with fallout, then yes, a groundburst would be the most effective. Just depends on what you are trying to do.</p></div>		</li>
