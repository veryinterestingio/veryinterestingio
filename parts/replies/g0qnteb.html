			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for providing an actual explanation as to why the lunula is actually white.</p>
<p>My pet peeve on this sub is answers that say what the thing is called and maybe what it's for but don't explain what it actually is or what makes it the way it is. Both the top answers on this thread are just &quot;that's the lunula, it's there because that's where the nail grows from&quot; which isn't an explanation at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lunula is white because it has a thick layer of dermis (deepest skin layer) between the nail and the blood vessels. The part of the nail that is pink does not have this thick layer. There is barely anything between the nail and the blood vessels, giving it the pink color since blood is red. The part of your nail you cut off is white because thereâ€™s just air behind it.</p></div>		</li>
