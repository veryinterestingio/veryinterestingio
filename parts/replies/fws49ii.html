			<div class="markdown"><p>My family used to get paid $50 a month each in the mid 2000s to carry little black pager looking things that picked up broadcast signals from television and radio and we had to dock them each night at a set time.</p>
<p>It had a accelerometer so it knew if you had it on you and would record which if it didn't you didn't get paid for that day. We used to hang it on a oscillating fan if someone forgot it that day and leave the TV on stuff we liked. </p>
<p>I was in highschool so that was like a bonus (we never had allowances) for me.</p></div>		</li>
