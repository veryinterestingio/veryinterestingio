			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about a single drop just means that some species of shark can detect on part of blood per 10 billion parts water. </p>
<p>So if you only bleed one drop, maybe they don't find you. But say a drop is emitted here and another 50m away, they could theoretically track that smell to the source. Or that single drop was diluted over the course of 50+ meters and they can follow that line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation. Unfortunately in all the movies with sharks somebody just bleeds or they throw some meat into the water and then bang, &quot;the big shark&quot; is there.</p></div>		</li>
