			<div class="markdown"><p>Because with RH scissors, when you use your right hand, it slightly leverages the two blades together - because of the pivot point. When you use RH scissors with your left hand, you're actually pulling the blades away from each other, making them not shear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scissors are put together the way the are because during the action of using them we tend to push the thumb and fingers in opposite directions, and most people are right handed.  You can cut paper just fine with your left hand it's just a different technique.  Your thumb needs to pull the top arm of the scissors instead of pushing it while your fingers push on the bottom.  Bit of practise of that and paying attention to how the scissor arms lever on the rivet should get you there.  It's easier to practise with an old crap scissors because they tend to be looser and the levering is more obvious.</p></div>		</li>
