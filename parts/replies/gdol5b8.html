			<div class="markdown"><p>My Therapist actually told me something very similar. When you start spiraling with anxiety you need something to break through the spiral. This could be many things and cold water is definitely a good one. He recommended actually going in the shower and putting it on as cold as possible. He said that if you were to jump into a cold lake (or any other body of water) you cant think about your anxiety anymore. The shower is trying to replicate that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to try is mindfulness. It doesn't have to be some like.. hippy new age thing. For me, I just focus on my breathing; really paying attention to the feeling of inhaling and exhaling. There are plenty of other things you can do besides breathing. Just as long as it's something you can focus on besides the anxiety or intrusive thoughts or whatever unwanted feeling. It could be focusing on things you can see, hear, touch, etc. What works for one person might not work for another.</p>
<p>It does take some time to get in the habit of mindfulness at first, but it gets easier over time.</p>
<p>And as an added bonus, mindfulness starts to bleed into other aspects of your life. I have found that I'm less impulsive and really think about things before I say them. I'm also learning to control my eating habits with it. Really trying to acknowledge that I'm hungry or full and not just bored or using food as a coping mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>[See my comment above] (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/k1hvdt/eli5_why_does_washing_your_face_refresh_and_wake/gdp6av2" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/k1hvdt/eli5_why_does_washing_your_face_refresh_and_wake/gdp6av2</a>). It's a life changer if you have bad anxiety. I started I'm the summer in our local lake (only 2 minutes from our house), 5 minutes in the morning would sort me for most of the day. But then when the weather got bad I switched to the shower. Meditation is a great help too. There's a breathing/meditation technique called &quot;breath of fire&quot; that works wonders too. A 10 minute  meditation with that in the morning and a hot/cold shower has made a massive difference to my life over the last 6 months. I haven't made nearly as much progress in the previous 2 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can go even further than just splashing cold water on your face.</p>
<p>In Dialectical Behavior Therapy, people use a method called TIPP to help calm them down.</p>
<p>T: Temperature (cool your face with ice or something)</p>
<p>I: Intense Exercise (like pushups or squats)</p>
<p>P: Paced Breathing (there are apps for this)</p>
<p>P: Paired Muscle Relaxation (consciously relaxing your muscles from head to toe)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dbt+tipp" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/search?q=dbt+tipp</a></p>
<p>The intense exercise's goal is to exhaust the sympathetic nervous system which controls your flight/fight/freeze response which is related to anxiety.</p></div>		</li>
