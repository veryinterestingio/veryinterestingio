Sls free toothpaste helped me a little, but I still received sores whenever I bit myself on accident.</p>
<p>After taking lysine daily for a month I went from 1-2 per month to 1-2 per year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the sore. I've had many many sores that are mildly irritating or barely noticeable. I've also had one or two (generally on the bottom of my tongue) that were so bad I could barely eat for days. I suspect it depends on how close they are to certain nerve clusters. A bad one + an irritant (ex: salt) could be excruciating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before I switched toothpaste mine were absolutely awful. Whenever I tried to eat or anything the pain was unbearable. The best way I can explain it is the feeling when you pop a zit on your lip or something and you feel horrible pain all throughout your face. The difference is with canker sores it feels like that constantly.</p></div>		</li>
