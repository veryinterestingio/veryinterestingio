			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Skatingraccoon Your first paragraph was great, but your second didn't really explain or compare about computer searches which is rather important when the question is comparing the two!</p>
<p>/u/sortacorrect to expand on the first paragraph from the previous poster, if searching on your computer is taking minutes, you're likely searching non indexed locations, so unlike the google search that only has to look in an index, your computer has actually to trawl through the contents of your hard drive. To use the analogy from the first paragraph your computer has to actually drive around to find what you're looking for. </p>
<p>If you only search in indexed locations (by default your users folder) the search can be very quick, just like the google search.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be quick, but often isn't, even with indexing on, and will result in incomplete hits almost always unless your search term happens to be in the filename. Windows indexing is just garbage.</p></div>		</li>
