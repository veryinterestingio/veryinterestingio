			<div class="markdown"><p>Does an increase in estrogen production cause a corresponding decrease in testosterone production? If not, then while your overall percentage of testosterone would shrink, you would likely still produce the same amount of red blood cells, since the absolute amount of testosterone has not decreased.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that hormonal birth controls are prone to raising women's blood pressure, not dropping it, this seems unlikely.</p>
<p>If you're looking for an explanation of why you have POTS, as far as I know, there isn't a scientific consensus on what causes it. It is definitely more prevalent in women, and it is more prevalent in those with Ehlers-Danlos and other connective tissue disorders (aka, if you are super flexible or your skin is super stretchy or you have a history of multiple joint dislocations, etc). I know that one hypothesis for what causes it is that a virus kicks it off by causing a malfunction of the nervous system. I've also seen another hypothesis that POTS is frequently preceded by a viral infection because being sick causes a few-day stint on the couch, which causes a rapid de-conditioning of the heart.  Long story short, you should probably ask your doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do have EDS but other that a specialist diagnosing it, I've not seen anyone. I went to 2 cardiologists who ran a bunch of tests but and the end of the day just told me to drink more and eat more salt. And then after a number of years it just stopped. Just as suddenly as it started.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but this myth has been disproven, most notably by the fact that post-menopausal women do not see an uptick in red blood cell percentage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a scientist, be careful with potentially wrongful conclusions. From the facts that you presented  the fact that post menopausal women do not see an uptick in red blood cell percentage could be related to many factors that are not hormone related. Age-related, oxidative stress -related body alterations could also be behind it. Hell even body mass shifts with ageing could cause changes in the bone marrow stem cell niche and can be independent of hormonal flux. .. Just bringing some healthy criticism to the table, hormonal chemical crosswalk might very well play a determining role, but at the same time might not. Its important to our job to always keep an open mind about stuff and consider all options until they are proven not to be an option. Or we might fall prey again to healing wounds with toad skin or vinegar etc...</p></div>		</li>
