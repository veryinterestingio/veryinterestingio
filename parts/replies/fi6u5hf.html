			<div class="markdown"><p>What's going to be morbidly interesting for me is when they find Khodemchuk's remains under the 'pile' seen in the <a href="https://i.redd.it/wb614jem75131.jpg" target="_blank">bottom of this photo</a>.</p>
<p>For reference, that pile <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tSUHbM9.jpg" target="_blank">is this part of the plant</a>. You can see how they built the Sarcophagus over it <a href="https://i.4pcdn.org/tv/1557408762045.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> without actually removing anything since it contains graphite and fuel chunks. </p>
<p>During the deconstruction of the Sarcophagus, one of the key things they're going to have to do is dismantle this as it's, obviously, an unstable foundation but also contains more radioactive elements that need to be dealt with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously. Kodemchuk did not die of radiation poisoning. If anything, he may briefly have been a pink mist before simply not being anymore.</p>
<p>I've encountered people talking about finding him before on reddit, and it seems like it's a meme of some kind, but there is absolutely zero chance there's anything to find.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming there are remains, I'm going to hazard that they'd be mummified. I'd think the radiation would keep them sterilized and bacteria free, so they shouldn't suffer much in the way of decomposition.</p>
<p>That being said, I find it highly unlikely there are any remains to find.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What’s fascinating to me is your last photo. Based on the time it would have been taken, and the quality, I’m assuming it was shot on film. Radiation has a massive effect on film, and will warp &amp; fog it up very quickly. For example, send a loaded film camera through an airport scanner and your dynamic range is essentially gone. I’m curious how that photo was made with accurate highlights and shadows so close to so much radiation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because most of the Radiation streaming out of that is directional. The threats around the plant came from radioactive gasses and particles, the super high amounts of radiation come from the fuel which will be directional, ie, you don't want to be above it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From reading the wiki article on it:</p>
<p>&quot;The site is due to be fully decommissioned by 2120 at a cost of £121bn.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm...  not used to reading about projects in the 22nd century, even if only ending then. I had to reread it a few times before I realized the &quot;2120&quot; reference was the date and not some other piece of numerical data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the cool read! Also it should be noted that they DO know what's in B30 and B38 (nuclear waste from reactors in the 60's and 70's), they just don't know exactly how much of it and what specifically is there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not only is it said to be the most contaminated site on Earth (I'm not sure by what standard), the Soviets at the time also decided to use the disaster as a real life experiment to see what'd happen the population that remained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Varying levels of dangerous. See the official site I linked above. There is a heat map. I took a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wIiYEEU.jpg" target="_blank">screenshot</a> on mobile for convince. </p>
<p>The things that are most dangerous are of course closest to where the core was. There's also the 'magma' that melted down in the basement. Otherwise dust would be very deadly to humans as it can be inhaled. </p>
<p>Just standing in the structure though is safe, you don't receive a very high dosage. The dangerous stuff is all handled by robots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, everything is presumed to have radioactive dust on it. The New Safe Confinement includes remotely operated scarifiers and grit blasters to remove the contaminated surfaces of concrete and steel respectively. For elements of the sarcophagus (and structures built to supplement it), and parts of the building far from the reactor core, that will be sufficient.</p>
<p>Second, any material exposed to a lot of neutron radiation can potentially be made radioactive itself. This will include things that have been sitting next to highly radioactive materials since the explosion, things that were exposed to the neutron burst that caused the explosion, and things that got irradiated in the course of normal reactor operation. There is a lot more variability here, because the lifetime of the radiation depends on what radioisotopes were formed, and that depends on what the material is made of. Some elements decay to a stable form quickly, and some don't. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.13182/NT01-A3230" target="_blank">In an intact reactor of the same design,</a> everything except the fuel channel pipes (and, I assume, the fuel itself) is supposed to be safe to handle within 100 years. But in the ruined reactor, pieces of those are going to be in all sorts of crazy places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For things becoming radioactive: Are things made radioactive cause the neutron radiation is basically being injected into their atomic structure? Or is it causing different atomic changes?
This is what I was curious about. Radioactive dust sounds annoying.
Thanks for the in-depth answers!</p></div>		</li>
