			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on where you are in the Country. From what I’m told, in Winnipeg it’s usually done in watts per square meter or some such, rather than a “feels like” temperature. In Vancouver, it’s just the temperature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Uh, what does psychology have to do with it? Wind blows away the pocket of warm air surrounding you, increasing the rate heat leaves your body....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This article really speaks to me. As someone who grew up in Winnipeg, I am often frustrated hearing people on reddit throughout the lower 48 of the USA in winter brag about it being &quot;-40 F&quot; when it's actually -15 F with an almost meaningless &quot;feels like&quot; temperature. In fact, almost no one in those places has ever experienced a -40, yet they're convinced it happens all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I'm in Minneapolis, where it reached -28°F this past winter. Even then, when it's absolutely freezing, people still would say it was -40 outside. I saw a lot of screenshots of weather apps which displayed the &quot;real feel&quot; more prominently over the actual temperature. It's cold enough as is, there's no need to brag about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am from Maine and this is definitely true, windchill can matter and does have an impact when day skiing because you are at elevation and it can be very strong but they don’t do “feels like” because that is relative and layers</p></div>		</li>
