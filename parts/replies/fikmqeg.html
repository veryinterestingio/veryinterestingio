			<div class="markdown"><p>I love curious questions like this! It depends on what gases are present. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-discharge_lamp" target="_blank">Wikipedia has a good explanation here </a> </p>
<p>I did an experiment in engineering school involving electric arcs in a vacuum, and that one was a super bright white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer this in its entirety:</p>
<p>Electricity has no color. Any color seen has to do with the particular elements that are available in that environment. Neon* signs, plasma globes, and lightning are the color they are because of the elements that become ionized. Consider the color of lightning or meteor trails on other planets.</p>
<p>*Neon signs are an umbrella term that refer to a low pressure gas in a glass tube with a cathode and anode at either end and a small amount of mercury within. Even though they are called &quot;neon signs&quot;, neon isn't used in every type. Other colors are made by using other gases and/or glass/coatings. A similar method is used in fluorescent lighting but the light comes from flourescence (phosphor coating on the inside of the bulb gives off light when excited by the UV given off by the ionized gas on the inside).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought and actual neon tube wouldn't have mercury in it.</p>
<p>I thought the ones with Mercury were mainly UV tubes or the fluorescent tubes which use the phosphor coating which &quot;converts&quot; the UV to white light?</p></div>		</li>
