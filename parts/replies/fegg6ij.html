			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah Iâ€™d say spending stimulates more spending and it stimulates economic growth through more jobs, more investments, more education, etc rather than specifically the government getting more in tax. </p>
<p>Unless the government pumps that back out to society by improving infrastructure, healthcare, education, etc. </p>
<p>Which in turn might stimulate more spending and growth again.</p>
<p>And money going to the government and out to all the people can usually be a better thing than money going into the hands of Gates, Buffet and Bezos. Or their shareholders and fellow board members. </p>
<p>How much of that money will the common man in the U.S see?</p></div>		</li>
