			<div class="markdown"><p>Any long term change is worth seeing a doctor if you have affordable access. If anything changes in your life, such as no longer getting an erection in the morning, it indicates something changed inside you. It's usually worth figuring out what changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should see a doctor. I'm over 30 and still get as many erections as I ever did. Still jerk off twice most days. Still get morning wood. If you aren't anymore, it might just be an aging thing, but it also might be a sign of cardiovascular health issues or low T.</p></div>		</li>
