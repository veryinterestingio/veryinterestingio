			<div class="markdown"><p>Unions might be an argument for a city or a country, but there are plenty of non unionised places in the world that donâ€™t have autonomous trains. </p>
<p>The real reason is that it costs far far more to upgrade existing systems than it will save in wages </p>
<p>But new systems are fair game. And to piggy back off your coal example, iron ore mines in Australia are moving to both autonomous trains and autonomous trucks </p>

<p>This entirely varies by number of engines. Though 5 engine is certainly not a common sight at all, I'd agree. 1-2 is the most common in my area, with the odd 3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A loaded coal car is about 130 tons. A coal train usually has between 115-130 cars. On the high end they would weigh 18,000 tons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More than 17,000 tons and you will break draw bars and coupling knuckles. </p>
<p>Also, $100k is common for engineers and conductors.  </p>
<p>Finally, automation is easy when there is consistency in train makeup, such as passenger cars. It becomes much more difficult when mixed manifest trains come to play. A 130 ton car rolls in a much different fashion than an empty flat car. Also, a mostly filled tank car moves erratically when the liquid inside sloshes around. A trained engineer can feel the character of a train and adjust to the situation as needed; an algorithm cannot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think for a second that having a live person somehow insulates you from any liability you're insane. If a person is working for a company, and that person makes a mistake, it's 100% the companies fault, you don't get to blame the person and keep all your money. Besides no lawyer in the world would sue the person instead of the company. A person has to be just about criminally purposefully wreckless to even have a chance of avoiding liability, even then that doesn't absolve the company from liability. I'm not sure what youre getting at but a human in now way reduces liability </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What eliminating a person would do, is create liability for the company creating the automated system.  If you remove the person, you remove the responsible party and put it on software and/or hardware.  It's why Tesla and Boeing are having PR issues now.  We are only to happy to blame a person; it's normal for a person to screw up .  But a software issue?  It's the programmer, or manager, or company who made the software.  </p>
<p>If I'm a software company, how can I assume liability for all my software for all use-cases under all conditions?  No fucking way, that's how.  My disclaimer will say &quot;an operator should always be immediately able to assume control of the vehicle in case of emergency&quot;.</p>
<p>It's the same reason why there are still pilots, and why we will always have truck drivers.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then liability would be on the system manufacture, in that case rail companies would love it. Liability would be on the automated system operator not the company. </p>
<p>If you use your analogy Lion Air would have been liable if it was found the pilot was at fault, but since the automated system was designed and implemented by Boeing then Boeing is at fault. In the case of trains, if you have an automated system and it fails, the operator of the automated system would be at fault, that's an argument for automated systems being implemented not against.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say it eliminates, I said it reduces the payment. Sure no one reasonable would ever sue the operator, but the insurance company will use &quot;it was the actions of one rogue employee&quot; argument as often as they can in front of a jury to make the jury give a lower number.</p></div>		</li>
