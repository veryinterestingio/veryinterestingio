<p>Edit: thanks for the silver! In exchange I will send you one half full and one half empty battery :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different types of batteries are designed to work differently, like with different discharge rates and voltages. As long as the batteries you are using are working together they are fine, but using different types or one half discharged etc. will make them work against each other and deplete or degrade them more quickly making your batteries not work even if it looks like they are working fine when you first put the different types together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rechargeable batteries have less juice than &quot;normal&quot; batteries. So if you put them together the normal batteries will try and force more juice into the smaller ones, which is bad.</p>
<p>This may cause them to get really warm, which makes them not last as long (or do other, worse things).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two normal batteries where one has less juice also forces juice in the smaller battery.
If the batteries are made out of the light metal (lithium) then this can go boom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A battery is like a horse, each one its own strength and purpose. There are horses which are strong, others are fast. If you want to pull a carriage better use two strong horses of the same type.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if you put one fast and one strong, the strong one will have more load, while the fast will had an excessive load and will get tired really quickly leaving most of the job to the strong one. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But let's say we are talking Roman horse races with small carriages and fast horses. The strong horse could do well for a while, but won't be able to keep up for long. They other fast horse won't be able to be as fast either. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you'll be putting down up to 4 horses if you are not careful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different voltages is not actually a problem, noone designs consumer electronics where you have to put in batteries in parallel, that is far too likely to cause problems with unbalanced cells, even if users were to pay attention, which they won't. If a device needs more current, it will simply require bigger batteries, not more in parallel, and if even D cells aren't strong enough, it will have a rechargable lithium ion battery.</p>
<p>As for batteries in series, if the device uses only two cells, you most likely don't have to worry either, as reverse-charging one of the cells would require first completely discharging it to 0 volts--which would leave the device with the voltage of only one cell to work with (so, at most half of the nominal voltage), which it most likely just won't, so you'll notice before anything bad happens.</p>
<p>Really, this is largely a problem of the past: The problem was primarily with devices that used, like, 6 cells in series, where the voltage of 5 of those cells (so, 7.5 instead of the nominal 9 volts) usually will still be perfectly fine to keep the thing running, so the empty battery would be reverse-charged with the user not suspecting anything. But devices that use more than two cells are getting kinda rare: Anything that requires any non-trivial amount of power nowadays usually will come with rechargable lithium-ion batteries, only devices with pretty low power use will use separate user-replacable battery cells anyway, plus modern electronics usually require much less voltage to begin with and/or modern switching regulators can efficiently produce those voltages from one or two cells just fine.</p>
<p>Also, while we are at it: <strong>Don't ever buy &quot;heavy duty&quot; batteries.</strong> Always buy alkaline--or rechargeable, where that makes sense. Zinc-carbon batteries (that are often sold labeled as &quot;heavy duty&quot;) are just terrible, they have much lower capacity, are much more likely to leak, have higher self-discharge (i.e., loss of charge without use), and higher resistance. Their only advantage is that they are cheap per piece, but the higher price of alkaline cells is worth every cent. Manufacturers tends to try and obfuscate that they are selling terrible batteries, but then, anyone selling alkaline cells will advertise that, so, if the packaging and/or cell does not say &quot;alkaline&quot;, don't buy.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, as there seems to be a lot of confusion about that in this thread as well: Your typical 1.2/1.5 V battery is not going to explode or to catch fire, no matter how you mix batteries. Anything with lithium in it is somewhat risky, but then, that's why you normally can't replace individual high-energy lithium cells in consumer devices. The worst thing that will happen with zinc-carbon/alkaline/NiMH battery cells is that some electrolyte will leak out and corrode the battery contacts in your gadget, or other metal in the device if you are really unlucky. Usually, that's a problem that can be fixed with some sand paper.</p></div>		</li>
