			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  It’s all about volume. Over time the casino will make money on all games they offer. Otherwise they wouldn’t offer them. </p>
<p>Blackjack for instance - dealers are often graded on how quickly they deal. More hands per hour = more money for the casino over time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that mean you went to Vegas once in the past 11 years, or you went there once 11 years ago, and you're still there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are all very good points.  One thing that really helps casinos is people's gambling mentality.  Most people that go to a casino don't walk away when they win.  They leave when they lose or when they have been playing way too long usually. </p>
<p>I have seen lots of people sit down at a blackjack table that gets hot to make a lot of money and then just stay until they lose it all.  If they do make a wise choice the casino will probably comp the room and food if they won enough.  That way you will play again and hopefully lose some or all of that money back to them.  If you are in vegas for a week and plan to play a lot of blackjack you probably aren't going to quit the first day if you get up $1500.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surprised this was so far down.  The simplest advantage is that all the dealers are pros while most of the players are Random Q Doofus.</p></div>		</li>
