			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a company that carries out, for example, structural deformation monitoring. We often use traditional survey techniques, aerial LiDAR, space borne inSAR and geotechnical instrumentation to monitor what is happening to the ground whilst civil projects like these are happening.</p>
<p>The parent comment I am responding to is a very well written / explained synopsis of what happens.</p>
<p>I just want to add a little - engineers sometimes learn from failure. As an example, Sir Thomas Bouch was knighted for his engineering success for designing the Tay Bridge Rail crossing. He sought expert advice on the wind loading that his design may be subject to. Ultimately that advice was incorrect and the bridge failed in a bad storm due to wind loading that far exceeded the design intent. I’m making a bit of a jump, but incidents like this lead to engineers using safety factors in engineering designs / calcs.</p>

<p>I used to work for one of the big engineering firms and is an ego thing, but I really feel proud of working as part of a team tackling some of the biggest projects in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an internship at an international engineering firm where they were working on multi billion dollar never done before projects. And then a lot of people are just sitting relaxed behind their pc designing and running calculations. It’s strange to see how something that didn’t exist long ago is now being used for almost everything. </p>
<p>AI will have a big impact on truck drivers or grocery store employees but I wonder sometimes since so many jobs are so computer intertwined if they can’t be just as easily eliminated in the long term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Engineering is a tricky one. There's so much that <em>could</em> be automated, but not necessarily <em>should</em> be automated. Much of engineering isn't knowing how to run a calculation, but when and how to <em>apply</em> that calculation, which takes judgement in the form of experience, insight, and a global understanding of how everything comes together. </p>
<p>And different engineers have different opinions on what the &quot;right&quot; answer is-- some may apply a slightly more conservative safety factor in one area of the design and have a slimmer safety factor in another area of design. It's interfacing with clients and understanding things that aren't readily punched into a spreadsheet (i.e., how much working clearance does the maintenance staff want for this piece of equipment? Sound concerns for this one particular room?etc)</p>
<p>We have a younger guy at our office with some programming experience, and has coded up a few pretty awesome tools to automate parts of our process. However, the basis for some of these tools were based on input from one project manager and one project's parameters--designing a school for one specific district is very different than designing a hospital for a small rural area. There's certainly common patterns among all these that I'd love to see AI investigate on a large scale, but I can't see a future where engineering is ever eliminated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good description but you forgot one part: often times the design firm AND the client (e.g., the City) will visit finished similar projects (e.g., subway systems) in other parts of the world and meet with engineers from that City to learn how the system was  built, what problems they ran into, what advice they have etc etc. Especially if the project is super-rare, it becomes a mecca for other project proponents.  There's no substitute for going and actually seeing a finished product before starting to designing yours.</p></div>		</li>
