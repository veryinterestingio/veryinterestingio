<p>There is a chance that the earth:s orbit will expand enough to avoid being consumed by the sun. if this happens and the moon survives as well then we will go back to the moon and earth becoming tidally locked. When this happens only one half of the earth will see the moon and a day on the earth will be 47 days!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unlikely the Earth will survive. The Sun will undergo mass loss which will expand Earths orbit to ~1.7AU while the Sun will expand to approximately 1AU. However, this neglects tidal interactions. Once the Sun leaves the main sequence its convective envelope deepens and dissipation of tidal energy is increased which leads to an increased inspiral rate of the Earth. My own work has recently highlighted that the estimated dissipation in evolved stars is likely to be underestimated by an order 1 factor and so it is even less likely the Earth will survive than was previously thought!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, but it all depends on the size of the broken up pieces. Some yes, probably some no. Like if the moon broke up and entered earth for example, the answer would probably be the same.</p></div>		</li>
