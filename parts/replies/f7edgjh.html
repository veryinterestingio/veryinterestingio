<p>San Cristobal defended the city from land attacks that had to come up the narrow strip of land from a ways away.</p>
<p>The rocky cliffs outside of the harbor meant you had to land in the harbor or land wayyyy further down the coast and walk while under constant fire from the various artillery forts connected to San Cristobal. It's a pretty good setup</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I play a game called minecraft, and in it you can make maps by simoly exploring. Well, j was out mapping some islands and i came across this huge steep cliff island that i had to sail around for a while before finding a suitable spot to land. It out in perspective things like, why britain is hard to invade by sea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other point is that if a fort protects a harbour entrance, then you can put a fleet of your own navy into that harbour and not have to worry about anything happening to them. No matter how badly battle goes on the open sea, they would have a safe place to retreat, repair and resupply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here are two images that show the strategic placement of the Spanish fort of St Augustine Florida:

<p>As you can see, there’s one way in and one way out. The ocean-side florida Coast can extend for up to a few hundred miles before a natural inlet existed. Some of the larger English man-o-war ship weighed as much as 14 million pounds and had a draft (amount of the hull below the water line) of 28 feet. You can’t land that type of ship on the beach, load or unload supplies from smaller rowboats expeditiously, or sneak around the fort and hit one of the million sandbars.  In fact, when privateers raided the fort way back when before it was a proper stone fortress, they actually had to row ashore and strike at night in hand combat after Trojan-horsing their way into anchored quarantine in front of the fort. It was impossible to move heavy armaments or get their actual ship close enough to strike directly.</p>
<p>Protecting vital infrastructure as you’ve said is a primary reason for forts, and is often easier when natural terrain prohibits a lot of other movement.</p></div>		</li>
