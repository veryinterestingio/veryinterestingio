<p>Ninja edit:  you asked about costs too. From <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/underwater-internet-cables-submarine-cable-map-shows-how-world-gets-online-1559604" target="_blank">this</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon Hjembo, a senior analyst at TeleGeography, explained to the  International Business Times that one of the early cables that crossed  entire Atlantic ocean cost more than $2 billion, though most today are  in hundreds-of-millions range.Â </p>

<p>Also, slightly tangential, I seem to recall some stock trading companies (the ones that do ultra-short sales) making these kinds of investments to get milliseconds quicker connections. Really makes you think about the amounts of money that slosh around on the stock market. </p>
<p>ETA: apparently it's nanoseconds and they use microwaves because fibre is too slow. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-08/the-gazillion-dollar-standoff-over-two-high-frequency-trading-towers" target="_blank">Wild.</a></p></div>		</li>

If you try to day trade, you will lose to the computerized automated systems with AI and speed of light transactions.</p>
<p>Did you just read on Reddit about Apples hot new product that you think will inflate their stock?  You're too late.  The milli-second that the news broke, thousands of computers already analyzed it and bought the stocks.  The priced jumped before you even finished reading the headline, even if you were literally the first person to read it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hold up.. im gonna sound really stupid but.. there are cables stretching across the ocean?!?</p>
<p>I assumed intercontinental stuff was sent via the air or something. Youre telling me at the bottom of the sea are cables? What if something happens and they have to fix it? My mind is seriously exploding right now.</p>
<p>Edit: wow, lots of responses! Ty so much for the info. I guess it seems like such a huge fest of human engineering that im surprised I never learned about them before. As dumb as it sounds, I kind of have a new outlook on internet connectivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on transferring multiple data lines, you can get a really good sense of how this works by playing with some RGB LEDs. </p>
<p>Red Green Blue (or RGB) LEDs are three LEDs packaged as one. There is a red LED, a green LED, and a blue LED which can be turned on and off independently, producing a range of colors through various combinations of these 3 base colors.</p>
<p>Let's say you transfer binary data using a RGB LED, so each color is either on (1) or off (0). If all three are on, you will see white light. If you see yellow light, that means red and green are on; purple means red and blue are on; etc.</p>
<p>So if we flash red, purple, yellow, green, the three signals would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1110</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0011</p>
</li>
<li>0100</li>
</ul>
<p>The receiving end is only seeing one signal coming across the wire, there's only one color at a time. But the receiver can break that color down into it's components to get the individual messages. And if we use more than just the 3 base colors visible to humans (say, the 80 'colors' mentioned above), we can get even more combinations and thus even more simultaneous signals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want the actual way it works, for a given color of light, you have various brightness levels.  If you have 2 brightness levels, that's a 0 or 1 (1 bit).  4 brightness levels is 00 - 11, 2 bits, etc.  You can also change the phase of the wave; basically the receiver creates the same wave that it expects the sender to send, and then checks to see when the sent wave changes phase.  Each phase change can signal a bit as well.  Combine them together and you get something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation#Digital_QAM" target="_blank">QAM</a>.  So the MAREA cable can send 16 bits of data every signal point (every 1/400billionth of a second).  QAM with 256 possibilities exists as well, in general terms.  You never actually change wavelength to indicate a given bit change, each wavelength is a saperate communications channel, similar to a separate physical cable.</p>
<p>Add in to that multiple colors of light, which when done properly, don't interfere with each-other.  On land-based cables, you could get 80+ wavelengths, each changing state billions of times a second, and signaling multiple bits per state change.  And then put multiple strands of fiber in a single outer jacket cable to push that even further.</p></div>		</li>
