			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically my understanding as well. ELI5 answer: mouth exhales are more betterer because more air goes out, faster.</p>
<p>I was born with asthma, and one of my triggers is exercise. So I have read a lot over the years about breathing, breathing exercises, basically a lot about breath and breathing. (as a kid, i was a mouth breather. one reason was my nose was often stuffy from allergies and being sick. but i suspect my oxygen levels were low due to my lungs often having fluid in them and often getting pneumonia.) </p>
<p>We often think a lot about inhalation being important, but exhalation is vital too.<br />
With my asthma, when my lungs are inflamed, exhaling is incomplete. This leaves too much CO2 in the lungs, and recycling that in there can acidify the blood.<br />
Incomplete exhalation is why asthmatics tend to sigh a lot. Sighing helps force out &quot;old air&quot;.</p>
<p>There is a technique called pursed lip exhalation that asthmatics and COPD patients are taught. The technique improves the exchange of O2 and CO2, helps increase volume of exhaled air (goodbye old air), helps prevent hyper-inflation of the lungs (yeah that's a thing). </p>

You are spot on, the nose is a very well developed organ with a lot of essential functions, don't forget to mention the survival aspect of smells.
On top of that, I haven't seen in the comments, but breathing out through your mouth allows you control how much heat you let scape your body</p></div>		</li>
