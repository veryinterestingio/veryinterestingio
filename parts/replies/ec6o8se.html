<p>Regarding black stars, how do we define &quot;star&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The colloquial definition usually refers to objects that undergo nuclear fusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a star has burnt out and essentially has no energy generating nuclear activity would it technically still be a star, or an ex-star?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stellar remnant is usually the term used, although it depends. If one is talking about low-mass remnants, like white dwarfs and planetary nebulae, one might say post-AGB objects, for example. It depends on the context.</p></div>		</li>
