			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister was called &quot;me too&quot; for a while because my brother would ask for what they wanted and she would only say &quot;me too&quot;.</p>
<p>They realized she wasn't actually developmentally delayed when they separated them to send her to special Ed and she started whinging about unfair treatment and how cruel it was to separate them lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister and I were 10 and 7 when our youngest sister was born. We were homeschooled so we spent every day with her and often played with her during our breaks.</p>
<p>Before she could speak recognizable English, she could definitely express complex thoughts in a language that sounded like babble. In reality it was a mix of words she made up (insults and expressions of disapproval, especially) and attempts to approximate English words. She would say something and my other sister and I would translate for her. </p>
<p>People thought we were putting them on because it sounded for all the world like gibberish, but I swear she was making full sentences. It was like in A Series of Unfortunate Events when Violet and Klaus translate for Sunny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL. </p>
<p>It’s interesting that <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptophasia" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> says that one twin can be more dependent on the language than the other as it fits in with what some of the replies have said. </p>
<p>My own twins are two and still don’t speak much adult language yet, which is also explained in the article. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and through positive reinforcement and being spoken to they learn. I wonder if people speaking baby makes it better or worse... I studied developmental psych but ages ago. </p></div>		</li>
