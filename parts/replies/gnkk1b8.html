			<div class="markdown"><p>For animals, fever and inflammation also represent avenues to &quot;sickness&quot; behavior which may prevent the spread of infection among a community, and signal to the community that the member needs special care. Evolutionary theorists of depression sort of came up with that hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very clearly. Ask a veterinarian. There’s an old saying amongst vets and sheep farmers-“sick sheep seldom survive” . As a herd/flock animal they have evolved to not show evidence of sickness to the predator. They reach a point where by the time they show evidence of being sick , the pathology / disease process is so advanced they are beyond the point where intervention can help. Pigs are similar .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh. The most sound idea of evolutionnary 'use' of depression is that it's a self-removal mechanism.</p>
<p>A defeated organism stops competing because it has 'learned' through failing at dominance or social interactions that it is not in fact a good candidate for reproduction. This is beneficial to its competitors, and therefore the species, since it reduces competition for mates and (in extreme cases) for resources in general.</p>
<p>Remember: populations evolve, not individuals.</p>
<p>Sickness behaviour, though, for sure makes sense, but I would hope the theory is contested for depression, because it doesn't really afford any explanation of self-imposed fitness reduction...</p>
<p>In the case of the sick individual, it actually does have 'something wrong' that requires isolation or signal for care. The same cannot be said of depression.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, but it is the successful individuals which drive that evolution.</p>
<p>Animals which just accept that their genetics suck and allow themselves to die do WORSE than a ugly duckling which HOLDS ON, toughs it out, and swoops in when and IF the opportunity arises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does.</p>
<p>That's why an over 40°C fever can be deadly</p>
<p>AFAIK higher temperatures makes our body work faster and more efficiently. I remember reading in high school that the optimal temperature would be around 39.8°C, and over 40.5°C you'd start de-naturing proteins and can have seizures, hallucinations and even die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat doesn't need to just denature proteins, enzyme efficiency operates on very specific temperature tolerances, so you start skewing one way or the other, and certain organs start dysfunctioning. I remember being taught in med school that 104F, or 40C like you say, starts to &quot;cook&quot; your liver for how enzymatic it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has an impact on blood clotting too, which was one of the fears drilled into us regarding MDMA overdoses/overheating. Supposedly it encourages micro-clots all over the body which uses up clotting material meaning the rest of the blood just can't clot any more and you get internal bleeding from general wear and tear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hot water doesn't kill organisms, but it does help to break up the oils on your skin that the organisms stick to. Normal, non-antibacterial soap helps with this process. Hand washing is a mechanical method of organism removal. Try rinsing cold bacon grease off a pan using just cold water. It barely moves. Now try with hot water - it starts to liquefy and comes off. Add some dish detergent and it will slide right off. Same thing happens with your hands. </p>
<p>If you wash your hands a lot, such as in healthcare, then you want to use lotion afterwards occasionally to replace the dirty oils with clean oils and prevent chafing, which leaves open sores which are a good place for infections to start. In general, though, your skin produces the oils it needs pretty rapidly.</p></div>		</li>
