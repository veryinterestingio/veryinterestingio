			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, unlike the other comment suggested, I didn't comment it as an insult/burn or anything like that aimed at you. It was just a remark about your text. So I'm sorry if I offended you somehow.</p>
<p>Now answering to this comment. That's just as obvious as your other comment and doesn't answer the question. OP, as well as I, wants to know why do the elements in Eye of the Tiger cause that feeling on us, or alternatively, which elements are present in the song that are associated with the feeling?</p>
<p>If I ask someone: Why does lasagna tastes so good? I don't expect them to answer with &quot;Because the cook wants it to taste good&quot;. Nor do I want to hear a lecture about how lasagna is made of sauce, pasta and cheese and what they are. But an actual explanation about how the tomato sauce harmonizes with the cheese or something similar.</p></div>		</li>
