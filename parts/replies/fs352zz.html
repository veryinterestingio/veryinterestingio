			<div class="markdown"><p>Shortly after declaring my major and beginning work in a mathematics tutoring center, I confided to one of my colleagues - who was almost done with her BA in pure math - that I feared I might be too stupid to be a mathematician. I will always remember her response.</p>
<p>&quot;Studying mathematics is spending 99% of your life realizing that you're an idiot and wondering how you manage to feed and clothe yourself and 1% of the time feeling like God Himself comes to you for answers about the great mysteries of the universe.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
