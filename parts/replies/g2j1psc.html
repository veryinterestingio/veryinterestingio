			<div class="markdown"><p>I took mushrooms in BC (which were far more potent than I ever expected) and I remember seeing stuff that looked like an Alex Grey painting, but far, far more intricate. It was surreal. Like spinning through a kaleidoscope but in my mind's eye. It was so complex and honest to god breathtaking. These systems must be breathtakingly complicated because when you're stating at them and they're starting back at you it changes your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First time I’ve seen someone so accurately explain what happened to me. Incredible experience.</p>
<p>Mine felt like endless layers(?) of the pattern. Like I was slowly zooming into them as they and just when it looked like I’d gotten to the end, a whole new layer would form and off we go again.</p>
<p>I’ve always found it quite hard to articulate the experience to people without sounding insane, so I’m saving this saving this for future use!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way I can put it would be fractal geometric patterns (similar to a Julia or a Mandelbrot set), which you can continue zooming in on and it'll always be the same pattern, infinitely. Who knows, we live in a quantum world which means we're quantum beings. Maybe we're getting a peak at a quantum process, or the multiverse, or different dimensions of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing happened to me. I had to keep my eyes closed to just enjoy all of the geometric kaleidescope-like patterns I was seeing. I even noticed when I would take a deep breath, I would see a wave through the patterns matching my breath. </p>
<p>Psychedelics are amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an extremely detailed trip wherein a very brave mouse with a tiny sword dives into the very structure of the universe, though a dimension made of crystal fractals.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the universe is held together by tiny spiders. They are very tired of their job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Psychedelics do not only show what is happening, they also enable usually disconnected parts of the brain to suddenly communicate, so for example a signal from different parts of the brain might end up in the part responsible for vision. This together with the disinhibition you mentioned are seen as two main mechanisms enabling synesthesia.</p></div>		</li>
