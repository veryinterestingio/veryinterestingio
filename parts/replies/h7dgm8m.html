			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Even small business owners can easily do this.  The business owns the owner's &quot;work&quot; vehicle and pays for gas, insurance, and maintenance.  All are paid untaxed as business expenses.  Does it matter that it's a Porsche Cayenne?  Nope.  Same for cellphones, service plans, computers, meals, travel, etc.  As long as he has a plausible business purpose, it is all paid out as expenses.  With so many personal expenses paid by the business, the owner can live very well on a much lower income on paper.</p></div>		</li>
