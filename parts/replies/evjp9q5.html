			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate answer. Unfortunately, also the furthest from the ELI5 level, haha. But yes, there are various stages to how we go from sensory input (source of the pain) to sensory experience (what we feel and acknowledge), and anything along that path can affect your &quot;tolerance&quot; by reducing the signal to, and within, the brain. </p>
<p>Then there is the psychological component of tolerance that another person quoted Lawrence of Arabia for - the trick isn't not feeling the pain, it is not caring. That is where things like depression, trying to look tough, comparing this painful experience with past painful experiences, ect., all come into play.</p></div>		</li>
