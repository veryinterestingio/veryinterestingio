I can imagine somebody creating a computer virus having the same methodology. &quot;If the primary fails, the backups must activate and take over, but stay dormant until it does fail so they also can't be removed at the same time.&quot;</p>
<p>Scary shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. There is a tone of stuff that <em>could</em> kill you happening all the time. Most of it gets dealt with very effectively by your body. Some of the stuff that your body has trouble with can be dealt with effectively by modern medical practices.</p>
<p>Anything those two major checks aren’t able to deal with has to be dangerous and complicated enough that, well, those first two checks weren’t able to deal with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more a case of survivorship bias. All animals constantly develop cancerous cells, it's just that there's so many fail-safes built in that 99.9% of cancers either self-destruct or get flagged and killed by immune cells before they get bad, so we only suffer from the really nasty kinds of cancer that have managed to bypass all the existing defensive measures</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. It’s why it’s so critical to get checked early and often. The sooner you get it checked, the better chances of catching it and removing it before it spreads throughout your body.</p></div>		</li>
