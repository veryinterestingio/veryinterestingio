			<div class="markdown"><p>And the scary part about paracetamol/tylenol is that <strong>it does NOT take a lot to shut down your liver and kill you</strong>. </p>
<p>Most drugs have a huge window of &quot;effective dose&quot; before &quot;toxic dose&quot; before &quot;deadly dose.&quot;  That is to say the effective dose might be 10 mg, the toxic dose might be 1000 mg, and the deadly dose might be 10,000 mg.  You're almost never going to accidentally or intentionally be able to hurt yourself.</p>
<p>But with Tylenol/paracetamol 70 mg/kg is the maximum recommended 24/hr dose. 150 mg/kg or 7.5 g in adults is the typical starting point for a toxic dose; and once you reach toxic it's almost always deadly because you don't get your liver function back.  The minimal dose associated with liver injury can range anywhere from 4g (<strong>8 pills!!</strong>) to 10g. [<a href="https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/acetaminophen-toxicity-what-pharmacists-need-to-know" target="_blank">source</a>].  And the Toxic/deadly dose goes DOWN if you take a lot over subsequent days (10g or &gt;200 mg/kg as single ingestion or over 24 hr period; 6 g or &gt;150 mg/kg per 24 hr period x 2days  - <strong>that's 20 pills in one day or 12 pills for two days in a row!</strong>) [<a href="https://wikem.org/wiki/Acetaminophen_toxicity" target="_blank">Source</a>].  </p>
<p>So your standard bottle of Tylenol with 50x 500mg pills OTC has 25g of paracetamol and <strong>will kill you</strong>.  This is unheard of in most OTC medicines. If you have a really bad series of pain and think &quot;just another 2 Tylenol won't kill me&quot;... well that's an extra gram and it just might.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did not know what the pain killers did to the organs, so thanks for explaining. I was before taking sometimes Ibuprofen and other times Paracetamol knowing they work differently and by not taking one too often wold be good. So by them having bad results on different organs, mixing those two drugs over time (with days in between of course, not on same day) would be easier on the organs. In the theory, not sure if actually good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Alcohol will also change the way liver processes paracetamol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To expand on this:  Tylenol is processed in multiple ways in the liver.  Acetaminophen first undergoes sulphation (binding to a sulphate molecule) and glucuronidation (binding to a glucuronide molecule) before being eliminated from the body by the liver. The parent compound, acetaminophen, and its sulphate and glucuronide compounds (metabolites) are themselves actually not harmful. </p>
<p>An excessive amount of acetaminophen in the liver, however, can overwhelm (saturate) the sulphation and glucuronidation pathways. When this happens, the acetaminophen is processed through another pathway, the cytochrome P-450 system. From acetaminophen, the P-450 system forms an intermediate metabolite referred to as NAPQI, which turns out to be a toxic compound. Ordinarily, however, this toxic metabolite is rendered harmless (detoxified) by another pathway, the glutathione system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alcohol is metabolized by several processes or pathways. The most common of these pathways involves two enzymes‚Äîalcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). These enzymes help break apart the alcohol molecule, making it possible to eliminate it from the body. First, ADH metabolizes alcohol to acetaldehyde, a highly toxic substance and known carcinogen. Then, in a second step, acetaldehyde is further metabolized down to another, less active byproduct called acetate, which then is broken down into water and carbon dioxide for easy elimination.  In the second step, an enzyme named glutathione-S transferase facilitates the joining of acetaldehyde with glutathione and the acetaldehyde-glutathione complex is easily excreted in the urine. When adequate levels of glutathione are available in the liver, alcohol detoxification goes smoothly. However, one evening of heavy drinking will quickly deplete the liver‚Äôs stores of glutathione.</p>
<p>The body‚Äôs available glutathione levels are always being depleted during alcohol detoxification. Thus, people who regularly consume alcohol at moderate levels, such as one or two drinks a day, are also constantly lowering their level of available glutathione.</p>
<p>The enzymes cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and catalase also break down alcohol to acetaldehyde. However, CYP2E1 only is active after a person has consumed large amounts of alcohol, and catalase metabolizes only a small fraction of alcohol in the body.</p>
<p>Put this together and when you drink alcohol, your liver is low on Glutathione because it's being used to break down the alcohol and it's producing more P-450 in response to the lower Glutathione levels.  The P-450 is just working to breakdown anything that it can, causing the Paracetamol to be broken down into NAPQI.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother always told me paracetamol is ‚Äúthe bad one‚Äù. You can kind of mess around with ibuprofen, take it an hour before your dose is due if you‚Äôre really hurting, or accidentally take one too many and don‚Äôt worry too much about it, but she always stressed you can‚Äôt do the same with paracetamol and it‚Äôll land you in hospital.</p>
<p>I miscarried my second pregnancy and was prescribed Naproxen (don‚Äôt know much about it other than that it‚Äôs a very strong NSAID) for the pain. I took it for weeks as it was a very very drawn out and painful miscarriage (late first tri) and while it was effective at managing my pain, I read up a bit and found out NSAIDs are known to affect/inhibit ovulation, so much so that some companies are working on formulating a NSAID-based contraceptive. Since I was trying to get pregnant again, I stopped taking it. I don‚Äôt know how accurate the information I read was but it was enough to convince me to tough out the (very bad) pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny because paracetamol is often recommended because it's easier on your stomach, people really aren't allergic to it like aspirin, it doesn't mess with as many medications as most NSAIDs and it's relatively safe during pregnancy (though not entirely so don't eat it like candy).</p>
<p>The recommended and effective doses are really low compared to the dangerous amounts and taking an extra dose here and there is nothing, though you don't want to make a habit of it.</p>
<p>Just stay away from alcohol and consult a doctor if you're in enough pain to use meds for more than 2 weeks or constantly feel like having to exceed the recommended dose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes, that‚Äôs true actually I had forgotten you can‚Äôt take ibuprofen in pregnancy, sucked because it‚Äôs better for headaches in my opinion and I had bad hormonal headaches in all my pregnancies. But I was so on edge third time I basically didn‚Äôt take any medication at all including paracetamol. </p>
<p>I did see a doctor after around 2/3 weeks of the very bad pain, I went to a&amp;e (ER) which to be fair they took seriously. What I really wanted was morphine haha. But I guess it wasn‚Äôt <em>quite</em> that bad, I wasn‚Äôt screaming or anything but couldn‚Äôt function through the pain.</p>
<p>I did actually have morphine for pain when I had viral meningitis and my god, it was like sweet sweet honey in my veins. It‚Äôs fascinating how painkillers work. Also I had pethidine the first time I gave birth and that was the sweet stuff too, made me realise how people get hooked on hard drugs if that‚Äôs how they make you feel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Naproxen isn't any stronger than ibuprofen, in fact in many ways it's actually more mild. But because it's more mild, they tend to offer much higher doses relative to the pharmaceutical effect (up to 2.5x higher than ibuprofen in terms of equivalent cox-2 inhibition, in Australia at least), which ends up having a stronger effect. If you regularly took 2.5x ibuprofen doses you'd end up with gastrointestinal bleeding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I defer to your greater knowledge 100%, I guess it must be due to the dosage in the pills available here (UK) that it‚Äôs prescription-only. It‚Äôs not very  common either, you are more likely to be prescribed codeine (which you can also buy OTC here in smaller doses) but either it was contraindicated or they just thought naproxen would be better for me at the time. </p>
<p>It did work for my pain. After I stopped taking it, I started having half a shot of rum a couple of times a day to control the pain. I know that sounds bad but it was all I could think to do that would enable me to function, take care of my son etc, without interfering with my reproductive processes. It also took the edge off the emotional pain a little bit. I did that for maybe a week and by then the pain had subsided enough that I could manage without anything. I did get pregnant the very next cycle after my period came back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you said makes no sense. First of all, they are 2 different drugs and can not be compared. Secondly, naproxen max daily dose is 1500mg, while advil is 3200 MG. Usually the smaller the max daily dose is, the more potent the medication is, because less dose do more. But once again, they can not be compared as they are not the same drug.</p>
<p>Normally what I see is 500mg naproxen twice daily, and I see ibuprofen 600mg 4 times daily. This once again suggest naproxen is more potent.</p></div>		</li>
