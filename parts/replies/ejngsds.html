<p>Due to the biggest advantage of Vinyl being that it is an analogue recording of the sound</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An advantage against the very earliest digital recordings, perhaps.</p>
<p>With modern bit depth and sample rates, digital recordings are now provably better in terms of audio quality: they're similar enough to the analogue recording that the human ear can't differentiate the difference even if we reduces the bit depth and sample rate from current standards, even for the most highly trained ear, while also being far more consistent.</p>
<p>If you take two vinyl records printed consecutively, the difference between them will be greater than the difference between a digital recording and the original...</p>
<p>I get that some people enjoy the imperfections of vinyl and think it gives vinyl &quot;character&quot;, but beyond that any idea that vinyl has an &quot;advantage&quot; in sound quality is nonsense: if you can tell the difference, it's because you're hearing imperfections from the vinyl</p>
<p>Unfortunately this tends to dissolve to tribalism, with people insisting vinyl is better &quot;because it is&quot;, usually backed up with a super-simplified graphic that shows the digital signal as a binary on/off at 1 Hz, overlaid over the analogue signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been confused by the argument that records have higher quality recording than digital... With modern bitrates digital measurably records more information... If your definition of &quot;higher quality&quot; is &quot;true to the original sound&quot; then digital is clearly better. Though I have heard many vinyl fans say that records sound &quot;warmer&quot;... Which has been shown to be the needle picking up the subtle vibrations of the motor in the turntable, so even less faithful to the original sound. That being said, if people prefer the sound of vinyl then more power to them. It's just always confused me that it's presented not as a preference but as an objectively superior sound recording.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This sums it up to me</p>
<p>I'm completely okay with people just preferring the sound from vinyl, if they prefer that to the original. I'm also completely okay with people enjoying the &quot;character&quot; of the pops and crackles, or simply of it reminding them of listening to the record years ago.</p>
<p>I just dislike the dishonesty of people claiming it to be an objectively, measurably better sound quality: it isn't, either in human-ear-detectable definition or in terms of how &quot;true to the original&quot; it is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's silly about the &quot;warm&quot; sound is that you could easily add a digital filter or analog device on the output to fuzz up the sound to add the same &quot;warmth.&quot;</p>
<p>FLAC is absolutely the way to go for masters, and yet I'm really dubious of anyone over 20 years old claiming they can even tell the difference between MP3 320 CBR and FLAC. </p>
<p>People will waffle about vinyl and &quot;24 bit&quot; (which tends to reduce fidelity by faulty process). These same people, so concerned with their recording including 22khz sounds, likely can't hear above 15khz. (And no, a website at home and your computer speakers are likely not a good test of this.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, if the mixing/mastering engineers wanted it to sound that way they would have made it sound that way. Many of those guys have $100k+ speaker setups and perfectly treated rooms. Thinking you can improve a signal run through a Neve 1073s and an LA-2A with a $5 piece of vinyl is dumb. Go spend $300 on a pair of Kali LP-6's and another couple on acoustic foam then just queue up Spotify since Spotify normalizes to about -14 lufs so mastering for it tends to not be as heavily clipped as other formats where loudness is king.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To preface; I have a fair sized collection of albums that most people would prefer I not put on, mostly pressed after 2000.<br />
Anyone who is claiming vinyl is sonically superior to anything other than FM radio is just really into their hobby and justifying the expense. Records aren’t about audio perfection, they are about materialism and the rewarding feelings associated with hobbies or collecting. For older folks nostalgia is probably a factor and I’m sure a fair amount of my peers are emulating someone they think is cool.<br />
What I personally enjoy most about listening to a record instead of just streaming the same songs is the tedium of skipping tracks and being forced to flip the album to hear the second half. It transforms music from something I just put on in the background (passive listening) to something I sit down and pay attention to (active). I buy albums I absolutely love and then delete their digital counterparts so the “only” way I can hear the songs is to listen to the entire album on vinyl.
Secondly I enjoy the tangible feeing of holding the massive artwork and/or exclusive liner art, followed by feeling (wether incorrectly or not) a closer connection to the artist. They knew their fan base well enough to print copies of their album on vinyl and many of my albums had to be purchased directly from the artist.<br />
Not disputing anything you said in your comment, but the vinyl sub is generally a dumpster fire of “because it is” and expense justification. Just wanted to share my reasoning as I feel it’s a little more grounded than what people usually get from “their hipster boyfriend”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never seen a proper blind comparison of live sound, v record, v various digital formats. I’d like to have the money to set one up. My personal opinion is that no recording sounds like the live sound, but you really notice it only in very fast transients, i.e. drums.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Live recordings go through a signal processing pipeline that's the same as what you would for recorded music.</p>
<p>Recorded music sounds different because of its compressed dynamic range and mastering process. Recording engineers in studios work with the unprocessed live sound and recorded sound all the time.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Agreed. You can get pretty close though. </p>
<p>Efficient speakers. This generally means fairly big speakers, often with horn tweeters. Alternately, while not as efficient, ribbon tweeters do transients like nothing else IMO. Bookshelf speakers do about 85dB/w, whereas some big monster speakers do 95dB or more. So, an additional 10 dB  given the same amount of power.</p>
<p><em>plus</em></p>
<p>An amp that is overbuilt for the job at hand. Something that can push your speakers to 110dB or ideally even more without distorting. The goal is not to listen at 110dB; that's madness. But if you listen at an average of 75 or 80dB, now you have 30-40dB of headroom for transients.</p>
<p><em>plus</em></p>
<p>Good recordings, of course. If the dynamic range isn't there in the recording, obviously equipment won't help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.
Before vinyl, records were easily broken. Vinyl is an excellent material for the job, cheap and durable.
This <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_record" target="_blank">link shows</a> the long history of records before vinyl solved many of the problems with other materials.
You are probably right, there is a better material out there now, but the R&amp;D costs versus any improvements wouldn't be good enough. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Make sure you take care of your needle.   You don't even need a great one, but you should have a good one.   a $100 Ortofon 2m red will do wonders for your sound and the life of your records.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your records clean</strong>.   The scratches and pops are not &quot;earthy&quot; or &quot;authentic&quot;, they're tiny explosions happening on the surface of your record as the needle crashes into the dust at what might as well be, from the microscopic perspective we're talking about, hundreds of miles an hour.</p>
<p>Make sure you align your needle properly, and have correct tracking force applied, and anti-skate set correctly.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT EVER PLAY A RECORD ON A CROSSLEY</strong></p>
<p>Cheers man!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard claims from audiophiles that they can tell the difference between the first few plays and later plays.  I heard of one who would make a tape of the first play of a vinyl record at something like 15 inches per second.  Then would listen to the tape until it wore enough to have detectable noise, then would make a new tape.  May be an apocryphal story.  My ears aren't that good.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I do understand some of the appeal of vinyl.  For a long time the ideal 'production values' used for CDs was to be true to life, so you could hear the artist breathing, hear the audience sneezing.  I tend to decrease the high frequency balance on CDs for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is just blatantly false.  The original recording is not made on vinyl.  It is made with other materials, then used to cast a metal master, then that in turn is used to press the vinyl.  </p>
<p>Your entire argument based on this false premise is therefore irrelevant.  </p></div>		</li>
