<p>Finally, the Muscovite Rus and the following political entities (including the Soviets and modern Russia) have worked from a &quot;next hill&quot; defensive strategy - basically they see the next hill as a threat to their safety and need to take it in order to achieve security.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  There are a lot of commonalities, although the vacuum of power left by the retreat of the Mongols and their clients in the preceding decades don't really have an analogy in the American West.  The vassal states (such as they were) were basically climbing out of the hole that the Mongols put them in when the Russians showed up.  Many of these states had had significant contact with Eastern and Western empires throughout the centuries (Greeks and Chinese, most notably), so it's not like they were completely unaware of events over the horizon.</p></div>		</li>
