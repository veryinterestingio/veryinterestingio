			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for Westinghouse Nuclear Services and WesDyne for a little while and the engineers were continually improving designs and coming up with new ones.</p>
<p>Some were so old they were stored (at one point) on 8 inch floppies. Lots of them. A <em>wall</em> of them.</p>
<p>They were moving it all to IDE hard drives when I left and that was a labor of love. It was inspiring, in a way, to see them laboring like ancient scribes and scholars, essentially copying ancient texts like cloistered monks of old.</p>
<p>They were so excited about the new designs they had created but NIMBY prevents them from being built.</p>
<p>Shame.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Heck, I bet the reactor code is still in Cobol.</p>

<p>It's a bit more likely written in Fortran IV but either way it's got more grey in its beard than I do!</p></div>		</li>

<p>no new reactor tech has been ok since the 1970s</p>

<p>Shouldn't the Navy be all about smaller, more efficient nuclear reactors for their subs and warships?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming they're referring to commercial reactors. A new smaller, lighter, more efficient, and more powerful reactor was developed for the Navy's new Gerald R. Ford class of carriers.</p></div>		</li>
