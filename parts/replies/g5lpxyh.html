			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn that is more than I thought. Thank you.
This brings me to some more questions:</p>
<p>Does the orbital movement of earth also affect weight? Do we weigh more when looking at the sun because we get pushed against earth (when the centrifugal center is the sun)? Do we weigh less in july when earth is further away from the sun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the same kind of calculation (assuming the Earth is in a circular orbit at 1 AU with a period of 1 year) gives a maximum magnitude of about 6*10^(-4) due to the orbit of the Earth around the sun.</p>
<p>Like you said, it can either make your apparent weight higher or lower, but with a maximum contribution of 0.06%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thought , we are always thought that the earth is &quot;squished &quot; like an orange , doesent that mean that if I am standing on the equator there will also be &quot;more earth&quot; beneath me , and the extra gravity generated by that extra mass under me would somewhat make up for the centripetal force ? Infact, since that &quot;squishing&quot; of the planet is generated by that same centripetal force , wouldent those two factors be somewhat related ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that was interesting. So, how short would Earth's day have to be to let us float away into space from Equador?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the centrifugal force to be exactly equal and opposite to the force of gravity at the equator, you'd need RΩ^(2)/g = 1, or Ω = sqrt(g/R). If you calculate that, you'd find that the Earth would have to complete about 17 rotations in a 24 hour period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not surprisingly this is just about the same as the orbital period in low earth orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating... if a life form ever developed on a much faster spinning planet than ours, they might achieve orbit with very little technological development, relative to ours.</p>
<p>I guess on the other hand, if the protoplanet mass is spinning that fast, a planet might not really develop.</p></div>		</li>
