			<div class="markdown"><p>To back up the mammal one, I would need to find a source for this, but I remember reading an excellent article on how the Americas used to have twice as many megafauna (animals over a certain weight, I want to say a ton?) as Africa, but almost all of them (dire wolves, giant sloths, mammoths, etc) were wiped out in a relatively short (evolutionarily speaking) period not just by humans, but by a single related group of humans as they spread out from the crossing from Asia. They used a particular kind of broad spearhead that was really good at killing large animals, and that was basically their primary food source. That branch of humanity single-handedly wiped out most massive American animals, and then themselves died out or interbred with other tribes (if that's the right word, I feel like it's not) since they'd exhausted their main source of food and resources. We can table the obvious lesson there and look at the modern megafauna in the process of going extinct in Africa, not to mention the large animals on land and in the sea endangered around the world, and I think that the biggest reason in the last few hundred thousand years animals are smaller is because it makes them safer from humans. Large animals tend to either scare us (quick kill it) or inspire awe in us (it's a source of pride to kill it, or maybe it's magical) such that enough of us feel a desire to hunt said large, very visible animals. And there are so many of us and we're so dangerous that even on the margins, that translates to danger and even extinction. Especially when you add in that large animals tend to reproduce more slowly. Humanity is itself a powerful evolutionary force, and it can be danger for us to notice you. </p>
<p>But before us, I'll leave it to other people to answer. </p>
<p>Sorry on vagueness, maybe I can go find that article tomorrow. Need to sleep now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The name for this theory is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture" target="_blank">Clovis Culture</a> or Clovis Point. More or less stating that humans were very adept hunters with tools to kill big animals (mega fauna) in North America. In Africa,  where humans and mega fauna evolved together this was not as prolific, so many of these species are still with us today.</p>
<p>A cool book on some of this type of thing is <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-holocene-an-environmental-history_neil-roberts/561397/?mkwid=sX2e1aPQO%7cdm&amp;pcrid=70112897472&amp;pkw=&amp;pmt=&amp;plc=&amp;pgrid=21329102112&amp;ptaid=aud-465071891222%3apla-366084668232&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIktCe1v374QIV3h6tBh1jtwuDEAQYByABEgK88fD_BwE#isbn=0631186387&amp;idiq=443273" target="_blank">Holocene by Neil Roberts</a>. It goes over much more than the question asked in this thread, but is a great read on all sorts of science based information on recent geologic time (the time of humans).</p></div>		</li>
