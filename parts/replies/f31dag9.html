			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm drinking right now and decided to test this theory. I captured some beer in my mouth and proceeded to sniff the air and I didn't taste anything. Followed it up with smelling my beer with some more in my mouth and I could taste it better while sniffing my beer. I had always thought the idea of smell playing a role in taste was over emphasized but I guess I was wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense.  I read the topic and immediately thought it wasn't true at all.  But I have a greatly reduced sense of smell, so my taste is from my tongue and stuff.  And I keep my taste when sick.</p></div>		</li>
