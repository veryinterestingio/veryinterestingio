<p>You amputate people's mouths or you extract all of the patients teeth at once?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea is to get the teeth out without chunks of the jaws coming along with them. We try to preserve as much bone as possible. Usually once the teeth come out the bone is clipped filed and shaved into a smooth shape and the sockets/bony defects are filled with human bone allograft. Then everything is sewed up as neatly as possible. </p>
<p>It’s a pretty major procedure to have done. It sucks for the patient, but we only do it when there is no alternative. It’s not an easy procedure for anyone involved, myself included. I much prefer to restore natural teeth, but unfortunately sometimes it gets bad enough that all of them have to be removed at the same time. I took out 32 teeth on a 23 year old male the other day. It was sad but it had to be done. There was nothing left of his teeth to repair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. So after something like that, would the normal or recommended course of action be full mouth implants, or just dentures?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You will be fine. Dentists and oral surgeons who perform major procedures like that have a lot of experience. It takes a lot of surgical experience to even get into the position of doing those types of procedures. </p>
<p>You will be in good hands and they will know how to take care of you through the recovery period. If you have any questions about what to expect feel free to send me a message. I do outpatient surgery for 12 straight hours one day a week and I promise you that virtually anyone who does that type of work will do their very best to help you obtain the best possible outcome.</p></div>		</li>
