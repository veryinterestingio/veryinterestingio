			<div class="markdown"><p>If you swing stuff around on a rope it will want to be at a point that has the highest force away from the center of rotation. On Earth this is around the equator, If you tie anything to a different place the stuff wil start swinging across the equator because the forces on it try to shove it towards the point of most force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spin a big ball on a rope around as you spin around in a circle. If you lift your arms above your head the pull of the ball wants to pull your arms back to the center.</p>
<p>It's easy to do it with a ball because we are quite strong and the forces small.</p>
<p>Scale it up to a planet and a reaaaaaaly long tube. Then the force will snap the tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a single line on the equator will be easier to defend. Any space elevator ever built is going to be a prime target for a terrorist attack, so keeping them all in a straight line makes the terrain around them easier to track by a single row of satellites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stuff in space &quot;wants&quot; to spin around in a circle around the middle of the Earth. </p>
<p>A pole sticking out of the equator is the only spot where the pole spins around the center of the Earth. </p>
<p>A pole sticking out a different place would either need to be really strong or have rockets to keep it in place. </p>
<p>Since the idea of a space elevator is less of a pole and more of a rope, it only makes sense around the equator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. They can orbit at any angle as they aren't attached to it like an elevator would be. We have plenty satellites ourselves that orbit North to South, East to West, vice versa and any combination in between. The difference is, ours have only been up there in the last 60 years, planetary rings and moons have been there for millions of years.</p>
<p>Millions of years is enough time for tidal forces to tug the satellites into an equatorial orbit that matches the direction of rotation, or more likely, change the orbit so that the object either crashes into the planet or fucks off into space, the equatorial satellites are just what's left.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this might be because a bunch of objects orbiting around a center point have a net angular momentum. Essentially after all the objects orbiting have hit each other enough they'll all be spinning in the same direction along the same plane.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm very certain this is why galaxy's are all spinning roughly along a plane, so I just kind of extrapolated that for a planets rings because it's pretty similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Rings tend to be formed when moons get too close and are shredded by tidal forces. Since the source material for the ring is being pulled perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the planet (remember the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the equator), you get those rings on the equatorial plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Space Elevator is not meant to support its own weight, structurally. The theory is to use centripetal/fugal/inertial forces to support it, kind of like floating in water. It’s easier to stand up in still water, because the water buoys your body up, putting less strain on your legs.</p>
<p>Building at the poles would require the elevator to completely support itself, which would be a massively more difficult feat of engineering. IIRC, there is no material currently known that could practically support the proposed designs on their own.</p>
<p>Edit: the rotation at the poles is zero, so you have no balancing force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a space elevator, not a space tower. A space tower can be built basically anywhere without much issue, but 1) the top will be below orbital velocity, so you still need a big speed boost to escape Earth's gravity well 2) it'll probably sink under its own weight.</p>
<p>A space elevator is held up by tension, not compression, so the counterweight needs to be exerting s force opposite to Earth's gravity, and the centrifugal force (which is a real, measureable force in a moving reference frame) is what makes the counterweight exert that tensioning force. If the counterweight is over the poles, it's not moving, so no centrifugal force, and no tension, and the tether just falls to earth.</p></div>		</li>
