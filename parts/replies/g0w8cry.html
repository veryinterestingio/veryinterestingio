			<div class="markdown"><p>What a great explanation, thanks! Both the explanations and the sources. Great answer.</p>
<p>As an aside, you and I clearly have fairly different definitions of the word “cartoon.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a little old fashioned by now, but you still hear it in film making as well. Referring to things which never physically existed as props, sets, puppets, actors, or whatever; if some element of an image was created entirely on paper or a computer it might be a &quot;cartoon&quot;, no matter how sophisticated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So all that said, if we could see the ripples like on the surface of water, would it look like an irregular bar-shaped ripple in the beginning? I get that at some distance it doesn’t matter so much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. It could be instructive to watch some simulations of earthquake propagation, along with earthquake shaking, e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXoZYc9N89M" target="_blank">this one</a> from the USGS for a hypothetical M7.8.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. At first it was hard to see the evolution until you focus on the color separation and the correlation of the counter in addition to the spread notated in the colors of the map. Very informative, interesting and made it easy to understand.  Thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love simulations, they'll never match up to the real world exactly but so much can be learned from them and it's beautiful to see them in detail we can't measure in the real world.</p></div>		</li>
