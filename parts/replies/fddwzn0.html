			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not privy to the specifics, but I suspect it is the grinding and alignment of the lens. </p>
<p>I got prescription inserts for my S - wore contacts for my original Rift. Inserts were the best money I've spent in a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a simulation.   Your eyes are usually focusing the image either in front of, or behind, your retina because they are malformed (hence, short or long-sightedness).</p>
<p>The headset will have lenses that are set to focus the screen on the retina for someone who is normally-sighted from 6-feet-away.  Hence it still lands behind/in front of your retina.</p>
<p>An adjustment, or a secondary lens just like your glasses, will refocus that light to a point where your eye bends it onto your retina just right (that's all your glasses are doing - refocusing it from a few millimetres in front of behind your retina to the perfect spot).</p>
<p>It won't be perfect if your don't have prescription lenses, though, because the eye doesn't distort perfectly, hence why prescriptions have so many numbers - those are the exact opposite rotation, distortion, etc. that your eye is performing without lenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The headset includes a lens, that goes between your eyes and the screen. Theoretically this lens could be adjusted for your eyesight, but as there are so many different types of lenses used for eyesight, it is better to add a second lens - your normal glasses lens - to do the adjustment.</p></div>		</li>
