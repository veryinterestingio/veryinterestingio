			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if it's the same for you but while my pain tolerance definitely has increased in general, it has only increased drastically for my chronic pain specifically. Some people assume that having been in pain since I was young I should be able to take just about anything without flinching which isn't true.</p>
<p>I have gotten very good at not reacting to or showing my chronic pain, but if I cut myself or stub my toe it is such a different kind of pain that I still react like most people would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah totally the same for me. Joint issues, muscle issues, migraines, stomach issues are all dealt with on a daily basis. I sliced my knuckle open down to the bone last month, didn't even feel it. Barely felt the stitch either. Stub my toe?!! OMG but I can still walk it off. </p>
<p>But I have to look back and laugh at what I thought was the worst pain of my life way back when I first got sick.</p></div>		</li>
