			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it in Google privacy policy that they can read the content of your emails and use that data to target ads towards you?  I'm not asking for speculation if they do, I mean have they actually confirmed that it's something they do?</p></div>		</li>

<p>We want to help you better understand the data that we use to show you ads. 'Why this ad' is a feature that helps you find out why you are seeing a given ad. For example, you might be seeing that ad for a camera because you’ve searched for cameras, visited photography websites or clicked on ads for cameras before. Or if you see an ad for a restaurant, you may discover that it’s because of your location or your mobile app activity. This type of data helps us show you ads about things that you might find useful. But remember, we never share any of this personal information with advertisers.</p>
<p>You can access this feature through an information icon on our services, such as Search, YouTube, Gmail, Play and Shopping. For most ads that you see on partner sites or in apps that use our services, you can access 'Why this ad' through a similar icon.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less that anyone is reading it and more that the algorithm gets information by processing email in the space between the sender and recipient. It doesn't read the email perse, but it's handling the exchange and can parse information like &quot;this email is from an optometrist&quot; therefore loading ads for glasses might be relevant. It's less that it knows you need glasses and more that it assumes the possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got it backwards. The information isn't distributed to every avenue, every avenue taps into the data collector's algorithm and has their ads distributed to the relevant parties. </p>
<p>Basically there'll be a data collector somewhere that says &quot;OP spends time at an optometrist&quot; and an advertisor who says &quot;send this ad to people who spend time at optometrists&quot; (rudimentary explanation).</p>
<p>The advertising companies don't even need to compile data anymore; Facebook and Google does it all for them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that's the power of Facebook. Say a company wants to reach 30-50 year old Midwestern males who are interested in hunting. Facebook can say &quot;OK here's 5 million of them. We can have your ad on their front page immediately&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The advertisers don't know who you are or that you went to the optometrist. However Google has sold x000 views of people who would be interested in glasses to the advertiser.
Google has deduced that you have been to the optometrist, and hence has you flagged as someone who may be interested in glasses. It has then served you the relevant adds.</p></div>		</li>
