			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't suppose you have any idea on what the consensus on vaping is?</p>
<p>The last Dr. I spoke to was pretty scathing of vaping, but then others have said that by far the most dangerous part of nicotine addiction is the fact its smoked often.</p>
<p>I guess I'm basically trying to ask if nicotine addiction in and of itself is particularly dangerous or is it fairly mild and more on par with say a caffeine addiction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vaping comes with its own problems, but consensus is hard to achieve simply because variations in temperature, coil materials etc. will change the contents of the vapor itself. Flavor agents in juices might also all behave differently. Simulating all sorts of usage conditions in a lab is nearly impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've both smoked and vaped in the past. The one key difference I noticed was that cigarettes severely impaired my progress at the gym while vaping had little to no effect. This leads me to believe vaping is at least somewhat less harmful than smoking.</p>
<p>As for the nicotine addiction, I feel any kind of upper can replace it quite easily. Since quitting smoking I've become reliant on caffeine and can have trouble focusing during the day without at least one serving. Not nearly as bad as cigarettes, but it is another form of addiction in itself.</p></div>		</li>
