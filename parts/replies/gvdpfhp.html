			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the discussion, Cadila Healthcare is also developing a vaccine in India. It has taken a lot longer than others, but data is expected in May and, hopefully, it will be available to the public in June. This is a DNA Plasmid based vaccine, which is different from both the technological discussed above, but doesn't use an inactivated virus either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really worth noting two of the major issues of the mRNA vaccines: storage and transport.</p>
<p>You know how it has to be kept at <del>liquid nitrogen</del> dry ice temperatures and need <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/11/rural-hospitals-cant-afford-freezers-to-store-pfizer-covid19-vaccine/" target="_blank">liquid nitrogen at some stages of distribution</a>, not just fridge temperatures?  That's expensive and difficult.  If you aren't a world power with lots of money, that's an issue.</p>
<p>Russia's certainly a military power, but their economic abilities are considerably weaker than the US and other powers.  India is further down both lines.  China has lots of money, but not as much per person.</p>
<p>Edit: Correction on storage needs - see strikethrough.  Second correction - I was mostly right - liquid nitrogen required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it because mRNA’s a pretty new technology, and the traditional approach, apart from having a long track record, is easier and cheaper to develop for? (the 3 nations you listed aren’t exactly 1st world at the moment)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the response  - but why wouldn’t they run with the option that had a longer track record when they knew they couldn’t test it to normal standards? What makes mRNA vaccines better?</p></div>		</li>
