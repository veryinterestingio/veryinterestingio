			<div class="markdown"><p>Newpipe can do that, too. Vanced is very good, but I enjoy the approach of newpipe devs. It's floss, it doesn't use youtube's API and it is VERY lightweight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't doubt that the higher voted explanations here are probable, but it's also possible that the user may not notice or remember instances of ads buffering simply because they are uninterested in them or have shifted their attention away for the duration. That being said I don't think I've ever seen an ad buffer in my experience, but most of my browsing is done on fairly fast connections and I rarely have issues with the content videos as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have ads cause I use adblock but anyway, despite my 100 mbps connection youtube doesn't seem to work much better than when I had 10 mbps, videos still randomly decide not to buffer past some point and I need to refresh the page and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a fast connection. I got a 2mbps dsl line that fluctuates wildly throughout the day. Most youtube streams okay at 480p. But I can't load ads at all. It takes forever and you can't lower the quality so they can actually load.</p>
<p>If I could get better internet, I could. But I am a resident of the United States... So, it's not possible. </p></div>		</li>
