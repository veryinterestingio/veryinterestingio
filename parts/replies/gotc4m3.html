			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflation applies to everybody just the same. Including the super rich. Inflation can occur in just about any economic system when the supply of money increases relative to the population and to the supply of goods and services. This is just as true in socialism or even communism as it is in capitalism. Inflation encourages people to spend money, which IS the economy. If we have deflation, people are incentivized to save instead of spend, decreasing the exchange of goods and services for money. The economy slows down. Most economists believe deflation leads to a downward spiral that will grind the economy to a halt. This is not unique to, or limited to a capitalistic economy. The corruption in unregulated capitalism is a different issue, and the cause of it is not inflation. Reversing inflation won't make greed or wealth inequality suddenly stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So one one the reasons you give is the economy would slow down if our saving didn't loose value. If our savings didn't loose value we wouldn't be on a threadmill to nowhere. People used to be able to pay off a house in years. When we had the gold standard.
The meaning of the economy should be to support our lives not the other way around. The reason the economy must grow or collapse is because the banking system has turned it into a ponzi scheme. If we had sound money we wouldn't need to grow. But those who live off growth would need to find a job.</p>
<p>Fractional reserve banking works with compound interest. Borrow one dollar this way and the system automatically creates exponentially growing money and debt. That is the reason you have inflation. The rich get the money first so it is a constant transfer of value to the capitalist class. It is counterfeiting. It is theft. It is fraud that was legalized by Nixon. It is forbidden in the bible to charge interest on money.
The more the economy grows, the harder the working class has to work, the less money they get payed for their work. It is baked into the fractional reserve system. The end game is that the banker families literally own the whole world. </p>
<p>The planet is round. We are not going to colonize space. So the system will collapse when it hits it's physical limits. The only way out is not to have children. Or sound money and UBI but the elite have a deathgrip on their money printing machine.</p></div>		</li>
