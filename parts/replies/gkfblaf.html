			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends hugely on where you live, though. A 5 minute run to the shops isn't long enough to be worthwhile. Even 15-20 minutes is arguably not worth it, unless that entire journey is at highway speeds. Places like the UK and much of Europe, where driving long distances is less common than say the US, a diesel car is less likely to be economical as a family car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but what's more important is the relative price of diesel vs. gas. Until recently, in France, diesel was much, much cheaper than gas, because it was taxed much lower. Then the government reversed that which screwed a lot of people who bought a more expensive diesel car hoping to save money in the long run (and we got gilets jaunes rioting for like a year, I even saw some in a local roundabout today!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Average commute in the US is the same as in Europe. Plenty of people driving diesels in Europe. In Belgium it's 48% petrol, 47% diesel.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The engine needs to get hot enough. Sitting with the engine idling probably won't cut it. Taking a drive down the highway every week or so to rev it up properly, pick up some speed, and heat up the engine should suffice, or so I've been told.</p>
<p>These comments explain it better than me:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll do that now and then. Usually a lot more often. Obviously less with lockdown.</p>
<p>I just meant is it bad to sit in the car for a while whilst its still running. Running for heating and so the battery doesn't die lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience is with diesel generators and not cars, so it might not be applicable. But diesel generators will &quot;wet stack&quot; if you idle them or run them at very low loads. (Basically too much crap gets deposited on the exhaust side of the engine) Is this a concern with diesel cars or trucks?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern diesel engines haven't that disadvantage you say, but instead of breaking down faster they pollute more when they are cold. I said that with the &quot;experience&quot; of diesel cars we have here in Spain.</p>
<p>We had a lot bigger percentage of diesel passenger cars sold than petrol ones four or five years ago when some more strict pollution laws appeared (in some years will be illegal to diesel cars to drive around crowded cities).</p>
<p>Diesels have some things more to maintain, like replacing the particle filter or having to clean some time the EGR valve (gas recirculation valve to lower emissions), but they aren't worse in any way.</p></div>		</li>
