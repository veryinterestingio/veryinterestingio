			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a pretty shitty identifier. It only works up to a billion population, is easily glanced, and is stored on just about every server you've ever entered personal information into. Some kind of public/private key pair would be a much better system for secure identification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The irony is, the last 4 digits are the most 'unique' numbers of your SS.  All the other numbers, people can guess or work out.  And with surprising high accuracy for some people.</p>
<p>While the last 4 digits are assigned incrementally, if someone was trying to figure out a specific person's SS, that last group would be the hardest to guess.  Not that SS are that secure in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your SSN can be changed. I have a friend whose family members repeatedly committed identify theft using her SSN and it’s actually relatively easy to have changed.</p></div>		</li>
