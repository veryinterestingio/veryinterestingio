			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's just a part answer.</p>
<p>The bit you haven't explained is why the system used for 11 and 12 doesn't continue to 19 like it does in Lithuanian. Or why the system used for 13 to 19 doesn't match the system used for 20 to 99.</p>
<p>The answer is probably related to the way English was influenced by different languages and cultures at different times but I don't have the cultural and historical facts to explain what and when the critical influences were.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think that's the answer. Here's what it was in Old English:</p>
<ol>
<li>ān </li>
<li>twēgen </li>
<li>þrīe </li>
<li>fēower </li>
<li>fīf </li>
<li>six </li>
<li>seofon </li>
<li>eahta </li>
<li>nigon </li>
<li>tīene </li>
<li>endleofan </li>
<li>twelf </li>
<li>þrēotīene </li>
<li>fēowertīene </li>
<li>fīftīene </li>
<li>sixtīene </li>
<li>seofontīene </li>
<li>eahtatīene </li>
<li>nigontīene </li>
<li>twentig </li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jslcgGthSCw" target="_blank">Pronunciation of 1-12</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKqk1Oqo6bE" target="_blank">Pronunciation of 13-20</a></p>
<p>Things get different after 20, so maybe that's influences from other languages, but as you can see/hear, the &quot;ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen&quot; was already there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have said language where I said English. It's ELI5 so I was trying to not get into proto linguistics until I found a good source. Then I got distracted by a neurology paper about differences between the French and Basque systems.</p>
<p>My point was that the system from 1 to 10 is consistent in that each number has it's very own name. Then 11 and twelve have related name but the system relates to their difference from ten. Then a different system is used still relating to ten but differently for 13 to 19. Then there's a different system from 20 to 99.</p>
<p>So it seems like there's 4 systems going on simultaneously in English. As you point out, the timing of their incorporation into the language likely happened before the time when English became a separately identifiable language but I still think we're looking for an explanation that has 4 points of origin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Notice the metathesis on th<em>ir</em>teen had not happened yet.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be thriteen (threeteen) but speakers absent-mindedly switched the consonants that pronunciation stuck.  The same thing happened with 'third'.</p>
<p>It would be like if we all started saying 'purty' instead of 'pretty'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but the question is why don't we say three-twenty then?  Why the reversal?  I guess 10-19 is from german and the rest is from romance languages for some reason?</p></div>		</li>
