			<div class="markdown"><p>But then you wanted to overreact instead of letting the guy go. A shootout happen, cops get involved, cops beat the daylights out of you and put you in jail. All of these over a pack of gum.</p>
<p>That's what we call a cytokine storm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wondering but isn't there also a limit to how many employees you have and not all of them are aware of the shoplifter. So like since that shoplifter only comes around once a year and there are other shoplifters that your employees need to watch out for the few that might recognize him are too few in number to cover the whole store.</p>
<p>In other words your immune system doesn't produce extra antibodies if there is no need for them so if you had a cold with 3 and you get another with 20 chances are your immune system doesn't know how to react cause it had other stuff to worry about.</p>
<p>Someone can probably explain that better, but I tried my best</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your immune system Guards are constantly running laps around the store looking for new customers to ID.  They're not always watching every doorway coming in. So there's a chance someone breaks in and steals something in-between their laps.</p>
<p>When they see a 'customer', they take a picture memory and send it up to Security Desk (memory t-cells). It can take a while to go through the binder of photographs but when there's a match, the security desk sends out tons of antibody interns to help look around. When an intern spots that exact customer, they start to hang onto his legs and call for security backup. The guard arrives, and takes out the perp.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Or sometimes, they see a new customer (an allergen) who they check out and appears to be behaving well. They let them go on their way. Later, they find out the entire nose-medicine section has been trashed! The guards run through their memory banks and identify the Allergen and put their posters <em>everywhere.</em> Next time the guards see this guy, they run up and down the nose-medicine aisle over and over, making their own mess, just to make sure they stop him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are people who don't get colds because their bodies simply ignore that kind of virus. It does nothing to them and leaves their system in a few days. There are things that absolutely will kill you if ignored, which is why we have immune systems, but the cold isn't one of them.</p></div>		</li>
