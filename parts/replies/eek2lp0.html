<p>That was because <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/isis-terrorist-behind-us-laptop-ban-bomb-plot-identified-uk-car-mechanic-980368" target="_blank">of an actual ISIS plot</a> to use laptops as bombs on international flights </p>
<p>It is the plot uncovered by Israel and the same plot and source of info Trump revealed to the Russians in the oval office meeting</p></div>		</li>
