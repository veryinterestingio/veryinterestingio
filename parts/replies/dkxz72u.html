<p>Why do you think doctors tell you to keep certain injuries elevated? </p>

<p>So that the blood (and other fluids) drains out of them more easily, this reduces swelling.  Swelling at the site of an injury is good in general, but the body often goes overboard and swells too much, causing further damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just an oddity: I can't sleep (or sit) on anything softly padded.  Basically every bed or futon I've slept on, i wake up aching like crazy.  I've slept on the floor for over a decade now.   Related I can't sit on a couch for more than 20 minutes or so before my back starts hurting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surprisingly that's not too uncommon. There are plenty of people who need firm mattresses. There are some who need super firm. Everyone's different. What's good for me isn't necessarily good for you and vice-versa. Although a firm couch sounds.. less than relaxing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use a bamboo pillow with shredded memory foam that I'm able to sort of mold into a u shape so it's thicker on the edges when I roll to a side and thinner in the middle for back sleeping. If you're willing to give a $60 pillow a shot, I sure enjoy mine. It also stays pretty cool but if you do end up getting sweaty at night it'll stay wet and that sucks a bit but then I just flip it and throw it in the dryer which fluffs it back up anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to mention this. If you are awake enough  or you can do it &quot;unconsciously&quot; you can wad the pillow up when you change positions. Also rocking the bamboo memory foam, and liking it so far.</p>
<p>Edit: the pillows I bought were $29.99 on Amazon and got excellent reviews. Friend has had them for a while and loves them, only been sleeping on them for a week myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just going to mention that I tried one of those bamboo foam pillows. It was terrible and felt like the skin on my head couldn't breath or something and it was too warm. </p>
<p>I eventually went back to my old pillow and never tried it again. And yeah I tried to get used to the bamboo for like 2 months and it was always awful.</p></div>		</li>
