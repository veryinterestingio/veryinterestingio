			<div class="markdown"><p>The ice crystals don't act as catalysts. The CFCs condense on the ice crystals surface.   The surface covered with the CFC molecules acts as the catalyst for the Ozone depletion reaction. The ice crystals also serve as a mechansim for concentrating the CFCs in a localize area of the atmosphere, so when sunlight hits the crystals in mid/late February and disappates them, there remains a region of highly concentrated CFCs in the atmosphere where there is a high rate of the depletion reaction occuring. The CFC is not destroyed in the reaction, it only catalyzes its. Hence the residual nature of depletion for years after production of the chemicals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/tbonesocrul, this is actually incorrect.  The first comment from /u/shiningPate above is correct, but this one is not.</p>
<p>The polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) of the second type do not &quot;concentrate the CFCs&quot;.  They are important because they remove nitrogen from the stratosphere that would otherwise serve as a reservoir for the chlorine (chlorine would be tied up in things like chlorine nitrate).  The chlorine nitrate can undergo heterogeneous reactions on Type-II PSCs that free up Cl2 while keeping the nitrogen.  The PSCs eventually deposit out of the stratosphere, thus removing nitrogen but not chlorine.  That's why PSCs are important.</p>
<p>These are the 4 important factors in the formation of the ozone hole:</p>
<p><strong>1) The Production of CFCs:</strong>  CFCs are inert in the troposphere but can photolyze high in the stratosphere.<br />
<strong>2) The Polar Vortex:</strong>  The polar vortex &quot;isolates&quot; the south pole from the rest of the atmosphere.  This allows chemistry to proceed relatively unimpeded and causes very cold temperatures (180~190K in the polar winter).<br />
<strong>3) ClO-dimer chemistry:</strong>  The ClO-dimer breaks at the Cl-O bond, not the weaker O-O bond.  This allows for efficient recycling of ClO that wouldn't occur with the standard ClOx cycle ([O] is too low).<br />
<strong>4) De-nitrification of the stratosphere:</strong>  HCl and ClONO2 can react on PSCs (HCl + ClONO2 -&gt; Cl2 + HNO3) and free Cl from two reservoirs.  HNO3 can then deposit from the stratosphere, thus eliminating potential Cl reservoirs.</p>
<p>The stratosphere denitrifies over the winter and ozone loss begins at first light in the Austral spring (October) when Cl2 photolyzes.  This process leads to <strong>complete</strong> loss of ozone over Antarctica until the temperature warms and the polar vortex breaks up.</p>
<p>As /u/shiningPate mentioned above, this <em>can</em> occur over the Arctic if temperatures are sufficiently low (180~190K).  An example of this was in 2011 when there were sustained cold temperatures and we saw the formation of an ozone hole over the Arctic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Outstanding explanation. I would maybe explain in more detail to the layperson that the land masses in the NH causes the polar vortex to displace, gyrate, and even split due to turbulent wind flow around the contrasting marine and land air masses.....preventing the air from reaching the extremely cold temps needed to form the polar stratospheric clouds which contain the cfcs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least part of the heating also comes from IR radiation through the arctic sea ice from the relatively warm Arctic Ocean below. Two miles of ice sitting over the south pole is pretty damn cold alll the way down and doesn't have the IR flux into the atmosphere that occurs in the Arctic. With high level calm air sitting in total darkness, it cools down much colder that the Arctic. The Arctic also receives air warmed over the continents in the turbulent swirls that disrupt the stability of the vortex</p></div>		</li>
