			<div class="markdown"><p>Is what you say in your first paragraph the cause of RSI and things like that? I know when I've been using my phone or computer too much because my left arm really does feel &quot;stuck&quot; in the using position even when I'm trying to relax it at my side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Repetitive strain injuries are different. Using a muscle too much causes it to accumulate microtears. Given time to heal, this is actually how muscles get stronger, but if the muscle is torn faster than it can repair itself, the muscle will stay permanently injured and inflamed.</p>
<p>However, repetitive strain injuries and muscle tension aren't mutually exclusive. You could have both at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
