			<div class="markdown"><p>The human mind needs to feel a sense of community, identity, and purpose. Some people will those needs by succeeding in their careers, others by joining political or religious movements. One of the healthiest ways for people who haven't been able to define themselves by their careers is cultural traditions, taking pride in your heritage.</p>
<p>Christmas in America serves that cultural role, particularly for the elderly and the disadvantaged. It's emotionally healthy for the people who need it to feel like they are connecting with the community of their past, and to gain a sense of purpose in preserving and teaching those traditions.</p>
<p>The importance of being able to access these traditions is important enough that it's often included in mental health and recovery programs for aboriginal people and others who struggle to find a place to immerse themselves in the traditions of their ancestors.</p></div>		</li>
