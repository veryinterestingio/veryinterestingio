			<div class="markdown"><p>I pretty much told you everything.  It was a genetically engineering variation of the bacteria that causes tooth decay, which doesn't harm teeth at all.  When put in test animals mouths, it completely beat out the natural bacteria and took over and sugar no longer resulted in tooth decay.    </p>
<p>And that's it.  Once released this bacteria would be impossible to stop and would quickly just show up in peoples mouths everywhere, whether they wanted it or not.  This would cause an international incident at best, as well as panicking all the people who already have the false notion that genetic engineering is bad.  </p>
<p>Plus there is some truth to the notion that there would be no profit to me made from it.</p></div>		</li>
