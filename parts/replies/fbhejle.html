<li>A related and more productive concept would be making covered parking lots and putting solar panels on the roofs.  </li>
<li>This would help keep the cars cool in the summer and also provide a good amount of electricity to offset the business the lot serves and top off electric cars parked there.</li>

<p>1) catch the solar as electricity
2) shade the car to prevent needing to AC </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't believe that nobody in here has mentioned that the Cybertruck will have a solar tonneau cover that charges ~15 miles per day.  And despite what u/Ansuz07 says, cloudy days don't make them produce zilch.  Varies based on time of year, location, and the clouds, but it can go from making MORE electricity (rare but possible) to a maximum loss of 25% (again rare but possible)</p></div>		</li>

<p>They actually only have like 10 days left to fund their company if a solar powered smart car is something you’d be interested in funding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the base model 3, it would add about 5% per day, and on the longest range S, about 3% per day, on the best of days near the equator. In reality, this is not enough, so you'd have to supplement with charging anyway. And $3,000 in charging goes a LONG way. Since a car that charges in 15 minutes would be parked anyway, solar panels just didn't make sense.</p>
<p>There are talks about the cybertruck, which is much bigger, having solar and little folding solar flaps to allow 15 miles per day, but that would be for bugout purposes...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bulletproof, 500 miles range, and with 120 and 240 out and air compressor, air suspension, you can use it to power your trailer. </p>
<p>15 miles per day of electricity is more than most people drive, so it means it will always be topped off. Even if you go 300 miles, it will recharge over the next few weeks. For a bugout vehicle, the cybertruck is going to be the ultimate vehicle, but I feel like the solar is a niche. Unless you're ACTUALLY going to bugout or bring a camper off grid for more than a week frequently, you won't need solar, and it won't make sense for you. Bonus if you're in the mountains, as coming down with a trailer generates a lot of energy.</p>
<p>The truck doesn't make sense for everyone, but I think if you are looking for a CONSTRUCTION truck, it is perfect. </p>
<p>Plus, steel can just be welded and sanded to fix dents.</p></div>		</li>
