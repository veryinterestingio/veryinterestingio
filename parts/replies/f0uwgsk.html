			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it true that particles can be entangled over large distances? How does that work? Does the magnetism of one particle's spin affect the other particle over such a large distance? Or are they entangled in another way in that case? </p>
<p>Also if one particle is entangled with a other particle due to the magnetism caused by their spin, why isn't every particle entangled with every other particle that has a spin? Why are only these two particles entangled?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I think of it is, because information can only travel at the speed of light, even if both states are measured at the same time, they send their information towards each other at the speed of light. </p>
<p>I don't consider it to be that one is making the other change its state, rather I consider it in the frame of many worlds.  If  someone else measures their state, in my reality they still exist as a superposition of all possible states.  As long as their information doesn't reach me before I measure, I will be the one that causes the collapse.  Then, when their information reaches me, it will match up with what I measured, simply because I <em>collapsed the information while it was travelling to me</em></p>
<p>If their information reaches me first, then that is the same as me taking a measurement and that collapses my reality.</p>
<p>Of course when I say collapse, I just mean from our perspective it collapses. There is no collapsing, just from our perspective we can't see a quantum superposition of states.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We are talking in such small (nano/pico) terms that close/far mean totally different things than you or I experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought once entangled they remain entangled regardless of distance apart. One experiment managed to make entanglement work at a distance of 870 miles apart which seems like a very relatable distance for you or me.</p>
<p>edit: a word</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the distance thing is not that these two particles, at random, happen to be entangled, it's that when you bring them into the same system they can become entangled and influence each other. And that influence is maintained even when they're separated?  </p>
<p>So then, if you altered the state (? terminology) of one, would it still affect the other at a distance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to be careful about saying A was always A and B was always B because that seems not to be the case. As far as we can tell, there is only a probability for either particle to be in one state or the other up until it is measured, but once you measure it, you know information about what the other particle will be measured as even if it is measured at a far enough distance and with a timing that would prevent any communication from traveling between the particles about how they collapsed.</p>
<p>That’s the part that makes it slightly weird.</p></div>		</li>
