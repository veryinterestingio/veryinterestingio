Still not sure how to do it, or if it's even possible. Do you have any recommendations for resources that I can crash course myself in GIS software?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone who’s interested, the use of satellite-based radar altimetry is really cool. It capitalizes on the fact that the ocean surface varies, relative to the geoid, depending on the presence or absence of mass below the ocean surface. For instance an underwater mountain or canyon. </p>
<p>Make a global map of sea surface, remove tides and a few other things, and voila, you’ve got a map of the sea floor down to about 1 km resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Altimetry is actually really poor in regard to the oceans. It’s the best we have right now though.</p>
<p>It’s a lie (or misstatement) on how “little” we know of the oceans.</p>
<p>We’re far from knowing all of it, new aquatic creatures are found weekly, if not daily, but it’s just like rain forests and jungles.</p>
<p>It’s a LOT of area to cover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh agreed. In my work I occasionally conduct swath bathymetric surveys using multibeam sonar. I can get down to a few meters of resolution but the beam swath is still relatively narrow and expensive to collect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The us navy and russian navy in particular have extremely detailed maps of basically every feature in the ocean. You cant see them, but they exist. </p>
<p>The soviets were so obsessed with map making they made maps down to street width and bridge capacity of basically everywhere on earth. They spent huge amounts of time and money on making maps.</p></div>		</li>
