			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction - Pfizer is looking to deploy its vaccine as soon as next month for frontline health workers. But it probably will be sometime next year that healthy civilian adults and children get it, so weâ€™ll have a lot more data at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a frontline healthcare worker, I can tell you that I'm not super excited about my employer mandating the use of this vaccine. I'll take it obviously, but I want to be given the choice. </p>
<p>I wonder if there will be any preliminary testing prior to the vaccine being administered. Isn't it a waste to give a vaccine to someone that may have already had an asymptomatic case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Not everyone makes a strong immune response from natural infection. The vaccine on the other hand is presenting a specific protein that the immune system has been found to develop especially useful antibodies against. There's every reason to expect that the immunity granted by the vaccine will be stronger and longer lasting than the natural immunity many individuals will have developed by being infected. This is particularly true of people who had very mild cases, as serum antibody profiling is finding that mild infection is associated with a weaker antibody response that moderate and severe cases.</p></div>		</li>
