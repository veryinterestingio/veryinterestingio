<p>TIL</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQTw_PVzdOQ" target="_blank">Semi-SFW</a> - contains CGI animations - tho the actual squishing might make you cringe a bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=175IiktUk6w" target="_blank">Also Semi-SFW</a>  actual procedure, non-nude.</p>
<p>Edit: Responses to this post have taught me that 1) Many people think mammograms squish your boobs against your body. Fraid not; 2) These videos may have discouraged a boatload of women from wanting to get a mammograms. It's still a very important screening tool, as uncomfortable as it may be, so please do take your doctor's advice and get one if recommended to. Cancer hurts worse than squished boobs!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean the filters increase contrast by only (or approximately) letting through certain wavelengths that penetrate breast tissue well, so there is less background from.... Scattering by other wavelengths? Inconsistent tissue penetration? </p>
<p>Or is it just to decrease the xray dose so you're not hitting the tissue with extra frequencies that aren't going to be effective for imaging anyway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly right, and decreased dose is one of the many benefits, along with much better image quality, to digital X-Ray detectors as opposed to old analog film. What a great question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never gotten a mammogram, and I'm scared to. I have a really stupid question that I've always been afraid to ask...is the machine pre-programmed to squish down a certain distance? Or does it self-adjust depending on the pressure exerted? The reason I ask is that I have really big boobs. I've always been afraid that the machine will smash them too much. It makes me feel claustrophobic thinking about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My area of expertise is limited to the actual X-Ray detector itself. There are two components to an Mammography system, the system-which shoots X-rays, it's the giant mobile C-Arm contraption, and the detector, which is on the other side of the breast. The detector is what actually produces an image that the doctor looks at.</p>
<p>Also all systems are different, I can only speak to the ones that I'm familiar with, I'd rather not say who I work for. But with ours the machine is not pre-programmed, the machine is controlled by a foot pedal. You'd be surprised just how much control you have with your foot, like driving. Seemed kind of counter-intuitive to me at first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The x-ray technician literally arranged your body and breast on the machine and adjusts the pressure to be appropriate for your body. It doesnâ€™t feel good, but the pain disappears almost immediately when the pressure is released. Itâ€™s about 60 seconds total out of the year, so itâ€™s worth it for your health.</p></div>		</li>

The breast needs to be flattened to a maximum thickness of about an inch, in order to achieve a worthwhile diagnostic image. Thinner is better, all other things being equal.</p></div>		</li>
