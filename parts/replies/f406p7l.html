<p>I recently tested this on many occasions while finishing my house and unscrewing philips screw heads from underneath both plaster and paint layer in outlet holes in brick walls.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If other screw designs—such as Phillips (plus), Robertson (square), Torx (star), and Allen (hex)—are painted over, it can be near impossible to unscrew them without using some sort of extractor tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't think of a reason they couldn't be cleaned out with something like a needle. I don't know in what way it'd be near impossible unless you have a super tiny screw or a massive amount of paint to get off.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Super quick because no cleaning needed - driver tip pushes just pushes it out when you come to release it. Doesn't make it slip for some reason</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nice tip, though.</p></div>		</li>
