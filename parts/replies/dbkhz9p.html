			<div class="markdown"><p>Came to chime in. I take 100mg 3x/day (300mg total). This is to effect the stimulation of serotonin and nor-epinephrine, and at 300mg or higher doses, it caused production of dopamine. Basically, my brain is dependent on this medication to pump out the old &quot;feel good&quot; chemicals. </p>
<p>Right as I started taking Effexor, I was also coming off from Tramadol use for 3 years. I finally told my doctor I couldn't handle the combo, and used medical cannabis to treat the pain and help reduce the violent withdrawals caused by stopping Tramadol.</p>
<p>Now, a year later, and I have a built in reminder for when I haven't taken a pill, I get the spins, electric jitters, BAD double vision (more so than when I'm on the medication), and an overall feeling of stupidity (different from being high on THC :D). I am working with my doctor to change what I take, and we are going to be doing a 4 month reduction of Effexor to make it easier, then start something new after I'm over Effexor.</p>
<p>All-in-all, it is an amazing drug, it really does work, but not being able to drive, read, or focus due to the double vision I get, and the extreme night sweats leaving me feeling horrible when I wake up, I want to give something else a shot for my issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk how you can say it's an amazing drug after what I just read.</p>
<p>I was also on it for a while. The entire ordeal, from beginning to end, was one of the worst experiences of my life. People should try EVERYTHING else first. </p>
<p>My psychiatrist at the time started me off on it as my very first antidepressant because he was getting paid to do so, I'm assuming. (Effexor pens and pads all over his office.) When I told him it was causing terrible side effects and I wanted to wean off of it and try something else, he prescribed me a higher dosage and told me I just needed more! I had to wean myself off of it and I've never been to a psychiatrist since. It's better just to deal with hard times on your own and not entrust your mind to a hack who's looking out more for himself than the people he's supposedly helping.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, I just hate that guy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I agree with you there. I do see many popular drugs being pushed by my doctor whenever he gets a new set of swag from the drug companies in his office...</p>
<p>When I said it's wonderful, I mean in the sense that it does actually work for some people. For myself, it lowers the nerve pains that I get everywhere to the point I can function. But alas, the side effects are just too much for me. As for people using it for depression and what not, I'm not sure how well it works, because there are times where it puts me down in the dumps. About every 2-3 months I get a week of depression, end up just sleeping most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had a few people tell me about modafanil. I think I might discuss that with my new PCP. I could use the energy. Effect at my dose should dump dopamine and help with energy levels, but instead I am always tired :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was addicted to tramadol in my teens. I was quite a fat kid so in my mind that meant I could take as much as I wanted, usually a sheet (6 500mg) at a time. </p>
<p>3 years and 5 seizures down the line, I don't do drugs anymore. I'm proud of myself, managed to get off them with no professional help. I laid in bed and cried for a few days. Felt a bit better afterwards, I've also lost 3 stone to date ?</p></div>		</li>
