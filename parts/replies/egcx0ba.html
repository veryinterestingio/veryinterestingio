			<div class="markdown"><p>With a smaller bucket (high ISO), you can fill it more quickly and easily (shorter time and/or smaller hose), but when you look at it it becomes harder to accurately tell how full it is (the picture is noisier). Bigger buckets take more time or a bigger hose, but you can more accurately look at the water level. This is partially because it's always raining a little bit; the rain will add noise to the amount of water collected (think of the bucket as getting taller but not wider: the taller the bucket, the less effect the rain has on the overall level as a percentage).</p>
<p>Also, if you imagine the image as a lot of buckets instead of just one (like pixels), the bigger your hose (wider the aperture) the harder it is to hit a single bucket only - so the image is less sharp (in particular, there is less depth of field, so out-of-focus parts of the image are blurrier; this analogy isn't perfect).</p>
<p>Available light is like water pressure. The less pressure you have, the bigger a hose you need to get the same amount of water in the same amount of time. So if you have a small hose (small aperture), a big bucket (small ISO), and low pressure (light), it's going to take forever to fill it up properly (very slow shutter speed required).</p>
<p>Also, if the hose is moving, the longer you keep it on, the messier everything gets (motion blur).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d reverse that, keeping the ISO as the bucket size. Available light is like water pressure. Imagine having low water pressure (low light) you’d have to leave the hose on longer or make the bucket smaller. </p></div>		</li>
