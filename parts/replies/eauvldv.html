			<div class="markdown"><p>Most seizures are brain cells running amok, their action potential lowers enough that they just keep firing, essentially a large repetetive wave of electrical activity overwhelms the brain, it isnt surprising that it can trigger all sorts of unrelated mechanisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some families that swear by it and some that say it doesn’t work at all.</p>
<p>I live in Colorado where it’s obviously easy to get, but our providers do not prescribe it so I know almost nothing about dosing. </p>
<p>We see a lot of complex seizure disorders which can be extremely difficult to control, such as Dravet, Lennox-Gastaut. Many families are very excited about Epidiolex (the new FDA approved medication that is similar to CBD), but going to presentations by the drug reps, it’s certainly unlikely to completely eliminate seizure activity in these patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I think that is a dream that may never come to fruition.</p>
<p>I would love to have something that is &quot;natural&quot; but also helps.</p>
<p>I have been taking 2 medications for 17 years now. I am always looking for something that will make life easier. I'm sure I will continue to be on medication the rest of my life.</p>
<p>My understanding on CBD is that it isn't the part of marijuana that makes you high.</p>
<p>I come from a very conservative background and really only want to use something that is legal.</p>
<p>Any other info that you could give me?
I'd appreciate it</p></div>		</li>
