			<div class="markdown"><p>Pi can be used in many shapes. For example, waves can be expressed in terms of pi.</p>
<p>This connects with the use of pi in a measurement called &quot;radians&quot;, in which can be used as a way to measure angles instead of degrees. In this case, instead of saying there are 360 degrees to travel around a central point of a circle, you would say that there are 2<em>Ï€</em> rads in a circle... in which case we've run into a problem... we've found ourselves back inside a circle.</p>
<p>You see, by the definition we commonly use for pi as the ratio between the circumference and the diameter of a circle, pi is intertwined with circles. Sure, we can find in mysteriously outside of the circle, but almost no matter where we find it, we can connect it <strong><em>almost</em></strong> always back with a circle. Isn't that strange?</p>
<p>This example isn't the best one, but it works. People have found relations to pi in vibrating strings that have near to no relation to geometry at all.</p>
