			<div class="markdown"><p>I think my favorite part of all this is: what if they're not? What if you only need one of those things stored to trigger all the rest to recall properly? What if that's why memory recall is such a spectrum of success?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your brain uses a compression worse than mpeg. Instead of lowering resolution, it leaves out specific details. Like what was the color of the vase at the back of the house in friends? Mpeg would show u correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I'd bet that you know enough childhood rhymes and sing-along songs that you could fill a whole book.</p>
<p>Seems to my caveman brain that it's the memories themselves that take up least energy or space, but the brain's computational power, synthesizing context and organizing tropes and micro-managing at the literal speed of thought, that really sucks up all the memory and energy, but gives real weight and teeth to the actual remembrance.</p></div>		</li>
