			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s actually a really interesting thought because you’re sort of right. Just as time dilates when you’re moving fast, distances shrink along the direction of your movement as well. Look up the ladder paradox for a really cool example of that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, travelling at the speed of light is impossible for anything with mass as it would require infinite energy.  But we could travel at, say, 99.9% of the speed of light.  It would still required a lot of energy, but a finite amount.</p>
<p>On the flip side, particles with zero mass (like a photon) can travel only at the speed of light, no faster, no slower.</p>
<p>There's an amazing book my Isaac Asimov where he discusses all of these things in really readable English (with a few simple equations thrown in for good measure).  It's called The Stars In Their Courses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would it feel instantaneous?  Isn't the whole point of relativity that things basically always feel &quot;normal&quot; for you?  Your own time would pass the same as always, but everyone not travelling at the speed of light would appear to zip ahead in fast forward?  I think if you travelled at the speed of light in a space ship for, say, five years, it would feel like five years to you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This statement was too broad. They can't go faster, but they can go slower. And different photons can have different speeds in the same medium. It's the speed of light in a vacuum that photons can't exceed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To expand on this, photons can move at different speeds, change directions, and interact with matter. Photons don't have a single constant speed, they slow down and speed up as they move through water, glass, air, and other matter. However, whatever speed they are moving in those conditions is, in those conditions, the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

Anyway, in the off chance someone will actually see this: basically this whole comment chain is wrong. Talking about measurements of time in the reference frame of a photon (or anything travelling at c) is nonsensical as a photon has no inertial reference frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think not really.  For a couple reasons.  1), <del>you would still feel time passing normally.  If you traveled at the speed of light for five years, it would feel like five years to you.  BUT, you would see everything around you standing still.  Like in the example above, your watch ticks along just fine, but the watch of the person watching you ticks more slowly.  At the speed of light, your watch would tick normally, but the watches of those standing on earth would appear to stop.  So it wouldn't &quot;feel&quot; instantaneous.  But it might be that when you finally stop, you're five years older, but everyone on earth hasn't aged a single moment.</del> </p>
<p>I think /u/Crash4654 is right, it would be the other way around.  If you traveled at the speed of light for like five years, people on earth would see your watch hand barely moving, or maybe not moving at all.  It would be like you're in slow motion.  From your point of view, you're living five normal years.  Everyone on earth is in super fast forward.  And when you finally stop, thousands of years would have passed.  I dunno the exact years, but just to give an idea.  Always had trouble keeping that straight haha.  Either way, it wouldn't feel instantaneous.  That's the whole thing of relativity.  Time will always feel normal to you.  But to others, your time will look different depending on your speed or proximity to a gravity well.  It's relative.  But to you, things will always feel normal for yourself, your own &quot;self&quot; will continue along its timeline like nothing's different.  You'll still age five normal years. </p>
<p>But 2) it's more or less impossible to go the speed of light anyway so it's sort of a non-question.  It's the same as saying Saturn would float if you could put it in a bathtub big enough.  That might &quot;technically&quot; be true, Saturn's density would allow it to float.  But if you have a bathtub big enough for it to float in, the gravity of the two objects would interfere with conducting that experiment.  You could never actually float Saturn in a body of water.  </p>
<p>If you tried to go at 100% lightspeed, as you neared the speed of light, your mass would increase, so you would need to add more energy to increase your acceleration.  But then as you got even faster, your mass would continue to increase, which would require more and more energy.  Basically, the more energy you pump into your spaceship to get it to go at 100% the speed of light, the more massive it would get.  It's sort of an endless cycle.  You could never actually reach 100% the speed of light.  </p>
<p>So <em>maaaybe</em> it would seem instantaneous insofar as others in the universe would have appeared to have not progressed a single moment, but you could never actually go the speed of light anyway, so it doesn't really matter.  And to you, you would still experience time passing normally, so you would still age.</p>
<p>At least I'm pretty sure that would be the case.  Someone smarter than me should chime in lol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interestingly, when you look at the person who is standing still, you will see their time as moving much slower too -- if you could see their watch, the second hand would also be going slow. This is because, from your perspective, you are completely still and they are moving very fast. (This is relativity)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That feels wrong. If you and your pal synced your watches, and then one of you went to travel at relativistic speeds for a while while the other stayed still, your clocks would show different time when you'd get back together.</p>
<p>This logically means that when you look at the person who is standing still, you should observe their time going much faster than yours. Because otherwise, your clock should be simultaneously ahead and behind your pal's clock, and that is impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to &quot;get back together&quot; your velocities relative to each other needs to change at some point (if only to simply change sign). When your pal changes direction your definitions of what &quot;simultaneously&quot; means changes. This shift in definition makes up for the discrepancy you're describing.</p></div>		</li>
