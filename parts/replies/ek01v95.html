			<div class="markdown"><p>A home range in the wild can be up to 20km because generally they have to go that far in order to find everything they need (food, water, shelter, conspecifics etc) however, if everything the animal needs is provided in a smaller space, the animal no longer needs to travel &gt;2km a day. The animal does not have a compulsive need to travel long distances daily, they travel because they need resources.
Due to the reduction in travel time, exercise and predatory avoidance daily, it is the zoo's responsibility to maintain mental stimulation through training, enrichment and enclosure design. This is generally very well provided for (of course, depending on the zoo. However, many zoo's these days do fantastic jobs) in other taxa, but primates (specifically hominids or &quot;great apes&quot;) are another story. Hominids are incredibly difficult to keep in captivity due to their complex social structures and amazing mental capabilities. I assure you though that good zoo's in your area are doing the best they can and, honestly, with the advancement of technology, the world of primate enrichment is about to explode! I'm really excited with how it's going to progress! </p></div>		</li>
