<p>I can often think of a word in French or Latin but not my native English. My family have gotten used to some of these words randomly appearing in the middle of a sentence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in my 3rd year studying Spanish in high school when I started taking a Japanese class in preparation for an upcoming trip.  It so happened that one of our Spanish vocab units happened to have words that I had learned in Japanese.  I didn't even realize what I had done until my Spanish teacher gave me my test back and suggested I might want to try again - in Spanish this time. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is called <em>code-switching</em> in Linguistics. It's a very common phenomenon!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even though I only studied Spanish for 6 years of middle school and high school, to this day when I'm playing Scrabble my brain keeps making words out of the tiles of my hand in Spanish and English.</p>
<p>Edit: like I obviously have the tiles for &quot;toga&quot;, but all I see is &quot;gato&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I've got letters here... Thing with horns... Or maybe milk? Wait, 'Fallout' has too many letters. Maybe I was thinking of '<strong>G</strong>ame <strong>o</strong>f <strong>t</strong>he <strong>Y</strong>ear'. I'll just go with 'tag'.&quot; - Me watching <em>Countdown</em> during the letter jumbles</p>
<p>&quot;Plus seven equals 127, add the 50, which is... One-forty-seven, fifty-seven, sixt- IT WAS GOAT!&quot; - Me watching <em>Countdown</em> during the maths portion fifteen minutes later</p>
<p>Edit: ...wait, that's entirely irrelevant since this part of the thread was about code switching, sorry.</p></div>		</li>
