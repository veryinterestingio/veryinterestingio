			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, extra question, sorry if you don’t know lol, but so how does that relate to twins being made? Is it just a rare occurrence where two eggs are fertilized somehow, or does one egg split into two somehow haha?</p>
<p>Sorry I’m just curious lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly yes. As in, you can have twins come from one egg, and you can have twins that result from two eggs being fertilized at the same time. It is called <em>monozygotic</em> for the twins from one egg, commonly called identical twins, and <em>dizygotic</em> for the twins from two eggs, commonly called fraternal twins. I'd refer you to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin</a></a> for more information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to note for comprehension reasons: monozygotic twins are made from <em>one</em> sperm and <em>one</em> egg, while dizygotic twins are made from <em>two</em> sperms and <em>two</em> eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's been a documented but extremely rare case of a woman becoming pregnant while pregnant. So her body essentially released another egg accidentally. Both children survived, and iirc the birth of the first child occured without problems for the second child.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might freak you out but a second egg CAN be released while a woman is already pregnant AND it can get fertilized AND she can have 2 different aged babies!  It's crazy, and rare, but happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They addressed this on Call the Midwife once. Twins, I think delivered at the same time (this was the 50s, no such thing as fancy fetal medicine yet), and the mother was white, husband was white, but one of the babies was not white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can be either, can be that two eggs were released and both fertilised (non-identical, no more similar than any other siblings) or the egg divide after it was fertilised and therefore identical</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly - someone below posted this link.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/biology-of-the-female-reproductive-system/menstrual-cycle" target="_blank">https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/biology-of-the-female-reproductive-system/menstrual-cycle</a></p>
<p>The pill mimics the second phase of the progesterone/estrogen cycle, makes the body think it just finished ovulating and is waiting for a period.  Stop taking it (that 7 days of dummy pills) and the body thinks it's time for a period now and has one. Then start taking the real pills and the body thinks it's back at &quot;just finished ovulating&quot;. </p>
<p>The body follows a sequence - rising levels of estrogen eventually trigger progesterone production (and also follicle hormones causing ovulation)  which then high those levels cause both estrogen and progesterone levels to go down, once ovulation has happened. (When it reaches a certain low level, menstruation happens and the cycle begins again with risin estrogen production). </p>
<p>Each step in the sequence triggers the next. </p>
<p>By taking a pill with estrogen (and some pills also have progesterone, in others the high estrogen level triggers progesterone)  the ovulation triggers never happen; meanwhile, because the body is ingesting the hormone(s), the natural sequence to slowly stop making the hormones never happens, because the hormones are taken as a pill, not made in the  body; so as long as you take the pill you are stuck in the &quot;finished ovulating&quot; cycle.  </p>
<p>As I understand it, some versions of the pill you can keep taking the active pill and never  menstruate while on it. (Also some implants)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tldr it's like a hormonal clock where you can only get pregnant when the hour hand strikes 12. But the pill repeatedly winds the hour hand back to 3, meaning it can never go past 6.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mini-pills are the ones where you take active pills all the time. They have progestin only, no estrogen. They're designed to thicken the cervical mucus and uterine lining so sperm can't get to the eggs/eggs can't attach to the uterine wall. Mini-pills <em>may</em> prevent ovulation and/or stop your period, but it's not guaranteed, which is why it's super important to take them at the same time every day. The mini-pill is what they put you on if you're breastfeeding (because estrogen destroys breast milk production) or if you have certain health conditions or you can't handle/are concerned about the estrogen in a traditional pill. I'm not sure if there are other types of pills where you're always on the active one, but I'm on the mini-pill right now until I'm done breastfeeding so that's what I know about. :)</p></div>		</li>
