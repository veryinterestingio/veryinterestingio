			<div class="markdown"><p>not just westerns.  all movies have a left/right dominance with heroes tending to travel towards the right when &quot;Going&quot; somewhere, or &quot;facing&quot; a challenge... and traveling to the left is traditionally a sign of a reversal, like, if you're retreating, or returning home...</p>
<p>think of the end of Avengers Endgame.  the heroes almost exclusively are to the left of the villains.  </p>
<p>edit; more xamples\~  </p>
<p>look at Thor Ragnarok, is Surtur to the left or right of Thor in the opening scene?  is the retreat vessel to the left or the right of Asgard at the end of the movie?  when thor and hulk fight in the arena, is thor to the left or the right?  </p>
<p>and what does that mean for &quot;perspectives?&quot;  in Captain America:Civil War, who's on the left and who's on the right?  what does this do for your sense of &quot;identifying with a viewpoint character&quot;  when Spider-Man fights Captain America, he's on the left, he's the one facing the struggle.  we see this scene MORE from the viewpoint of the kid who meets captain america for the first time, and LESS from the viewpoint of THE TITLE HERO meeting Tony's new apprentice.  as much as people choose sides in that movie based on they're supposed ethical leanings, i'm willing to bet a lot of people are more influenced by visual language than they understand.  </p>
<p>also, remember that rules are established so that they might be broken.  in art, nothing is foolproof.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shoulda capped &quot;Western,&quot; I guess. I meant Euro-American as opposed to Asian, particularly Japanese, which reads right to left and might also do film motion right to left.</p></div>		</li>
