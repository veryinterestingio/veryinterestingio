			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points.  There simply weren't very many other major power competitors in the region, and the terrain outside of the main fertile regions made accessing China difficult in a time before mass sea travel. I mean, one could say there were several major power competitors <em>in China proper</em>, but they were largely similar culturally, kind of like the ancient warring Greek states.</p>
<p>Historians have evidence of the mass, Sparta-level, full-societal organization in order to support the state, dating at least as far back as the Spring &amp; Autumn Period (8th century BC), two whole centuries before Cyrus organized the Middle East under Persian rule.  And since the system generally worked, as the region became more unified, they simply kept improving the same system until most of what is now China considered themselves the &quot;people of the Han&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
