			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an anesthesiologist, listen to this guy. We all talk about veins that blow. Unless you're introducing a rapid infusion catheter into a vein that won't allow it you're not blowing the vein. You botched the iv access, most commonly because the catheter was only marginally in the vein so that any movement dislodges in from the venous lumen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can't some IV drugs sort of &quot;eat&quot; at the vein weakening them to collapse too? I once spent several days on vancomycin and (I think) ceftriaxone, by the 6th day, both of my arms/wrist were 90% bruise, they had given up on finding a good vein and put in a picc line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Over time they can thrombose, yes especially with high osmolality solutions and vessel irritants. Maybe I was a bit quick to refer to a pet peeve of mine where IVs &quot; blow &quot; shortly after placement. ðŸ˜…</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a veterinarian and, while that may be true for humans, there are plenty of species that you'll blow the vein even if you do everything right. Getting venous access in birds is an art and preventing the vessel from blowing requires dedicated attention on pretty much every stick. Ferret veins are so freaking roll-y and their skin is somehow simultaneously thick and stretchy... good luck. Cats are tough because of the claws and teeth, and a lot of sedatives crash the blood pressure. Dogs typically revive my self confidence that I'm able to get a vein if I'm having a bad day. </p>
<p>I did an IV on a human woman on an airplane once after she collapsed in the galley. It wasn't as easy as bleeding a cow, but it also wasn't particularly difficult either.</p></div>		</li>
