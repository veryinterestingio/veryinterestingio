<p>On paper another year alive is fantastic, but not if you're going to be feeling like death every day and stuck in bed being a vegetable.</p>
<p>My dad fucking hated being alive when he had cancer. He was still able to laugh, but I could tell he hated it, everything was taken from him. An extra year of that would've been hell for him. I also hated seeing him the way he was.</p>
<p>It's an extremely sad and depressing thing to say, but sometimes you're just better passing away.</p></div>		</li>
