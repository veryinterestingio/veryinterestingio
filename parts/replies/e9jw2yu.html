			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to say, I read the question differently:  I assumed that OP was asking what the difference in the molecular composition would be for a plastic that doesn't melt or deform under microwave-level temperatures (which I'm guessing is down to a &quot;more tangled&quot; and longer polymer chain, but I expect that it's probably not that simple)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a good question too. Molecular composition and chain length both would impact segment mobility and how that segment mobility would change with temperature. Chain mobility would ultimately be related to how well the material would flow or lose its mechanical strength. </p>
<p>Entanglement would play a part, crystallinity (If present) would play a part, intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding would also factor in. It’s a significant challenge to relate molecular structure to macro-properties but is always an active area of research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except it isn’t that straightforward anymore. While 3 &amp; 6 have long been considered more stable under heat, it turns out they release some unpleasant chemicals that will mess up a developing body (child/young adult). <a href="https://www.nontoxicrevolution.org/blog/7-types-of-plastic" target="_blank">read more</a> . I have a NYT article clipped on this very subject somewhere, if anyone wants more info, PM me and I’ll send it. I confirmed it all with me kids neonatologist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct regarding plastic labeled number 3. I incorrectly associated the recycling number 3 with polypropylene when in fact polypropylene is number 5. Poly(vinyl chloride), otherwise known as PVC and identified by recycling code 3 is not safe for use in the microwave.</p>
<p>As I indicated above, polypropylene, recycling lab 5 is considered safe for the microwave when labeled as such. </p>
<p>Please read the packaging label, and still, when in doubt use a glass or ceramic plate.</p></div>		</li>
