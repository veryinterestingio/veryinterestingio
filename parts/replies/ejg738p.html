<p>This obviously doesn't apply if your car is supersonic, of course :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See open topped f1 and indy cars as examples. Apart from g-force related strains, the drivers have full range of motion of their head and hands in the cockpit, even at top speeds. And can even lift their hands to flip off other drivers at 250-300kph+ </p>
<p>The design of the cars means that very little air is passing  their heads, whereas just a few inches away air is moving very fast. </p></div>		</li>
