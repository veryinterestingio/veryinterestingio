			<div class="markdown"><p>The veins which carry blood back to the heart and the arteries which carry blood out of the heart are very close together in the paws of dogs.  They are so close together that the warm blood in the arteries heats up the cold blood in the veins.   Dogs regulate the size of the veins and arteries to manage this blood flow and temperature exchange.  </p>
<p>Basically the warm blood heats up the cold blood.  This limits heat loss.  The warm blood heats up the cold blood which is returning to the dogs core .</p>
<p>As opposed to humans which don't have this countercurrent circulation.  Our piping hot blood makes it to the surface of our hands and dumps the heat to the air without warning up cold blood in our veins that is making its way back to our cores and need to be heated up there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So presumably this is advantageous to us in some ways?</p>
<p>I'd imagine that this makes it easier to reject heat by delivering hot blood directly to the sweaty skin. Our ability to reject heat is after all one of the factors that made us apex predators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our biggest advantage over animals with padded paws is our dexterity and ability to sense very fine differences in texture and the like. This necessitates thinner skin at the point of contact with the things we are manipulating and touching, and this means that blood vessels are closer to the outermost layers of skin.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that our human ancestors also evolved in much warmer climates, which has carry over in the locations of blood vessels and stuff.  Hominids are also a fairly young group, compared to the canids and felids, which have had longer to adapt and radiate and further adapt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are much better at expelling heat, yes. Dogs don‚Äôt sweat but we sweat more than any other animal. It gives us a massive endurance boost over other animals and allows us to outpace them in the long run even though they beat us in the short one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans have the greatest endurance of basically all animals. Early hunters would &quot;walk animals to death&quot;, they still do today in some primitive cultures. One of the biggest reason for this is our ability to dump heat quickly. We do this by sweating and not having thick hair, but also (I guess?) by having our arteries dump more heat to the environment.
Most mammals have high risks of overheating, a tiger needs to kill his prey very quickly or the best from his muscles will literally &quot;cook&quot; him to death.</p></div>		</li>
