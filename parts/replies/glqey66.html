			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, under high enough pressure. CO2 cartridges for airsoft guns, for example, have at least some liquid CO2 in them as long as they're under about 90 degrees F.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does pressure affect states because the more of it there is the more force it is pushing on a substance? For example could you decrease the pressure on a solid enough that it would melt or vaporise?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out the phase diagram for carbon dioxide: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6nJMeS5.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/6nJMeS5.jpg</a></p>
<p>It tells you the state of carbon dioxide at a given combination of pressure and temperature. </p>
<p>1 MPa = 10 Bar of pressure, so atmospheric pressure is around the 0.1 MPa line. 273.15K = 0°C = 32°F</p>
<p>The supercritical part is especially interesting because carbon dioxide behaves like a gas and a liquid in this region. You can use this for drying delicate structures. First, under high pressure (liquid region in the phase diagram), replace whatever liquid is in the structure by washing it in liquid carbon dioxide. Then heat it up until it goes supercritical and finally reduce the pressure, so carbon dioxide becomes a gas. This prevents capillary action from pulling your structure together. </p>
<p>This is how aerogel is made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're being downvoted because of your phrasing. The way I read it was &quot;ice always sublimates&quot;, which is of course not true. &quot;It is possible for ice to sublimate [in conditions we easily see on earth]&quot; is a really interesting point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Grits102 small nitpick and something i don't like about that article. sublimation is evaporation, but evaporation is not sublimation.</p>
<p>even gold evaporates at room temperature, but VERY slowly.</p>
<p>add energy to some molecules of a solid and some might break free and float away. this is evaporation, it is even in the name (e-vapor-ate -&gt; into-vapor-ing)</p>
<p><em>sublimation</em> only really happens when the substance in question physically <em>cannot</em> exist as a liquid at certain pressures.</p>
<p>CO2 sublimates because it can't be a liquid at atmospheric pressure. ice doesn't sublimate, it evaporates.</p>
<p>iodine is often erroneously given as an example of sublimation (i even got example that in my high school chemistry class), yet, it can easily exist as a liquid at atmospheric pressure and it melts if you heat it. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/chem13-news-magazine/sites/ca.chem13-news-magazine/files/uploads/images/october-2015-article-3-graph-sublimation_page_04.jpg" target="_blank">phase diagram</a>. but it evaporates readily at room temperature and the vapour is very coloured and easy to see clouding it's vessel. see it only actually boils at 184C</p>
<p>whether or not you want to call that sublimation or not i guess is arbitrary, but to do so sortof removes any distinction between it and evaporation.</p></div>		</li>
