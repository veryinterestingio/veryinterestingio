			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely true. The street in front of my house is the only route to about a hundred houses in the back of my subdivision, and my bedroom window faces the street. On weekdays, a handful of cars pass my house early in the morning. There's 4:10 am semi-loud muffler guy, 4:35 am diesel truck guy, and a handful of other early shift workers. Most of them pass by like clockwork, and I'm sure it contributes to the fact that right around 4:50 am, ten minutes before my alarm goes off, I can actually feel my metabolism dialing up. I start to feel wakeful, my pulse and blood pressure kick it up a notch, and of course I start to need to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that on weekends, when these worker vehicles are not passing by my house, the 5 am wakefulness doesn't disappear, but it is more subdued, meaning I can sleep in until 6 or 7 if I want.</p></div>		</li>
