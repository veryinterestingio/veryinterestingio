			<div class="markdown"><p>a few corrections.  I've been in about 15 credits to feature movies and animations.  </p>
<p>Not every single person is a union member.  For example - almost 0% of digital special effects artists are union members.  They work for what seems like ok wages but then you count the unpaid OT - of which there is a TON of, then they're often making min wage on an hourly basis.   There are lots of non-union labor involved in movies.  </p>
<p>Post production doesn't make up the bulk of the production.  Even on a fairly VFX heavy production.  </p>
<p>Marketing and advertising can definitely push in the tens of millions of dollars but are never computed or counted as part of &quot;production&quot;.  Marketing is huge but it's just  not accounted together with production costs.  It's totally separate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and the top actors occasionally get profit sharing on top of their multi-million dollar contracts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't address the question though. Profit sharing is only determined after the movie's financials start coming in. It's how REVENUE might be distributed, it's not how the COST of the movie is calculated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because Hollywood is famous for accounting assumptions that mean no movie ever makes a profit, &quot;profit sharing&quot; is really revenue sharing (only fools accept a share of the profit, actors demand and often get a percentage of the revenue sometimes with a guaranteed amount if their percentage would otherwise be smaller).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.  In most blockbusters, the largest number of names is the vfx dept.  Non-union.</p></div>		</li>
