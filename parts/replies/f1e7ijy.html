			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, many times, if she has a regular and predictable cycle. Then her late period carrying the defective fertilized egg is a little miscarriage and is probably a tad more bloody than the normal period. </p>
<p>It’s pretty cool how our bodies can detect it’s defective and then get rid of it naturally.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can't be somewhat pregnant. You either are or you aren't, but yes. Most women have miscarriages way more often than they realize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possible chemical pregnancy that terminated itself before she knew she was pregnant. It can happen and it can happen right after her expected period to make itself appear as a &quot;late&quot; period instead of an early miscarriage.</p>
<p>But also yeah the human body is great at self terminating when the genes aren't compatible with life. Like a filter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You skipped the fact that sperm aren't injected into the cervix.  They are dumped in the vagina which is WAY more hostile than the uterus and fallopian tubes.  They have to get pretty lucky to even find the 'door'.  I think more sperm die by not making it to the cervix than any other single thing.</p>
<p>It's also the only thing we can actually influence, hence the obsession of people trying to get pregnant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cervical mucous does help sperm find the opening to the cervix though. Around the time of ovulation most women get cervical mucous that is the consistency of egg whites. This wet, stretchy mucous helps to create slippery ‘pathways’ towards the cervix and also protects sperm from the pH levels in the vagina.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have heard stories of women going to their gynecologist repeatedly to check for an infection, and not even the doctor tells them that midcycle goo is <em>completely normal.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s why deep penetration is recommended when trying to convince. If sperm is deposited directly onto the cervix, then they have a better change of getting through. Nobody in this situation is jizzing on the opening of the vagina hoping they swim through.</p>
