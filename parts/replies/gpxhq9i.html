Just before the dining hall opened he began blasting John Phillip Sousa music.<br />
As the people walked by they just couldn't help but walking in time with the music.  Some of them even looked over at us and said with the look on their faces &quot; yeah you guys are making us march, we can't help it, but it <strong>IS</strong> funny&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like that book but that sounds like BS. I think it has to do with pattern recognition and communication. Understanding a communicative pattern is hardwired. Engaging in that pattern is communication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The book was really good imo, but there were clearly parts of it that were hypothesis. As a side note, I remember reading somewhere that Levitin was a major narcissist, so it wouldn't surprise me for him to believe shit that he didn't have much base for.</p></div>		</li>
