			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the more amazing things about adult bodies is that there isnâ€™t much cell division for most tissues, except for some, like stomach lining, that are constantly being sloughed off and replaced by cell division.  Because cancer cell get loose, and start reproducing like crazy, most chemo and radiation attack cells when they are most vulnerable, during cell division. That unfortunately also kills cells in the tissues that normally do reproduce, like stomach lining. Which is why you get nauseous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the problems of radiation is that it slows down cellular processes. I don't know if this can slow down cancers, but one of the negative long-term side effects on cancer patients is that it can cause problems in normal cellular repair for bladder and intestinal linings leading to issues such as <a href="https://www.radiationcystitis.org" target="_blank">radiation cystitis</a>, which can be fatal. There are treatments, but it has to be caught early and managed well and may involve more appointments and hospital stays than the cancer itself.</p>
<p>And that's just <em>one</em> possible side effect I happen to know about. Thankfully, not one that's affected me personally.</p></div>		</li>
