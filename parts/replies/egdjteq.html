			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the protective factors? Also, I would think that a protective factor would prevent, not delay. For instance, trauma and marijuana use are correlated with development of schizophrenia, but only during the developmental stages when schizophrenia tends to develop. So, for instance, someone who's susceptible may develop schizophrenia if they use marijuana in their adolescents, but if they hold off using it til they're 25+, they won't develop it later. </p></div>		</li>
