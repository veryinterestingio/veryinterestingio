			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I see this image from time to time and it always gives me chills when I see it.  Every one of those things in that picture is another galaxy.  Just think of the stories and histories and strange things that have occurred in each one of those spots of light.  Incredible.  In my opinion that's one of the most meaningful and awe-inspiring pictures ever taken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the crazy thing is that since that first picture there have been more. Seeing ever more galaxies and increasing the estimates about how many there might be. The obvious conclusion is that this will go on for a bit and our current estimates are still too low. </p>
<p>It's unimaginable just how big the universe is and how much stuff is in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also unimaginable how empty the universe is.  In between those galaxies are infinite stretches of nothing but miniscule amounts of energy.  Even galaxies are mostly nothing between the stars.  Solar systems are mostly empty space (all of the planets in our solar system would fit between the Earth and the Moon).  Even matter is mostly just energy trying too hard in between (relatively) vast gulfs of emptiness between subatomic particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stumbled upon a video awhile ago that has always stuck <a href="https://youtu.be/3WtgmT5CYU8?t=425" target="_blank">with me.</a> It causes me to really stop and think about all the trillions upon trillions of unique, amazing encounters some aliens we will NEVER, EVER MEET are having in their slice of the universe, never knowing we exist. </p>
<p>How many sentient beings look up at the stars at night wondering if WE exist? What incredible histories have transpired on that planet? What are their equivalent to the Great Pyramids, Stonehenge, Rome? Did they ever make movies or books? Imagine the ARCHITECTURE! What will I never see? The FOMO is very, very real.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about this. With all the life that is likely out there, it seems very likely to me that some advanced life forms are both 10% more intelligent than humans and have been around an extra hundred thousand years. </p>
<p>Imagine humans right now with an additional 10% intelligence and an additional hundred thousand years from today. Year 102,020. Essentially everything will have been invented by then right?</p>
<p>You have to imagine that life forms out there have figured it all out already. If long distance travel is possible, they’ve conquered it. Either A) long distance travel isn’t possible so they stay around their galaxy because it takes too long to get out so it’s on us to make it out and populate our own. B) it’s possible, they’re here but just letting us evolve to a certain point before letting us join them (because they’d pretty much all be the same and variety is unique). Or C) were them and this life we each feel is just what we do in order to pass near infinite time we have to live, matrix stuff. When you did you wake up with all your loved ones who had passed and can plug yourself in for another new unique life. </p>
<p>...right? Any options I’m missing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is very unlikely that we or any creature will be able to travel to other Galaxies. The universe is expanding at a rate too fast for us to catch up.  </p>
<p>It is questionable whether or not we will even make it beyond our own solar system.  </p>
<p>It is nice to imagine the human race flourishing and spreading amongst the stars though and I do hope that we can learn to better understand one another and strive for that kind of galactic utopia.  </p>
<p>Heres a video that completely melts my mind depicting celestial bodies we have actually seen / measured. It is almost unfathomable to realize how small we are.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People have asked me before if I believe in aliens. If I say yes, I sound like I'm a nut job who believes the government covered up aliens landing in Roswell. I don't believe that. </p>
<p>I do, however, believe that we are not alone in the universe. Maybe we had the 1 in 50 billion chance that our planet was perfect for life...well with the unknown billions of galaxies and potentially trillions of planets out there, life had to have formed on more than a few planets. </p>
<p>It reminds me of the saying, &quot;If you're 1 in a million, that means there are 7,000 people just like you&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the camp of; it's illogical to think in the vastness and age of the universe there has never been nor ever will be life elsewhere in the universe, but in the vastness and age of the universe it is highly unlikely that any two life forms from other world's will ever encounter each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I firmly believe two things about &quot;aliens.&quot;</p>
<ol>
<li>Because of the sheer number of galaxies, stars per galaxy, and planets per star, as well as the purely chemical ultimate origins of &quot;life,&quot; it is nearly a 100% certainty that some form of &quot;life&quot; exists on some other planet, somewhere, right now. </li>
<li>Because of the sheer distance between galaxies, the difficulties and delays in communication over such great distances, the relatively tiny blip of time during which we earthlings have been able to generate any sort of electromagnetic signal that might be visible from another planet, the likelihood that &quot;life&quot; on other planets would look vastly different than life on ours, etc. -- We will never, ever make contact with alien life.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't like to sound like a nutjob either. I believe in aliens mostly due to probability, that area of &quot;nothing&quot; shows that there are a load of galaxies which are full of solar systems which are full of planets. There has to be one which isn't too hot or too cold for life to exist. It's much harder to believe that they are all too inhospitable for life.</p></div>		</li>
