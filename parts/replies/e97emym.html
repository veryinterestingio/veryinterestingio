<p>Dems have gotten lucky in terms of senate seat opening dates. If 2022 or 2020, didn't have majority Republican, Democrats could've been facing a Republican Supermajority. Entirely possible by 2022 we can see a complete flip, </p>
<p>Dem 54-54 to Republican 45-46 for 2022, possible. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit for clarification: had the Democrats not vastly underperformed in a friendly map with Republicans defending (and ultimately winning) roughly 12 swing state seats in 2016, this discussion would be completely different. </p>

<p>Also, the house has seats based on population, so big states will have more seats.  But the senate has two seats per state regardless of size.  Low population states tend to be republican due to being more rural, and so rural areas (and so republican areas) tend to have more republicans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's mostly this. Wyoming's ~600K citizens get 2 senators (lowest population state). California's ~40M citizens get 2 senators (highest population state). If a few thousand democrats moved from California to Wyoming, the balance of power in the senate would be shifted by a significant amount!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the House also got way out of wack after they capped it's size at 435. Wyoming's lone House Member represents 535,000 people. Each one of California's 55 represents 730,000.</p>
<p>So like the Senate the House over represents trees and rocks - just not as badly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way apportionment in the House works the most over represented and under represented states will both be small states. Large states will be the closest to average representation. This is because the most underrepresented state will be the ones just short of having enough people for 2 representatives.</p>
<p>You can see that in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pop_per_rep.png" target="_blank">this image</a>. The largest population per representatives is Montana, with 1,050,493 and 1 representative. And in general you can see that the low population states have more variable representation (both high and low), while the high population states have very close to average representation.</p>
<p>Furthermore increasing the number of representatives does not significantly help to fix this problem unless you <em>drastically</em> increase it. The maximum disparity is determined by the number of representatives that you give to the smallest state, so you'd have to increase the number of representatives enough that the smallest states have 4 or 5 representatives to ensure an overall even representation. And that would mean increasing the size of the House by 4 or 5 times.</p>
<p>Also, representation is actually more even overall now than it was 100 years ago.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it's not really a big problem and it would be highly impractical to fix.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Wyoming is actually one of the least gerrymandered and fairest states when it comes to elections.</p>
<p>Second edit: in case it wasn't obvious, I did mean gerrymandering for the *state* senate. There were some interesting shenanigans involving a prison a few years back, IIRC, but that was mostly funny, not malicious.</p></div>		</li>
