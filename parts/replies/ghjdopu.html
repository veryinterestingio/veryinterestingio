			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, synthesis sounds way too long to mass produce. </p>
<p>Although I suppose there's no way to find out because apparently no one has published this stuff. </p>
<p>I couldn't even find a patent for Pfizer or Moderna. </p>
<p>I was under the impression that the FDA would approve the vaccine <em>and</em> the manufacturing of it. But the hearings held a few weeks ago didn't mention process development, just the completed vaccine therapy. </p>
<p>And if you google about how mRNA vaccines are made all you get is basic articles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and it doesn't help that Moderna has - at least in the past - been rather secretive. Here's an op-ed published in Nature from 2016 talking mainly about Moderna [it was around the time where Theranos was shown to be a fraud]: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3488" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3488</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moderna's coming-out party was highly anticipated and breathlessly reported. But something was missing: Moderna's scientists have yet to publish a single paper describing its therapeutic platform. That makes it difficult for outsiders to get a read on the company. And the Boston-based firm isn't alone in deprioritizing journal publication. Other prominent biotechs like Theranos and Kadmon have also chosen stealth over disclosure of data. Is this the beginning of the end of publishing company research in peer-reviewed journals? And, if so, does it matter?</p>
<p>In biotech's early years, a company's publication record was a matter of pride. Corporate research groups competed with one another and with academics to engineer a protein or isolate a monoclonal antibody. A paper in Science, Nature or Cell was an intellectual currency that provided external validation of an enterprise's R&amp;D effort, something that could attract investors. Academic founders of flagship companies like Genentech, Biogen, Immunex, Isis/Ionis and Regeneron brought with them the culture and expectation that publication increases engagement with the wider research community, builds corporate reputation and assures scientific quality.</p>
<p>Many biotech companies still encourage this activity. In 2013, for instance, the vast majority of the top 50 large-cap biotech companies published at least ten papers. R&amp;D teams at Biogen, Gilead, Celgene, Isis/Ionis and Vertex each published over 80 papers; Amgen scientists authored nearly 1,000. Publication not only provides credibility for R&amp;D, but also serves to attract scientific talent. When companies are downsizing internal R&amp;D and seeking closer ties with academia, a record of active publishing from corporate research teams led by top-tier former academics helps provide kudos, leverage and security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But interviews with more than 20 current and former employees and associates suggest Bancel has hampered progress at Moderna because of his ego, his need to assert control and his impatience with the setbacks that are an inevitable part of science. Moderna is worth more than any other private biotech in the US, and former employees said they felt that Bancel prized the company’s ever-increasing valuation, now approaching $5 billion, over its science.</p>
<p>As he pursued a complex and risky strategy for drug development, Bancel built a culture of recrimination at Moderna, former employees said. Failed experiments have been met with reprimands and even on-the-spot firings. They recalled abusive emails, dressings down at company meetings, exceedingly long hours, and unexplained terminations.</p>
<p>The company has published no data supporting its vaunted technology, and it’s so secretive that some job candidates have to sign nondisclosure agreements before they come in to interview. Outside venture capitalists said Moderna has so many investors clamoring to get in that it can afford to turn away any who ask too many questions. Some small players have been given only a peek at Moderna’s data before committing millions to the company, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That being said, I'm still a believer in the technology &amp; work done by scientists at Moderna. It's just unfortunate that there seems to be a &quot;toxic&quot; attitude of secrecy, especially when secrecy runs counter to scientific progress - and to gaining people's trust.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've worked in some highly regulated fields before and the regulating bodies tend to take an interesting approach in some regulations. Often times, they don't necessarily care about all of the finer details of <em>how</em> something is produced, just as long as the final end product meets a ton of requirements. The idea is that the stringent final requirements necessitate high levels of supply chain and manufacturing control by the company doing the producing but also lets the expert companies figure out how to best do the manufacturing. Take aerospace for example. The FAA is <em>not</em> THE expert on how to design and manufacture a plane. Obviously they know a lot about it but the OEMs like Boeing and Airbus are the true experts. The FAA could never regulate 100% of the entire plane design and production system themselves. I'm speculating a bit here that its likely similar with the FDA and vaccine manufacturing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The FDA would never get in the “weeds” of manufacturing plant design. The mfgr just needs to prove (validation studies, corresponding design docs, etc) the plant meets requirements for safe production. Now, if you get in the penalty box where the FDA thinks you cannot correct (hello consent decree), you will be challenged at every design/implementation phase (source: worked for a company under a consent decree)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested, <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/patents" target="_blank">here is a page</a> showing at least Moderna's COVID-related patents. It seems likely that they are using enzymatic RNA synthesis with modified RNA polymerases, to incorporate modified nucleotides for increased mRNA half-life or other benefits</p></div>		</li>

<p>I used to check their job postings every week in 2019, never got a response. </p>
<p>Good to see they are thriving.</p></div>		</li>
