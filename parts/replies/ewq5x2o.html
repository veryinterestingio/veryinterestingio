<p>HK is a port city with its own culture due to the opium wars and being a British colony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However this hk culture is actually a british machination made after the 67 riot in order to distance their subject from their zhongguaren counterpart, so no more anti-colonial riot would take place. It uses the colonial power dynamics to paint the more “westernized” individuals in a better light than their peers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the extradition bill was passed along &quot;criminals&quot; in Hong Kong to be tried in Chinese courts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lol no, it was initially requested by taiwan in order to prosecute a hong kong dude who murdered his pregnant girlfriend in taiwan (therefore the trial have to be held in taiwan)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>their special status is one of the main reasons that their economy has been so good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, no. The main reason of hong kong’s economy prowess is the fact that they are the gateway and the liaison to the manufacturing capital of the world; shenzhen.</p>
<p>Their special free port status and the extremely low business tax does help, but with custom free zones popping up in shenzhen anyway, many businesses decided to just go directly and bypass hong kong (hence why shenzhen dwarves hong kong in almost every aspect these days)</p>
<p>In fact, the most surefire way to kill off hong kong’s economy is by cutting off their ties to china. Hong kong economy composed mostly of service and its own manufacturing capabilities are near non-existent. Without chinese manufacturing, the service industry would die off faster than anyone can say “i’m a better huaren than those zhongguaren”</p></div>		</li>
