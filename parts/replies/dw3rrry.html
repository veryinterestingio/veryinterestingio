<p>Furthermore you need an appropriate amount of processing power to compute that fast enough. If your computation slows down you lose the balance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably still lots of noise in the acceleration sensors. The vibrations of the motors themselves would cause some error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't remember the article but a lot of computers higher energy requirement is the percision involved. Ur brain senses things yeah but for the most part it kinda just assumes things as a big power saving technique. Think of any optical illusion, memory (yeah I would prolly do that vs remembering u specifically looking a door or putting ur keys on the rack), r/tifu. </p>
<p>I think there was a dog fighting &quot;ai&quot; that they built to run off approximations and the thing worked damn well and without the need for a super computer.</p>
<p>Still amazing what the brain can do but hilarious in how it can trick us</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add, from a programmer's perspective... that robots only will ever do what they're supposed to. The difference here is that humans are regularly making mistakes and as such correcting those mistakes. &quot;Perfect&quot; walking will look very different, because it is not realistic. </p>
<p>We start to see something that looks much more realistic when we see robots like this correct themselves after there's some external interruption to their otherwise perfect movement;</p>

<p>Well, they only do what they're <strong>told</strong> to do. That can frequently be different than what they're <strong>supposed</strong> to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an engineer, Bigdog is fascinating. As a human being, it creeps the shit out of me. Imagining walking down a dark empty street and hearing that horrible noise behind you. You turn around and see Bigdog walking towards you, faster and faster as it gains confidence about running on the sidewalk. Seeking vengeance for all the times human beings kicked it for fun.</p>
<p>(I'm pretty sure the problem is that each pair of &quot;knees&quot; bends one way. The noise doesn't help.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely not true. Neural networks are just as error prone as humans are if not more so. If you're talking about classical programming then sure, they will never make a mistake but they are also extremely limited in what they can do and cannot learn without being reprogrammed. </p>
<p>In the near future nearly all robotics will be running a neural network in some form or another and will thus by nature be prone to making mistakes. They may make a lot less mistakes than humans but still will not be perfect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory then, I imagine we could probably make robots that run pretty well on completely flat surfaces.</p>
<p>Probably just don't see that because for any situation where you want a robot to work on a flat space, wheels would just be a better choice.  And so there's no good application for robots that move on 2/4 legs but only work on completely flat / regular surfaces.</p></div>		</li>
