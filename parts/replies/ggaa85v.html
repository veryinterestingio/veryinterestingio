			<div class="markdown"><p>There could be a ton of small reasons one might cost more than the other, but ultimately the reason they're priced similarly is because they have similar products and the market demand is greater than the supply. Pfizer and moderna will both sell their entire production capacity for vaccines through all of 2021, and probably will still be demand for more. If moderna saves $5 a shot because it doesn't need cryo cases, they're just going to bank that $5.</p></div>		</li>
