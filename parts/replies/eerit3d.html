			<div class="markdown"><p>Erosion is a complex process, but generally, wind and rain don't erode rock much at all.  Water or wind that carries abrasive sand erodes rock significantly.  We think of erosion as a slow process because it takes thousand or millions of years, but more erosion happens in an hour when a flash flood scours rock with fast moving pebbles than a decade of sand gently flowing past.</p>
<p>Mountain ranges are mostly eroded by the action of frost expanding in crevices, and plant roots wedging crevices open.  Lichens chemically etch even the surface of rock to create microscopic beginnings of cracks.</p>
<p>tl;dr Water no erode.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You guys are thinking of weathering, which is the physical or chemicals breakdown of materials.</p>
<p>Erosion is the initial movement of those broken down materials.</p>
<p>Wedging is one weathering process, but water's biggest influence in weathering is through chemical interactions with earth materials. Physical weathering is small potatoes compared to its chemical counterpart.</p></div>		</li>
