			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe some oleds nowadays are again susceptible to this. My Asus laptop with a 4k oled got an update recently that warned me about not using it at full brightness for too long and recommended adding a screen saver. (I now have the old maze one from win 98 days lol)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you're just burning all of your OLED pixels equally. So they all become dimmer over time, not just the ones showing static image (the task bar).</p>
<p>I'd recommend turning the brightness down if possible. 80 % hurts the display much less than 100 %.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yea I already do that, even with most my stuff being on dark mode, this thing is too bright at max. It's at 80 in bright settings, near 0 in low light.<br />
I also just have the screen turn off after a set time, but I just thought it was neat to be recommended to set a screensaver.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think I've ever kept a single screen above 50. Granted I have a sensitivity to light, but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's one of the main issues for popularising OLEDs for desktop use, along with their price, even though they're really good in regards to color, contrast, response time and can save energy, especially when using darker colors or pure black.</p>
<p>I actually think one of the reasons why every website is suddenly adding dark mode after years of begging is the mobile users, since it saves energy. </p>
<p>But yeah I think the burn in issue is getting better with time. Also, can you really notice the difference with 4K on a laptop screen? Even with 17'' it seems like overkill but I haven't seen it IRL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean if you just switch from 1080p to 4k you might not notice a huge difference, but then going back to 1080p it does seem pixilated.<br />
It's really unnecessary for most things unless you're doing design work. Reddit + discord aren't gonna benefit from 4k</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LCD should <strong>not</strong> suffer burn in. As there's nothing to actually wear out.<br />
What can happen is the pixels getting &quot;stuck&quot;, and it can be fixed, though usually doesn't happen on good panels.  </p>
<p>This is done by exercising them by strobing primary colours on the screen, sometimes for several hours or longer, but it will return an LCD display to normal.</p>
<p>ELI5: A LCD pixel is like a little window, when the window is left in one place for too long it can get stiff and hard to move. By wiggling it back and forth quickly for a while it can loosen the window back up so it moves freely again.  </p>
<p>Actual &quot;Burn in&quot; is from the phosphor on a CRT decaying from use, it physically cannot glow as brightly anymore.  </p>
<p>With LED displays (when the pixel is actually an LED, like OLED) the LED ages, losing brightness as it does, so for the same brightness setting the pixel now produces less light, causing a difference to be visible.  </p>
<p>Many smart phones use OLED displays now rather than lcd due to the fantastic contrast and energy efficiency. So they suffer the same as TVs.</p></div>		</li>
