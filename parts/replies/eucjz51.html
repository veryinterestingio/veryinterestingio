<p>Probably not. Small businesses outnumber larger ones massively, and most small businesses don't have the resources or expertise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are talking about scale.</p>
<p>Google, for example, has software engineers in the tens of thousands, even more if you include contractors and partnership projects.</p>
<p>How many small businesses will it take to match how many operators google has? What about google + Amazon?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not entirely. In short, NIPRNet has it's own dedicated lines and is connected to the public internet through DISA, all traffic is encrypted before traveling to the public domain. SIPRNet either has dedicated lines (airgapped), or is encrypted and then tunneled over NIPR. JWICS (next level above SIPR) can again have it's own dedicated lines (airgapped), or encrypted and tunneled over SIPR.  </p>
<p>So in practice, US government networks are not airgapped by default, but the connection to the public internet can be severed by DISA, making it airgapped.  </p>
<p>EDIT: As for OP - Companies do use airgapped networks, the problem with them is if they are airgapped you severely limit availability, part of the CIA triad (a model used to design information security policies). While you do increases confidentiality (keeping information secret) and integrity (making sure you data hasn't been changed by unauthorized people), limiting availability may mean your employees have difficulty doing their job. Truly airgapped systems are the most secure, but also the most difficult to work on, especially for a geographically diverse company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice clarification. I was 2E2 and then 3D1 in the Air Force, setting up the encrypted connections that allowed SIPR to go over commercial/civilian connections was half my job. </p>
<p>We do have small air-gapped networks that require us to do the 'ol 'lock it up in a brief case and carry it' to get information between sites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SIPR, JWICS, and other classified networks usually just get encrypted and go over a regular business connection with a commercial ISP. </p>
<p>I have to deal with our commercial provider all the time because any outage they take affects all of our networks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At some point they have to go over commercial lines, those points are access points that sit between the DODIN and the commercial internet......they, to my understanding of the DODIN, don't go over the standard commercial ISP of the local area (or rather they might run over the same physical lines, but are only used for transportation through the area).  </p>
<p>I've definitely seen local providers down and the DODIN still operating normally though.</p></div>		</li>
