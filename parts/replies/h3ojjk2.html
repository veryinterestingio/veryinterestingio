			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify slightly, normal situations are 'positive energy' because stuff has a lot of positive energy, so you can assume that more stuff going into the black hole adds energy.</p>
<p>In Quantum Mechanics (which was outside the scope of the original theorem), potential differences (read: a place where a force will be applied to something there) can create field disturbances (think: like a particle but not quite) with negative energy. This energy will be very, very small unless the potential difference over a short distance is large (that is, the force would be very very high for anything affected).</p>
<p>This negative energy means that when these field disturbances are added to the hole, the hole is smaller.</p>
<p>Black holes have sufficient potential difference for this effect to be significant if regular matter (including light) isn't falling in to swamp the effect. The smaller the hole, the more significant it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I was trying to think of all of this and put some thoughts together in my mind and I feel like I thought of something possible but I don't know if I'm understanding what you said correctly.</p>
<p>Given what you said about positive/negative energy, and how a strong force is required to create the negative energy condition, does this mean that black holes merge not through one simply absorbing the other's mass, but one creating enough force to cause the smaller to experience negative energy, and then radiate the energy out from that smaller black hole into the larger one, until the smaller evaporates and the radiated energy turns to mass inside the larger? Or do we not exactly know how the mechanics of black home merging works, and right now it's just sort of a &quot;bloop they're together.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That scenario is an amusing thought, but no, the mechanisms of merger and evaporation are both reasonably well-understood (in theory, subject to experimental validation) and totally distinct.</p>
<p>For large black holes (including all of those that form from stellar collapse), the evaporation rate is utterly insignificant unless you have it sealed off from the rest of the universe to a perhaps-physically-unattainable extent (you can't block neutrinos or your seal's thermal radiation).</p></div>		</li>

<p>What we think of as “empty” space cannot be completely empty because that would mean that all the fields, such as the gravitational and electromagnetic fields, would have to be exactly zero. There must be a certain minimum amount of uncertainty, or quantum fluctuations, in the value of the field. One can think of these fluctuations as pairs of particles of light or gravity that appear together at some time, move<br />
apart, and then come together again and annihilate each other. Because energy cannot be created out of nothing, one of the partners in a particle/antiparticle pair will have positive energy, and the other partner negative energy.   </p>
<p>The one with negative energy is condemned to be a short-lived virtual particle because real particles always have positive energy in normal situations. It must therefore seek out its partner and annihilate with it. . It is therefore possible, if a black hole is present, for the virtual particle with negative energy to fall into the black hole and become a real particle or antiparticle. In this case it no longer has to annihilate with its partner. Its forsaken partner may fall into the black hole as well. Or, having positive energy, it might also escape from the vicinity of the black hole as a real particle or antiparticle. To an observer at a distance, it will appear to have been emitted from the black hole</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taken (and patchworked) from &quot;The brief history of time&quot; by Stephen Hawking </p>
<p>Basically Quantum fluctuations cause a particle antipartcle pair, one with negative and other with positive energy. When a virtual particle with negative energy falls into a blackhole, the other particle may escape from the vicinity of the blackhole as a real particle. To an observer,  this looks like radiation from the blackhole.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important detail in regards to that is that if the negative energy 'virtual' particle goes OUT rather than IN, it doesn't have anything to hit to give it the energy it needs to become a 'real' particle so the process doesn't happen. Thus, there is a preference for evaporation rather than spontaneously getting heavier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically the area theorem states that the black hole can never lose its mass (and thus, event horizon area, as they are directly linked) when it engulfs matter, otherwise it will &quot;evaporate&quot;? Isn't the first self-evident?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It <em>creates</em> mass? And then consumes half of it by losing more energy than the equivalent of the eaten mass, practically losing mass by eating it? I can't make sense of any part of this...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>the blackhole is creating mass and consuming half of that mass, but in doing so it looses energy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not correct. No energy (and hence no mass) is created; thermodynamics isn't going to be bested that easily. The pair of virtual particles have equal and opposite energy, meaning they cancel each other out.  The positive energy particle escapes the event horizon and is radiated out, while the negative energy particle falls into the black hole. The negative energy particle lowers the total energy within the black hole and consequently the mass. The black holes doesn't &quot;[consume] half of that mass&quot; but rather loses mass equivalent to the Hawking radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, to make sure I understand...</p>
<p>The area theorem is a consequence of the fact that once mass-energy falls across the event horizon it can never escape. Since the radius of (and hence the area) of the event horizon is defined by the mass-energy of the stuff on the inside, and since nothing that crosses into the interior can ever escape, the area of the event horizon can never shrink. This generally holds because things that fall into a hole like light and stars have positive mass-energy. Mass-energy in the interior goes up because stuff falls in; the event horizon's radius gets larger.</p>
<p>Hawking radiation, however, arises from quantum fluctuations near the event horizon. These fluctuations, in turn, are made large enough to produce pairs of particles by the immense gravitation of the hole itself. The particles are produced and start moving away from each other in opposite directions. Most of the time, they both fall in. Sometimes, however, one of the particles falls more or less straight into the hole while the other one escapes to infinity. Conservation of mass-energy demands that someone pays the piper for that virtual particle that became real and got away, so it's got negative energy in a sense; there is an energy debt associated that must be paid to maintain conservation of mass-energy. Since the black hole itself created the conditions to create the particle pair, that negative energy is added to the positive net mass-energy inside the hole. The mass-energy inside the hole goes down because a particle escaped to infinity; the event horizon's radius gets smaller.</p>
<p>Mass and energy conservation is maintained, yet no information, mass, or energy crosses out of the event horizon. The hole just shrinks a tiny bit to compensate for the escape of the particle. Similarly to entropy, the area of the horizon GENERALLY always increases, but can decrease if the conditions are correct.</p>
<p>My spidey sense tells me that this is all somehow connected to the link between a black hole's entropy and the area of its horizon.</p></div>		</li>
