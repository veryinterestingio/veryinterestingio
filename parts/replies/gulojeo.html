			<div class="markdown"><p>I had that with a colleague. He was wearing a pair of shoes he hadn't worn for years. He's a waiter. So as the shift went on there were all these black bits all over the place until he realized it came from his shoes.</p>
<p>By the time the shift was over his soles had disintegrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>poor colleague, it happens to the best of us.</p>
<p>This always occur with shoes left unworn for extended period of time. The shoes would look perfectly fine and crumbles sneakily when one starts walking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a similar incident that i had one time. I was on my way to go hiking in a different country. As hinking boot are bulky and heavy, I was walking in them. </p>
<p>Just as i got off the bus to the airport, and started jogging to the terminal, the entire sole broke off in one catastrophic event! The sole went shooting across the bus station floor, in front of everyone. I was mortified.  Then I walked through the airport with the sole in one hard, looking for glue. </p>
<p>In hind sight, this was hilarious, I must have looked crazy!</p>
<p>Throughout their life the boots had beem well used and were about 10 years old. They had sat in a closet for 18 months and not been.</p></div>		</li>
