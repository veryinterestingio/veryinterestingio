			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t a hard problem to solve technically.</p>
<p>You have a list of eligible voters (List A)</p>
<p>You have a list of candidates and each has a vote count. (List B)</p>
<p>You make sure nothing associates the two lists.</p>
<p>When someone votes you remove the voter from List A (they are no longer eligible to vote) and increment the counters for the candidates they voted for in List B.</p>
<p>At the end of the election you purge List A, so now no one knows who didn’t vote.</p>
<p>You make sure that any logs you have on the server do not accidentally link entries in List A or List B.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>When a voter submits their voter card to the ballot drop box, how do they know that it was correctly counted by whoever decides to tabulate the votes? How do they know it was then properly reported to their Secretary of State?</p>
<p>At some point you have to trust some system, whether it be individuals or software.</p>
<p>If you really wanted someone to be able to verify it somehow you could generate a hash. This actually would do a good job of helping people to be sure their votes were recorded accurately, at the risk of someone being able to reverse the hash and determine who voted for what.</p>

<p>⁠After you do the final purge of List A, how do you know that the total number of votes in List B is not too high or too low?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same way you do today. You can’t know if it’s too low because you don’t know how many people decided to vote. As for it being too high, some external system can know the total number of eligible voters, and you can determine if it’s too high.</p></div>		</li>
