			<div class="markdown"><p>One time I killed a fly by smacking into a screen door. After capturing the dead fly in a container for disposal, I saw something interesting on the screen.</p>
<p>There were these little white things... eggs. Then I saw these itty bitty white wormy things wiggling their way out of a couple of eggs. So I had a few maggots squirming on my screen door.</p>
<p>Then I looked back in the dead fly in the glass container and saw some maggots squirming their way out of the ass-end of the fly.</p>
<p>I proceeded to use a pressured water sprayer to knock all of the yuck off of my screen. I also immersed the dead fly in ammonia before flushing it all down the drain.</p>
<p>Also, when before I rinsed the screen door I sniffed the screen and it smelled awful. Like rot.. or something.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correlates with my experiences. Whenever there's been a fly stuck in my room, it seems to begin pissing me off at the same time every morning, a clear indication to me that it sleeps and then wakes up at nearly the same time every day.</p></div>		</li>
