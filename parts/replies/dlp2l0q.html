When we move back to the States, we are getting one. With warm water and moving parts. It is amazing and is so much better at cleaning than toilet paper!</p></div>		</li>

Can you explain the process of using a bidet? Is it like rinsing off &quot;debris&quot; with a garden hose? Doesn't all the debris scatter everywhere? Are you wiping before and after? I have no concept of the logistics of a bidet but most times I will soak a wad of TP to use along with the regular wiping technique so I'm intrigued by this toilet tech. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was giving a friend of mine a hard time because where he was born (and visits frequently) bidets are the norm. He asked me &quot;when you come back from the gym, do you just wipe yourself down with toilet paper? No? Would you feel clean if you did?&quot;  Cleaning with toilet paper always seems unsanitary now. Totally want a bidet in my next home. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a job that occasionally has me going into some really nice homes here in Los Angeles. A lot of them have had extremely hitech toilets that then wash and dry your ass for you, all while playing your favorite tunes lol. Seems we are skipping bidets and going straight for robots that worship our bottoms.</p>
<p>On a side note, loved having a bidet in Barcelona. Made it possible to survive a long hot summer with only two daily showers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm one of those in the minority that don't seem to like them that much. My father-in-law has a hi-tech Toto toilet that has a bidet and drier and the bidet ALWAYS leaves poop on me. I end up wiping anyway and that's with changing the length it comes out and moving around to try and get it all. It just isn't powerful enough, even on the highest setting. Also, the drier is almost useless as it takes forever.</p>
<p>BUT, I don't use strictly toilet paper. I use <em>moist wipes</em> and they are by far the quickest and cleanest. Dab dry with toilet paper and you're done in 10 sec. The only thing I don't like is that you shouldn't use them on a septic system (which he is, hence the bidet toilet) and they aren't great for sewer systems either no matter how much they'll tell you they break down quickly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is no joke. Google &quot;fatberg&quot;. </p>
<p>They're called &quot;flushable&quot; because they'll go down the toilet. They just wont go much further, and they don't dissolve like TP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can buy a bidet &quot;seat&quot; now to attach to a regular toilet. Got ours at Home Depot, and can't stand not being able to use one when not at home. They're about $800 (Canadian), water temp settings, dryer with heat settings, sanitizer, deodorizer, it's awesome.</p></div>		</li>
