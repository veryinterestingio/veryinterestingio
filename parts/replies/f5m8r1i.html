			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhhhh I would be curious to know what the answer to this is too. I mean at some point all the continents were one, so at some point we all came from the same place. It really blows my mind. Anyways, I'd imagine there has to be some kind of baseline to where it begins.</p>
<p>Another follow up question: Do we think in hundreds of years, America will be a specific origin, even though we know they can't be fully &quot;American.&quot; </p>
<p>Are we fully, actually, any specific ethnicity? Someone help. My brain might be imploding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought of it kind of like a less specified version of evolution by natural selection. Basically, we all started out in the same place, but then over the course of an extremely large period of time, our ancestors lived in different places across the globe. The ancestors adapted to these places, producing different skin color, eye color, facial features, etc... The longer your ancestors were there, the more it affected your genes. </p>
<p>Then fast forward to today and we've drawn political lines and say &quot;I'm Nigerian&quot; or &quot;I'm Italian&quot; or whatever, and people identify with that. In general, especially in the past, some of these features match up to the stereotypical person in that country. In reality, though, even if you are ethnically Italian as far back as you know, for example, you probably have other genes from the middle east, the Balkans, and/or other places. And then, of course, southern Italy has a different history and, traditionally/generally, an ethnically different people than northern Italy (just as almost all countries have these differences). I think about ethnicity as a &quot;region&quot; thing more than a &quot;country&quot; thing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If we had tens or hundreds of thousands of years and people from America were somewhat isolated then yes, I believe a specific ethnicity would develop. However, it might not show up the same way because we will be living in little artificial cubes by then and not exposed to nature as much lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!! This put in to words what I was trying to rationalize in my head. Thank you! haha </p>
<p>Such a valid point. Crazy to think how much the world will continue to change throughout time as we know it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually we all go back to Africa, but the path we used to get here gets muddy in the middle. They can make some guesses though based on historical data that &quot;people from this region mostly came from that region&quot;. However, after a certain amount of time, simply saying you are &quot;German&quot; means you share many common ancestors with all people who are German. At that point you can say &quot;the German people of the year 1500 came from this region of...&quot; and keep extrapolating back.</p>
<p>Basically, after about 500 years, you are going to have so many ancestors that you will cover most of a cultural region and at that point can follow the general history of that region to go further back.</p>
<p>As for American identity, probably not. But that's true for most modern society where people move so freely. Historical lineage only works because of how little people traveled in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually not so much. Go back 200 years and people didn't travel far (most people anyway). Go back 500 years and most people didn't even travel outside their own village area. So, going back it gets easier and easier. </p>
<p>Germany would be quite distinctive due to the 30 year war which ravaged the country, even though most parts weren't even involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't give you the best answer but basically the test that these ancestry sites do only goes back to about 1600. There is another test that goes back further but is more expensive.</p></div>		</li>
