			<div class="markdown"><p>Begs the question... why do hugs calm us?  </p>
<p>Or do they...  a hug from a stranger isnt very calming...  </p>
<p>So is it the pressure, or is it the awareness of a friend?</p>
<p>If its the latter, can a blanket simulate that?  And if so, why can't a stranger?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People literally pay now to be hugged by strangers. So the hug or cuddle from a stranger can be very calming. I would suspect, like most human physiological reactions, there are multiple inputs. A hug from a stranger might not always be relaxing due to other inputs outweighing it. </p>
<p>If I had to guess, just like how exercise is a physiological 'off switch' for anxiety because it simulates the physical exertion that typically preceded escaping from a predator (And thus our bodies could calm down)...Being held or put under pressure might have been a signal response when allies or family group were close and shielding you from danger. If a predator attacked or if there was some threat, you would naturally have to be held or shielded to remove you from it (Especially when young). We might have associated a prolonged sense of that feeling with being safe (Because our group was around us, and clearly looking to protect us).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Where are you getting this? In traumatic situations, strangers will often hug to relieve stress. Car accidents, violent encounters, natural disasters, etc. Victims of a shared trauma may hug each other, or a stranger who turns up to help may hug someone who is hysterical or in shock. I don't really understand how you came to your conclusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that being uncomfortable with strangers is simply an innate response.</p>
<p>Babies are comforted by hugs and by swaddling, but generally react negatively to strangers (as do most instinctual animals).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man Iâ€™d find it hard to believe it was all in my head. I was at a friends xmas last year and she had gotten one as her gift and was passing it around for people to check out. I had no experience with them. I was just sitting on the couch and they draped it over me. It was much more than the sum of its weight, it felt like someone shot me with a tranquilizer dart. I was nearly paralyzed, not because I couldnâ€™t physically handle the weight but it was like a switch actually got flipped. I think I literally started slurring words it was friggin nuts and I totally get the appeal.</p></div>		</li>
