			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the reason you're supposed to get yearly flu shots isn't because the antibodies have expired; it's because there are different strains of flu that dominate from year to year. Each shot is tailored for a handful of strains that are expected to be most common in the coming year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, because influenza is always unique and never the rule, antibodies from influenza vaccination do wane very rapidly and don’t seem to provide much protection from one season to the next. (Immunity from influenza infection does seem to last much longer.) See for example  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7182205/" target="_blank">Intraseason Waning of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness</a>.  </p>
<p>Once again, influenza is unique, and you should never see something that influenza does and assume other viruses do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is there talk about a covid vaccine boost in that case? I can understand we need an annual shot for influenza since it's unique. But do we need a covid booster to take new variants into account or because the antibodies are supposedly gone after some time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder then if getting the influenza vaccine in the years after getting the wild-type flu would inhibit catching flu (presumably mildly and/or asymptomatically after recent infection) and developing wild-type antibodies in subsequent years.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I caught the flu mildly as a child 1-2 times total 20-25 years ago and have not had it (to my knowledge or symptomatically) or the flu vaccine since then. I worked in a museum for almost a decade with a high volume of children visiting daily (though I did not generally interact directly with them, just occasionally pass through crowded public spaces) and never had the flu or vaccine, though they had on-site clinics and encouraged it (for public staff mainly, not me).</p>
<p>So, would getting a flu vaccine prevent my body from mounting a defense to the current wild-type flu vaccine as well? If I already have lingering natural immunity from last year, and I keep getting exposed to and successfully mounting an immune response to new wild flu strains every season, would that result in a perpetual natural immunity that is (at least somewhat) superior to the vaccine (of course barring major new disease mutations)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of confusion because of headlines like &quot;Studies show that vaccine is good for six months&quot; to imply that it is ONLY good for six months. That's not what they are saying. What they are saying is that they took a sample of people who were vaccinated over six months ago and either by testing their antibody levels or looking at their breakthrough infection rates have deduced that the vast majority of people are still protected after six months. They can't product the same results for 3 years because the vaccine hasn't been around long enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a blessing and a bummer.<br />
I'm pretty sure the antibodies caused my tinnitus and since my antibodies after COVID and tinnitus decreased at the same time, AND the tinnitus was back after the vaccine, I was hoping it will be over in 6 months or so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Side note, antibodies don’t really have an “expiration date” and if they did it certainly wouldn’t be a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While generally true, those in the &quot;continuous risk&quot; category for rabies exposure (i.e., lab techs that are examining neuro matter for signs of rabies) get sero tested every 6 months, with booster shots given as needed based on those titers.</p>
<p>This is an extreme example, due to the lethality of rabies, but it's an interesting example of viral prophylaxis.</p></div>		</li>
