<p>awesome. I have several.</p>

<p>so based on your definitions, you have a doctorate degree and you do therapy? And the fact that you provide therapy as opposed to focusing on research is what makes you a clinical psychologist?</p>
<p>Someone else in the thread mentioned that there are different types of therapy treatments. The examples they gave were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cognitive behavioral therapy Family therapy Exposure therapy Group therapy (And the list goes on)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do you find out what kind of therapy you're looking for? How do you figure out what you need?</p>
<p>Finally, how do you know if you've found a bad therapist/etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I have a doctorate in clinical psychology with a focus in marriage and family therapy. My school gave everyone a focus in psychodynamic therapy (a modern blend of psychoanalytic concepts) and family systems therapy. As part of my doctorate I completed a dissertation (a research paper) so I am familiar with research practices, but it is not my focus. One can, however, be a clinical psychologist and focus more on research. There are two different types of psycjology doctorates: Doctor of psychology (PsyD) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). The former is generally more “applied” and the latter tends to have more research involved. </p>
<p>In terms of finding the right treatment for you, something to consider is the Dodo effect <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict</a></p>
<p>Essentially, the type of therapy (within reason) is less important than the therapeutic alliance, the bond you feel with the therapist. Sometimes it is best to see a couple therapists to try and get a feel for them in the room. Of course, some treatments do have significant evidence for specific populations, DBT for borderline personality, for example. But most therapists at the doctoral level integrate multiple conceptual models and approaches when working with their clients. </p>
<p>Finding a bad therapist is an unfortunate reality, just like it is in any professional sphere. Two things to pay attention to are how the therapist values the relationship and maintains it with you, and how they approach boundaries and the frame of therapy. If they can do those two things, they are likely to at least do no harm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Therapy is like dating, pick someone who you have a good feeling about, and give them 2-3 sessions. At the end of session 3 if you don't feel understood, feel directionless, etc. than you move on and try someone else. You don't necessarily need to know what kind of therapy you're looking for - it's their job to say, are your issues behavior based, thought based, etc.</p>
<p>Once you've been to therapy and have some insight into what causes your problems you'll learn what forms of treatment are appropriate for you, which can help if you need to see a new therapist.</p>
<p>As for bad therapy... I had a friend with very debilitating social anxiety. She saw a virtual therapist who had her draw pictures. For months. Needless to say, her anxiety did not improve at all. A basic &quot;round&quot; of therapy would average about 12 weeks and you should feel like you have made significant progress with what is affecting your life at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To your first point, it's also considered best practice for therapists to check in about how their therapeutic approach is working out for their clients; and, if it's not a good fit, it's also best practice to refer the individual to other services that may better suit them, whether it's a different modality, different theoretical orientation, or a higher/lower level of treatment.  (Per the ethical standards in my state, it's usually at least three internal/external referrals if terminating with a client due to poor fit.)  Therapists ultimately want what's most effective for their clients, and won't take offense if you tell them it's not accomplishing what you're hoping to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I connect people with therapists all the time, and what’s needed (or will work best) can vary significantly on the individual. What I would recommend if possible... if you know someone that’s been to therapy, ask them about their experience and how they benefited from it. I’ve found that when individuals pick a therapist randomly it can lead to some false starts, and possibly skew their perception of it. You can also setup 20 minute phone consultations with most therapists to get feel for how they interact. </p>
<p>As far as knowing if it’s a good therapist, a good therapist will build enough of a connection that you will feel they understand you and your issues. </p>
<p>I would also stress that the process of healing and change is not easy or simple regardless who’s is helping. Both finding a therapist and/or just participating in therapy can be difficult, the important thing is that people keep trying and putting effort into healing.</p>

<p>Psychology Today is also a good resource, you can identify specific specialties that need focus (Trauma, Depression, Relationship Issues, etc), and find local therapist that specialize in those issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second using:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com" target="_blank">https://www.psychologytoday.com</a>.</h3>
<p>It's a great search tool, has filter and sort options (including insurance accepted), and the therapists can include a picture and statement that gives some insight into what they're like. After several awful and unethical therapists over 20+ years, I used that tool and found the most amazing therapist</p></div>		</li>
