You can see that in the map I linked, the colors of different ages are in nice parallel bands. The plates do sometimes switch directions over hundreds of millions of years, but usually only after a large continental collision prevents further motion in that direction.</p>
<p>Airport metaphor: the conveyor belts keep going in the same direction until the luggage gets jammed up and stalls the machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They subduct under continental plates due to differences in density. Conservation of mass plays a role in that the Earth's surface isn't getting any smaller, so a conveyor belt is much closer to reality than your second hypothesis, but still oversimplified to the point of being... not right.</p></div>		</li>
