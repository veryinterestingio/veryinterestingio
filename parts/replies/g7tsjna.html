			<div class="markdown"><p>That would make more sense as a reply to a comment about the fact that Linux does not compel you to update.</p>
<p>The fact that Linux doesn't require a reboot is an actual technical difference between Windows and Linux.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and (like many before me wrote) this is a big problem if you want to target the average consumer.</p>
<p>I had a friend who once was really proud of installing his parents ubuntu &quot;because it's more secure&quot;. When I saw that machine once a year ago, it was running Ubuntu 12 with the last update installed on the day of the installation (when Ubuntu 12 was fresh).</p>
<p>No browser updates, no security patches, no anything...
In a world where Linux viruses are a thing, this is dangerous.</p>
<p>Also the people knowing their stuff are not dangerous, the ones not knowing it aren't either. The problem is the big group who think they know better than the computer and just ignore updates if they can.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always pick update and shutdown at the end of the day. You can also schedule the updates to happen at lunch time or something when you wont be using the computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does, it just doesn't do it.</p>
<p>With Linux, you can replace a program or library file while its in use, without affecting already started applications. The already started programs will simply continue to use the old version, which remains preserved as long as the file handles are open.</p>
<p>That means both a less stable system (if something updated talks to something not updated and gets confused) and a lot of long-running processes still running vulnerable libraries. Servers get restarted automatically if the server package is updated, but AFAIK not if the dependencies get updated, and I don't think standard consumer-grade distributions offer reboot-less kernel patches by default (even Ubuntu Livepatch needs some form of setup).</p></div>		</li>
