			<div class="markdown"><p>So I should really think of the BS as like a pipe system with only 4 directions and the phase of the light determines which direction it goes.
Such that if the phase is correct all light goes to the detector?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Four arms is a good way to think of it. There are two paths along these four arms from the emitter to the detector.</p>
<p>The phase doesn’t determine whether it goes through or reflects. Rather, it’s calibrated so that they can determine the difference in “lengths” of the two paths based on the difference in phase of of the light at the detector, because they know they are precisely in phase at the beginning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the intensity is always halved when going through the beam splitter so the laser and detector both receive 50% each of the light.</p>
<p>Then by determining the phase difference by looking at the detector we can determine the path difference and other sorts of effects.</p>
<p>My problem is I've never actually used an interferometer and im going to be studying physics, what are we looking for at the detector or rather what is the detector.</p>
<p>For example I understand in Young's double slit experiment we can see bright and dark fringes and thus have something physical to measure but what is there in the Michelson interferometer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's a fine understanding for the ideal beamsplitter. The phase of the light will determine which path has constructive vs. destructive interference. </p>
<p>The tricky thing is that you have to keep track of both inputs and both outputs - they can 'go negative' and cancel each other out. So you can't say 'each one splits in half', only considering the intensity, but also the sign/complex phase.</p></div>		</li>
