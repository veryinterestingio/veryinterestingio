			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of sound that matters is the speed of sound in whatever medium the wave is traveling through. In a hydraulic flow, the speed of sound in water is what is relevant. It should also be noted that the speed of sound in a given medium is dependent on temperature and density.</p></div>		</li>
