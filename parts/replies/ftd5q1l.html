			<div class="markdown"><p>excellent question.  I have found that most students (especially those who are taking it bc it's required) have very very low expectations (due to fear or bad rep that the class gets) so the silver lining to this is that you have no where to go but up!!</p>
<p>I have found that spending the first two weeks going through really interesting/provovative examples of real-life scenarios i.e. Alf Landon vs FDR election sampling issue or the conviction of Sally Clark works very well. I pick a few health headlines where the stats have been seriously misused and then ask them to bring some in.</p>
<p>Yes, those two weeks take away from maybe being able to get into multiple regression or something else at the end of the semester- but I have found it worth it to get them engaged and excited.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who hadn't even thought of majoring in Statistics until I took my first undergrad course in it (Harvard's Stat 110, Introduction to Probability with Joe Blitzstein), I think a student's first experience with Statistics can have a very real impact on how scary it seems.</p>
<p>Part of what makes Stat 110 so fun (you can view the lectures <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo" target="_blank">here</a>) is that Joe couches everything in terms of real-world examples that make the information seem immediately applicable. He teaches each of the distributions in terms of &quot;stories&quot;: the exponential distribution is taught in terms of waiting times for a bus; the Poisson distribution is taught in terms of the number of chocolate chips on a chocolate chip cookie. They immediately feel relatable and applicable.</p>
<p>Another great course to gain inspiration from that's a bit more on the &quot;Data Science&quot; side but also approachable and fun is <a href="https://cs109.github.io/2015/" target="_blank"><a href="https://cs109.github.io/2015/" target="_blank">https://cs109.github.io/2015/</a></a>.  </p>
<p>Personally, I still find that the most mind-bending parts around Statistics are around randomness -- what does it <em>mean</em> for an event to be random and how can we get used to switching from the mathematical world of determinism to the statistical world of randomness? I write a bit more about that <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-graduate-students-perspective-on-statistics-5cb6ca643689?source=---------2------------------" target="_blank">here</a>, and perhaps untangling this confusion might be helpful for new students.</p>
<p>Finally, I think Statistics can come easier to some students than others. I think that having plenty of office hours and opportunities for students to seek help, especially at the beginning, can be really important -- and structuring them in a way that the students who need the most help will come to them is perhaps even more important :)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Students like to see how what they are learning makes a difference.  For those interested in college basketball, we launched bracketodds ( <a href="http://bracketodds.cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank"><a href="http://bracketodds.cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">http://bracketodds.cs.illinois.edu/</a></a> ) to gently ease students from 7-12 and beyond to see statistics in action.  We now get around 150,000 hits per year, with many schools using our site to bring data and statistics alive.  SHJ</p></div>		</li>
