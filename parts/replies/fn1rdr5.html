			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the only thing about milling iridium with a ceramic tool is that ceramic tools are usually roughing tools, and parts are still finished with carbide much more slowly. However, iridium is a lot more expensive than inconel so I don't think a lot of designs are taking a lot of big roughing cuts. Iridium is also not exactly a structural material and used more for its chemical properties, so large complex shapes are not usually done.</p></div>		</li>
