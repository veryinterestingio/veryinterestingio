<p>Hell, after I &quot;woke-up&quot; from my coma, I could not think well for a long, long time.</p>

<p>What exactly do you  mean by this? Was it just hard to concentrate? For example, if I asked you &quot;what's 5x5+2&quot; would it just take a while to think about the answer? or was the voice in your head gone or something?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Everything is quiet and calm.</p>
<p>I accidentally gave myself a wicked coma almost 5 months ago.... I still have a 24hr memory span.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(5x)5+2 = 0</p>
<p>25x+2 = 0</p>
<p>25x = -2</p>
<p>x = -(2/25) or -0.08</p>
<p>Pretty easy but I am not sure why you'd give that one to someone recovering from a brain injury.</p></div>		</li>
