			<div class="markdown"><p>I always assumed that the reason &quot;spiciness adds up with temperature&quot; is a function of the Arrhenius equation (or some variation of it), the kinetic theory that an increase in temperature increases the rate of a reaction (capsaicin's interaction with your taste-buds, butt-hole, skins, eyes, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's both. The temp gives more reaction between capsaicin and its receptors, but those receptors are responsive to temperature itself. In fact that's their main function! The receptor that capsaicin reacts with is called TRPV1 if you want to look it up, and TRPV1 receptors' function is the detection and regulation of body temperature. The receptor is fired by temp above 43C, acids, capsaicin, and allyl isothiocyanate (horseradish and wasabi).</p>
<p>That's why spice feels hot, and why spice makes you sweat. When TRPV1 is activated, your brain gets the signal that your body temp is high. So the normal responses to overheating all start - dilated surface blood vessels, rapid sweating etc.</p></div>		</li>
