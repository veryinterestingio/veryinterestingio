			<div class="markdown"><p>I did programming back in the 90s, C++, visual basic, html, early Java script and even got some grants to pursue it in college. I was so burnt out from it, computers were no longer fun. I made the stupid\smart choice to no longer want that to be my job. Now I love building and playing on my PC, currently married to an awesome woman and have 2 kids. My job is menial, and Im sure with my smarts I could have had a much better career but at least Im happy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who's had a lot of jobs before landing on something that resembles a career, my advice to people is not to find something you love, just find something you can tolerate at a company you don't loathe with coworkers you sorta like. </p>
<p>A job is a job, its there for money, not fullfillment. Not every job has to be your passion, and not every passion should be monetized.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What makes the job suck out the passion? Is it the routine? The lack of absolute freedom in what you'd be working?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man that's tough. I don't actually know if people understand happiness beyond dopamine and novelty. You can make kids &quot;happy&quot; with infinite candy and cartoons but we'd all agree that's not real happiness or good for them. Same with adult addictions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps set smaller goals?   There have been plenty of new things I tried where I never reached my original goal.  However it was still fun seeing myself get better and reaching lesser milestones.</p>
<p>Also you can learn from failures what specific things you do better than others and can use that info to better pick new hobbies.</p></div>		</li>
