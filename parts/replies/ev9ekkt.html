<p>Each additional rotor gives you, essentially , control over one additional aspect of your multicopter's kinematic state. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the caveat that the rotor's effect is linearly independent of the effects of the preexisting rotors. Rotors vertically oriented can only give you control of four axes of the multicopter (cannot directly apply forward/backward or left/right acceleration), with the remaining control axes controlled indirectly. Hence why we describe multicopters as &quot;underactuated,&quot; even when it's an <a href="https://www.volocopter.com/en/product/" target="_blank">octodecacopter</a>. If, however, we added a pusher propeller, we can gain direct control of these axes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is quite correct! To achieve 6DOF with 6 rotors, some of the rotors must be mounted non-vertically, other wise you do not have a linearly independent set of torque-thrust vectors.</p></div>		</li>
