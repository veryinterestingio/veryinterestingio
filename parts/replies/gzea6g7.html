			<div class="markdown"><p>I once worked at a facility with chimps.  One in particular liked to subtly fling balls of shit at unsuspecting newcomers. At 60-70 feet away, he was surprisingly accurate, and the shit balls seem to come flying from nowhere.  </p>
<p>Iâ€™m fairly certain the NYYankees would have been quite pleased having him on the mound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was like the factory farming of the day but it doesn't fit with the idea of the noble savage living in balance with nature so people don't talk about it much. They were people and that means they did shitty stuff too just like the rest of us. I'm sure my ancestors did this and worse when push came to shove. The term in the American west for it was &quot;buffalo jump&quot; if you want to read more about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also communication and teamwork. We can coordinate with 10 of our buddies to encircle a group of prey at 500 feet and then slowly close in, so that by the time they spot us they have nowhere to run. We can spook and corral prey towards narrow spaces where our friends are lying in wait with spears for easy kills. When prey do have good stamina/endurance we can chase them in the direction of our camp and tag a friend in to take over the chase. When we track an animal we can communicate precisely about it to each other. We are much more communal than other predators and can use that in very sophisticated ways.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s terrifying from an animalâ€™s perspective. With virtually any other predator, you know they want to directly attack you so they can eat you, and you just need to escape. But when you see a lone human, there could be two dozen other humans secretly lurking in the area, all working together against you, having formed a strategy in advance and staked out your likely escape paths.</p></div>		</li>
