<p>Kevlar® without the ® is poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>eh.... <em>I think</em> unless there is a desire to specify which generation of Kevlar® someone is referring to, it's okay to assume that when someone refers to kevlar, they mean the most recent. That said, kevlar is a branded material that no company can claim to create (save for dupoint). So the hard ® seems necessary only in legal or widely public text publications. In which case, the generation/version would be clearly pointed out (because new and shiny). </p>
<p>This is just a personal preference I own, and I don't believe you are wrong. I just wanted to kill time and point out what I believe is a common thought.</p></div>		</li>
