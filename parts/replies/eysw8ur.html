			<div class="markdown"><p>I can personally vouch it's more than just luxury carmakers. I worked on aerodynamic testing for Ford and this was what we tested the most (wind noise in general, so including windows and also wind/noise leaking in from the engine)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess when a) production numbers are that high and b) competition is as fierce as in the car industry, the tiny details really start to matter. </p>
<p>Wind noise is bound to become even more important with electric cars as you can hear it a lot more at speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny that it's actually called &quot;helicoptering&quot; cause that's what I called it when I was a kid. I hated it and it seemed to bother me more than anyone else in my family cause I'd always have to ask them to fix it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cannot stand how my mom can just.. leave the turn signal on. Her van will even start beeping at her and she doesn't know why. And she uses the remote feature to roll all the windows down to let the hot air out, then forgets that she has to roll the back windows up too or the helicoptering starts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite a bit. Smooth flow and small frontal area are key factors in overall drag coefficient.
Longer cars are more drag efficient than shorter ones.</p></div>		</li>
