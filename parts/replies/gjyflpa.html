			<div class="markdown"><p>So this might be a stupid question but there is a youtube channel called the hydraulic press channel on youtube and they sometimes through paper under that thing and it seems to become pretty solid (toilet paper that is so compressed you can use it as an actual shotgun slug that does damage to the target). Would in that case there be some kind of bonding/pushing atoms into a different. I imagine that 300 tons off pressure in that small area could be enough to do something to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding pressure to a system adds energy to the system, and that <em>can</em> rearrange the bonds, but it doesn't necessarily do that. It depends on the exact circumstances.</p>
<p>What's likely happening in the video you're watching is that paper materials - toilet paper especially, since it's made to be soft and fluffy - has a lot of empty space/air in it. But it's made of wood, and if you think about wood, wood is pretty darn tough - we're talking the stuff that it takes multiple swings of an axe to break through.</p>
<p>When you put toilet paper under that much pressure, you eliminate all the air in it, and it condenses down into a much tighter and tougher arrangement of the fibers. There's not likely any chemical change, it just begins to resemble what you're use to - wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer.  Physical and chemical change are different, and pressure almost always elicits physical change as opposed to chemical if there's any outcome at all.  Even when pressure makes carbon residue into diamonds, that's really just a structural rearrangement, even though it's occurring at the atomic level.  Well put.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good addition, and very true.  Honestly depending on the type of paper (that fancy bumpy recycled kind for example, you might just be breaking adhesion between two globs of wood pulp or two crenated plant cells, not even molecules.  I think a lot of people missed this part of the issue and dove further into the fray than was probably necessary.  The fundamental reason OP's question isn't how stuff works is very much because of what you're saying.  It's not ATOMS, it's MOLECULES AND CELLS.  Things with distinct fronts, backs, tops, bottoms, et cetera.  These aren't going to just line up and get lost or mixed up in each other like when I put a drop of water in a cup of water or something, because not only are they super complex, they're not liquids or gases either.  If there were such a thing as liquid paper, I'm sure two &quot;sheets&quot; of that would be fairly miscible, but sadly paper is solid as far as I have seen in the world thus far.  Oh well.</p></div>		</li>
