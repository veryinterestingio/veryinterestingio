			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just the Latin word for sun which is used to make numerous compounds in English. It's not any more official than &quot;the Sun&quot;, and per the IAU &quot;the Sun&quot; is their choice for the name in English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who knows only one language, it seems to make sense to use words from a dead language, if you need to pick an official name for those objects. Then no one will be left out or offended. The same way that chemical elements aren’t supposed to be named after living people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no official name given by the astronomical union to the Earth, the sun nor the moon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/our_moon/#4" target="_blank">The designation of our Moon is, therefore, the Moon, with a capital M and used as a name (a proper noun). The same applies to the designation of our planet — the Earth, of our Solar System (IAU Style Manual, 1989) and to all the other major planets. <strong>At first, it may seem these much-treasured celestial objects don’t have “proper” names. However, it is just the opposite.</strong></a></p>
