			<div class="markdown"><p>It can happen, but it’s really rare. The fertilized zygote (egg+sperm, first step in growing a baby) that would result would have 1.5x as much DNA as it should and wouldn’t develop correctly, resulting in a miscarriage/egg not implanting in the uterus. Something similar can happen if the sperm or egg had too much DNA to start with (2 copies of each chromosome instead of just one) because it didn’t split up correctly when it was being made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this happen to me actually! If the egg still attaches and tries to grow it turns into what's called a molar pregnancy. Basically long story story it turns into a tumor which can become cancer. The fetus will never live and overall it sucks alot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why evolution fucking AMAZES me. How many times did an egg (,or I dunno whatever precursor to an egg there was) like have to keep fucking up until the just right mechanism ended up happening which prevented tons of unviable zygotes. It's so neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can happen in a partial molar pregnancy, but creates abnormal tissue that can't develop and either doesn't implant (so there is no actual pregnancy despite fertilization) or ends in miscarriage. It can be pretty messy business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-identical twins come from separate eggs. On rare occasions a woman's <del>uterus</del> ovaries will have two eggs instead of the usual one, then each of them can get fertilized separately by a (different) single sperm each.</p>
<p>Identical twins come from a single egg that was fertilized by a single sperm. As the fertilized cell divides, its daughter cells usually stick to each other to form a single baby. In rare cases, the daughter cells can get accidentally separated and will start to form separate babies: twins. Several such separation events can happen resulting in multiplets.</p></div>		</li>
