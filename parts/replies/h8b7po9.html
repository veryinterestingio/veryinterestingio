			<div class="markdown"><p>Christmas music is such an easy earworm for me.</p>
<p>I’ll be humming “the drummer boy” or “joy to the world and ask “wait, what song is this? Why do I know this tune?”</p>
<p>Then it hits me, and I’m angry because now I can’t stop Christmas tunes and it’s summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you found something that works! What if it's just like, instrumentals?</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, the only thing that works is getting rid of that underlying anxiety. Sometimes, it's just time. Shit sucks lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's typically just 1 or 2 verses stuck so I just write down whatever is looping in my head. I dont even have to write with pen on paper. I just do the correct motions with my hand and so far it worked every single time. My mind was blown the first time I tried it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting connection to note.  Children often watch the same movie (Land Before Time?) over and over and over because it is familiar to them, and the predictability gives them something to latch onto and use as a reference point when learning to interact with the chaotic real world.  I can imagine to an extent, we all experience a level of comfort from familiarity and repetition.  </p>
<p>A friend of mine jokingly sings &quot;Everything is Awesome&quot; from the Lego movie.  He interjects it randomly when hanging out about 20 times in a matter of hours.  I can tell that everything is <em>not</em> awesome when he is doing that, as it's more of a comfort tick than a joke.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a great description. I feel like memes are similar -- so overplayed it's not really ever funny anymore.</p></div>		</li>
