			<div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of these. My stepdad was given two years (heart issues) 15 years ago. My aunt was given a year for ovarian cancer 18 years ago. My paternal grandma though was told she was &quot;cancer free&quot; then it came back in her 6-month follow up and she was dead 6 months later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doubt it all you want. It’s not like it’s an exact science to begin with.  They don’t pinpoint the exact day somebody will die and then tell them they’re going to die sooner.  </p>
<p>They’re giving it their best guess and so considering it is still a guess, albeit an educated one: it’s not lying to give a more cautious estimate over a more ambitious one.</p></div>		</li>
