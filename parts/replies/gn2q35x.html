<p>people believed that mental health problems were the result of demonic possession and that had remained unchanged for thousands of years</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eh... I feel like this part isn't really accurate. I mean, Freud was doing his thing in the early 1900s. At that point there was already a pretty comprehensive system of defining mental health disorders. Emil Krapelin was big on that. </p>
<p>Even before that people recognized the idea of mental health disorders and wouldn't just assume demonic possession, particularly educated people. Though they were often pretty wrong in their interpretations (like, the catch all term &quot;hysteria&quot;), they did have ideas about mental health conditions. All the way back to the ancient Greeks mental disorders were being recognized and written about. Hippocrates is one well known figure. Plato and Aristotle pushed for humane treatment towards those with mental disorders. </p>
<p>Throughout the early modern era, from around the 1600s onward, we started to see the idea of insane asylums where people with mental health disorders were &quot;treated&quot; (these treatments were often awful and were closer to torture than an actual treatment, but clearly the idea of mental disorders that may be cured existed). </p>
<p>Freud's focus on talk therapy and his focus on the mind seems to be the main reason he's still taught and well known. Thoughts about mental illness seems to shift between, as you said, magical or even demonic causes to physical causes that could potentially be fixed through surgeries. As the surgeons started to differentiate themselves from their earlier counterparts and take a more scientific approach towards surgery during the age of enlightenment and onwards they often started to believe that everything must have a direct physical cause, and that slicing and dicing is probably the best way to fix mental health issues as well. </p>
<p>While mental health issues often do have physical causes, the mind can play a big part as well. This is where Freud really differs. </p>
<p>I do like your analogy with the wagon wheel though, that's very true and I think is an apt description. It's not that Freud had everything right, but he developed a rough outline that's been developed and refined over the years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that better way to phrase would have been people just had even more egregious misunderstandings of mental health issues pre-Freud, who himself had gross misunderstandings but was able push the field in the right direction.</p>
<p>Fair enough?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto the end, freud had gross missunderstandings, its just that his gross missunderstandings were pointed at and moving in a direction that could be built on to result in what we have today. </p>
<p>People iterated on the logic of Freud and got the right answers, whereas if they had iterated on the logic of whatever there was before, they wouldn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also worth remembering that Freud rubbed shoulders with, and treated the influential and wealthy of his day. He developed a very understandable - and marketable - set of theories and treatments. Turns out, people like talking and having someone listen.</p>
<p>Proving that your theories work is not required to be remembered. While the Germans were diligently applying the scientific method to psychology, Freud did a good job of integrating centuries of psychological thinking about the mind into a popular package.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immediately assuming demonic possession is a blanket statement, but a person with almost any mental health problem might be written off as “simple” and put in a sanitarium to wait until they die, or a poorhouse to work until they die, etc. The viewpoint that psychological treatment was a legitimate instrument for healing and people with mental conditions can, with treatment, be made well, was pretty revolutionary.</p></div>		</li>
