			<div class="markdown"><p>I image that the those who run Akinator made a lot of input themselves to get the thing started, and they might intervene here and there to stomp out some bugs. However, I dare say that most of it is user input.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Choose some very obscure character from a show, and when Akinator fails, he will ask you to add the character or choose him if he already exists. From all your answer up to that point, they already have that many characteristics too add.</p>
<p>After that search for him again, and you will notice how it's improved.</p>
<p>You could also answer questions wrong, and input a character, then you would get the same character  upon answering with the same lies. (If no one else has added that character).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah. I haven't played, or even thought about that game, in ages! I used to play it with my sister when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Then I remember playing it again as teenager, with a friend, and we asked questions about the personality or the life of the person. As in <em>&quot;Is your person a criminal mastermind?&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;Do they own a lawn mower?&quot;</em>. The end game wasn't to win (we almost never guessed right, if I remember correctly), but to listen to the each other explaining our reasoning and bringing some of the characters to life by giving them a life story.</p></div>		</li>
