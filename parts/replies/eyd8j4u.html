			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, and at your neurologist’s discretion we can drive after 6 months of zero seizures. Mine isn’t photo-sensitive and my neurologist is kind of a useless prick and the only advice I got was to get sleep, never drink in excess and stay away from baths and bodies of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine was don't stay up too late, don't drink too much alcohol, and don't do drugs. So you're similar to me. Where it's a piling up of mental effects and not blinking lights.</p>
<p>I had a tonsillectomy years after my 3 adolescence seizures. After the surgery I had a seizure because I was tired, pumped with drugs for the surgery, and dehydrated. Did a month of no driving because my neurologist is awesome and the circumstances were quite extraordinary, both agreed that I probably didn't need to go back on meds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have epilepsy (juvenile myoclonic) and this is a trigger for me as well! Strobes and other things that come with the photosensitivity warnings don’t seem to bother me, but light through the trees always has. So technically I’m photosensitive, but a veeeeery little and specific subset of that category.</p></div>		</li>
