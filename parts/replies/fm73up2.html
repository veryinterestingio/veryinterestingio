<blockquote>
<p>he chinese had believed that grounded rhino horns are an aphrodisiac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just pointing out that this is not the case, according to Save the Rhino, the largest rhino conservancy NGO in Europe. In fact, it is a misinterpretation of texts by Westeners. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino-info/threats/poaching-rhino-horn/" target="_blank">https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino-info/threats/poaching-rhino-horn/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to traditional Chinese texts, such as Li Shih-chen’s 1597 medical text “Pen Ts’ ao Kang Mu”, rhino horn has been used in Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years and is used to treat fever, rheumatism, gout, and other disorders. It also states that the horn could also cure snakebites, hallucinations, typhoid, headaches, carbuncles, vomiting, food poisoning, and “devil possession.” While it is commonly believed to be prescribed as an aphrodisiac, this is not the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you might think that I am just nitpicking here, but read the following part: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a belief in Western countries that rhino horn is used as an aphrodisiac and sexual stimulant, but this is not correct and seems to have been misunderstood or misinterpreted by Western media. <strong>However, research has shown that people in Viet Nam are starting to believe this rumour as they are consuming it for new reasons.</strong></p>
<p>Even without aphrodisiacal properties, however, rhino horn is one of the mainstays of Traditional Chinese Medicines, and its collection has been responsible for the death of tens of thousands of rhinos around the world.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: those people using rhino horn to cure medical ailments really believe it works. That’s what drives up the demand on which the poachers thrive. As Ann and Steve Toon commented in 2002, “For practitioners of traditional Asian medicine, rhino horn is not perceived as a frivolous love potion, but as an irreplaceable pharmaceutical necessity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, repeating the misinterpretation that rhino horn is an aphrodesiac <strong>drives up demand</strong> because people in Viet Nam have been believing the rumours that are spread by Western media. </p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong, it is reprehensible to use rhino horn for any sort of bullshit &quot;medicine&quot;, but it is tantamount to understand where demand is coming from if you want to combat the issue and drive down demand. Repeating the misinterpretation that it is an aphrodesiac is doing the opposite, and creates a new market of people who believe these rumours. Again, this is according to Save the Rhino, not according to Chinese propaganda sources or whatever.</p>
<p>Here is another article from Scientific American: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hard-truth-about-the-rhino-horn-aphrodisiac-market/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hard-truth-about-the-rhino-horn-aphrodisiac-market/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>now it’s mainly part of a desperate grasp onto traditional medicine and cultural quirks by the older generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also not accurate actually. The main users are rich businesspeople, celebrities and government officials. It is a status symbol. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Medicinal” use of rhino horn is not even the main demand. Most of it (I was told 80% by a rhino conservationist in South Africa) is used as a status symbol. They make paperweight, engagement rings, statuettes..</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's why I do research on my own to understand complex medical treatments. If you really need an aphrodesiac I have the perfect essential oil for you!</p></div>		</li>
