			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true. Rubber is elastic, as the balloon stretches it applies more and more force to the air inside, which is under greater and greater pressure. The balloon is not being fatigued or stretched beyond the elastic point, that will cause it to break.
The elastic properties may be affected by heat, as the hot air from your lungs expands the rubber and makes it looser and easier to stretch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rubber absolutely gets fatigued. It's why stretching a balloon out slows you to blow it up with less effort. Or why if you stretch a rubber band half way to breaking, then stretch it that much 100 more times it will probably break.</p></div>		</li>

The balloon is absolutely stretched beyond its elastic limit. The paper even talks about unloading and reloading the balloon, where it follows a different, “easier” path, as the original comment suggests.</p></div>		</li>
