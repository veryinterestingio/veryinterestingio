<p>I don't think chimpanzees have an equivalent</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are right, but in nature they have some sort of communication (sounds and gestures), so I was wondering if they still would express themselves through those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to my knowledge, especially as they were also living with untrained chimps. And as far as I know, the apes knowing sign languages also did not form an elitist ruling clique. ;)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a baby chimpanzee getting a mild shock from an electric fence.</p>
<p>What's fascinating is a chimp indicates to another chip that the baby touched his finger off the electric fence.</p>
<p>There a screen shot - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xxDRpI2.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/xxDRpI2.png</a></p>
<p>It happens quickly, so it's easy to miss. He communicated very fast, I think a lot of communication is missed as we process some types of visual information slower.</p>
<p>Chimps are faster at some tasks.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Even watching for the communication at full speed and I missed it the first time. The slight nod of acknowledgment from the other chimp is also pretty interesting. Thank you for sharing this clip and explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating. </p>
<p>Regarding the memory test; Haven’t our brains through evolution moved further away from memory abilities? I wasn’t surprised by the results because I have an idea that we remember quite poorly compared to other species.</p></div>		</li>
