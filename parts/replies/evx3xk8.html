			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be possible, but carbon is a mixture of C-12, C-13 and a little bit C-14, the graphene is not perfectly flat, to get 1 gram you need a giant surface, you would have to measure the distance between the graphene atoms with excellent precision, this distance depends on the surface the graphene is on and many other problems.</p>
<p>Instead of graphene people used a silicon sphere. We have decades of experience with producing extremely high quality silicon for semiconductors.</p></div>		</li>
