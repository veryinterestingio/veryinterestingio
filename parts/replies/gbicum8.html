			<div class="markdown"><p>To translate... gunk inside your skin can be caused by many things, and your body can address the problem with different strategies.  The process starts when something shouldn’t be in skin, which is a problem. If it is inside your skin, the body gets upset and sends the immune system to attack, which sends lots of fluid and lots of white blood cells. It gets swollen and red. This makes liquidy puss.  Now, depending on what your body is fighting, puss can range from liquid to jelly to chunky (gross).</p>
<p>The other major problem you have is blocked pores.  Technically, a pore is outside your skin. It’s like a front porch: part of the house, but open to the outside, so it’s outside.   No matter what blocks pores, dead skin starts to collect, and depending on the pore type will have different amounts of oil.  These are your harder pieces of gunk.  Black heads and white heads can be very hard, as they are mostly dead skin squished tightly into a shape.  They can even feel sharp.</p>
<p>Some pores produce a lot of oil, especially teenagers.  So when you pop a pimple, at first you get a hard plug, mostly white (dead skin), and then you may get lots of trapped oil to come out, maybe with a little bit of blood.  So that’s all liquid.</p>
<p>Your body can also send white blood cells and puss into the blocked pore to fight infection, and now you have a menagerie of horrors.</p>
<p>You can let your imagination run wild with possibilities. You could have a pore that’s blocked grow inward into your skin... maybe it fills with dead skin, maybe oil, maybe it starts to rot...</p>
<p>Dead skin, puss, oil, germs, and blood all in different combinations.</p></div>		</li>
