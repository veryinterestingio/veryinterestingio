<p>so how can you discuss things in a meaningful way when they don’t listen to any of the science that’s out there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;backfire effect&quot; is still kind of being worked out in the literature. It's pretty clear that presenting people with new information doesn't usually change minds. It's less clear if it makes them more entrenched. </p>
<p>That's why I think an information deficit model of science communication (here let me talk at you about science!), is overall not effective. There's also data in the literature showing that this is not an effective model. </p>
<p>People take a lot of their beliefs from their social circles. I'd start with being a very public model of pro-social behavior. Wear a mask in public. If you have kids, when you get them vaccinated take a happy (not crying) picture for social media. </p>
<p>If you do have the one-on-one conversation, genuinely listen. Let them know you understand their concerns, and then point them to a good resource. It's tacky to recommend my own book, but there are tons of books and websites on the topic that are great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate this advice. I am sometimes part of groups that have a few rabid anti-vaxxers in them because my husband and I chose to take as natural approach as possible to parenting.  We minimized unnecessary medical interventions through my pregnancies and births, I breastfed, I coslept, and I used baby carriers to snuggle my babies every day instead of placing them in strollers or swings. I didn't put my kids in daycare and my husband and I structured our lives so that he would be home with them during the day and work a couple of evenings a week when I was home. A LOT of people in this community are vaccine hesitant and a small (but very vocal) minority is rabidly anti-vaxx.</p>
<p>You're not going to convince anyone of anything by telling them they are just flat earth anti-science morons. The only success I've ever seen is from first validating their legitimate concerns. </p>
<p>They couldn't use any medicine during their pregnancy because it could be dangerous to the baby. They aren't using formula because breast milk is superior. They aren't using insect repellant or sunscreen on baby's skin because it could be dangerous. They can't give some vaccines until the baby is older because their immune system is too immature. But two days after baby is born, they are told that a vaccine for a sexually transmitted disease is necessary.</p>
<p>They wonder why this one is OK. They wonder who chose hepatitis B to be the first one. They wonder why we have so many vaccines given all at once. They wonder why there are so many vaccines period. They wonder whether they are really safe. They wonder what the chances are that their kids will ever encounter the vaccine preventable illness.</p>
<p>These are not crazy concerns. They are not wrong to want to make the best decisions they can for their child. They are good questions to be asking and demonstrate critical thinking. </p>
<p>The way to reach these vaccine hesitant parents is to first hear their concerns. Then, in a completely non-judgmental way, address ALL of their concerns and questions through science.  Explain what  the reason is for the timing and the combining of vaccines. Explain that the efficacy of vaccines has improved so much over the years that the vital load transmitted is much reduced from what we people in their 30s received as kids. Etc.</p>
<p>We need to make the time to have these conversations with vaccine hesitant people because the anti-vaxxers will be glad to make time to convince them. We need to not turn them away or roll our eyes. We need to stop with the messaging that if you have concerns about vaccines that you are a flat earth, anti-science idiot.</p>
<p>We also need to change the messaging to be more sensitive to these concerns.  Instead of messaging about how if you don't vaccine your child that you are a murderer, what about vaccines make us all safer, and your doctor will be glad to talk to you about any safety concerns you may have. </p>
<p>We don't tell people that we aren't allowed to question medical treatment any other time. Informed consent is a fundamental tenet of medical care. But when it comes to vaccines, parents are shamed and ridiculed when they have questions. That, more than anything, pushes vaccine hesitant parents to listen to the anti-vaxxers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something that I think is also effective is using the tactic of personal anecdote to hammer home the importance of these ideas from a tangible, social perspective. </p>
<p>My in-laws are very conservative, about a great many topics, but often times if I approach from the angle of “well, this is <em>my</em> experience with xyz “, they tend to be a little more hesitant to say immediately “Well you’re wrong”. Why? Because this is also <em>their</em> metric for understanding the world: experiential and social information, versus institutional trust.  </p>
<p>I often use the stories my grandmother told my mother about when vaccination first became a thing in Thailand. People would walk miles to have their children vaccinated!! Before this, you would not give a name to your child before the age of one, because the chances of losing that child were so great, and the pain is that much more terrible when the child has a name you have given it. </p>
<p>My thinking is that these are stories that resonate, and I think they give anti-vaccination/hesitant vaccination individuals — like one coworker I have, and my mother-in-law— some pause, hearing an experience rather than a statistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait you had me on the first part, but making your kid an insta influencer kinda sucks, no? What about simply approaching them as people, and acknowledging that they <em>do</em> have reasons to not trust the government. But that you find other reasons more important. Give them something real onto which they can project their legitimate fear and anger?</p>
<p>Say, toppling governments, dismantling social rights movements, selling out to corporations?</p>
<p>People are angry for a reason. Our job as academics is to give them our best account of that reason, and tell them that we're with them in this. Because we are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't personally show my kiddo on social media, but friends who do have often posted a cute photo saying &quot;post shots&quot; or something unassuming. It's just a way to normalize the behavior.</p></div>		</li>
