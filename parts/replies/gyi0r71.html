			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, another bit of info, the Army did all of the landings in the ETO and had the majority of the troops for a majority of the landings in the Pacific. Iwo was the ONE landing entirely conducted by the Marines and that's the reason it gets so much of their attention/ad money, they didn't have to share the glory with any Soldiers. That's why they didn't talk about the Gilberts etc. as much; just after the war, which contributes to the focus today. </p>
<p>The USMC has always been credited with the best self-perpetuating propaganda in the US military. They have had to fight to stay in existence.</p>
<p>Edit: in Reddit tradition, thanks for my first gold; I'd like to thank my family and Keanu Reeves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Air Force manages bombers and land-based ICBMs and Navy manages submarine-based SLBMs. No other branch of the military (including Army) has nuclear weapons. The Army did have some artillery but it was decommissioned a few decades ago.</p>
<p>Note that orders to use nuclear weapons must come directly from the President no matter what.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Marines can both join the SEALS (which is weird) and they have their own equivalent of Maine Corps Force Recon.</p>
<p>They can operate truly independently with no support covertly in small numbers behind enemy lines. But no one talks about Force Recon. The SEALS however are famous.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the seals are special forces and you can probably read one of their thousands of books that talk about their missions specifically. But special forces falls under its own command.(<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Special_Operations_Command" target="_blank">SOCOM</a>)</p>
<p>I feel like your question is what do the seals do if the marines exist but the seals are elite seamen and do secret squirrel shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to other comments here, Navy SEALs are <em>not</em> Special Forces as far as the US military is concerned - they're what's known as Special <em>Operations</em> Forces (or SOF). It might seem a bit picky of a distinction, but it's important to note that in the US, the name <em>Special Forces</em> refers to the Army SOF unit also known as the Green Berets. The British, in the other hand, use Special Forces for all their, well, special forces.</p>
<p>It's not quite as simple as saying that SEALs are the Navy equivalent of the Army Special Forces, because they specialize in different things, but it's not completely off the mark. Army SF's primary job is training and working with guerrilla fighters - they were sent into Afghanistan to work with the Northern Alliance against the Taliban, for example. The SEALs are more focused on so called &quot;direct action&quot;, i.e. get in, fuck shit up, get out. Of course, there's a lot of overlap, and Army SF can do most of the things the SEALs can do and vice versa. Also worth noting that the Air Force and Marine Corps have their own SOF units in the Special Tactics Squadrons and the Marine Raiders, respectively.</p>
<p>On top of these, there is JSOC, or Joint Special Operations Command, which consists of the best of the best from each branch of the US military. This is where you find 1st SFOD-D (commonly known as Delta Force) and DEVGRU (or SEAL Team 6, aka the guys who took down Bin Ladin).</p></div>		</li>
