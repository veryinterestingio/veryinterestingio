			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's like this:</p>
<p>Minerals at the bottom. Organic matter at the surface.</p>
<p>When minerals from the bottom rise, they fertilize PHYTOplankton.</p>
<p>Then that phytoplankton uses sunlight to reproduce and basically forms the base of the food chain. Zooplankton feeds off it, then krill, then fish, then Sharks and mammals. Which then defecate and all those minerals sink to the bottom again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deep waters are typically high in dissolved inorganic nutrients which would sustain high production of phytoplankton which can produce energy using light.</p>
<p>However, deep sea organisms are limited by sources of energy as only a few microorganisms can thrive without the input of organic carbon, which is delivered at very slow rates and thus limits the productivity of abyssal ecosystems away from vents or whale falls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, they do. I have a hard time imagining there being lots of plankton on the seafloor though, given that much of those organisms photosynthesise or eat other plankton: this is just a guess based on what I could find on Wikipedia, but perhaps the swirling eddy currents around seamounts serve to trap and concentrate passing surface plankton?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost 100% correct, however there are a number of contour following currents beyond the continental shelf. Check out contourites if you're interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The matmyob answer?  That looks reasonable?</p>
<p>I agree with the overall context of your answer (deep ocean is stable and boring), however I'd make a slightly different focus and say that every surface ocean process is seasonal (wind stress -&gt; ekman, warmth and strength of currents, ice formation, productivity etc...).  The majority of these processes are very weakly connected to the deep ocean if at all but some of them, like ABW and NADW formation, are reasonably well connected.  </p>
<p>So, do seasonal effects in the surface lead to seasons in the deep?  Near the bottom/deepwater sources there is almost certainly a detectable salinity / temp signal, but we expect that signal to diffuse away to nothing in the majority of the deep ocean.  </p>
<p>In short, there are seasonalities in deep ocean inputs which will give a seasonality near those input locations, but given the size of the deep ocean reservoir relative to the fluxes (and the pertinent diffusion timescales) there is little seasonality in the deep ocean as a whole. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, I suppose. But I don't think that seasonal signal is strong like it is in areas close to the surface...so I was thinking that question in terms of what it means for the biotic communities, which to my knowledge, do not substantially differ seasonally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd agree that the deep ocean biomes don't have strong annual cycles (or at least, it seems implausible.  I can't recall any actual data to prove it).</p></div>		</li>
