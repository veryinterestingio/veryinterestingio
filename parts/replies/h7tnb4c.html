			<div class="markdown"><p>To put some numbers to your example, covid has a 0.8% fatality rate and about a 5% &quot;if you don't go to the hospital you die&quot; rate.</p>
<p>About 50% of the US population are not vaccinated. There are 330 million Americans. 330×50%×0.8% is 1 320,000 deaths.  Now some of those people already caught covid and died.  If we have had 600,000 covid deaths already, about half were from the groups refusimg the vaccine, so drop the expected future deaths <em>if hospitals can handle the load</em> to about a million more Americans. </p>
<p>Up to 5 million if hospitals can't handle it.</p>
<p>We should also discuss non-fatal casualties, whether long covid or permanent/long term damage to survivors. Everything from kidney failure to stroke to ED.    Actually we should talk a lot more about that last one as it might get young males who think they are invincible to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>As we discover that Covid attacks the brain, we have more reasons to worry about how we will care for the cognatively damaged survivors of covid.</p>
<p>Edit thank you kind redditor for the Silver!</p>
<p>Edit 2, 2 awards, thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly not sure at this point.</p>
<p>I did some digging to get a good number for you and a lot of what I found was old.  With the additional data from the last 18 months, a Jan 2021 published report is going to be out of date. </p>
<p>This looks promising, it only has 4 US states, showing a bit of a variability of IFR.  0.8% looks pessimistic according to this, but is optimistic compared to other things I've looked at so...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly that seems conservative if anything. For example, according to numbers from the New York Times, California has had about 4m cases and 64,000 deaths, well 64,000/4,000,000 is .016 or 1.6% fatality rate.</p>

<p>Here's more numbers from Johns Hopkins that shows some of the rates for other countries.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vaccine makes it much less likely that a vaccinated person will carry enough viral load to spread it, even if they get infected. However, even if a vaccinated person becomes infected and carries a high enough viral load to infect others, the vaccine still assists in reducing symptoms that make the spread worse (like coughing), and it assists in helping the person eliminate the virus more quickly, reducing the amount of time they’re able to infect others, and therefore the amount of others they will infect. </p>
<p>As far as mutation goes, the vaccines provide an immune response in the body that is near identical to getting infected, so while the virus will always mutate and select for advantageous mutations, the risk of vaccinated people making those mutations “worse” is no different than the risk of non vaccinated people who get naturally infected “causing” mutations. It’s something we can hopefully improve on with future vaccines, but the worst case scenario right now is that it’s no worse for mutation risk to get the vaccine than to not get it. </p>
<p>Also, the more people are vaccinated, the less mutations matter. If we do reach herd immunity through vaccination, it’s very unlikely the virus will be able to mutate enough in a short enough period to survive the die out from not being able to be spread to new hosts without antibodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All good points, thank you., But I would like more elaboration on that part about &quot;the vaccines provide an immune response in the body that is near identical to getting infected&quot;. </p>
<p>I know the spike protein itself is cytotoxic, but are there other components/proteins that the immune system can pick up on besides the spike protein to provide immunity, or is that basically all the innate immune response relies on?</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if the spike protein were removed, would the immune system be able to detect the virus and build a defense against it, or would it not even matter because that's the only dangerous aspect of the virus (what allows it to enter cells to replicate)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you can apply pressure for a virus to evolve.  </p>
<p>More infections == more mutations.  </p>
<p>Obviously, a variant that bypassed the vaccine response would be more successful, therefore more likely to become the dominant strain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, and it’s something that does have to be considered when designing the vaccines. From what I understand of how the current mRNA vaccines are designed, they target the spike protein, the primary means that the virus uses to enter the cells. Minor mutations in the genetic code are likely to not affect such a vital protein in the virus, which is why it was a good target for the vaccine. This is why we see that the current vaccines are effective against the Delta variant, the new variant still has a spike protein close enough to the old form that the vaccine still provides effective protection. </p>
<p>Is it possible that a variant can emerge that goes around it? Absolutely, but the odds are low. These odds increase as more people are infected, so the bigger threat for more variants does come from unvaccinated people as they will have a higher viral load than even a breakthrough case.</p>
<p>What’s awesome about the mRNA vaccines, though, is that it’s much easier to create a booster from these vaccines, since all you need is the mRNA sequence, something that is way easier to decode in a linear fashion and share, than a protein, which gets all folded and complicated. So even as variants that are resistant emerge, we likely won’t have to wait as long for a booster. The wait will come from running clinical trials, but that’ll still shave off loads of time.</p></div>		</li>
