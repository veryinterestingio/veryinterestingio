			<div class="markdown"><p>The bank is not your buddy. It's a business. The bank lends money and charges you for it based on how likely you are to pay back, and to do so on time. It accepts the fact that some people won't be able to pay back. I'm such cases, it has to take what it can get. On balance, it does very well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you knew your buddy just got his clock cleaned in a divorce, got laid off 6 months later, and is living barely off of welfare and has about 0 change in hell of ever paying you back the 10k?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would be happy to get anything at that point.</p>
<p>However, this is why I, as a rule, don't loan people money.  If I am in that state of mind I just give it to them, and if they pay me back, sweet, otherwise I write off the moment I hand them the money.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're still going to have a <em>massive</em> hit on your credit report from the big, blazing 'BANKRUPTCY' at the top of it. </p>
<p>When i did mortgages, the vast majority of the time a bankruptcy within the last 5-7 years was game over </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bankruptcy, settlements, judgments, collection accounts all effect credit score. The biggest thing to effect the score is a delinquent account. You can file bankruptcy with all your accounts current and have a score in the mid 600’s.  Two cc accounts that are 60 or 90 days late ...your score is in the 400’s. Yes, bankruptcy looks bad. But settlements and delinquencies are also bad and most credit analysts hold all of them against you to mostly the same degree. For the consumer, if they have out of control debt, and qualify for a chapter 7 bankruptcy, doing that is in their best interest. Only thing better than that is paying off your debts in full. </p>
<p>Edit:  mortgages are the hardest type of loan to get and yes, you would never be approved for one if you have a bankruptcy. Credit cards, car loans, leases...they all have a more relaxed credit approval process</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bankruptcy hurts the longest for sure. A few lates will fall off after 3-5 years. Bankruptcy is 5-7. But bankruptcy can also burn a creditor indefinitely. You're credit report might be in check but if you burn every major bank in the process it might not matter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen credit reports with collection accounts older than 10-15 years. If the debt is never resolved it potentially can stay on there indefinitely as it bounces around to different 3rd party collectors. My point was bankruptcy has been made into a dirty word that most consumers think they should avoid at all costs. But, it’s just not true. Bankruptcy is a protection for the debtor, usually offering relief from being over extended. It’s not to be used lightly, and often other signs of active hardship are just as detrimental to a consumer’s credit as bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Edit: if you have a “few lates” on an account, that will show on your report for as long as the account is active. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don’t pay a cc in 6 months, they will write the debt off as a loss and most likely sell it to a third party collector. So, after 6 months the account charges off. </p></div>		</li>
