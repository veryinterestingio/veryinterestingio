			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually tell by generally a forced stretch hurts quite a bit more than a natural stretch and will not feel natural. It is usually pretty obvious when one stretches too much. If you have to apply quite a bit of force to make the stretch happen your muscles and joints probably are not ready to stretch that far. A normal stretch is just going as far as you can without trying to pull or push anything hard basically. Like for example if you try to learn down for a toe touch that is in normal stretch, if you try to clench your muscles to force yourself to reach your toes, or grab onto your toes and pull with your arms to stretch farther, those would be an example of forcing the stretch that may reduce flexibility, and would also likely be quite painful.Basically listen to your body, if your body is saying &quot;this hurts too much stop&quot; it is probably too much, and just do the stretch more lightly and remember to take deep breaths while stretching. With time you will be able to do the stretch more and more without the pain. I also like using YouTube channels like Bodyweight warriors to help guide me through flexibility training as they have more know how than me.<br />
Edit: it is also important to note the difference between a dynamic stretch and a static stretch. Dynamic is moving around, static is more holding a position. Dynamic stretches are typically done before workouts or in the morning, static typically after workouts of before bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the in-depth reply. It's greatly appreciated by me and I'm sure many others. I was wondering what the benefits of an increased flexibility is. Because I've started stretching as a morning routine to help me get out of bed and start the day actually awake. But I wanted to know what benefits I may receive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using the touching your toes (or trying to in my case) example, I pretty much just reach a point where I can’t go further. I get no pain or stretching sensation, yet I can not physically push it further. If I do try to push it it causes pain, yet still doesn’t move further. </p>
<p>In contrast, stretching calves, quads, hip flexors and pecs/shoulders actually feels good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good stretching involves slowly sinking into the stretch over the course of at least 30 seconds. If you push hard, you won’t be able to maintain for longer period of time. After about 30 seconds into a stretch, you’ll feel certain muscles release which allows you to properly “sink” into the position further</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, at the point that you're meeting resistance, push with/tense the muscles you're stretching for 5ish seconds without coming out of the stretch and then relax them. Basically showing the muscles they can still operate at that level of extension without getting strained, according to every PT and dancer I know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small caveat:  the cells that tell us we are stretching too far are not muscles.  They are specialized cells in out tendons called golgi tendon organs or cells parallel to our muscles called spindle cells.   They are a subset of cell called proprioceptors.  They relay information based on how quickly a muscle is extending or how much force is being applied to the tendon.   A reflex will either contract to stop the muscle from extending too fast, or will relax to stop a muscles from contracting too strongly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it true that when an unconscious person is stretched that they are much more flexible?   Like could I do the splits if anesthetize vs not being able to touch my toes now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. </p>
<p>It’s not just unconscious though. It’s under anesthesia which is a level above (below?) unconscious.</p>
<p>Most of what we talk about as “flexibility” actual has to do with resting tone of a muscle, meaning that even at rest it’s partially contracted. This is totally normal.</p>
<p>When under anesthesia you’re so thoroughly out and nervous system activity is so low that you have no resting tone so the only thing limiting the movement is the actual joint and the maximal mechanical length of the muscles. </p>
<p>In operative reports post knee replacement the surgeons often include how far they were able to bend the newly placed prosthetic which gives us a pretty good idea what their max voluntary range could be. The chance we’ll be able to bend further than the surgeon could bend the knee in the operating room is basically zero.</p>
<p>Edit:  I would point out what the guy below said is likely true. It won’t take you from being a solid, cold block of metal to an olympic gymnast in a snap. Extremes aside, people often demonstrate significantly larger passive ranges of motion under anesthesia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in an orthopedic clinic and I don’t know about more flexible than the normal, but for our patients that are unable to get back to the normal level, they have to go back into “surgery” and undergo what is called a closed manipulation, where they are put to sleep and the surgeon will forcibly stretch out the extremity. One of our patients was at 60 degrees of flexion for their knee after a knee replacement after 12 weeks so they had to do the closed manipulation. We like at least 100 degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely not. You will probably be more flexible, but not incredibly so. Inside your muscles are things called golgi tendon organs that, when stretched, send signals to your muscle to contract, so as not to be stretched any further. This will still happen. It is likely someone could just keep stretching and end up tearing muscle/connective tissue because you won’t be able to actively push against them</p></div>		</li>
