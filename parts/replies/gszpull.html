			<div class="markdown"><p>Influenza also infects animals, hence the terms like swine flu and bird flu. The Covid measures have been effective at breaking the transmission within the human population, but once we’re no longer wearing masks and distancing, once it returns to the human population in a crossover event, it will resume its usual transmission cycle.</p>
<p>Perhaps if the idea that people who feel unwell should wear masks and not do silly things like try to work through it in the office become established norms, we might have far less severe flu seasons, but I fear that won’t be the case.</p>
<p>I am given to believe that a lot of the reason we were able to get Covid vaccines so quickly was because of research efforts to develop flu vaccines. The team that developed the AZ vaccine at Oxford, for example, had previously been working (so far unsuccessfully) on a “universal” flu vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
