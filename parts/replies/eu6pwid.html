			<div class="markdown"><p>Rehearsal. Going over something again again and again is proven to strengthen the memory in question. Like revision before an exam.</p>
<p>If we were take  two neurons in a series, and repeatedly stimulate these neurons so that the connection point between these two neurons is activated again and again, then the 'strength' of the connection between these two neurons increases. This is a very simple explanation of a phenomenon called synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>So you can see how easy it is to say that synaptic plasticity = memory formation? Rehearsal is just the neurons being stimulated again and again, and the strengthening of the connection between these neurons is the 'memory'. A direct and easy to distinguish cellular correlate of memory. Easy.</p>
<p>But rarely are things in science so straightforward.</p>
<p>It has been found for a fair while now that the opposite is also possible and found naturally in the brain. By the opposite I mean the 'weakening' of a connection between two neurons after a series of stimulations. We even know the specific 'pattern' of stimulation that envokes this weakening. How does that work if we believe that synaptic plasticity = memories? We don't actively 'forget' things, it just happens. </p>
<p>No this does not disprove synpatic plasticity = memory. In fact this process of weakening fits in very nicely with how neuroscientists currently think memories are made, and synaptic plasticity is at the heart of it all. It just goes to show that memories and memory formation in the brain is far far faaaaar too complex for such a simple explanation. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Very interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no. If you were to remove a neuron you are removing a source of information but it’s not that simple. There are many neurons which make up a single memory trace. The best way for me to describe this is that if you have an image of a circle ⭕️ in front of you, and you cover a small section of the outer ring so it is no longer visible, it will still be a circle to you. In this case the circle is the whole memory trace, and the part you cover is one of thousands of neurons making up the trace. You won’t necessarily ‘forget’ any information by removing a single neuron because others will likely also be triggering the next neuron in the trace to fire anyways.</p></div>		</li>
