<p>There is good reasons against negative mass like the fact that you don't have a stable vacuum. You can create as many negative mass particles as you like and only lower the overall energy of the system by that, which means your system runs away into lower and lower energies, it's unstable. </p>

<p>I understand negative mass is highly en vogue among laypeople right now. It's the new -1/12 basically and people  just don't listen to any issues this concept has and go around parrotting it everywhere. They don't care and think it's cool. </p>
<p>To address your other comment as well</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea has been considered seriously for quite a while: See &quot;white holes&quot; the theoretical opposite of black holes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>White holes don't have negative mass. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Space-time warps &quot;downward&quot; in the presence of mass-energy, but there is absolutely no reason to believe that it cannot also bend &quot;upwards&quot;,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither upwards or downwards makes sense when speaking about curvature in GR, since it isn't a scalar function / a &quot;rubber sheet&quot; (where you seem to take this from, but this is just inaccurate popscience), it's described by a tensor. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The existence of negative mass wouldn't change any equations at all.</p>
<p>frankly symmetric equations are simpler anyway</p>
<p>making space-time symmetric. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is at best incomplete.  While it's true that if you have a constant amount of &quot;stuff&quot; flowing out equally in all directions the flux of stuff will fall off as 1/r^2, what is the outflowing stuff in the case of electricity and gravity, why is there a constant amount of it, and why does the force depend on the flux of this stuff?</p>
<p>And for extra credit, why don't <em>all</em> forces behave this way?  The strong nuclear force, for instance, is not an inverse square law.</p>
<p>(To my knowledge, you can get there from here by diving deep into the ideas of virtual photons and gravitons, but that's far enough from my field that I'll leave it for someone else.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The weak interaction has a short range because its force carriers (W and Z bosons) have a large mass. Instead of an 1/r potential you get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_potential" target="_blank">Yukawa potential</a>.</p>
<p>The strong interaction is special as its force carrier (the gluon) has a charge* on its own and can interact with itself. In addition the interaction is strong. Naively this would lead to a potential proportional to r for large distances, i.e. a force that doesn't decrease with distance. In practice this means you cannot have isolated charges of the strong interaction: If you try to separate particles of different charge you provide enough energy to produce new particle pairs that keep both sides without a total charge. In principle the interaction would have infinite range, but you cannot get charged objects.</p>
<p>*called &quot;color charge&quot;, has nothing to do with the electric charge</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 1/r potential comes from the fundamental solution of the Poisson
equation Δϕ(x) = δ(x) ⇒ ϕ(x) ∝ 1/r (w/ boundary condition ϕ → 0 for
large x) in three dimensions.  The weak and strong force don’t have a
classical limit.  I don’t think it makes any sense to try to compare
them to classical EM or gravity.</p>
<p>You can now try rationalize the Laplacian here.  You can go back to
the QED Lagrangian or look at the Newtonian Limit of the Schwarzschild
solution.  Or just say it’s the “static part” of the wave operator.</p>
<p>My favorite would be that it’s the unique second order linear
differential operator invariant under rotations.  But then you would
still have to explain where there isn’t an additional const·ϕ term
(this would correspond to a mass of the quantum particle).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think an &quot;incomplete&quot; explanation is what's most appropriate for a question like this. There's nothing wrong with sticking to the framework that the question was asked in. Responding to the OP with an argument using QFT would be totally unhelpful. In Newtonian physics the best answer is the one given--that mass is always positive. </p></div>		</li>
