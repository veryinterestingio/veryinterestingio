<p>This is correct, but the opposite may happen as well. Venezuela just did the same recently (removing 6 zeros from the currency) and the government issued <em>smaller</em> bills in this case.</p>
<p>A not-fun fact: they've gone through this process 3 times since 2007, removing a whooping 14 zeros. 1 Bolivar today is equal to 100.000.000.000.000 (100 trillion) pre-2007 Bolivars.</p></div>		</li>

&quot;As noted above, the nuevo peso (new peso) was the result of elevated rates of inflation in Mexico during the 1980s. In 1993, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari stripped <strong>three zeros</strong> from the peso, creating a parity of $1 New Peso for $1,000 of the old ones.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
