			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, there’s usually a button or setting to turn the fan on or off. I would think it’s pretty close to universal at this point. But I had an apartment once where the oven had to be older than the building itself so I didn’t want to assume everyone had the feature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely not standard on lower/mid range electric ovens in the US, sadly. I have a decent enough and relatively new electric oven in my apartment, but the air fryer is FAR better on most items and cuts cook time in half.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also in the UK.
Seen many ovens where fan on/off is an option as well as which heating elements are used (top/bottom).</p>
<p>Common is one dial with all the fan and elements options and the other for temperature</p></div>		</li>
