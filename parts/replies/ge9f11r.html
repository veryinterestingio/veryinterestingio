			<div class="markdown"><p>Second this.  I would add, please make sure the area/company you use does this responsibly.  I've done this a few times, but once in Mexico, it was a free-for-all with the boats and the competition between skippers to get close to the whales resulted in a bunch of hits, you could tell it was stressing out the sharks (which is not only bad for the animals, but made it hell to keep up with them once you are in the water as they are constantly trying to get away from the boats).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I meant at the Georgia Aquarium, they have giant rays also, as well as other sea life you would have a hard time seeing in the ocean. I had a chance to in the galapagos but our schedule was so packed, there was also hammerheads that I missed too. But yea check out the Georgia Aquarium, the prices are pretty reasonable and they provide all the equipment (for obvious reasons). Atlanta itself is a great city and the Aquarium is also really nice even if you aren't diving. I believe they offer extra packages where they get you real close to the rays or the whale sharks (you can only choose one you can't do both in one dive) but those cost extra. The tank itself is huge, if you've never dived in an enclosure before it's a really cool experience.</p></div>		</li>
