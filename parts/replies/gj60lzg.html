<p>You shouldn't however confuse vapor coming off boiling water as the same kind of steam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Steam, ie water in gaseous form, is invisible.</p>
<p>What you see coming off the pot / kettle isn't steam, it's water in liquid form (still very hot) that's condensed from gas (steam) back into microscopic liquid drops and now being held aloft by the hot air current. Basically a hot cloud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as people realize that in that water vapor is some actual steam and that is what will burn you.  Same thing with microwaving a sealed container.  If you open them too soon after they have been heated you can get a instant burn from the steam that has formed in the container.</p></div>		</li>
