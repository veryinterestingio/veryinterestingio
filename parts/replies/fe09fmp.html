			<div class="markdown"><p>All the continents are <em>on</em> plates. They <em>are</em> plates. They can't really shift from one to another, they move around with respect to one another. And plates overlap in any subduction zone, supercontinent or not. The Indian subcontinent is currently being thrust under Asia to form the Himalayas, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tectonic plates are chunks of the litosphere which act independently. Some of them are huge, like the Eurasian Plate, some are much smaller. Moreover, most of them have continental crust, but some don't, like the Nazca Plate, which takes up part of the Pacific and currently subducts over the Southamerican Plate, causing Chile to have enormous copper deposits and really strong earthquakes. </p>
<p>If all goes according to plan, after 50 - 100 million years, the Pacific Ocean is going to disappear and Asia is going to collide with the Americas.</p></div>		</li>
