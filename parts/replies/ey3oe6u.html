			<div class="markdown"><p>Pushed us the wrong context here really. We think that their gravitational interactions between them pulled them together and then sling shot them out in some cases. In other cases we believe massive collisions changed the orbit velocity and sent massive planets on elliptical orbits in towards the sun causing absolute havoc with other planets orbits. </p>
<p>If you look at the rotational direction of the planets youll notice that where they should all be uniform, most are not. Some are tilted differently, some (Uranus and venus) actually spin the complete opposite direction. We think these differences where caused by the havoc of larger bodies interacting closely, and in the cases of the retrograde spin planets that they collided with something rather large. </p>
<p>Neptune is thought to be on of the bodies that came in to the inner solar system causing this havoc. It's rotation is unexpected and titan actually orbits the planet in the wrong direction, which is unusual and even more surprising when you consider the size of the moon and its distance to the planet (most retrograde moons are small and distant from their planets, likely captured from another planet or planetary collisions)</p></div>		</li>
