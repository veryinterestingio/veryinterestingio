			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, your answer helped a lot! But in the case of blackholes, how did that idea even first come up? Was it just a random coincidence that someone just chose to describe that particular setup of spacetime and it coincidentally turned out to actually exist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blackholes were a fallout of how general relatively models gravity. The math of general relatively <em>really</em> accurately modeled what we could observe at the time, better than any other model we had before. This suggests that the model is &quot;close&quot; to reality. But once you have the math, you can use it to predict what might happen in other cases that we haven't observed yet...that's what happened with black holes. We said, &quot;Hey, if this math model is right, and we get conditions such-and-such, this weird thing will show up.&quot; Then we went looking for the weird thing, and found it in reality.</p>
<p>It made other predictions, like frame dragging and geodetic effect, but it took several decades before we could build an instrument to measure them (a satellite called Gravity Probe B). Once we did, Gravity Probe B found exactly what was predicted. </p>
<p>The only reason, so far, to not think that general relativity is entirely correct is that it doesn't work at really small scales...it conflicts with quantum physics. Reconciling the two is THE big physics problem of our age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what you said, one prediction that Einstein's general relativity made was that the bending of spacetime from high gravity objects like the sun could bend light around it.  So if a star were known to be behind the edge of sun, you could see it.  Problem is, the sun produces a lot of its own light, so you'd have to wait for an eclipse to verify it.</p>
<p>Which is exactly they did on May 29, 1919.  They saw stars that would only be visible if light were being bent around the sun.  Giving strong evidence for general relativity as a good model.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;General relativity is right. It produces verifiable predictions and has stood up to every experimental test. The same can be said for quantum mechanics, perhaps even more so. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the context of GR, a basic black hole is actually not a particularly complicated object to describe mathematically. It was done by Karl Schwarzschild the same year Einstein published the theory. </p>
<p>Schwarzschild solved Einstein's equations for the case of a perfect sphere of mass. From a physics perspective, it makes a lot of sense to try this. The black hole part shows up when you take that sphere of mass and make it extremely small.</p>
<p>Schwarzschild did not know that such an object existed. Unlike with the wormhole though, a sphere of mass is a very good approximation of a lot of the things that exist out there in the universe, so it's not <em>so</em> crazy that black holes ended up being a real thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think it's quite what the joke is getting at in this instance, but this reminded me instantly of 'spherical cows in a vacuum'.  I guess I just find the idea that physicists instantly solving problems around perfect spheres amusing.  Probably makes sense for objects to be spheres at that intense mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to try and give a true ELI5 answer...</p>
<p>The idea for black holes didn't really &quot;come up&quot;, so to speak, in the way I think you mean.  Nobody really had the idea for a black hole and then tried to come up with math to describe/prove it.  Black holes just kind of &quot;popped out&quot; of the math as a natural consequence of messing with it.</p>
<p>What basically happened is Einstein came up with some equations.  Then he, and others, started playing with them to see what would happen.  Tweak a variable here, fudge another there, etc.  The terms of the equations correspond to physical characteristics of matter, energy, time, and space, so when you get an answer from them, that answer corresponds to some combination of those things (whether those combinations can actually exist in nature or not).</p>
<p>The equations can deal with what happens as you dump more and more matter into a given volume of space and what gravity will do with it, so to speak.  They observed that the density of matter in a volume of space increases as you dump more matter into it.  That's not exactly a surprise to anyone even before Einstein came into the picture.  But,  now, they saw that gravity increases as the density goes up (also not necessarily news to anyone, but now they had a mathematical way to play with the idea).</p>
<p>So, they (mathematically) kept dumping more and more matter into a given volume of space to see what would happen.  Eventually, they got to a point where the math was telling them that the force of gravity resulting from X amount of matter in Y volume of space was so great that it would overcome the subatomic forces.  Gravity would squeeze all that matter together despite all the other forces saying &quot;cut that crap out right this second!&quot;  </p>
<p>That X amount of matter in Y volume of space is what we call the Schwarzchild radius.  Put simply, that's how much matter has to occupy what volume of space so that gravitational collapse is inevitable.  Gravity will keep condensing that matter further and further and nothing can stop it.  Say goodbye to that matter, it ain't comin' back!</p>
<p>They played with the math some more and discovered that as the matter collapses, it inevitably leads to a point of infinite density that we call a singularity.  In truth, what really happens is the math basically breaks down at this point and starts giving seemingly nonsensical answers... &quot;a point of infinite density&quot; is how it's usually described, but that's mostly because we don't really know what it is and that's as close as our minds can get to a rational description.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could scientists have predicted something like a black hole just from the classical equation F=GMM/r^2 ? Presumably at a certain density that would also return numbers that would exceed subatomic forces.

<p>GR predicts wormholes in the extended Schwarzschild solution of an eternal black hole. This is how the concept of a wormhole was first discovered.</p>
<p>The full Schwarzschild solution consists of a black hole and a white hole counterpart, which is essentially the black hole but in the past. Between them is a wormhole that connects the universe with a parallel universe. The wormhole itself though closes faster than the speed of light so you can never traverse it. Later attempts at making a wormhole traversable, require negative mass to keep it open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out that white holes are a blatant violation of the second law of thermodynamics. The whole of thermodynamics is just statistics applied to large numbers of particles governed by mechanics. Technically, a single instance of a violation of the second law of thermodynamics doesn't actually break physics because thermodynamics is, again, a statistical theory. However, if the probability of something happening is less than 1 in 10^(1000) or so and yet it still happens, it's safe to assume you have your theory wrong. A logically equivalent statement is that is something has only 1 in 10^(1000) chance of happening, given that there is only so much energy in the universe and only so much time for things to happen, it will never happen if your theory is correct</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One could for example imagine a ball with negative mass that falls upwards like a balloon, except that a balloon only floats upwards because the surrounding air is even heavier, while a ball with negative mass would fall away from a planet into space even in a perfect vacuum.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that nothing in relativistic theory prevents such a ball from existing.</p>
<p>Like, if you try to use general relativity to calculate how an object faster than the speed of light would behave, all the formulas suddenly have bullshit results like infinity = 0, which are obviously wrong and thus demonstrate that objects moving faster than light are incompatible with relativity.</p>
<p>However, if you instead enter an object with negative mass into those same formulas, that doesn't happen. Instead, you get a bunch of perfectly valid, if somewhat unusual solutions.</p>
<p>Two of these solutions demonstrate that an object with negative mass could be used to create a stable wormhole, or an Alcubierre warp drive. The math says that's what would happen.</p>
<p>However, just because general relativity doesn't say that a ball with negative mass couldn't exist, doesn't mean anything with negative mass actually exists anywhere within our universe, or even that there isn't some other yet undiscovered natural law that proves that all mass must always be positive.</p></div>		</li>
