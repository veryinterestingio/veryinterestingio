			<div class="markdown"><p>Are those 90% mostly inactive or are they mostly for shared functions, as in, mammals have a heart, mammals have a brain and the rest ~10% is just a config file?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would take an expert on the matter to clarify this, but as I understand, these often quoted &quot;percentages&quot;, such as that we share 97% of our DNA with the Chimpanzees are somewhat of a misnomer. There are certain sections of DNA code that are compared through some specific and not exactly straightforward methods to arrive at that figure. It doesn't mean what the layperson thinks it does though. We don't actually share 97% of DNA with Chimpanzees. We might not share that much, overall, with another human being.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of these comments get at different ways to answer the question, but none have <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.huffpost.com/entry/surprising-way-your-neand_b_568455/amp" target="_blank">the most interesting argument</a>. LoPorto's angle may seem sensational, but it's worth putting out that his data is not wrong. The allele in question does come from Neanderthals, it is traceable to about 42,000 years ago, and it is associated with temperament. The most interesting argument is that Neanderthals gave us a totally different creative temperament. </p></div>		</li>
