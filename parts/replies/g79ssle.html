<p>I was on Kapiti island and one just cheerfully walked right up to within 10cm of me and stood there, waiting for me to eat it.</p>
<p>They're fat and juicy looking walking lunchboxes with no fear of humans.</p>
<p>I'm glad they've been preserved because they're special (and delightful)...but man they are not the fittest</p></div>		</li>

<p>They were fit for their environment until people came to New Zealand. Many birds in New Zealand had no natural predators, so there was no selective pressure for them to keep their instinct of fear of predation. Many bird species on isolated islands can have their populations easily decimated by introduction of various animals, snakes, rats, cats, or people to name a few, into their environment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A bird that flys off at every sound will use a lot of energy so need more food, and will have less time to find that food as it's flying off all the time.   On a small island with not much food that's a big disadvantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of animals with no species experience of contact with humans are trusting of us. As you get away from Africa, animals get more trusting, or at least they used to before we ate them all (macro fauna specially). African animals on the other hand, have survived us long term. They know we will eat them first chance we get...</p></div>		</li>
