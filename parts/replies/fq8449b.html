			<div class="markdown"><p>I vaguely recall a story of a man who was adrift at sea for a long period of time. He had water but no food. He was able to catch and eat raw fish and he noticed over time that he had a stronger and stronger urge to eat the eyes of the fish. He said he finally caved and ate raw fish eyes and it was the most delicious thing ever, presumably because they contained a vitamin that his body was critically lacking. </p>
<p>If anyone remembers better than I do and can post a link, Iâ€™d be grateful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes me think of My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George. The protagonist ran off and is living on his own in the mountains and at some point he an indescribable urge to eat the liver from a rabbit I think during winter. He later learns that it's full of vitamin C.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same story but reminds me of Antarctic explorers I think or just sailors lost at sea. There was a ship lost at sea w/European sailors and indigenous guides. They would collect rain water to drink and catch fish to eat. Eventually the European sailors started to scumb to scurvy while the indigenous guides were perfectly fine. The difference was the Europeans only ate the standard meat while the locals ate all the organs as well.</p></div>		</li>
