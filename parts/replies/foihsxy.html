<p>Let me ask you this: is there any truth to the idea of keeping ones microwave popcorn in the freezer? It is supposed to, I don't know, help every kernel pop or something.</p>
<p>What say you, microwave popcorn scientist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wait for 3 seconds. This results in pretty much perfect popcorn with about 10-15 unpopped kernels per bag.</p>
<p>I waited a little bit longer once, had 9 unpopped kernels but the popcorn was right on the verge of being burnt, like there was already some discoloration on some of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was the protégé of Sir Orville Redenbacher’s at Popcorn University and was his witness at his wedding with aunt Jemima. Credentials secured MFs. </p>
<p>So I had no idea about this. </p>
<p>Found out googling <a href="https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/house-home/food/10-foods-you-never-knew-you-should-freeze" target="_blank">this</a> </p>
<p>Basically it seems to make sense for home made popcorn but not so much for commercial packs. </p>
<p>Ice doesn’t react to microwaves. It has to melt first then be vaporized. That’s why the unfreeze sequence is so slow. </p>
<p>What can happen is that air humidity at room temperature will condense into water then freeze as ice if put below freezing point. This keeps water present and, once melted, may provide a faster more uniform humid and hot atmosphere for heating. Also kernels won’t individually lose humidity. </p>
<p>If stored in an open or unsealed bowl, kernels could dry and become impossible to heat up and pop. Which is probably prevented by freezing. </p>
<p>But commercial packs are sealed individually already and likely in protective atmosphere. And just store your kernels at home in an airtight Tupperware and you should achieve the same result. </p>
<p>There you go Hugo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I even out the kernals in the bag before it gets nuked and that seems to yield a lot less unpopped kernals. Nothing dramatic, probably a handful or two more of popped corn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat release by the first pop is used by nearby kernels to pop. When most kernels are pooped, heat accumulates, hence the burning.</p>
<p>Edit meant popped. Not pooped. But left there because funny.</p></div>		</li>
