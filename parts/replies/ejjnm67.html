			<div class="markdown"><p>Lake Pontchatrain in LA immediately comes to mind as an exception, but I’ve always been curious about these distinctions also because sometimes a “sea” is just a certain coastline or large bay... like the Andaman Sea or South China Sea (I’m typing without googling, did my memory brain work?). What makes those seas? Is it a geopolitical reason?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a borderline case, lake pontchartrain is an estuary with a very restricted connection to the gulf of mexico. Some seas or oceans with different names have no clear boundary between them but are useful for referring to broad areas, for example the arctic and atlantic oceans. Apparently the arctic ocean is sometimes regarded as a sea or even an estuary of the Atlantic ocean, although that last one seems like a bit of a stretch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is salt water that flows into the ocean, partially surrounded by land, it is a sea.  If it is surrounded on three sides it is considered a gulf, but the terms are not mutually exclusive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up: Is the Great Salt Lake in Utah a sea even though most people call it a lake (that I know from Utah, anyhow) and do lakes with artificially higher salinity due to human intervention (IIRC, Lake Michigan) become seas at a certain point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was born in Salt Lake! (The city, not the lake).  It is indeed a lake as it is landlocked.</p>
<p>You'll note I said lakes usually have fresh water because there are some exceptions.</p>
<p>When a lake doesn't have a natural outlet, salt will build up over time as it is carried in by water but does not evaporate out with the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally: The Black Sea is a sea that has been a lake in the past. It is currently connected to the Mediterranean and receives an inflow of salt water through the Dardanelles and Bosporus. During times of lower water levels, the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea were not connected and the Black Sea was effectively a lake. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically the Caspian Sea lake. The Caspian Sea is still its name, even if the words that make up its name would be incorrect were they used with their normal dictionary definitions. </p></div>		</li>
