			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup if you're like me, always wearing white shirt. The stain will turn yellow and hardens over time. I tried bleach, baking soda and scrub but it's very stubborn. However, I found an awesome deodorant that is aluminium free. Arm &amp; Hammer. Works like a charm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have that problem. For some people, switching to an aluminum-free deodorant (non-antiperspirant) works. But then I would sweat through all my shirts. </p>
<p>I switched to Certain Dri, which was the strongest antiperspirant I could find without a prescription. That actually stops most of my sweating, so it doesn't leave the stains because the aluminum chloride doesn't soak into the shirts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, same. The aluminum ones give me a painful and itchy rash, and the non-glycol ones make me smell worse than no deodorant at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, basically I can't use any &quot;natural&quot; or aluminum free deodorants because I get a nasty inflamed rash, too. Like, so bad my armpits swell up. I'm not allergic to anything (to my knowledge), but good lord was that a rude awakening. </p>
<p>And all of this was started because the women at work read these articles about how we are all going to get cancer and die from deodorant, so they all started using natural stuff and shaming those of us who didn't, and I certainly didn't want to die of armpit cancer, so I ran out and bought some to be cool like them. </p>
<p>And then my armpits turned into balloons and were bright red like I got armpit sunburn. </p>
<p>And then I started using Old Spice and told those women to go fuck themselves when they were like &quot;but caaaancccerr&quot; </p>
<p>I love Old Spice. Using Dragonblast right now. No rashes and I smell wonderful and not like candy or old lady flowers or baby powder. And my armpits love aluminum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer that Iâ€™m not a cancer scientist or anything. But inflammation is usually caused by damaged tissues, and one of the mechanisms for cancer is higher rates of replacement of damaged cells. So by avoiding inflaming your armpits you might be avoiding <em>that</em> risk of cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of those natural ones are harsh! The aluminum ones give me contact dermatitis so my nurse practitioner recommended I stop using those. There was one with citrus oil so strong it exfoliated a whole layer off my skin after two uses. It peeled off like after sunburn. Others were so rough that they manually irritated me, if not chemically.</p>
<p>I ended up finding the best one for me was an aluminum free but not-natural deodorant ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may want to be wary around any sexual lubricants then since PG is the base for a lot of common cheaper ones. Same with vape juice and a ton of foods. You could have a PG allergy and it's so common in many things these days that it's easy to be exposed without knowing. But it's just that, a base. The PG is rather inert and doesn't have much of an effect itself, so whatever deodorant you used with PG in it was just using it as a base for whatever the active ingredient was. And if you aren't having allergic reactions left and right from all the many PG containing products nowadays, it's more likely that you had a bad reaction to whatever the active ingredient in that brand of deodorant was. </p>
<p>My local grocery store has their own brand of super-value cheap crap products and once I bought some powdered donuts from them thinking there was no way they could screw those up. Main incredient of the powdered sugar coating? Propylene Glycol. The donuts left a coating of lube all inside my mouth that then started blocking my ability to taste their terribly shitty donuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deodorant and antiperspirant are two different things. Deodorant works by suppressing the bacteria that cause the smell. Antiperspirant works by clogging your sweat glands so there is less for the bacteria to live on.</p></div>		</li>
