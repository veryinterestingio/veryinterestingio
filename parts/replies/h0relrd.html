			<div class="markdown"><p>Phone phreaking was definitely a thing. The dail up internet sounds were just binary. People could get free long distance calls by just playing a certain tone. You can even 3d print a whistle that makes the perfect sounds. It has a name but I forget. If I find it I'll update.</p>
<p>Edit: they used the 2600 Hz to get past the companies.</p>
<p>Edit2:spelling pheaking to phreaking thank you @Lethalmindninja @MuricanA321</p>
<p>EDIT: Most of my information is not 100% correct here is a better resource <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking" target="_blank">phreaking wiki</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Nothing to do with dialup. </p>
<p>What you would do is call a 1-800 number. Your local exchange would use a trunk line to call the 1-800's exchange and that would call the local number.</p>
<p>Then you would play the the 2600 Hz tone, which the remote exchange would interpret as your local exchange hanging up, but your local exchange would still think you are calling the 1-800 number and not bill you.</p>
<p>You then find yourself dropped into the trunk line, and you could dial any number, pretending that you were the local exchange routing a long-distance call.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's why where I lived, you had to hang up and the operator would call you back.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wasn't that T-Mobile strategy in 2019. People don't choose carriers based on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being a voip engineer coming from a country (Italy) where it's illegal to originate calls from a number that's not tied to that line and with providers actively rewriting your caller id if it's not in the allowed range I am always appalled by the fact that someone thought to allow people to spoof their number and in the entire chain of command no one thought that maybe, <em>maybe</em>, someone would misuse it</p></div>		</li>
