			<div class="markdown"><p>I found a study which shows even higher (65%) concordance for identical twins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thirty-eight pairs of monozygotic twins (34 male pairs and 4 female pairs) were found to have a concordance rate of 65.8% for homosexual orientation. Twenty-three pairs of dizygotic twins were found to have a concordance rate of 30.4% for homosexual orientation.</p>

<p>Based on these numbers, you can calculate the heritability of homosexuality to h = 2(0.65 - 0.30) = 70%. This means that 70% of the variance is genetic (roughly the same as type 1 diabetes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great source. I would also like to see the results in an adoption study that looks at twins raised in different environments. Just to clarify questions about whether the similar results are related to environmental influence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because identical twins are also raised in the same environment at the same time and experience a lot of the same developmental factors.</p>
<p>And exposure to hormones in the womb are also the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Discovering Behavioral Neuroscience: An introduction to Biologocal psychology by Dr. Laura Freberg.  It's a textbook so I can't just link it.  I also rented it so I can't see if there was a source mentioned in the textbook.  I know for general gay/bi rates it's from CDC studies but I don't remember the twin source.  It's probably different.</p>
<p>Homosexuality is primarily based on prenatal hormone environment, which is why fraternal twins share such a high rate. There is a genetic component but it isn't clear cut, we know there's something genetic going on, but we don't know exactly what.  We haven't tracked down any gene(s) involved and we don't understand the mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some evidence that it is epigenetic rather than genetic. For instance, A mother's second born male child is more likely to be gay than the firstborn male child. That brings up all kinds of questions about evolution and whether homosexuality plays a role in moderating competition amongst males.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am blown away by the fraternal twins stat, if true.</p>
<p>Genetically, fraternal twins are just (full) brothers. If nevertheless the 25% is correct, that would mean something really relevant happens during early development that they share (probably during pregnancy).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Data we have on fraternal twins in the womb suggests that it’s stuff like exposure to hormones from the other twin (biologically speaking, trans-acting agents), more so than <em>just</em> the genetic basis of the individual twin and what their cis-acting hormones are doing. </p>
<p>Given that hormones direct the assembly of, well, all of you that makes sense, but when it comes to dev. bio. I’m thinking specifically of how sex hormones pattern the brain.</p>
<p>Gay twin studies are <em>cool</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot happens in the womb.  We don't fully understand it, but it appears to be related a lot to prenatal hormone environment.  A lot of the markers we have for that (and just the random ass differences between men and women) show differences between gay/bi/straight individuals.</p>
<p>We can actually mess around with this stuff with rats (prenatal development actually continues a bit after birth) and get some interesting results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some factors during gestation and/or genetics that play a factor, but they are very poorly understood. Handful of unclear and somewhat conflicting studies. It’s a delicate line to walk as homosexuality used to be considered a mental illness, and much of the research is tainted with that perspective.</p>
<p>Homosexuality is ~2% to 10% in general population, depending on source and how you ask the question. There is still a large stigma, for example there are many men who answer yes to “prefer sex with men” but would not self-identify as “gay.”</p></div>		</li>

<p>So you, a man, prefer to have other men for your sexual partners. Therefore, you must be gay.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the issue of a sexuality spectra; and where people choose to draw the lines between different sexualities. Assuming a male subject (same is true for female, but in reverse. Also: using male/female because this applies equally to boys/girls and men/women), if they prefer ONLY female partners, they're clearly heterosexual, and if they prefer ONLY male partners, they're clearly homosexual.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But what if it's not &quot;only&quot;. Suppose our subject is sexually attracted to 1 in 100 women, and 1 in 1 000 000 men: he is clearly more heterosexual than homosexual; but is it enough to count him as bisexual? What if the numbers are 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10 000 000? Does any of that change if he happens to run into one of those males right at a key point in his life, and ends up dating said partner for a long time - or marrying the partner?</p>
<p>There's no standardized set of scientific definitions of what &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;straight&quot; mean. To make things worse for scientists, there's a lot of disagreement about what they mean in society: I've heard definitions including &quot;You're gay if you say you are&quot;; &quot;You're only gay if you like giving (being penetrated in) anal sex&quot;; &quot;You're not gay unless you've married a man&quot;; and &quot;You can't be gay if you've had sex with a woman&quot;. And those all specify &quot;gay&quot; to mean &quot;male homosexual&quot; - there's a huge mess of other definitions for lesbians - and many leave out the entire idea of bisexuality.</p></div>		</li>
