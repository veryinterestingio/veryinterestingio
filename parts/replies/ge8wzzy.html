			<div class="markdown"><p>That is way overkill.</p>
<p>The US law mandates that emails have one click unsubscribe links too.</p>
<p>Sometimes it will just unsubscribe you from one email lists so you need an extra step to do it globally, but it works 95% of the time from any semi legitimate company. </p>
<p>Many companies won't remove you from email lists from hitting the spam button so you could still receive emails from them.</p>
<p>To stop unwanted emails it is better to first try unsubscribing and then mark as spam if that doesn't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because the unsubscribe link behaves differently in Europe.</p>
<p>Before GDPR, when you clicked unsubscribe, you then were directed to a webpage where you'd make the changes.</p>
<p>Now, in Europe and according to GDPR, when you click unsubscribe, in order for the website to be compliant no extra settings need to be changed, the unsubscribe action needs to be one click.</p>
<p>Using a VPN might trick the unsubscribe website to apply the GDPR rules and unsubscribe without extra stuff like &quot;only from this kind of email but not from all others, we'll still send those&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I'm in Sweden, part of EU having this GDPR regulation.</p>
<p>Some none EU based companies still makes me click multiple times to unsub stuff. But I usually unsub once and then if it appears again I mark it as spam in Gmail, giving them hell sending to Gmail in the future (if multiple reports come in).</p></div>		</li>
