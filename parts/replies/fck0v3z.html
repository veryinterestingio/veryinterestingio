<p>I thought I just hated mexican food forever until I learned to ask for no cilantro. A whole new world opened up in regards to salsa</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my exact story! I used to despise mexican food, until one day I went to a friends house and was in love with the tacos. I told my mom, who asked the friend's family for the recipe. That's when she realized I hated cilantro. My uncle (mom's bro) also despised cilantro, and my mom knew to leave it out for him. I still don't get why it never occurred to her before, since everytime I complained that the dishes still had soap on them and it was ruining everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FINALLY I have an explanation for why the rest of the world seemed crazy.  I'll pick cilantro out of anything that contains it.  It comes very close to triggering my gag reflex, and people look at me like I'm being too dramatic.  &quot;No Karen, it's like some kind of mixture of soap, metal shavings, and mint!&quot;  I couldn't understand why anybody likes it... but now I know, I'm some kind of genetic freak that tastes stuff in it that others don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>‘Soap, metal shavings and mint’ - best description of this vile taste I’ve yet seen. Horrible stuff and it turns up everywhere - yet, despite lots of people hating the taste of coriander (leaf) almost no restaurant mentions if it is used.</p></div>		</li>
