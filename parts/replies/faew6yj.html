			<div class="markdown"><p>For those wondering (to give it the LI5 touch): When music is recorded, it's typically done with each instrument (and vocals) having at least one microphone assigned to it. In some cases - drums, for example - they'll have multiple mics on a single instrument. Each microphone is assigned a track, which can be adjusted during recording.</p>
<p>What mixing does is take all the tracks from the recording of a song, and combine them into something coherent. That includes examining and taking what are the best takes of a segment of the song and putting them in the mix. Throughout all this, they're editing these segments and making adjustments to their sound - say a vocal track might be pushed up so it could be heard more clearly over the instruments, its EQ balance made to make their voice fit to the song.</p>
<p>The mix is then delivered to an engineer for mastering. What mastering does is take the mix - which comes in the form a single file, a series of files representing each track, or a smaller set of files called &quot;stems&quot; that combines similar sounding or range tracks into a single file - and polish it further until it becomes a functional song. The adjustments made in mastering are less technical and more creative - example, what genre is this song, and what should it sound like? In doing so, the mix becomes something more polished and complete in form.</p>
<p>To put it into a analogy, using video game development terminology: Mixing turns all the components made for a game into a functional beta, which is then handed to mastering engineers (or QA testers) to iron out the bugs and turn it into something that can be shipped.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is all true, it wasn't at all like that in the 50s and 60s during the era OP is referring to.  In those days entire orchestras might be recorded with three tape  tracks leaving room for a mixdown and an overdub, and there was almost no option for real mastering, you were more or less recording everything live.  </p>
<p>Possibly what OP is talking about is partially due to physical echo chambers to create reverb.  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber</a>  </p>
<p>These chambers would produce an airy echo on the recording.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is in mixing they're adjusting things on each track (what each microphone records or each instrument or whatever) individually. In mastering all of the tracks have already been combined into one audio track, and you're just adjusting the whole thing together. So in mixing I might decide my guitar sounds muddy but my vocals sound way to sharp and bright. I could turn down the bass frequencies and turn up treble for just the guitar track and do the opposite to the vocal track so the song sounds better. Once you're at the mastering stage you'd only be able to make those adjustments to the entire song, so I'd only be able to make the guitar sound less muddy but make the vocals sound even more sharp/bright and crappy, or vice versa.</p>
<p>So basically the mixing makes all of the recordings a coherent song where everything sounds good together. The mastering makes it sound good on your speakers when you play the song.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mastering is more like solidifying the overall mix. So mixing is adjusting each element/instrument. Mastering is gluing the whole thing together. You’re working on the overall sound and how it’s gonna sound altogether when you’re mastering, rather than individual sounds in the song.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The adjustments made in mastering are MORE technical and LESS creative. Mastering on Vinyl is an involved process because the distribution of frequencies (mostly bass) affects the width of the grooves. Nowadays you would consider mastering more about getting an acceptable tonal balance on consumer playback devices but it also incorporates elements such as normalization for streaming platforms or optimization for various compression formats.</p>
<p>General tonal balance and creative master bus effects should be applied in the mixing stage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^ This is probably the most knowledgeable comment here</p>
<p>I’ve worked in pro studios for decades, and the simple answer honestly (in my opinion) is that analog recording gives more body, thickness, breadth to something with as wide a dynamic range as vocals</p>
<p>citing CSNY was a good example to use. </p>
<p>another answer is that music was more influenced by psychedelics and cannabis back then, cocaine later — these dramatically affect your hearing. psychedelics sensitize your hearing, cocaine dampens hi-frequency response and engineers wind up making brighter, sometimes unwittingly ‘harsher’, thinner mixes.  and before arguing that this seems ..biased, I was told this by serious producers and engineers when I was training as an apprentice, it’s a thing one needed to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great episode! Listening now. I've been producing music for 10 years and have worked with several mastering engineers and tried to learn as much as I can, but in some senses I feel like a kid at the window of a toy shop - I have a grasp of what's going on in mastering but it takes so much practice</p></div>		</li>
