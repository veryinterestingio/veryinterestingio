			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, I almost never saw my dad wear jeans until he retired, even on “casual” Fridays.  His mother had fallen in social class as a child in the depression (Her family had owned several stores in Oklahoma where all the farmers bought goods on credit when the crash/dust bowl (think of their customers as The Grapes of Wrath type folks) occurred), and she had a strong middle-class self-consciousness in the 50s while raising my dad. She told him that only farmers wore jeans.</p>
<p>Even in the 90s when my parents were raising us, my parents had a hard time letting us wear jeans. We looked pretty nerdy at school as we were always over-dressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in Eastern Europe if you had &quot;jeans&quot; any other color than blue it was considered cheaper/not &quot;original&quot;. My dad, born in 50s, told many times a story how he worked in construction his whole summer during high school to save enough to buy some brand name blue jeans, but his mom took his money as they were building a house, bough him some cheap pants and used the rest of the money to pay for plumbing in the house. He is still salty about that :). There was also a term &quot;russian threesome&quot; popular in the 70s and 80s (it's when two people are having sex and the third one is guarding the jeans from thieves)</p></div>		</li>

<p>blue dye was the cheapest</p>

<p>Heh, not too long into the past when blue was one of the most expensive dies there was. Hence The Virgin Mary is usually painted blue because the pigments were so expensive therefore her depiction received the highest reverence.</p>
<p>EDIT: See below re: clarification of stuff used for dyeing clothes vs paint pigment.</p>
<p>Still - the associations with the colour blue in art and prestige were sown hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>EDIT2: The art I'm referring to is medieval art from \~800-1400s. Well before pigments were readily &amp; cheaply imported from the east.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's always a matter of a hue and intensity.  </p>
<p>Blue: Woad was cheap, as were a number of other dyes that produced a pale blue colour. Indigo was expensive as hell (until the british east india company started importing it in great quantities).</p>
<p>Purples: Madder/woad dye was cheap, as was dyes made from Lichen or purple root. Tyrian purple/imperial purple was among the most expensive of dyes (made from secretions of the Murex-family of seasnails. Approximately 14000 snails are needed for a single garment).</p>
<p>Reds: Madder or lichen reds were cheap. Crimson was expensive as hell (made from crushing the shells of a species of insects that only live on Kermes oaks).</p>
<p>Yellows and green were usually quite cheap, although a really vibrant and durable green wouldn't be invented until the middle ages (Lincoln green).  </p>
<p>All of this changed between the mid-19th century and the early 20th century as imports became cheaper and synthetics dyes were developed (the invention and production of synthetic dyes was one of the key exports that propelled Germany into becoming a great power).</p></div>		</li>

<p>At the time, even though I read all the stuff and put it into my own words, I didn't really have a context for the significance of his work. </p>
<p>Thirty years later, you'd be surprised at how it periodically comes up and I am able to connect that information from way back when to something that's being discussed now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass trade of purple dye was expensive in the ancient days because only the Phoenicians of modern day Lebanon had the technique of creating the dye from seashells of dead molluscs. They got their name, meaning the Red People from this dye.</p>
<p>So purple began to indicate wealth as they had the lock on purple dues and didn't need to worry about competitors. Being amazing traders, seafarers and navigators (credited with the North Star discovery) they reached far and wide to sell this fine dye. Hence purple on royal robes, on christian priests everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For this reason, the pigment made from lapis lazuli was called <em>ultramarine.</em> Not because it was &quot;extremely blue&quot;--in Latin, <em>ultramarinus</em> literally means &quot;beyond the sea&quot;. To them, it came from an unknown place unimaginably distant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.woad.org.uk/html/woad_extraction.html" target="_blank">It's a chemical process</a>. The pigment precursor is contained in the leaves.</p></div>		</li>
