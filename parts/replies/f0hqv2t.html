<p>I think we have an IPhone situation here: &quot;Most people do not want an IPhone, and do not see the benefits of a touchscreen on a phone! They are so used to texting the usual way, that this alone is reason enough why this type of phone will take years to take over, if it ever does...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most people do not want an IPad, and do not see the benefit of what is merely a bigger IPhone. A tablet is not useful in any particular way, and its size is such a drawback in iteslf that it will never have mainstream appeal...&quot;</p>
<p>And so on. Sometimes people do not know what they want, until it is there, and they can have it. They underestimate benefits which are hard to explain: &quot;The interface on a touchscreen is intuitive? So what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean when you say that reading on a tablet is more comfortable than on the usual screen or phone? That makes a difference?&quot;</p>
<p>And they overestimate potential drawbacks: &quot;You can't even type well on those touchscreens, and they are a pretty unreliable and narrow input device!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But a tablet really is much bigger than a smartphone, and I can't see how it wouldn't just constantly be a major inconvenience...&quot;</p>
<p>Same thing here: I suspect, when it actually happens, most people wouldn't mind one bit to be &quot;deceived&quot; by a nice and friendly robot. In a professional environment, <em>nobody</em> will mind, as those robots in this video here are more friendly and accommodating than many real customers. Some people <em>think</em> they would mind, for some reason, and are overestimating potential drawbacks.</p>
<p>And they underestimate the comfort of delegating simple tasks involving human interaction to someone else, who can reliably perform them. Even if that someone is a robot. They underestimate the improvement in quality of life you can get from this ability to delegate.</p>
<p>tl;dr: This is an IPhone situation: People will probably not know that that they want this, until it is here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The full theory goes that as a non human robot (something distinctly not human, like a roomba) gains more human features (eyes, a face, and so on) we tend to enjoy it more.  So we're indifferent to a Roomba because its basically a circle that cleans floors, but slap googly eyes on it and we'll treat it like a pet, give it a robot voice saying it loves eating dust and we'll chat with it and give it a name.  Till it hits a certain point where it almost, but not quite, looks like a human, at which point we're creeped out and repulsed by the robot. For instance, if you made that Roomba into a perfectly shaped human, but it still sucked dirt off the floor, we'll be kinda freaked out about it.  Presumably, once we can no longer tell the diffrence between a robot and a human on an subconscious or conscious level, we would treat said robot exactly like any human.  This includes subtle things - like how exactly it behaves, talks, or walks.</p>
<p>The working theory behind the phenomenon is that as something becomes more human, we subconsciously associate more human characteristics to it.  It'll it hits a point were we subconsciously we identify it as human, but a human with something horribly wrong.  As social animals, when we see another human in distress, it also subtly makes us feel uneasy as well. </p>
<p>Going back to the human roomba example, imagine how you would react if you saw your mom (or any adult you care about) crawling along the floor licking it.  You would pretty much immediately freak out, probably try to get them to a doctor, maybe even suspect they had some horrible brain disease or parasite. At the very least you would express your disgust with them (if they stopped immediately and showed signs of embarrassment, like you caught them jerking off)   We dont do that with human like robots - because we know they're robots- but subconsciously the same alarm bells are ringing.  And that freaks us out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for clarificarion, the valley doesnt describe a spot on an axe in terms of progress but a psychological one. Its the place between things being normal and things being scary. Think of a teddy bear with a full set of teath in his mouth. Its the feeling of something being off in a scary way, but not being sure what it is.</p></div>		</li>
