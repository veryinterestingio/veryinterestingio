The infected cells detect something weird is happening and produce interferon which activates macrophage which produces cytokines and the neighboring cells go into &quot;interferon defense state&quot; where they activate the many <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22328912" target="_blank">interferon stimulated genes</a> with a broad and complex antiviral activity targeting all the intracellular metabolism (also recruiting immune cells but this is the secondary effect). It is the only way to stop the infection at its early stage if no specific antibodies had been produced during a primary infection a few years before, thus it is the best way to get infected and show almost no symptoms then no antibodies.</p></div>		</li>
