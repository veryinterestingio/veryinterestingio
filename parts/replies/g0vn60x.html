<p>People who worked on the Manhattan Project and handled plutonium had to have an annual urine test for medical research; they had a social organization called the IPPu Society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from St. George and have talked to several downwinders. It wasn't just accidental. Children were given Geiger counter badges and encouraged to sit on the roofs of their homes to watch the mushroom clouds from the Nevada Test Site. It's supremely fucked up. There are still Downwinder survivors today, but the legislation to pay them for the damage done to them is coming to and end and they will lose the compensation they need.</p>
<p>This wasn't one incident either, it went on for years. Like, outside of Japan, and Kazakhstan, Utah likely has the highest death count from nuclear weapons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/civil/common/reca" target="_blank">https://www.justice.gov/civil/common/reca</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act was passed on October 5, 1990.</p>
<p>RECA establishes lump sum compensation awards for individuals who contracted specified diseases in three defined populations:</p>
<p>Uranium Miners, Millers, and Ore Transporters may be eligible for one-time, lump sum compensation of $100,000.</p>
<p>“Onsite Participants” at atmospheric nuclear weapons tests may be eligible for one-time, lump sum compensation of up to $75,000.</p>
<p>Individuals who lived downwind of the Nevada Test Site (“Downwinders&quot;) may be eligible for one-time, lump sum compensation of $50,000.</p>

<p>1990 adjusting for inflation would less than double these amounts.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I mentioned this a few weeks ago but it was pointed out to me that it's actually it's just cheaper to melt down a few lifted wrecks for the occasional, sensitive component but if we want to dig a whole load of fresh ore up and put it through a fresh mill that hasn't been contaminated we could have as much uncontaminated steel as we want. It's just not worth it yet.</p>
<p>E: Since this has lots of up-doots, let me say for the benefit of those not digging down, that other users have pointed out that the air is the problem, not the steel / ore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is the existing steel making process uses oxygen derived from atmospheric air which is tainted with radionuclides. There is also the additional factor that there are quantities of steel tainted with cobalt-60 during careless handling and accidents involving the material. </p>
<p>So even if you construct an uncontaminated processing facility, you still need to obtain enough untainted oxygen to make such a facility worthwhile. </p>
<p>Atmpsheric background radiation peaked sometime in the mid '60's and has been decreasing ever since so I assume, barring any other radioactive nonsense, we'll get it down to a level that makes said steel useful for that purpose. </p>
<p>Not an expert on the topic, I get bored at work and listen to a lot of history and science channels that cover this topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that newly smelted steel gets contaminated from radioactive particles in the vast amount of atmospheric air that is used in the smelting process, rather than direct contamination of ore, or from processing equipment.</p>
<p>We can get uncontaminated ore, but there's no source of uncontaminated air.</p></div>		</li>
