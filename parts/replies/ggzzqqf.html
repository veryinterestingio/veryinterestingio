			<div class="markdown"><p>As an OT, I was looking for the OT to chime in and explain!</p>
<p>I like to explain proprioception as the stretch on ligaments, muscles, and tendons, the feeling of gravity's effects in the body, the way the ground or surface pushes back against you. </p>
<p>Weighted blankets increase the surface area of push and pull on the body, giving us more information about our body and position, increasing calm and reassurance. Some people seek more of this sensory input and find it more organizing than others do. Other strategies to increase proprioception including pushing activities, heavy resistance exercise, joint compression, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is totally different from vestibular input, correct?</p>
<p>My little guy has ASD, and heâ€™ll just spin and spin and spin. Loves to be upside down. He got a weighted vest and blanket for Christmas, and weâ€™re very excited to see what they do for him. I believe (probably wrongly) that his sensory issues are one of the causes of his seizures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Vestibular sensation is the sensation of your head position, so it senses movement, falling, spinning, being inverted, etc. It is caused by crystals inside a coiled matrix within the inner ear. When gravity moves the crystals, the brain senses movement of the head position. </p>
<p>Sometimes kids with ASD seek a lot of vestibular movement like spinning, but that is actually really activating and arousing and sometimes it never really gets satisfied. Some of those kids do really well with more rocking/swaying as well as deep pressure. Lycra swings or hammocks can be helpful. </p>
<p>I don't know a lot about sensory issues and seizure activity, unfortunately. Pediatrics isn't my current area of practice. </p>
<p>Good luck to you and your little guy!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's fascinating. Is heavy resistance exercise used to increase proprioception during the exercise only or is it felt after the exercise as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: The science of weighted blankets is not clear. However, it is an easy thing to do with almost no associated risks. Many people find it helpful, so give it a try.</p>
<p>Hi, OT professor here to add some context. Weighted blankets do not predominantly activate the proprioceptive sense because proprioception requires resistance across joints that then puts your tendons on stretch. That's an oversimplified explanation, but the gist is that lying with a weighted blanket on you does not tell your body where it is in space because the pressure is mostly just pushing on your chest and is a deep touch sensation. If you are standing with the weighted blanket, you could argue this adds tension to your lower limb joints to create proprioceptive input. However, most people sleep with these blankets, not walk around. The empirical evidence is very much not clear around how deep touch through weighted blankets reduces anxiety. This type of research falls under a theory called Sensory Integration. The theory tells us that each person's nervous system has different sensitivities to each human sense. If the system is easily excited then too much of this sense is overwhelming. If the system is difficult to excite then the sense needs a lot of input to register. Humans are best regulated when they get an amount of sensation that matches with this set point. Also that certain sensations, when activated, tend to cause increase or decreased general arousal. The theory is that deep touch is calming and light touch activating. This is something that is just anecdotally observed, not explained neurologically. The most recent systematic reviews on sensory integration therapy that I am aware of (authored by a colleague) were inconclusive for the roll of general sensory integration therapy. Multiple individual studies I can think of have investigated deep touch through weighted vests or blankets, but in general they are small of sample size and low level evidence. I am on my phone right now, but if you want some references I can find them later. However, deep touch being calming is observable anecdotally for many people and bares almost no risk. We can make conjecture about why this is, for e.g. it simulates a hug and therefor activates oxytocin, but that is not necessarily a scientific explanation so much as intuition.</p></div>		</li>
