<p>-2.75 on both for my contact lenses if that makes a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your dad was likely myopic. A lot of my myopic patients find an improvement in their vision once they hit their 40s/50s due to how the eye changes with presbyopia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My vision improved for a couple of years, or at least the near-sightedness part did. The next exam I was told I had cataracts. The doctor said that improved vision (other than the cloudiness) was a result of the cataracts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually rare instances when this happens.  One of those instances has been described,  and even a movie was based upon the story. The protagonist had every measure of his well being improve over the years. A very curious case. I believe his name was Button. Benjamin Button.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they do, but it usually happens for older people. For example, my dad’s vision has gotten better during the last few years.</p>
<p>It very rarely happens for younger people though, I’m willing to bet the ”improvement” in your eyes was just a measurement difference. The same thing happened to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I could upvote you more than once. The amount of misinformation in this thread is shocking, even from people who claim to work in or be in school for medicine/ophthalmology/optometry. You have covered the most common causes and with accuracy. Thank you!!</p></div>		</li>
