			<div class="markdown"><p>we also tie knots at the top, so we can loosen them fully without them slipping out of their loops. I'm pretty sure they come that way actually, I've never seen someone without them knotted and I don't remember having ever knotted mine. Iunno i've been in these boots for like 5 years lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely had to tie the knots on the end of my laces. And my boots were always a pain to get on and off. All 3 different pairs.  Never have they ever been easy to slip in or out of so you guys must have had some secret boots I didn't know about lol. Unless you had the ones with the zippers on the side. Unfortunately I never got those.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Had to buy my own but it's just instant, and you don't have to do weird shit to tuck away all the excess lace left over after you finish, because it's already tucked from when you tied it last year</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're likely not loosening low enough. You want to loosen boot laces below the curve of the boot. If you stop in/at the curve, the lower portion still has pressure on your foot. Properly fitted boots are easy to out on and take off. Could also be a sizing issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>even more helpful is to tie a knot in the center of the lace - it won't slide out past the bottom most eyelets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the comment I was looking for all the way down here where it won't get noticed.   Because you have the right answer.  It is super easy to get your boots loosened and slipped off with the knots and speed laces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a pair of rocky's that came with super high speed paracord laces. They were a real son of a bitch to get off. Swapped those laces for the ones from my boots in basic (I think kiwi makes them, they're skinny and kind of sharp). Never looked back. Super easy to get on and off. </p></div>		</li>
