			<div class="markdown"><p>Silicon is the low hanging fruit if you've studied general chemistry but actually in many ways less similar to carbon than something like nitrogen. The molecules being much more bulky and having more diffuse outer orbitals leads Si-Si double bonds to be very unstable and triple bonds to be basically unheard of. Additionally silicon compounds are much more prone to forming clusters more akin to boranes than carbon systems so the chemistry of any silicon based life would have to be very very different than that of carbon. </p>
<p>Also carbon largely only ever forms 4 bonds not due to the mythical octet rule but the fact that it's small. Silicon compounds can easily form many more bonds as is displayed in compounds like SiF_6.</p>
<p>Another issue is that silicon is higher in metallic character and as a result tends to form much more ionic bonds, which are generally more subject to attack from outside chemicals than the strong covalent bonds carbon compounds tend towards. </p>
<p>And that's not even to mention the fact that you'd have to have a huge supply of silicon which is vastly less likely than a smaller element like carbon.</p>
<p>All told, I personally think there's likely more support for nitrogen or boron based life than silicon based just based off the chemistry. Any non carbon based type would have to be fairly drastically different, but silicon just has a lot more problems with it than people tend to think.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Silicon based life is overrated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well boranes are very interesting in that like I said they form clusters that tend to sort of open up as more electrons are added to them since boron is known for forming electron deficient compounds. What's interesting to me about this is that these clusters readily substitute borons for other atoms like carbons and nitrogen's which can vary the properties significantly. </p>
<p>Nitrogen systems have the issue of nitrogen having a much higher electronegativity than carbon which could pose some major problems, but interestingly azanes exist which are basically the nitrogen analogs of hydrocarbons and can form chains and rings much the way carbon does. This would likely be more akin to carbon based life than the boranes idea but in reality it seems like it'd just be a shittier version of carbon based life and likely require carbon anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen this presented from a physical chemistry perspective based on bond energies... essentially the relative strengths of the possible chemical bonds is much more even in carbon-based molecules, meaning you get a large variety of different possibilities (C-C, C=C, C-O, C=O, etc.) which is necessary for forming the basis of life.</p>
<p>However, for silicon the Si-O bond is relatively much stronger, meaning that extended -Si-O-Si-O- structures are formed rather than small molecules.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: I may have butchered the details of the explanation but the overall gist is right).</p>
<p>My question is whether in other environments (e.g. other planets?) the atmospheric temperature and pressure coukd favour silicon-based life over carbon?</p></div>		</li>
