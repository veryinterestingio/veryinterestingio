			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh totally!</p>
<p>Imo a huge part in my life was to understand that I have to (learn to) manage my whole being into, what could be described as, harmony/peace or at least actively moving in that direction.</p>
<p>Jordan Peterson's lectures and his talks (as in the events he hosted in the tours for both his books) taught me so much obvious but not always simple truth about being human, especially in these times (21. Century that is), that really flew under my radar.</p>
<p>I will always be incredibly thankful for that. Lord knows humanity really needed to, and still does hear this mans words.</p>
<p>So gladthat he is recovering and not already gone for good q.q</p>
<p>peace</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ted is unconscious under a table because he started a bar fight.</p></div>		</li>
