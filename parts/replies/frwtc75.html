			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi OP. I’d like add that you should try a good hand-made soap. Mass manufactured soaps are detergents but soap made with lye (sodium hydroxide) is actual soap. Hand made soaps or any “good” soap will be full of glycerine, a natural humectant. Humectants are what preserve moisture in your skin. </p>
<p>I buy my soap from a local manufacturer in my area. All I use is bar soap and I never get that weird feeling like I did with the “big brands.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanna chime in and say that I used to feel the same as OP about bar soap and avoided them for most of my life. I decided to try out some non-mainstream soap that kept seeing on the web being advertised as &quot;hand-made&quot; (pretty obviously targeted ads hitting my demographic), and was pleasantly surprised that it felt really great to use. Dunno how &quot;hand-made&quot; it really is, but I honestly kinda prefer it to liquid soap at this point.</p>
<p>I won't name-drop the brand, because (A) I don't want to look like I'm shilling for them and (B) it's fuckin soap, buy whichever &quot;hand-made/natural&quot; soap appeals to you the most, they're all basically made the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't happen with good soap, liquid or solid. If your hands feel squeaky, that's a sign to change products imo. </p>
<p>Also this applies ESPECIALLY if this happens with a body soap. It won't exactly do any damage, but it will dry out your skin more. However they can do &quot;damage&quot; if you clean your privates with them, especially as a female. Make sure the pH is balanced (3.5 before adding water is optimal, 5.5 is the highest a body soap should be), that it does not contain perfumes or dyes and that it only uses mild emulsifiers. Products containing lactic acid are the best for your entire body.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What if I use bar soap for that squeaky feeling. I'm an oily mofo and washing my face and hand with bar soap is the only way to 'feel clean'. Is that unhealthy for my skin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soaps are universally basic not acidic (the saponification process produces alkali salts), handmade bar soap has a pH range of 7-10 after the lye has completely reacted with the oil/fat source.</p></div>		</li>
