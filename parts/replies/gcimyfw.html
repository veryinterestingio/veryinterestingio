			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you want to know for personal use? I've personally Charmin, Scott, and the one I use now in a jar of water with some light shaking. Charmin was pretty intact, while Scott eventually broke down. The one I use now blew the two out of the water. Not literally, but almost. It's not American. It is manufactured in another first world country with smaller pipes and a lot more people per area, so it really has to break down. These wipes literally break down after a couple seconds of shaking in just a jar of water. They aren't the cheapest or the most durable (for obvious reasons), but they definitely break down. They're about $10 for a 3 pack of 64 wipes on Amazon. PM me if you wanna know (I gotta keep my supply safe).</p></div>		</li>
