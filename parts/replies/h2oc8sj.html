			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has built and slept in an igloo I'll say they get very warm inside.  It got to the point where I couldn't stand being in my sleeping bag anymore and had to unzip it.  The inside will start to melt a little so you have to make sure it is smooth so the drops run down the sides inside of dripping.  Getting in and out of an igloo though is like crawling in a sink trap so you have to put all your clothes back on to slither in and out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The curved pipe under your sink that prevents odors from coming back out.  In an igloo you don't make an entrance straight into it, you make one that goes down, under the wall, then back up.  That way you trap the warm air inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the &quot;U&quot; or &quot;S&quot; (if the S was on its side) shaped pipe at the bottom of the drain.</p>
<p>This keeps a low area filled with water even if you don't run the sink in a long time, which acts as a seal against sewer gas coming back up through the plumbing system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also even if he doesn't literally mean <em>all</em> of his clothes, when you are dressing for tens of degrees below zero (really doesn't matter either °F or °C at that point, they converge at -40) even having just a sweater on would feel like you're &quot;naked&quot; relative to the 3-5 layers you would want on when going outside.</p></div>		</li>
