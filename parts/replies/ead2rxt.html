			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive my layman's ignorance but isn't the universe expanding at faster than the speed of light (gravity)? So wouldn't anything at the periphery of the observable universe never &quot;feel&quot; the gravity from this object?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Assuming the fate of the universe isn't a big crunch, portions of the observable universe that are already far enough and moving away will never make it into the black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relative speed of expansion is dependent on the distance of the two coordinates being tracked.</p>
<p>This is because expansion is proportional. Say I have a 10 meter long rubber band tied to a tree. I stretch the free end another 5 meters in one second, giving a 15 meter expanded length. This yields a 50% increase in length. A point very near to my hand will have moved the full 5 meters, giving an expansion speed of 5 m/s relative to the tree. However, a point only 1 meter away from the tree will also have stretched by 50% of its relative distance, so it’s now 1.5 meters away. This yields an expansion speed of 0.5 m/s away from the tree.</p>
<p>This is why at the largest scale, the universe is expanding fast enough that clusters of galaxies are being pulled away from one another, but on smaller scales, the relative rate of expansion is so small that we aren’t exactly being pulled away from the floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass of the observable universe is estimated to be 3x10^(52) kg, so we are about one 16 billionths of the way to having enough mass to do that.</p>
<p>Also, a black hole with that mass (edit: the mass of a solar density object the size of the milky way) would have a Schwarzschild radius of 7.85*10^(13) light years, which is about 850 times the radius of the observable universe...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we are talking about the observable universe here. If the universe is truly infinite, would we expect to see an object like this eventually (assuming we could figure out a way to keep exploring the universe beyond the edge of the restrictive observable radius we now have)? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t get it, all the mass in the mostly empty observable universe would make a black hole with an event horizon the size of the observable universe? That doesn’t sound right, though I’m not any sort of authority. Can anybody speak on that? How big would the event horizon of a black hole with a mass of 10^52kg be? I’ve been wondering about that for a minute</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I was not suggesting a star made up of only Milky Way's matter. It is a star with the starting density of our Sun with the radius of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>That is a much, much larger black hole.</p></div>		</li>
