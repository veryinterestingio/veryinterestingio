			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer! This is really the only one that makes sense - either the fingerprint is secure enough to unlock the phone or it isn't.</p>
<p>... is the encryption key combined with some kind of hash built into the phone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is the correct answer. Basically the decryption key isn’t stored on your phone but derived from the PIN. Since you can’t place your finger exactly the same way every time you can only detect if it’s a close enough match to a stored one. So the best you could do with a fingerprint is allowing a stored decryption key to be used, and if the decryption key is stored on your phone i can be read...</p></div>		</li>
