			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, entropy is a state function, it can be measured and calculated. In principle, all you have to do is to count the number of microstates in a given macrostate (others have explained what they are so I won't bother repeating), take the natural logarithm of that number, and multiply it to the Boltzmann constant, and that's the entropy of the system. It has the unit of the Boltzmann constant, which is also the unit of heat capacity.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackur%E2%80%93Tetrode_equation" target="_blank">this equation</a> calculates the entropy of an ideal gas based on its internal energy, the mass of each gas particle, and the total number of gas particles, all of which are measurable quantities(Internal energy of an ideal gas is a function of temperature).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading trough all these answers, i've found nothing about measuring it or giving it a numeric value. As far as i can see it's just &quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot;</p>
<p>Don't take my word for it though, maybe someone else can come and clear things up.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/l6g1nb/what_does_entropy_mean/gl358bc/" target="_blank">This</a> comment by u/hugoRAS was just added, which seems to say that it does in fact have a numeric value, which seems to be based on the whole how many microstates make a macrostate thing u/weed_o_whirler mentions in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/l6g1nb/what_does_entropy_mean/gl0g270/" target="_blank">The top comment</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It absolutely does have a value and units, the simplest of which is k * log (number of ways of arranging the atoms), where k, or kB is the boltzmann constant. Its units are J/K.</p>
<p>Note that another definition is:</p>
<p>addition in entropy = addition of energy / temperature, in a system under certain conditions.</p>
<p>This is also J/K, and note that this classical definition agrees with the kB log (ways) definition in the number (apart from an offset, depending on definitions)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not adiabatic but isothermal (which can—but does not necessarily—result from adiabatic conditions).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Entropy is certainly quantifiable. <a href="http://john.maloney.org/Papers/Determining%20entropy%20\(5-2-07\).pdf" target="_blank">Here’s a list</a> of various ways to calculate it and its changes in various situations (at a high technical level, but it gives you a sense of how the real calculations are done in science and engineering.)</p></div>		</li>
