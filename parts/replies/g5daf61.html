<p>One thing that people forget also, is that you can have debt and be owed debt at the same time, so there's all this debt but it doesn't all come from one place and sort of cancels out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a hugely important thing that a lot of people dismiss to make things sound scarier. If A borrows $10 from B to buy lunch, and tomorrow B borrows $5 from A to buy coffee, there's a total of $15 worth of debt between them, but only $5 has to be paid for all that debt to go away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why? Why can't we just do some math, cross out a few debts, and reduce it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because that debt isn't owed to &quot;a country&quot;, it's owed to &quot;investors from that country&quot;. For example, imagine that France owes 50 million to Italy, and Italy owes 30 million to France. In reality, it's more of a &quot;The french government has taken 50 million from italian companies, banks and individuals, which it has to pay to them, and the italian government has taken 30 million from french investors&quot;. If governments agreed to forgive each other's debt, they would end up with a lot of very angry bankers.</p>
<p>There's also the issue of interest rates (my english is not very good so I don't know the exact words to explain this one). If I owe you 100 bucks on a 20% interest over 10 years, and you owe me 70 bucks on a 50% interest over 5 years (gross exaggeration) I would lose 36 bucks in ten years if we reduced the debt, and I would actually win 37 bucks in ten years if we kept it. That's a $73 loss for me, so I would never want to cross out some of the debt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because countries being in debt to another is a form of soft power. China will never attack us, for example, because they are heavily invested in us and losing the American economy will crash theirs. Likewise, they know we can't go too heavy-handed against them because they could just divest all of their US holdings and crash our economy. So it creates a political stalemate that increases global stability, and is why removing yourself from that debt network threatens to cripple your international bargaining power.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You can't 'request the debt.'  There's specific terms and conditions specifying how the debt will be paid.   Just like a home loan, the bank can't just decide one day that you owe the balance of your loan and foreclose on your house.</p>
<p>Countries can possibly do something like dump all of the debt they own of a specific country but that would probably hurt them more than the whomever they're beefing with.</p></div>		</li>
