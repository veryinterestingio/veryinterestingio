			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello!  Like with people, the fastest way to a crow's heart is through food.  Carry around a few unshelled, unsalted peanuts (raw or roasted) and toss your would-be friends some as you see them.  As much as you can, try and target a particular pair, and not random crows everywhere.  This is important for several reasons.  1) crows are territorial, so if you can locate a resident pair it means you'll see them everyday.  That consistency is what fosters the relationship.  2) you don't want your feeding to attract crows that aren't otherwise in the area.  That can be bad for other wildlife.  So just toss a handful to an already resident pair.  One handful a day is plenty to cultivate a relationship without supplying so much food that it because a problematic feeding frenzy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few of the local crows have a seasonal “relationship” with me. During the winter when food is scarcer, they’ll sit in the tree in front of my window and caw for food. They’ll come by at other times of the year to say hi, and sometimes follow me to my car, but only ever seem to want food when times are tough. One of the crows is more of a loner/outcast and he will come down and eat food silently if he’s the first one around, but the others will all call to each other to let them know I’ve put food out.</p>
<p>Also, near my work we get a “mega murder” (a genocide of crows?) in the autumn. It’s happening right now. There’s easily over a thousand crows. Crows fly in from all over the area. I figure it’s a crow version of a “coming of age” ceremony where the young and others without partners have an opportunity to find a mate and expand the gene pool in the smaller groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live very close to one of the largest crow roosts in North America (i.e., within walking distance), so some evenings every tree and roof around my home is covered in crows. Is there a way of identifying a specific pair in the multitude, or is this just a case of &quot;too much of a good thing&quot; to establish a relationship with specific crows?</p></div>		</li>
