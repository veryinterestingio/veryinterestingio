			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything you said sounds suspiciously wrong, no offense though.
I don't believe your actual core temperature drops by several degrees, nor does any bodily fluid solidify when cooled down like that.
Also, when asleep, you don't blink, so you can't blink away the &quot;normal dust an grit&quot; that doesn't even accumulate with closed eyes. Doesn't make any sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know that it’s several degrees, but an essential part of the circadian rhythm is the cooling of the body when you should be sleeping, and it reaching a low (normally) around day break, and then slowly raising in temperature after. The temperature cycle is why it’s best to keep a set sleep schedule, because your body will shift temperature based on when you normally sleep much easier than if you go to bed at random times all Willy-nilly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If talking about Fahrenheits, then the body temperature can indeed drop by a couple of degrees, but obviously not if talking about Celcius. Bodily fluids that have salt in them do solidify when the water evaporates, even sweat leaves a residue behind when it dries up. </p>
<p>The last part I have to guess with, but even while you don't fully blink while sleeping, your eyes still move around including eyelids. They don't generally speaking fully open but I don't see why the movement that happens in your eyes couldn't push out the tears (and other stuff) that forms the crust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well okay, you got me haha. It feels like that &quot;<em>haha by saying *I'll be there in five* I didn't mean minutes, I actually meant days lol</em>&quot; thing again. Sorry</p>
<p>The keyword is solidify. When a fluid solidifies, it doesn't mean it evaporates and leaves a tiny salt residue. Two completely different things. So I still stand by my claim that bodily fluids don't solidify by cooling <em>a few degrees</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, I get you. Eyes move and push out tear fluid etc, I agree. But in no sense &quot;dust and grit&quot; like he claimed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, but don't take what I said for granted either. I just challenged what I think doesn't make any sense (and I think I hinted that it's just my gut feeling). I could still be wrong; but I don't think so, just like everyone else does haha.</p></div>		</li>
