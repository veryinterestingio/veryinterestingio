			<div class="markdown"><p>Being binary may not hinder planet formation. In fact it is one of the explanations for the star disk misalignment, spin-orbit misalignment of stars with their planets and warped disks. This is pretty much the bleeding edge though so any comments by people will be pure speculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's doable (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0673" target="_blank">Planet formation in the habitable zone of alpha Centauri B</a>).  It's more of a &quot;multiple star systems are not as favorable to the creation of planets that are detectable with our current methods.&quot;  This either leads to planets like those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-47c" target="_blank">Kepeler-47</a> - massive planets orbiting a compact binary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the discovery of Kepler-47c, it was thought that binary stars with multiple planets could not exist. Gravitational issues caused by the parent stars would, it was believed, cause any circumbinary planets to either collide with each other, collide with one of the parent stars, or be flung out of orbit. However, this discovery shows that multiple planets can form around binary stars, even in their habitable zones; and while Kepler-47c is most likely unable to harbor life, other planets that could support life may orbit binary systems such as Kepler-47.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's just that it isn't as easy to form nor as easy to detect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Formation is fine. For formation we just require that a disks lifetime is ~10-30Myr and we are in the same regime as single systems. With that said no one as far as I am aware has done any work on the formation efficiency of planets in warped disks (which may or may not be common around binaries) which I suspect would be inhibited due to the seemingly increased velocities in certain areas of the disk. There is no reason to suspect the disks timescale would change for a binary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stability is a separate issue and is different for close and distant binaries. </p>
<p>For close binaries that produce planets from a shared disk there is no issue. The planets would be unstable close in and would happily be stable further out. </p>
<p>For distant binaries it might be expected that giant planets may undergo high eccentricity migration through the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. I have recently became less convinced of the efficiency of this mechanism due to occurrence rates of misaligned disks seemingly being roughly the same as occurrence rates of misaligned hot Jupiter's. The system would likely be a bit less stable than a single star system however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So odd question....is it possible that Jupiter and our sun were binary brown dwarf sized originally but our sun pirated a bunch of mass to become the star it is today and leaving Jupiter with what is left of it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jupiter has 0.001 the mass of the Sun.  So no, there weren't two similar sized masses and the Sun got the majority of it.</p>
<p>However, the location of Jupiter when it was formed and what it did after that is an interesting area of research.</p>
<p>There's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_tack_hypothesis" target="_blank">Grand tack hypothesis</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In planetary astronomy, the grand tack hypothesis proposes that after its formation at 3.5 AU, Jupiter migrated inward to 1.5 AU, before reversing course due to capturing Saturn in an orbital resonance, eventually halting near its current orbit at 5.2 AU. The reversal of Jupiter's migration is likened to the path of a sailboat changing directions (tacking) as it travels against the wind.</p>
<p>The planetesimal disk is truncated at 1.0 AU by Jupiter's migration, limiting the material available to form Mars. Jupiter twice crosses the asteroid belt, scattering asteroids outward then inward. The resulting asteroid belt has a small mass, a wide range of inclinations and eccentricities, and a population originating from both inside and outside Jupiter's original orbit.[3] Debris produced by collisions among planetesimals swept ahead of Jupiter may have driven an early generation of planets into the Sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping-Jupiter_scenario" target="_blank">Jumping-Jupiter scenario</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The jumping-Jupiter scenario specifies an evolution of giant-planet migration described by the Nice model, in which an ice giant (Uranus, Neptune, or an additional Neptune-mass planet) is scattered inward by Saturn and outward by Jupiter, causing the step-wise separation of their orbits. The jumping-Jupiter scenario was proposed by Ramon Brasser, Alessandro Morbidelli, Rodney Gomes, Kleomenis Tsiganis, and Harold Levison after their studies revealed that the smooth divergent migration of Jupiter and Saturn resulted in an inner Solar System significantly different from the current Solar System.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also information at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System#Formation_of_the_planets" target="_blank">Formation and evolution of the Solar System : Formation of the planets</a> has another approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, which is the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to 4 M⊕ within about 3 million years. Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun. Theorists believe it is no accident that Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line. Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~5 AU from the Sun. This excess material coalesced into a large embryo (or core) on the order of 10 M⊕, which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't know and we don't know if the sun had a twin. We think that the sun formed in an open cluster which allowed for the stars formed in the stellar nursery to scatter. </p>
<p>We think that HD 162826 is a sibling star of the sun so hopefully that will help us find more in the future.</p></div>		</li>
