			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know why experts estimate that we will need booster shots every 2-3 years against covid19? All the studies I have seen so far shows that even though antibodies decrease, thanks to memory cells immunity is still strong in most of the individuals after 6-8 months of infections. I also do not hear these reinfection stories anymore (which was extremely rare anyways, most of the reported were either long covid or reinfection with a variant, confirmed reinfections were 20-30 cases throughout the world).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have experts been saying that recently?</p>
<p>That was the best guess a few months ago: <em>As variants arise, we may need to update our vaccines, just like we do annually with the flu.</em></p>
<p>But it's turning out that the mRNA vaccines are providing robust immunity to the variants (as you said) - most experts I follow on Twitter etc. are excited that we definitely do *not* have an immediate pressing need for variant-specific boosters.</p>
<p>We don't know how long the immunity is going to last at these super high levels of protection from the first two doses of the mRNA vaccines. 2-3 years might be a good guess, but 10 years might be a good guess too - we had all the tests done on safety/efficacy/duration in mice and rats, and we have safety/efficacy in humans and nonhuman primates, but I don't think we have duration in nonhuman primates and we certainly don't have it in humans.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You need a booster shot once your antibodies fade to a certain level because that’s where most of your protection is coming from. Antibodies are your first line of defense against reinfection. Having memory cells will help the illness be over quicker and be less severe, but those cells are all off chilling in your spleen and lymph nodes. It takes them a little bit of time to 1) notice that you’ve been infected (because the infection is probably happening at a mucosal surface) and 2) become reactivated. </p>

<p>Because they’re common enough now that it’s not an interesting enough story to publish. Natural infection has been reported to have 80-90% efficacy at preventing reinfection. Which isn’t pretty good, but it certainly isn’t uber rare for people to get it twice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had covid and one shot of mRNA vaccine, your immunity will be better than someone who didn't have covid and got two shots. The immune response is very robust. Just having covid is not enough to protect against variants and fading immunity, but this pressure for people who had covid to get both shots is unnecessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>20 years ago, the theory was narrowed down to one of two mechanisms, either the selected (antigen recognizing) memory cells lie dormant and await reactivation for clonal expansion, or they divide (albeit slower) periodically to keep the cell line going.  I'm not sure which, if either, was ever determined.</p></div>		</li>
