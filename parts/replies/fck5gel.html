			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, the reason why it is called &quot;zero sum&quot; is because if you sum up the scores of all the players, the sum is zero. To take the first marble example, whenever you win a marble, your score increases by 1. Whenever you lose a marble, your score decreases by 1.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, the score is 0-0. If I get a marble (+1) you have to lost a marble (-1) which would make the score +1:-1 and +1 + -1 = 0. The sum score is always zero. Zero sum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A better example involves gains from cooperation. In a zero sum game, anything you receive I must lose and vice versa. The &quot;pie&quot; or &quot;bank account of prizes&quot; is fixed and divided between us or lost. In a non-zero sum game, the pie can grow or shrink depending on the players' actions.</p>
<p>Most of the time, we focus on pies that grow. So, one &quot;canonical&quot; (but sexist) toy example is called &quot;The Battle of the Sexes&quot; - the idea is that a husband and wife are trying to decide what to do of an evening. The husband would prefer to go to a boxing match. The wife would prefer the opera. HOWEVER, they both get utility from being with each other. If they &quot;cooperate&quot; and end up in the same place, they're BOTH better off than if they'd decided to go their own way.</p>
<p>It's like when I want to work on building a 3D printer and my wife is watching HGTV. Sometimes I hang out with her and sometimes she comes to see what I'm up to. We each prefer different activities but when we consider each other and that we want to be together... we end up in the same place. Coincidentally, the two pure strategy Nash equilibria to BoS are &quot;Opera, Opera&quot; and &quot;Boxing, Boxing,&quot; i.e. married couples gain from being together.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now let's say that we're playing a game where the object is to pick up the most marbles in a field full of marbles. No matter how many I pick up, doing so doesn't require that you lose any. That's a non zero-sum game.</p>

<p>Unless it's a game that doesn't end until all the marbles are picked up, then it becomes a zero-sum game again, I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was assuming that the marbles were equivalent to &quot;points&quot;, and that each player doesn't get to keep the marbles after the game is over.</p>
<p>If there are 1000 marbles on the field in each game, and the game continues until all of them are collected, then the sum of all the players scores will always be 1000, and so the literal description is a &quot;1000-sum game&quot; rather than a zero-sum game, but I think they are equivalent. Perhaps a more inclusive term would be &quot;fixed-sum game&quot;.</p>
<p>In such a game, every time you pick up a marble and earn a point, you are depriving the other player(s) of an opportunity to earn a point. Thus it's a zero-sum game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't your field full of marbles example still be a zero sum game? When I pick up a marble you are no longer able to pick up that marble, which would reduce your maximum possible marbles. Granted, this would affect you much less than it would in your bag full of marbles example, but it still would. I think each player would need their own field before this becomes a non zero sum game, or am I mistaken?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I could have been more explicit. The assumption is that you are only capable of picking up a limited number of marbles before you become incapable of carrying any more and that a field full of marbles would be enough to ensure that a marble taken by one player isn't a marble denied to another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this still may be a zero-sum game. If the goal of the game is to win (rather than collect marbles for their own sake), then the utility function depends on the difference between your score and mine, so any marble you pick up makes it harder for me to win.</p></div>		</li>
