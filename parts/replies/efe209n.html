			<div class="markdown"><p>Why birds migrate is a pretty fascinating subject, especially since in many species we see that only portions of the total population will migrate, while others reside in one place year round. The two major factors that compel birds to travel thousands of miles seasonally are food and sex. Strict insectivores will need to seek warmer climates in winter in order to find food, while other species can rely on seeds and berries to see them through the winter in colder areas. In the spring, migratory birds flock north in anticipation of an explosion of insects, which provide the essential protein for supporting their chicks. Timing is absolutely key, because if they arrive too early or too late, the exhausted birds might find little food to support themselves, let alone a batch of chicks. They also have a slightly better time staking out territory (feeding grounds) to defend from competitors than they would in the densely populated tropics, which is again, vital to raising a clutch of chicks. Heat isn't generally a huge issue, as birds are pretty great at regulating their body temperature, although obviously prolonged stress, either hot or cold, will increase a bird's chances of mortality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question Moose_Hole, and good user name. </p>
<p>Contrary to 19th century agrarian thinking(which has persisted in 21st century urban mindsets), the sub-arctic is a biological bonanza in summer time. </p>
<p>You cannot farm on it in most places, but the growing season provides a huge amount of sunlight, making up for the shorter overall season. </p>
<p>In spring time, flowering plants just explode into life. While it makes good biological sense in the south to grow flowers and berries later in the season, in the north it happens early. </p>
<p>For the reason that there is a lot of sunlight, as much as 24 hours per day, huge specimens of garden vegetables can be grown. Vegetable gardening being a bit of a different pursuit than grain farming. Most grains won't have time to finish in the north. They need a hot dry autumn.</p>
<p>This sunlight benefit also applies to many berries and seeds, and insects can darken the sky with their uncountable numbers, so from a birds point of view, the north is a smorgasbord of tasty things. </p>
<p>Flying north makes a heck of a lot of sense. When it is time to go south, southern plants will be fruiting. </p>
<p>Here is a photo of the tundra, north of the treeline. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LfWiG94.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/LfWiG94.jpg</a> In the background you can see the Arctic ocean and the headlands and islands off the coast. The lumpy hills you see are called pingos and are actually a core of ice with vegetation on top of it. </p>
<p>This was taken in a slightly different(drier and colder) area with very little grass. You can see a bit of shale stone poking through bottom center. This shows how thin the ground cover is, and how these plants thrive despite a lack of topsoil. </p>

<p>For a broader view of the drier area, I have this photo: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before 1978 Ohio was home to Bob White quail. When the blizzard struck many birds just huddled in place, waiting for the storm to pass. The flash freeze that followed entombed them in ice capsules. That spring I remember finding little hollow ice eggs with dead birds inside all over the ground.</p>
<p>Bob White quail were rendered extinct in Ohio because of that event. I miss their calls on summer evenings. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely part of the answer. I have a Mountain Hardwear down sleeping bag rated for -20F and I've never tested it that low but I have been camping when it got down into the 20s and I was sweating, I literally had to wake up and pull in some cold air from time to time. Everybody else on that trip was cold as balls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, that’s like an Everest bag, hope you get to actually put it through it’s paces. Also, what you’re sleeping on is very important since all your bags insulation is crushed beneath you so you need firmer insulation.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>In fairness, that probably didn't help. Fresh snow is a pretty good insulator thanks to all the trapped air in it, so if your sleeping bag/tent was covered in snow, that just amplified your sleeping bag's insulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, unrelated to all that, can I ask you about open air camping/sleeping like that? I've been trying to get outside more... But as someone who has slept inside pretty much all my life, the idea of camping without a tent is... bothersome.</p>
<p>I TOTALLY get the allure of sleeping under the stars and all that. It's why I'm really getting into camping and stuff. But.. I dunno, like what about wildlife? Not just bears or something like that... Foxes, birds, curious cats looking to get warm, insects, that sort of thing. And I fully realize a tent isn't gonna stop a determined animal. But, I'd rather wake up with something rustling my tent, as opposed to my face. Or an ant train all up on my stuff, you know what I mean? It feels like, by going to sleep completely in the open, I'm surrendering myself to whatever is out there with me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That feeling exactly is the reason many animals live in caves, dig burrows or build lairs. Also why we started making huts the moment we stopped being hunter gatherers. I would trust one of our oldest basic instincts... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things: 1) In a way, you ARE surrendering yourself to whatever is out there with you; 2) There's not very much out there that gets a damn about you. I'm camped over 1000 nights in my life, and probably 50-100 of them without a tent. That includes mountains, deserts, rainforest, glaciers, and woods like in the eastern U.S. </p>
<p>I've had something crawl into my bag without me inviting it in exactly once - when a friend's dog got cold and burrowed down beside me and into the footbox of my bag. The long and short of it is that nearly everything that you'll encounter in the wild is at least cautious of you, if not downright scared. Even bears, which seems to be the biggest concern for most folks, are almost never directly aggressive - if they come into camp, they're pretty much always interested in your food and not you. If you take reasonable precautions (e.g., hang food away from camp, use a tent when you know there are a lot of critters you don't like around, etc.), you'll be fine.</p>
<p>If you have to pick something to be afraid of while you're camping, I'd shift my focus to people. A bunch of drunks scare me way worse than any animal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good half step is to sleep in a hammock. Keeps you off the ground and away from creepy crawlies but it's not as &quot;protected&quot; as sleeping in a tent. Plus I find sleeping in hammock way more comfortable than sleeping on the ground. Eno is my favorite hammock company but there are plenty out there.</p></div>		</li>
