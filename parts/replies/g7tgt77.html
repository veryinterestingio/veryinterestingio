If I randomly chop up 3 programs and stick them together it's not going to turn out very well.  Or,  are most of the resulting Frankenviruses non-functional?</p>
<p>(I feel like this is what Ridley Scott was sort of aiming for in Prometheus and Alien Covenant,  but failed.  Messing with the building blocks of life in disturbing ways.  Kind of like the R&amp;M Froopyland guy. )</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, by far. Even when a single virus is replicating normally, a huge proportion of the virus particles produced are non-functional, partly as a result of their high mutation rate. Viruses kind of brute-force natural selection through sheer numbers. (I mean, all evolving entities do, but viruses more so than most.)</p>
<p>It also helps that your typical virus is incredibly simple compared to even the simplest bacterium. True living organisms have thousands of genes, all working in concert, while a virus can have few enough genes that you can count them on two hands, and often the functioning of one virus gene is fairly independent of the functioning of another.</p>
<p>Mind you, plants and animals and other complex organisms do also accidentally pick up one another's DNA. Most of the time nothing much comes of it, but sometimes you get a gene that actually ends up doing something useful in the recipient's body and ends up sticking around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How does this happen? I don't recall ever learning about any such mechanism.</p></div>		</li>
