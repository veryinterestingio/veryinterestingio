<p>(somebody had to link to this)</p>
<p>we exist as elaborate control system for this biological meat/muscle robot we control, that also keeps us alive, and is mostly automated. Mostly controlling it with electrical signals we send to parts of it to move.</p>
<p>we have grown so used to playing with this meat puppet, sending signals to it, we think of it as our &quot;body&quot;. Most of it still remains out of our control.</p>
<hr />
<p>there is a short story expanding on this, where things are reversed, where your meat body is used as robot in amazon like factory, you just rent your body to it, and ai uses your body to do the job, you just lose a day. Get paid minimum wage.</p>
<p>the point of the story being some people are already doing this, without the i can just rent my body out part. have to live the thing, are worse off than the people in the dystopian novel, story, who had ai control their body.</p>
<p>ask somebody working for amazon if they would allow ai to take over your body for a day and get paid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those sound mightily like Bill Gates' nanobots. Exercise is a conspiracy! They're in the air when you breathe but they only get in if you breathe enough of them at one time, so you have to exercise to breathe faster and get them all in. That's why they're pushing &quot;healthy&quot; lifestyles! </p>
