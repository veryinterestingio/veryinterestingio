			<div class="markdown"><p>Less than is realistically measurable. I think I read somewhere a keystroke is like 168/1000 of a kilocalorie (the kind of calorie referred to on nutrition labels) and blinking takes less energy than that because you are moving less mass a shorter distance</p>
<p>Edit: typo</p>
<p>Edit 2: i may have misremembered, perhaps it was 168/1.000.000 (a calorie, which is 1/1000 of a Calorie/kilocalorie). Regardless, blinking is probably not a measurable amount of calories</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems like too high to me... If you're e.g playing a game at 100 APM/keystrokes per minute, or say typing at 20 words per minute at 5 characters per word average, that's 168/1000<em>100</em>60 = 1008kcal/hr
At an average of 2500-3000 kcal on your diet, 3 hours of gaming and you dont need to hit the gym anymore</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently watched a video on YouTube by a mortician and he explained that to keep the eyes closed they have these jagged contact things which they place on your eyeball and it grips your eyelid to stop them opening.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole video is worth watching! You sure take much greater care of your deceased than we do in the developing parts of the world. No embalming, rough handling, pretty much no thought given to setting the features at all. Death is a terrifying ordeal for the living.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends, I'm no mortician but I've heard some prep the body by putting in contact lenses with small spikes on them to grip the inside of the eyelids and keep them closed. I think they're called eye caps, never looked into it but it seems neat tbh.</p></div>		</li>
