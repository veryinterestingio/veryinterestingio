			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrons still consist of charged quarks, and they have a magnetic dipole moment! Still, I guess a cloud of &quot;neutron gas&quot; should be fairly transparent up to some very high-energy gamma rays, where you can excite some delta resonances or something. They are like an electronic transition in an atom, except here it's a quark transition in a neutron and you excite them with really hard gamma rays instead of UV/vis light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what you mean, neutrinos are completely different particles. Neutrinos don't have any electric charge, so they don't react to electromagnetic fields, they can only feel the weak force.</p></div>		</li>
