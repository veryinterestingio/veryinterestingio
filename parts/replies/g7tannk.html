			<div class="markdown"><p>Syphilis was also a lot more horrible back then apparently:</p>
<p>&quot;the first European sufferers were covered with acorn-sized boils that emitted a foul, dark green pus. This secretion was so vile, von Hutten affirmed, that even the burning pains of the boils troubled the sick less than their horror at the sight of their own bodies. Yet this was only the beginning. People's flesh and skin filled with water; their bladders developed sores; their stomachs were eaten away. Girolamo Fracastoro, a professor at the University of Padua, described the onward march of symptoms: syphilis pustules developed into ulcers that dissolved skin, muscle, bone, palate, and tonsils—even lips, noses, eyes, and genital organs. Rubbery tumors, filled with a white, sticky mucus, grew to the size of rolls of bread. Violent pains tormented the afflicted, who were exhausted but could not sleep, and suffered starvation without feeling hunger. Many of them died.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More that (1) people just inherently were less &quot;healthy&quot; back then given that nutrition and actual medicine among the Europeans in the Middle Ages were non-existent -- medicine didn't really begin to progress until post-Renaissance/Enlightenment when anatomy started to become an actual study and (2) writers at the time would've written gory, disgusting descriptions of the disease because they were pandering to the morals of the people at the time, especially those who could read - in the article above John Calvin says &quot;God has raised up new diseases against debauchery&quot; so it was also a way of saying that if you did the horizontal tango this nasty disease would happen to you. It was the Middle Ages version of that Mean Girls &quot;don't have sex, if you have sex you'll get an STD and die&quot; quote.</p>
<p>Also to bring up some more syphilis history, the U.S. did some seriously sick and morally depraved experimenting on actual people with the Tuskegee trials and Guatemala prison trials to &quot;research&quot; syphilis progression and potential treatment. I recommend anyone to read up on this when you're hearing people say &quot;why don't Black and Latinx people get involved in medical trials?&quot; so you can respond &quot;why would they trust us after THAT?&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! There are actually a couple of ways to do this:</p>
<p>Immunotherapy. Normally your body has mechanisms to kill cells with replication errors. (It's probably happening in you right now!) But if your immune system doesn't &quot;see&quot; the bad cells, they can keep replicating unchallenged and boom, cancer. If you can find a virus that's attracted to cells with that specific type of &quot;wrongness,&quot; you can engineer the virus to deliver a &quot;come kill me&quot; signal. Now the immune system knows they should be attacking. </p>
<p>Oncolytic virus therapy. Similar process, except the virus stimulates the cancer cells to kill themselves (apoptosis). </p>
<p>Or if you wanna go really nuts, you can use the virus to try to &quot;fix&quot; faulty tumor-suppressor genes, so the body just makes fewer mistakes and/or fixes them faster in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there's a lot of research into these called &quot;oncolytic&quot; viruses; we've been working on them since the '60s. The trick of course is finding a way to prevent off target infection. There's actually an oncolytic herpesvirus that is a globally approved therapy already - passed all clinical trials and is now in regular use - for melanomas that can't be operated on called Talimogene laherparepvec aka T Vec. They use a genetically engineered/modified herpes virus that has a couple proteins deleted. Normally when one of your cells is infected by a virus the cell has an innate immune system that detects viral RNA and then shuts down translation (the process of making protein from a piece of RNA). Viruses hijack your cell's machinery to create viral proteins and new virus copies, so this will prevent the virus from replicating and infecting other cells. A lot of herpesviruses have a countermeasure in the form of a protein called ICP34.5 that prevents this shutdown. But, we've realized many cancer cells actually lack the ability to stop translation (and cell division, transcription, etc hence why you get tumors of cells growing out of control). We can actually delete that gene from the virus; it can no longer overcome translation shutdown in your healthy cells and therefore can't replicate. Since the cancer cells don't have the ability to stop translation anymore, when the virus infects those cells it can still replicate normally and spread. So it can infect/get inside all of your cells like normal but only selectively replicates in and kills cancer cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body's homeostasis can be very tough to overcome with only outside influence. Even when you're in a hot shower, your core temperature is not affected that much, and is no where near affected to the point it would consider it a fever. Similarly for being outside on a hot day. You run the risk of severe dehydration and severe skin damage in your effort to raise core temperature with hot air/water. The skin and nearby fat is a pretty good insulator, which is why we sweat!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar question the other day though: would it work for a localised infection like a cut, pimple, ulcer, boil, or something? Can you keep it hot enough in the area to make a difference? I figure you can keep it warm enough to be inhospitable but not cause too much damage to your body. Googling showed some benefits to this from blood flow but no mention of the fever aspect.</p></div>		</li>
