			<div class="markdown"><p>as someone with a blister currently from cutting wood the other day, I'm under the assumption that blood blisters are formed in a similar fashion but along with the  interstitial fluid, that blood is drawn/ escapes in addition?  I'm assuming that when the inner layers of the skin are mechanically torn as you've mentioned but at a much harsher point where blood would be drawn, it's essentially like a cut in the skin, but in this case - a cut under the skin. Am i correct in my deduction?  </p>
<p>edit; just saw another reply, more or less confirming this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, a blood blister means you've caused enough damage to the inner layer for blood to leak, but didn't damage the outer layer enough to leak, so blood pools between the layers. </p>
<p>It's basically the same thing as a regular blister, just, more severe damage.</p>
<p>Leave it be until it heals naturally and the outer layer of skin flakes off. You'll regret opening/draining it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends. I've gotten a couple blood blisters on my heel (stepping full-weight on a tiny rock) that made walking unbearable. I was much better off draining them and bandaging them, it drastically reduced the pressure on the injury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A (sterile) pinprick at the base of the blister (then covered with a bandage) can relieve the pressure while retaining the protection of the outer layer.</p>
<p>This can prevent the blister from rupturing open on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Also, if a blister is deep enough to cut into the lowest layer of skin, it can be filled with blood, and it is eve more painful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason a popped blister hurts like it does is because the exposed top of the dermis is where all the nerve endings are situated.  They are used to being covered by a protective layer of epithelium and exposing them makes them over excited and irritated.</p></div>		</li>
