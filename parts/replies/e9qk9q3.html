<p>Technically you also want both to be in free-fall to have an inertial reference frame. Scientists are rarely in free-fall, but we know the gravitational field of Earth very well so we can take its effect into account. And it has to be taken into account - atomic clocks at sea-level run notably slower than atomic clocks 100 m higher. Even 10 cm height difference can be measurable with some clocks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I'm gathering from other comments is that this will barely change the value of what a kg is, compared to what it already is (probably won't be noticed on a regular lab scale).</p>
<p>So for what means does this definition prove useful? What research areas require such a precise definition of a kilogram?</p>
<p>Or is it just a good thing, because then we won't have to calculate the new kg each year based off the currently used radioactively decaying kg.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It shouldn’t. Scientists chose planck’s constant so that the newly defined kg is the same as the old one. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Under the previous system, we had one physical object defined as a kg and all kg masses were copies of that one (or copies of copies or copies of copies of copies and so on). This is ok, but over time there was a measurable change in the difference between the copies and the “true” kg. But how much of those changes were changes with the copies or changes with the original? If the original is changing, then 1000 years from now when they make a new copy kg, it could be way off from the current kg, and future people would wonder what the hell was different with physics that so many of our numbers were off from what they’d be measuring.</p>
<p>With the new way of defining a kg, people 1000 years from now can make a new copy kg that is exactly the same as our current kg. And a million years after that they can still make the exact same kg. If we put scientists on Mars or in another star system, they can make accurate kgs there too.</p>
<p>Defining seconds or meters or kgs with physical objects means that if the physical objects change and we don’t notice, everything will suddenly be different. Defining them by unchanging physical qualities works a lot better for long-term consistency.</p>
<p>^(Disclaimer: I’m not any sort of science, this is just the reason <strong>as far as I understand it</strong>.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The second is defined based on the frequency of radiation corresponding to the transition, not the frequency of the transition between the two states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant#Determination" target="_blank">A Kibble balance</a> (formerly called Watt balance). It's really cool, because it has two modes: one where a weight is put on one end, and a conductor passes through a coil on the other side, creating a current, which you measure. Then you can take that current, and drive the same coil, and it pushes back with the force to move 1 kg at a known speed.</p>
<p>So, I think I have this right, by fixing Plank's constant, and using the fixed elementary charge, you can now fix the current in the second step, and no longer need that first calibration step. So now anyone with a Kibble balance can accurately weight a kilogram, to an uncertainty that is proportional to the quality of the balance.</p>
<p>So the new kg relies on the meter and second, but I believe you now need the Ampere to measure it, at least by that method. There are other methods (in that above link).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMYvVgsotIk" target="_blank">This video on NIST's Kibble balance</a> is good balance (heh) of not too simple, not too complex, although it operates a bit differently than a simpler Kibble balance I described above.</p></div>		</li>
