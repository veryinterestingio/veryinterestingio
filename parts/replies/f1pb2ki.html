They use church money to buy enough books to get them to number one do they can be referred to as best selling author and pastor so and so. Thankfully a few of these guys have been kicked out of their roles for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a myth. They’re not allowed to accrue any personal financial benefit from those transactions. See FEC Advisory Opinion 2014-10, which summarizes numerous instances of candidates buying copies of their books, from self-published books to those from major publishing houses: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The facts presented in this request are particularly similar to those presented in Advisory Opinions 2014-06 (Ryan), 2001-08 (Specter), and 2011-02 (Brown). In each of those advisory opinions, the Commission determined that the authorized committee’s use of campaign funds to purchase copies of its candidate’s book would defray an expense that would not exist irrespective of the campaign, and therefore the spending would not be an impermissible personal use. In reaching its conclusion in each of those advisory opinions, the Commission considered several facts, including that the committee’s funds would be used to purchase the book solely for distribution to the committee’s contributors and supporters — and thus would be used by the committee only for the purpose of influencing its candidate’s election to federal office — <strong>and that the candidate would not receive any royalties attributable to the committee’s purchase.</strong> See Advisory Opinion 2014-06 (Ryan) at 5; Advisory Opinion 2011-02 (Brown) at 5-6; Advisory Opinion 2001-08 (Specter) at 3.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if they don’t receive royalties from their own purchases, it still pushes the book to #1 which gives it more exposure and more legitimate purchases and makes the candidate appear more popular than they really are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly. The politician is the face while the publisher is the grifter. The politician has to wait until they’re out of office to get their cut through appearance and speaking fees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit. I never thought about this. It is in the word &quot;bestseller&quot; but I've never thought about sales numbers. In my mind I associated bestseller with quality. Shit! This blows my mind. So they can buy their own books! Thanks stranger for a paradigm shift in my perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To go a step further, &quot;top 10&quot; charts and the like in stores are often just a marketing device. I say this as somone who briefly worked for a corporate videogames retailer about 20 years ago; the &quot;top 10&quot; charts for each platform were literally just &quot;the 10 games we really want to sell right now&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that it is padding numbers the same way but there are tons of consumer items where bestseller and quality don’t necessarily go hand-in-hand, McDonalds hamburgers being the first to come to mind. Most consistent and reliable, yes, absolute best I’d have a hard time pitching.</p></div>		</li>
