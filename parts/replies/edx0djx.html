			<div class="markdown"><p>In the video where the same guy made a high current low voltage transformer and first showed it off, he said it was 25-75kva but somehow I don't believe him because Output power can't exceed input power, and you don't get much more than a 25kVA supply to a domestic premises.</p>
<p>The Primary coils (two 120V windings in series so running at 240V) are being supplied with a variable voltage regulator from 0-240V at 13A or a maximum of 3120W, he said the output voltage was 0.5V, 3 cables in a figure of 8 round the two sets of windings so 6 turns in total I guess?</p>
<p>Power output cannot exceed power input, so assuming a standard 13A socket feeding the transformer then it's only 3kVA but maximum of 6kA output. Even assuming he had a 240V 32A socket that would only be 7.6kVA, if he had a 63A socket (which I doubt because he doesn't seem to get 3-phase until much later in his videos and I can't find anything rated for 240V 63A, only 415V 63A) that would still only be just over 15kVA.</p>
<p>To Deliver the 50,000 Amps he claims it can handle at the short circuit voltage (which may be lower than the 0.5V he stated the output voltage may be), you would need an input power of at least 25kVA not accounting for any losses. At those sort of powers I'm pretty sure it would melt the primary windings, blow up his electricity meter and blow the master fuse fitted by the electricity company, which are typically rated at 80-100A 240V (25kVA would be just over 104A).</p>
<p>He does however, not use that transformer for the video in which this GIF is made from. He uses a different transformer entirely but the 240V wires going into it look like your standard 13A mains cable (at best 2.5mm^(2) but looks thinner so hard to say), so depending on primary windings, with what looks like 3 turns on the secondary windings, he could very well get a maximum of 5kA output, but not with the small wires he used on the secondary windings. Like you said it's likely a few hundred amps at best but at a very low voltage.</p></div>		</li>
