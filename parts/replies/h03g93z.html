			<div class="markdown"><p>And the reason this is different to games like poker is because in a game of blackjack the players are playing against the dealer and winning money from the casino. When they flip the odds in their favour by card counting it's causing a loss to the casino.</p>
<p>By contrast, in games like poker the players are playing against each other and a highly skilled player who can skew the odds in their favour is winning against the other players. The casino's profits aren't impacted by any one player's skill (or lack of it) as they just take a &quot;rake&quot; (percentage) of the pot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most casinos don't even bother kicking you out anyway. You're not hurting the house that much.</p>
<p>Now if you and a group of buddies are at it for days at a time, you <em>might</em> raise an eyebrow. But Joe Expert sitting down at Blackjack and walking away with a small prize after a couple hours? Not a blip on their radar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like if you're losing a game you have the right to walk away, the casino also has the right to walk away from a game that its losing.  Of course since the casino can't physically walk away, they will politely (or forcibly, if they have to) ask you to walk away instead.</p></div>		</li>
