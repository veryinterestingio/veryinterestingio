			<div class="markdown"><p>There are three main reasons for dark circles (there are more, I'm just talk about the main ones)</p>
<p>Hyperpigmentation by melanin (the thing that makes you tan)
Structural dark circles (this has to do with the anatomy of your eyes and bones)
Circulatory problems. </p>
<p>You must first identify the cause to treat it correctly. Most people have mixed source dark circles.
You might need a skin peeling, or a filler injection. </p>
<p>Usually you can find the cause looking the color of it.
Brown? Melanin
Blue, red or purple? Circulatory.
Dark? Structural (it should improve when you point a flashlight to your eyes dark circles)</p>
<p>If you can get some chamomile tea sachets, it might help. Soak them in cold water and put them in your eyes circles for around 20 minutes. Don't open your eyes during this.
They will mainly work for circulatory dark circles. </p>
<p>Best thing you can do is to consult a dermatologist to find the exact cause and treat. </p>
<p>Sometimes all you need is a good night of sleep. </p></div>		</li>
