<p>You also implied that Anglo-Saxon is named after England. Actually it was the Angles and the Saxons that migrated to Britain and mostly displaced the Celtic language.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be pedantic, it's the common ancestor of <em>North</em> Indian languages - the bottom 1/3 of India speak <em>Dravidian</em> languages, which are unrelated - as well as Iran, and <em>most</em> of the languages of Europe - with the exceptions of Basque (which is in a language family of its own) and the Finno-Urgic languages (Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, and some rare languages in a chunk of central Russia). And arguably Maltese - if you count it as a European language, it should be counted in the Semitic language family.</p></div>		</li>
