<p>That's why it's also important to chew plants - they have a protective coating on the outside, so you need to mush them with your teeth to mechanically destroy (or cause holes in) the protective layer to let the acid dissolve it further.</p>

<p>Otherwise you end up with chunks of undigested plant in your poop! Like the corn kernels!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, not in the sense your comment implies it does. Cells are not digested by the stomach acid. If they are, they are the grounds for ulcers and this is pathological - not physiological. There is a mucus layer that neutralizes acids, so the cells actually never are in contact with stomach acid - instead, they are in contact with mucus that is at pH of around 7.</p></div>		</li>
