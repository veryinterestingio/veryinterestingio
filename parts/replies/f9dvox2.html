			<div class="markdown"><p>The hassle is that it essentially bans people without smart phones from attending. For cities like Detroit (now has every major sport), you have to offer physical tickets or you are effectively banning the poor.</p>
<p>Edit: I guess you're also missing the point that attending sports games used to be a pastime for people of all walks of life and now the tickets are too expensive for a lot of people to even purchase. So you're reinforcing my argument. If they can't afford a phone, they can't afford tickets and that means you think sports are for people with money, not the poor. Chew on that one for a minute. </p>
<p>Detroit has a 50% child poverty rate, yet has NHL, NFL, MLB and NBA games. Do you think these families are attending in droves? No. They can't participate without money.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: just realized I said the same thing as the people below me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not really. Most people, even poor, own smart phones these days.  You can get a prepaid smartphone for $20-$30. If you can afford sports tickets you can afford a smartphone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then you get some tickets as a prize, or a donation, or a handout. And you go to the library on the morning to print out your tickets for this special event you were lucky enough to get tickets for, and you find out that you are too poor to use these free tickets. :(</p></div>		</li>
