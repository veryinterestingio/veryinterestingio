			<div class="markdown"><p>You really only want to do a venepuncture on an neonate if you either need a large amount or specifically deoxygenated blood. It's a really hard draw. They have teeny tiny veins that roll and collapse really easily. </p>
<p>Sometimes with premies the only vein large enough for the smallest needle is in their forehead. There's only a few people in our hospital that are able to do that one. I know pediatric life flight can get it. They are fantastic.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My son caught roseola at 10 weeks old (they didn’t know it was roseola until the residual rash showed up over 2 weeks later). I took him to the ER where they tried for a vein 14 times....that’s not an exaggeration. I was about to lose my mind watching a new staff member come in and I kept thinking, “this is it, this person has the magic touch”. Nope. When the anesthesiologist couldn’t do it, they had another hospital from an hour away come to transport him so that they could perform a spinal tap (fever in newborns = spinal tap in case of meningitis) The EMT’s finally got the IV into his forehead. THEN! Then, they tried for the spinal tap and were unsuccessful in getting spinal fluid. They finally gave up after the third try.
It was debilitating to watch numerous people poke and prod my baby. Totally not their fault, but I wanted RAGE!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is so rough. I'm sorry. Those nights were always the worst. I 100% admit that I am not experienced or talented enough at phlebotomy to not blow the vein of a dehydrated newborn. So I would always send it up the chain and try and get someone who was really really good. I would end up waiting with the patient's family,, who were worried and stressed, trying to talk to them until the second person would arrive. </p>

<p>They would usually try at least a couple times, before suggesting we call someone else. That's when a sort of blood draw phone tree would kick up. You have an escalating chain of people you can try and contact who are ranked based on likelihood to succeed and how hard they were to get. Usually you would call Peds ER nurses. They start IVs on babies all the time, so they're usually pretty good, but they're always super busy. After that it's probably a peds ER doctor or the anesthesiologist if he's available. </p>

<p>Last chance and hardest to get a hold of is the pediatric ER helicopter EMTs. They have to start  IVs on babies that are coding in a moving helicopter. They are the best of the best. It was always  an intense experience when they were between calls and came down. They always walked in, got it on the first try making it look easy, and then immediately leaving again because they were always busy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very common scar. It's generally from breaking in shoes and getting a blister. Once you get the blister, the shoes keep rubbing, and the area never heals quite right. Most people have scars there at least on one side.</p></div>		</li>
