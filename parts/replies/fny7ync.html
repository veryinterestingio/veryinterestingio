			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to that - Although influenza H1N1 was replaced by H2N2 in 1957, and then by H3N2 in 1968, both of those viruses still had most of their genes derived from the 1918 H1N1.  And H1N1 returned in 1976, and continued to circulated until 2009, when it was replaced by a different H1N1, the pandemic strain - which is actually even closer to the 1918 strain, to the point that the 2009 and 1918 strains probably immunize against each other. </p>
<p>Influenza is a crazy mess, but bottom line is that 1918 remains the ultimate parent for all the seasonal flu strains that infect humans today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much of this is due to the virus itself evolving into a less virulent strain as opposed to the population simply having more immunity and genetic defenses due to exposure?</p>
<p>It's my understanding that other human coronaviruses don't produce long lasting total immunity like measles can, but rather long lasting partial immunity so that future reinfection will generally be less severe. Some of those strains are believed to have been in the human population for centuries, and so we obviously have numerous defenses both inherited from ancestors as well as from our own exposure to them throughout our lives and infections are usually just a mild cold. </p>
<p>I'm a little confused why you think that a best case scenario for COVID19 will be that it ends up like measles. Wouldn't a better and more realistic scenario be that it follows a trajectory similar to other URIs and simply becomes an endemic virus that causes mild illness for most people, with vaccines and treatments available to those who are more vulnerable? It seems like it's already well on its way to becoming something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s unlikely that the virus will evolve to reduced virulence, at least over a reasonable time frame. That’s a widely misunderstood myth about viral evolution. </p>
<p>It’s possible that childhood immunity would eventually lead to adults being at least relatively immune. That would essentially mean abandoning today’s adults and accepting that millions of them will die, until today’s children grow up and replace them. </p>
<p>Natural infections are not going to lead to herd immunity.  Vaccines are needed to reach that level of population immunity. </p>
<p>That leaves us with vaccination to reach herd immunity as the best-case scenario, that saves the most lives in the shortest time. </p>
<p>Endemic coronaviruses are probably a poor model for immunity to SARS-CoV-2, since the amount of inflammation (which drives immunity) is very different. SARS and MERS are better models, and experience with those viruses and their vaccines suggest that it’s reasonable to expect good immunity lasting for several years. </p>
<p>Of course much of this is speculation until we see how the vaccines perform, but it’s much more reasonable to expect effective, widespread vaccination in a reasonably short time than other scenarios - even though ill-informed media keeps pushing worst-case scenarios based on incorrect data, anecdote, and outright lies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very well said. With regards to certain viruses becoming a 'norm', viruses are more likely to be less pathogenic over time than otherwise. This is because the sole purpose of viruses is to replicate and if the host of the virus dies, the virus will not be able to do so. Thus, while viruses such as H1N1 may have become a seasonal influenza, they have picked up mutations over time to be less deadly compared to its original state. This is what we hope for in the case if SARS-CoV-2 continues to persist in the future.</p></div>		</li>
