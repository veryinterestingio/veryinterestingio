			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s definitely cortisol levels. If you’ve ever had to be on prednisone then you know how potent cortisol is as an anti inflammatory. </p>
<p>One time I was on a high dose (40mg), and I developed a double ear infection, sinus infection and bronchitis and I had no idea. Dangerous situation but really interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Please elaborate. How did the anti-inflammatory processes cause the double ear infection, sinus infection and bronchitis? That sounds very scary!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the prednisone is mimicking cortisol which /u/JaDBiNo described as being an immunosuppressant. So if your immune system is suppressed you are much more likely to suffer from any infection you might be exposed to. OP /u/Tmoore188 got super unlikely.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is why cortisone injection is not advised (except for emergency/necessary surgeries) in many countries amidst the coronavirus pandemic due to the risk of immunosuppression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to differ between Infection and Inflammation. Reduced inflammation, mediated by your immune system SHORT TERM, reduces your symptoms...but, if you have your middle ear full of staphylococcus aureus, then....thats gonna hurt too!
And a reduced immune system increases likelyhood to get sick.</p>
<p>Cancer treatment often suppresses your immune system, making the patient more susceptible to infections...</p>
<p>Yeah, medicine aint easy</p></div>		</li>
