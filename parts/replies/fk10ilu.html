			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to add to this by saying blenders tend to be high speed low torque, food processors tend to be low speed, high torque. This allows food processors to push their blades through tough vegetables and knead bread dough. It allows blenders to smash apart soft fruit and mix up liquids. For example, if you put boiled vegetables into a food processors it would mash them up; put the same vegetables into a blender and it will fling them to the sides where they’ll stick while the blades spin ineffectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't overstate how convenient they are if you do much chopping. I can chop onions in the food processor while I'm thinking about doing it with a knife, and that includes clean up. I have a medium size KitchenAid that rocks. I use it all the time to make chicken salad from rotisserie chicken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a problem I have:</p>
<p>I want to blend chives together in my potato soup such that all the chives get blended, the mixture turns green, and there are no little chive pieces left behind. Plus I know <em>it's possible</em> since I've seen a pro chef serve me it green before.</p>
<p>However, when I try to do it myself, I end up with a bunch of mini chive chunks in a pale potato soup. I tried with a food processor, but another factor that I might have messed up is how much soup base to also have (I may have had too much or too little).</p>
<p>Any tips on what to use here to achieve what I need?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Handheld immersion blender? I use it for a potato soup with greens in it and end up with smooth green soup- but it's usually something with larger leaves like arugula or lettuce. </p>
<p>I actually use it quite a bit and they're reasonably cheap and small to store, I would recommend trying it at least! Very easy to use with minimal cleanup too. </p>
<p>Just, um, make sure that sucker is at the very bottom of the pot or things go awry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make a chive puree and fold it in. Blanche and shock chives (cut into 2in pieces), throw in a blender with an ice cube or two. Blend til smooth. Fold that in and you're good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blender with a small amount of the liquid, start low and ramp up(works best with a blender that has a knob as opposed to button settings, like a vitamix). What you want is your chives liquified beyond recognition, that means blender. If it's a smooth puree soup I would use a blender for the whole thing, if you want chunks food processor is better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what my food processor does. </p>
<p>I'll confess, I don't really like my food processor. I don't think it does a good job of chopping. If I want everything really tiny, fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do know that you have to sharpen the blades periodically. I sharpen my food processor blades every year or 2. When you sharpen the blades you get and smaller and more even pieces as well as going threw food easier. You can tell that the blades are dull by running you finger along the edge to see if it is sharp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called that because if you can use it well, its a similar motion to strumming a mandolin. Also most of the time people spell the cooking tool &quot;mandoline&quot; as it was French originally. Just in case you ever need to be very specific about which one you're talking about lol.</p></div>		</li>
