			<div class="markdown"><p>Best they've managed to do is delay severity. I have what I call my baseline all the time and it gets worse throughout the day. I have some medication that lengthens that time. I'm passed being upset about it. I don't know what it's like to have a clear head, so I don't know what I'm missing. Would be nice to know though! :D</p></div>		</li>

<p>E: Seriously though, what treatments have you found most successful? Im doing flexeril, myofacial release/yoga, and, most importantly, weed &amp; not sitting at a screen for more than an hour. Took 30 years to figure all this out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might have the same thing though I'm not sure as I have haven't been diagnosed. Many of the muscles around my face as well as my entire neck will become more tense as the day goes on which seems to pressurize my entire cranium as well as pressure behind my eyes. Clonidine for blood pressure seems to alleviate it a bit as well as having a nap.</p></div>		</li>
