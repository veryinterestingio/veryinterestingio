<p>TL;DR the body does an immaculate job at affinity maturation and property selection that rivals any in vitro antibody engineering process in terms of throughput and identifying viable candidates</p>

<p>Can't really beat massively parallel trial and error for this.  I'd say there's probably a Nobel in it if someone can replicate the hypervariable proliferation followed by target selection, in a repeatable and extensible way, <em>in vitro</em>.  A desktop &quot;DIY antibody&quot; kit from Sigma would revolutionize more than a few research problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really would! We also REALLY need a high throughput method for intrabody engineering! So difficult to engineer for cytoplasmic solubility and affinity without it being low throughput or multistep. I want to get back into process dev for antibody discovery!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does exist. Sort of...</p>
<p>A random antibody library can be generated by introducing random sequences into CDR using PCR. The library can then be screened against specific targets of interest. The hit sequence can then be isolated and expressed recombinantly.</p>
<p>This has existed for at least a decade, but I am not away of any therapeutic antibody generated this way. It has its own set of hurdles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This method works well if your library that you’re mutagenizing is derived from an animal immune response. Not so great for naive libraries but yeast surface display or phage display are fairly high throughput. </p>
<p>I was using Tat inner membrane display since I was engineering an intrabody for an intracellular target and we didn’t have the money to immunize an animal. The screening method using this display method is incredibly low throughput so there is definitely room for improvement!</p></div>		</li>
