			<div class="markdown"><p>It is understandable that people want to take a “wait-and-see” approach. These are new vaccines and so people are nervous – when there are new developments people often want to wait to make sure all is well before adopting them, so that response is understandable – they want to see what happens to others before they take it themselves. I think it’s important to acknowledge and be empathetic about their concerns, first and foremost. But then you can have a conversation about it. </p>
<p>One thing that might be helpful is to remind them is that they will not be the first ones to take it. In fact, thousands of people participated in the trials that allowed us to know that it’s safe (e.g., the Pfizer/BioNTech enrolled over 40,000 people from all over the world). If it wasn’t safe, leading experts like Dr. Fauci would not have taken it.</p>
<p>I am hopeful that by the time the vaccine is ready for broad distribution, people will see that a lot of people from many different backgrounds have taken it and are doing well, and that will alleviate some concerns.</p>
<p>Overall though, we can acknowledge that it is not unreasonable to have concerns, but then take the time to answer the questions that address the concerns that people have.</p>
