			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be adding too much on your diet prior to this. The amount of salt added to enhance flavour would be, say, a half-teaspoon in an entire cake. It's generally below RDI levels of &quot;grams&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's been years since I did. now if I have some potato chips, it tastes like sand paper, but then I can actually taste other things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is entirely likely that salt intake within normal ranges for people who salt their food does not have any impact on blood pressure.</p>
<p>My experience as a yo-yo dieter is when I'm losing fat and deliberately taking grams of salt daily (because low carb diets have nearly no salt if you don't eat bacon or cheese) my blood pressure is healthy, when I am obese and not taking salt (because there's sufficient salt in pizza and Burger King) my blood pressure is high</p></div>		</li>
