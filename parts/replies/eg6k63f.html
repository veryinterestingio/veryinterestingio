<p>You still get sleepy at the end of the day even if you didn't move your body at all, after all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who was paralyzed for a few weeks I just wanted to say that's not entirely accurate. You get tired <em>eventually</em>, but if you don't do anything you won't be tired for a long time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all, at least not for me. I couldn't tell anything was wrong unless I tried to move. And really i didn't get a sensation of &quot;not moving&quot; so it's not like it hurt or felt like anything. I'd try to move my arm and it wouldn't move, that's all.</p>
<p>So, maybe stop trying to be awake? Ha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I had an epidural I was unaware that epidurals make you completely unable to move or feel your lower body. I had a panic attack that lasted about two hours. I made my mom rub my feet the whole time, hoping for any feeling. The only thing that finally calmed me down was when I could feel my pinky toe. It was wild. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not as well as when you're asleep, but it will happen, yes. While you're awake, your resting heart rate, even when you're not moving around, will still be higher than when you're asleep, for example. </p>
<p>The body is still usually slightly active even if you're stationary. Even if you're lying down, you might shift your position, reach for a glass of water, etc etc. In deep sleep, your body will move significantly less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. So recovery still happens, but not at an optimal rate. I'm guessing that better bouts of rest the following days might help on ''missed out'' recovery. Thanks for the answer :)</p></div>		</li>
