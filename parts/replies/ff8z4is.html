			<div class="markdown"><p>We can feel them pulling galaxies and through gravitational lensing along with a few other ways. It could be a whole bag of different kinds of matter but we lump it in “dark matter” and “dark energy” because we can’t see it on the EM spectrum. Hope this helps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong. We do know it's there. The evidence is overwhelming, it's secured knowledge and a Nobel prize has just been awarded. Reading about dark matter on the internet though you will likely get away with a, picture where how established dark matter  is is undersold massively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually been considered and no, it doesn't work. A full Kardashev 3 civilization, or even K2's would obscure most bands of light from their stars, but there is one thing that will always be there: heat. A Dyson swarm, even a Matrioska brain, would still be extremely visible in the infrared.</p></div>		</li>
