			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you mean fuel cell-powered cars, personally, I expect both types of electric vehicles, Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) are going to successfully make it in competition with Internal Combustion Vehicles.  BEVs, of course, are already coming down in cost as they are mass produced.  FCEVs will get a chance to do the same once cheap hydrogen is available at filling stations.</p></div>		</li>
