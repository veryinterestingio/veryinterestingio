<p>Some (but not all) rifts initiate with an eruption of flood basalts, an event for which we have no modern analogue. </p>

<p>The youngest large igneous province (LIP) is the Columbia River Basalt Group, which formed about 15 MYA ago and also the smallest LIP - meaning it &quot;only&quot; covers most of Washington state.</p>
<p>The LIP resulting from (or causing?) the breakup of Pangaea is the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), nowadays split into various fragments from Brazil to Morocco to Iberia. It is the largest known LIP by area, and one of the likely culprits of the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event, one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; extinction events.</p>
<p>Also another fun fact about the Columbia River formation: The mantle plume that created this LIP still exists, though over the eons has significantly died down. As the North American plate has slowly wandered east, it now sits below the Idaho/Wyoming/Montana border.<br />
We call it the Yellowstone hotspot.</p></div>		</li>
