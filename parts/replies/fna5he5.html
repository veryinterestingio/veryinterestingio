<p>It took me far too long to realize that I had trouble sleeping because I was too warm. I now keep my bedroom at 60 - 64 degrees F year-round, and adjust blankets so that my skin feels decidedly cool to the touch.</p>
<p>I am also religious about getting up at the same time each morning, work or no. As morning approaches while still in bed, I can often estimate what time it is by my heartrate - my circadian rhythm is that finely tuned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you have for someone that has done CBT-I... But the math doesn't help, it says I shouldn't change what I'm doing. I've been experimenting with my sleep hygiene for the past 9 years. I've tried Benadryl, lunesta, 3 or 4 different meds in the same class as amitriptyline, rozerim, restoril and ambien. Also sleep restriction and plenty of other therapy.</p>
<p>I refuse to believe I'm stuck... although it is the easier thing to accept.</p></div>		</li>
