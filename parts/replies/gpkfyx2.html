<p>I also feel this with game. When “i” think to much about the game like surviving, I can’t win. But when I get into that zone. Which I feel like it’s no longer me, but just my whole being taking over, I get so much so much better. </p>
<p>Now that you gave that analogy, I feel the same thing with it when it comes to playing game. I’m telling this man how to play the game. But once I really just let him play the game. I get into the zone. </p>
<p>Also I feel the same way with sport. Example bowling. I hate this sport. I only play it with friends . But in the beginning I think so much. How much the ball weight, the walk, the balance all off that. 2 beers in and I feel like I let “little man” take over and bam! In the zone. </p>
<p>I really love the analogy. Thanks for sharing.</p></div>		</li>
