			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean people are starting to use like artificial organs in culture now. You could get a lymph node in culture and have all that architecture. But the amount that you would grow would be way less than you could grow in let's say a rabbit.</p>
<p>The flip side is once you have a B cell that has the antibody you want, we can immortalize that B cell and grow that in cell culture no problem. Once we grow it, we can get the cell to start making antibodies and then harvest those. Generating a new (de novo) response where we aren't sure what the best antibody is (IE SARS-CoV2)  will always require a germinal centre reaction and it's just way easier and cheaper to do it in animals than culture.</p>
<p>I should add the vaccine part is easier because you basically essentially let the body decide what the best response is. Something that it does incredibly well. PLus a vaccine has memory. Antibody transfer is just transient and doesn't offer long protection and we have no idea how to graft memory B cells in a consistent manner for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you talking about using computer algorithms to predict antibodies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure which natural computing field to pin this down as I barely scratched the surface on this, but yeap, things as using supercomputers and big data for simulations to predict receptors, binding properties etc.</p></div>		</li>
