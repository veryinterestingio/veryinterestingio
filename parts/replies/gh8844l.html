			<div class="markdown"><p>Anthropology major here: Ken M is actually very right (their first comment anyway)! A main focus in archaeology ethics is that once a site has been &quot;dug&quot;, it cannot be undone- excavation is an inherently destructive process, and when an excavation is done poorly (poorly kept records, mistakes, typos, damages to items, etc) it is really taking something valuable from all of humanity to whom cultural heritage &quot;belongs&quot;, which cannot be recovered. It's serious stuff, unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just go there and notice all the marble is gone and there are just holes where the anchors were? Take a tour? It is very evident when you see the buildings and even forum with anchor holes and facades that dont look like they were made to face the air directly. It's not like the marble melted and yet everything else is well preserved. It was looted pretty hard upon first discovery.</p></div>		</li>
