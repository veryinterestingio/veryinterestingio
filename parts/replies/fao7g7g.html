<p>We had a 350 gallon tank for our herd which usually had 4 cows. In winter I still had to freeze my ass off every 2-3 days scrubbing (because they ALWAYS shit in the tank) and refilling it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was this a hobby farm or homestead? Or did you guys have row crops or other stock? A herd of 4 seems like it would produce more than a family could eat, but not enough to turn much, if any, profit. I guess that depends on how big a family, where you were, how much pasture and rain, and all that. </p>
<p>My family ranches and I am starting a job in rangeland management next year so I'm just interested in all the diversity of operations and how people make them work. Your family's is much smaller than what I'm familiar with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe, although I don't speak as an authority on the subject, that the answer would be that their bodies don't need to conserve water because of the amount of water that is in the grass that they eat. Think of the grass as water bottles growing out of the ground for the bison. It makes sense when you consider the sheer amount of grass that a buffalo eats in a day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bison are better at conserving water than cattle, but they still aren’t great at it. They will travel further from water then a cow will, but they still need to drink every day. Bison are adapted for  prairies and forests, not deserts. </p>
<p>I think it’s more helpful to compare them to an desert dwelling herbivore such as a kanagaroo rat that never needs to drink free water. They can get all the water they need from their food and metabolism, and their poo is dry as a bone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, cows drink a ton! They need between one and two gallons (depends on the weather or if they are lactating) per 100 lbs of body weight per day. Compare that to a desert adapted species like a kangaroo rat who never needs to drink free water. They can get everything they need from their food and metabolism.</p></div>		</li>

Just me personally, I weigh 140 so that would be 1.4-2.8 gallons of water for me.</p>
<p>My normal water consumption is probably around 1/2 - 1 gallon.</p>
<p>That's crazy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a big grey area.</p>
<p>Besides water for drinking, water is used in the production of corn/soy that they feed the cows in industrial agriculture.</p>
<p>Activists will attribute the water used to grow crops as being used by the cow - and inflate the numbers ridiculously.</p>
<p>The reality is, a cow is supposed to be living off grass (not corn/soy).</p>
<p>A cow raised on pasture would use significantly less water than a cow that is being force fed corn.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true, but why are you saying it like this is some kind of misrepresentation or lie on the activists side?</p>
<p>The whole point is that you need to include the <em>total</em> amount of water used in producing meat for consumption, even if its not water that is directly drunk by the animal itself but it is instead used to grow it's food. It still counts towards the total water used to produce the meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The calculation doesn't make a ton of sense.  I lot of cattle drink well water and then pee much of it out on the same ground it was pumped out of, so it's not all &quot;wasted&quot; like they make it out to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also by feeding them more grasses and alfalfa you improve the quality of the topsoil for the fields and reduce the fertilizer requirements for other crops. But it isn't as profitable as unsustainably dumping fossil-fuel derived fertilizer on cash crops year after year after year and taking home an extra 5% yield, at the cost of the viability of the farmland 30 years down the road.</p></div>		</li>
