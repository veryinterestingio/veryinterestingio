The Unistellar project has confirmed to me that people love observing the dark sky  and are willing to dedicate some of their free time to conduct scientific studies if we build the tools for them to do it easily. The eVscope is basically that. A modern and easy-to-use tool so every can see those distant galaxies and nearby asteroids from home but also help scientists with new data.</p></div>		</li>
