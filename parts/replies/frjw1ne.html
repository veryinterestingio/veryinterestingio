			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflammation also causes your vessels to become &quot;leaky&quot; in a process called extravasation. This fluid will leak into your tissue and will cause that &quot;achy&quot; pain you feel when you have the flu. This fluid contains WBCs that will go and kill whatever it's supposed to, which will lead to more pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the chemokines released is called bradykinin and one of its functions is to make us more sensitive to pain. It does this by sensitizing the pain receptors (TRPV1), lowering the threshold required for them to fire. So stimuli that would previously go undetected now set off a signal cascade that ends in a painful or burning sensation.</p>
<p>Edit: adding the explanation below.<br />
Basically, TRPV1’s job is to detect things that happen when there’s a problem (like acidic conditions, temperatures over 43C/109F, capsaicin, etc) and to let the nervous system know something is up. Even though the stimuli are all different, the result is the same. When TRPV1 fires, we feel a painful, burning sensation (though this can be more mild or more severe).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s the cytokines, which are little messenger molecules produced by the white blood cells, that cause inflammation to go up! Inflammation makes you more sensitive to pain, less hungry, more tired, more depressed, and just feel worse in general. To answer your second question, yes! ‘Sickness behavior’ is thought to be a motivational state your body takes on to protect itself and encourage healing during an illness, essentially discouraging unnecessary energy expenditures. Wiki has a nice entry on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question would be: Is the inflammation good/helpful for getting rid of the sickness? As in would eating anti-inflammatory foods when you have the flu reduce pain but also prevent your body from getting over the sickness sooner?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t understand the mechanism but I suffered from chronic inflammation for 15 years. Some days I couldn’t lift my arms over my head. After serious gut issues I spent months on an elimination diet and discovered that tomato, potato, and chocolate were causing it. A few years on and I am completely free of pain. I don’t know how much damage I did to myself but I’m thankful every morning I wake up without pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do reduce your inflammatory response. But often, your body goes overboard and so it’s not harmful to knock it down a peg. </p>
<p>The same thing applies to taking Tylenol. It’s best if used for screaming high fevers. Otherwise, let your body do its thing.</p></div>		</li>
