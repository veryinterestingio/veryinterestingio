			<div class="markdown"><p>An eight to twenty Milligram fly could not carry a one-pound coconut! Listen. In order to maintain air speed velocity, a fly needs to beat its wings two hundred times every second, right? It could be carried by an African fly! Oh, yeah, an African fly, maybe, but not a European fly, that's my point. But then of course, African flies are non-migratory. So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway. Wait a minute!  Supposing two flies carried it together! Nooo... They'd have to have it on a line... Well, simple! They'd just use a strand of creeper! What, held under the wings and calypters? Well, why not?</p></div>		</li>
