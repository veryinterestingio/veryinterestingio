			<div class="markdown"><p>What are you asking? I'm not sure I understand your question completely.</p>
<p>The day can be shortened by a change in its moment of inertia, very similar to a ballet dancer: If mass moves towards the ćenter of rotation, to conserve the angular momentum the rotational speed has to increase. The ballet dancer speeds up if she pulls her arms close, the earth speeds up if landmasses are moved towards the rotational axis or even by the leaves that fall to the ground in autumn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't Newton's Third mean that any angular momentum &quot;gained&quot; from a terrestrial source (whether earthquake or leaf) would have initially been stolen from the Earth to begin with, and thus the day actually doesn't move one way or another from these sources on a long enough timescale?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our length of a year is measured in days. If a day changes, our defining of a year changes due to measuring it by days whether the actual time it takes changes or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A year is defined as a single orbit around the sun. Days are measured as a single rotation of the Earth. The number of days in a year are a result of how many rotations we do during a single orbit around the sun, hence 365.24 days in a year.</p>
<p>If the revolution is changed such that a day now takes 48 of our current hours - 1 hour = 3600 seconds (seconds are defined independently of either orbit or rotation, it’s based on caesium (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second" target="_blank">SI second definition)</a>) - while the orbit does not change then a year is the same number of seconds/minutes/hours, but half as many days.</p></div>		</li>
