			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read there was an immunological survey in South American where they tested whole villages for exposure to rabies and found that a few percent of the residents had apparently been exposed and become immune. Basically their immune system threw it off &quot;early,&quot; so they lived through it and never knew they had it. The idea was that <em>symptomatic</em> rabies is (almost) always fatal, but that some people do survive &quot;pre-symptomatic&quot; rabies. Have you heard of this study, and is this an accurate lay characterization? I'm piggybacking this question because you might be in a good position to confirm, deny, or comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes a few populations in India, South America and Arabia are ‚Äòimmune‚Äô to rabies because of their genetics.  People traditionally drink their blood as a primitive postexposure prophylaxis.</p>
<p>As a scientist I have to oppose these unfounded claims as anti-rabies antibodies are destroyed in the acidic stomach.</p>
<p>As a human being, this might work for reasons we do not understand yet.</p>
<p>Or, a more plausible explanation is that these people were infected with an attenuated strain of rabies and they developed immunity against the pathogenic version.</p>
<p>We infect animals all the time with live attenuated rabies and most of them survive and develop juicy anti-rabies antibodies that we kill the animals for to use for research, diagnostics and cure.  Unfortunately this cruel path of science still has to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Apparently there really are some rare exceptions to the rule that untreated rabies is always fatal. Not any experiment anyone should try, though, because you're a goner if you develop symptoms. I tracked down <a href="http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0689#html_fulltext" target="_blank">the study that led to my question</a>. Likely you've seen it, linked it here for the benefit of eavesdroppers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the main topic, and I appreciate the insight on the rest of the post, but I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs any more or less cruel to use an animals body for life-saving medicine vs life-saving sustinenceü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre testing cosmetics here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading a study where a patient was symptomatic and went to the ER several times with what was later determined to be rabies, but they either fought it off eventually or died - no final outcome was known.  The hospital didn't get their name and the pt  kept leaving, so it's not known if the patient eventually succumbed or survived without treatmeny, but the presentation was atypical and indicated some immune systems might be able to fight it off even after it's symptomatic.  That's the only potential case of survival like this am aware of and it's so full of unknowns.  Thanks for the SA info I'll read up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In its simplicity is it an old virus? Like, other viruses affect fewer hosts because they've built up complexity over the millenia which made them host specific? Is rabies a very &quot;old&quot; sort of virus? Well... do we have anything resembling virus taxonomy that goes back more  than a few centuries? Or virus... fossils (virus are practically already a fossil lol, what would you do, crack open a rock and swab the inside).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That‚Äôs a very good question.  Rabies is known for centuries as the mad dog disease, even from ancient Egyptian writings.  Current form of rabies originates from southern Europe in the 15th century CE.</p>
<p>Searching for fossilized rabies in frozen dogs is plausible but potentially very dangerous - you do not want a real zombie outbreak.</p></div>		</li>
