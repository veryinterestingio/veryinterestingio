They really helped me get through my online anatomy and physiology course without losing my mind. But keep pushing forward and it'll all be over before you know it :) you got this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi Sophie,</p>
<p>I used to tutor Math and Physics in undergrad as a Math Major. </p>
<p>If you have any questions because you just can't find an answer through google or youtube or you need an explanation from a person and not a video, please feel free to pm me! </p>
<p>I can't answer everything but hopefully I can help if you get truly stumped!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try watching youtube videos. Studying will be easier if you've got someone to teach you. And protip: keep sweets and snacks on standby while studying. You'll get a headache if you don't eat anything while studying.</p></div>		</li>
