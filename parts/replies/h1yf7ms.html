			<div class="markdown"><p>About 0K: In laypeople terms,  the second law of thermodynamics says that heat flows naturally from an object at a higher temperature to an object at a lower temperature, and heat doesn’t flow in the opposite direction of its own accord.</p>
<p>Put a frozen dinner in the oven and it heats up.</p>
<p>Put a warmed dinner in the freezer and you've increased the energy (heat) in that system. If there's a thermostat, the compressor kicks on to try to move the heat from the freezer to the outside world.</p>
<p>You introduce energy (heat) to a system, but you have to remove (literally move to somewhere else) energy to make something colder.</p>
<p>Now that we've established to get very cold you have to take energy (heat) out of a system to cool it off, we can look at a basic example. </p>
<p>If you have a system with ten units of heat and a system with two units of heat, we can say that heat will flow from the ten units down to the two units, averaging six units (zeroth law, these systems can be said to be the same temperature). We've cooled the hotter system down and warmed the colder system up. It would never work (on its own, naturally) that the two units would flow up to the ten and we'd have twelve. </p>
<p>So if nothing exists at 0K, how can we remove heat from 0.006K (lowest recorded temperature)? Heat doesn't flow up. It flows down. We're trying to pull heat up from 0.006K but the entire universe is trying to shove heat down into that system. I'm this way, it is like a vacuum. You need something colder for the heat to flow to, but nothing is that cold, so we have this limit that may be unreachable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik it can’t happen, the work needed to drain any system entirely of energy and heat approaches infinity the closer and closer you get to absolute zero. It might be possible with the heat death of the universe in like a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years or however long that could take, but if my understanding of it is right even then it’s (the old universe) never absolute zero</p></div>		</li>
