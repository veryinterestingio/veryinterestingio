			<div class="markdown"><p>Really makes you wonder about how much of evolutionary potential we will never see since Earths is pretty much limited to what we have now. We could evolve some amazing stuff, but only off of the back of previous creatures. </p>
<p>One thing I always think about in regards to that, for some weird reason, are the Quarrians from Mass Effect. On their world, evolution was far more influenced by symbiosis over predation. Most of their native viruses and diseases benefitted the hosts instead of harming them, hence why their immune systems are so weak, later reinforced by living in sterile conditions.</p>
<p>I always wonder if life could actually evolve that direction. Maybe a primordial cell could have absorbed a type of mitochondria that produced way more ATP than ours, meaning it could share excess energy with other organisms. But would complex life still evolve without the predator/ prey dynamic? Or would it become even more pronounced, producing new types of life thanks to the extra energy? </p>
<p>More importantly, is there any way that evolution can drastically alter things we see as set in stone? E.g. Skelletons, could a 4 legged animal evolve into a 20 legged one over millions of years? Just because we haven't seen an example of it doesn't mean it's not possible. </p>
<p>But my current favourite topic, what species do we have now that can hybridiz? We like to think its only closely related animals, but recently scientists accidentally made a hybrid (just sperm + egg, no engineering) of a paddlefish and a sturgeon. While those animals LOOK closely related, they're separated by 184 MILLION YEARS! I can't overstate how long that is. And while the leading theory is something to do with their slow rate of evolution and numbers of chromosomes, it's still fucking insane!</p>
<p>I wonder what other animals can do something like that. I went on an odd tangent there, but I just think evolution is awesome. I especially like that it created humans, for the simple fact that evolution, the process with the mantra &quot;good enough&quot;, made a species with the capabilities to eventually create &quot;improved&quot; life. Imagine, it may have created a way in which life no longer needs to worry about constraints, where we can create totally new animals for new worlds, or even for Earth if it comes to that. </p>
<p>I just hope we don't waste our potential.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest if there were any beneficial viruses they're all integrated already. Also I think there's quite some symbiosis and paired evolution going on. It's just that evolutionary processes are very slow and the world is changing so fast right now. Evolution really starts working when you go over 40 generations of time. Which is easily multiple milennia</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's evidence to suggest Mitochondria <strong><em>are</em></strong> a symbiote that merged with Eukaryotic cells in our distant past, from which all plants, animals and Fungi decend.</p>
<p>RE: Evolution, we're currently in a bit of a renaissance in terms of our understanding of the relationship between the raw machine code that makes up life (DNA) and what it does. We're approaching the point where we may be able to <em>decide</em> how we evolve from now on, with all the moral and ethical dilemas which surround that...</p></div>		</li>
