			<div class="markdown"><p>YMMV. My deodorant (spray type, non-antiperspirant) works so much better with hair. The few times I have shaved or trimmed way back, it felt less effective, and I felt more sweaty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol.  </p>
<p>Depending on your preferences, Old spice has a new gimmick antiperspirant. It has a grid surface like some of the gels but is an antiperspirant. So you can really work it into you underarm bush without using more than you really need. Smell good and long lasting too(legit 48hrs under heavy labor)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You talking about Old Spice's soft solid deodorants? Their &quot;red zone&quot; line or whatever? That's not remotely new, I've been using it for at least a decade if not more. And what you say is exactly why I like it. 1-2 clicks to get some deodorant out of the holes, and then rub that shit in vigorously. The label says 3 clicks, but that's waaaay too much.</p></div>		</li>

Deodorant is pretty disgusting if you have a long day in the overheated office, because it then smells of a mix of BO with Deodorant. Urgh</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if I use antiperspirant I sweat like a pig. Like soak through every shirt I owned. In high school and college i was super self conscious about it and tried about every antiperspirant I could get my hands on. In grad school, <del>in a bout of depression</del> living he academic dream, I couldn't be assed to go buy antiperspirant but I had a stick of regular old spice or something I had bought by accident and thrown in a cupboard. I didn't sweat at all. Being a scientist I bought new antiperspirant AND regular deodorant and did a series of tests, and yeah like 8 years later I can say with great confidence that antiperspirant makes me sweat like a hog and my whole teenage anxiety was self induced... I don't know why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone needs antiperspirant. </p>
<p>The labels are usually marked with a distinction between the two(had to explain this to my couponing wife), with antiperspirant labeled as such; and labelled deodorant lacking the word antiperspirant. Not the most intuitive or clear labelling, but it also does not matter for most people. Only those of us sensitive to one or the other would care about the difference, along with us sweaty bastards.</p></div>		</li>
