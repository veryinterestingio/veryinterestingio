			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - it's radically increasing the volume of the air moving through by heating it a ton, but keeping the cross section the same. As such, the exhaust must be moving far faster than the intake. This is also where all that thrust comes from - throwing the exhaust put the back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It primarily increases the temperature, which means the same unit of air that entered is now less dense and a lot bigger. Since the mass flow rate is essentially constant, minus some small amount of added fuel mass, and the volume flow rate increased, the velocity has to increase as well. All combustion engines are heat engines and primarily work by heating air so that it will expand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But WHY. It's so you can recover the energy from the expanding gases.  If you just let it expand directly into the atmosphere much of the momentum is perpendicular to the direction of travel, and doesn't help propel the rocket forward.</p></div>		</li>
