			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for pointing this out. My grandfather explained the theory of relativity to me when I was a kid, but I did not get it until much later, at which point I just thought &quot;Well you're just perceiving it differently because of the speed it takes to reach your eye.&quot;</p>
<p>So to see there is a big distinction that accounts for that is great to learn.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What’s super interesting actually is how things <em>actually</em> look to your eyes travelling near the speed of light. One of the craziest effects is that you can actually see the <strong><em>back</em></strong> of an object in the right circumstances, and objects will appear to rotate.</p>

<p>Top is 90% speed of light, bottom is stationary. The cubes aren’t actually rotating, but they appear to. It’s called Terrell Rotation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is maybe easiest to understand with light clock.(one photon captured between 2 mirrors)</p>
<p>If we were to capture one photon between 2 mirrors in a way that in bounces from one side to another in 1 sec. When clock is in rest photon travels ~300 000 km from one side to the other, but if clock was on the move to a outsider photon would not travel in a streight line but would zig zag, the faster the clock moves the longer the path of a photon is but the speed of light is constant so his time slows to 'compensate' for the more distance it covers. So his internal clock does seem to slow down. </p>
<p>It is confirmed as some particles with really short life span, cover more ground than they 'should'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physics noob here. Doesn't the actual time we observe lightning strikes involve the time it takes for light to reach our eyes anyway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is a light time delay. If you were measuring when a lightning strike happened down to the microsecond you’d absolutely need to take account of light travel time, even ignoring special relativity!</p>
<p>The big deal with relativity is that the lightning strikes don’t just appear to happen at different times from the non-stationary frames - they <em>genuinely do</em> happen at different times. You make your measurements, correct for the light travel time, and write down that one happened before the other. No refinement of your measurements will correct that, because it’s reality.</p>
<p>Hence this idea that time is relative!</p></div>		</li>
