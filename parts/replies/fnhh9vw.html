			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. It can be very difficult for an owner to determine the reason for a dog slowing down. Sometimes it is just related to aging or even obesity, but it can also be due to cardiovascular disease, or more commonly, pain from osteoarthritis. The good news is that many of these conditions are treatable. Your veterinarian will be a great resource to help determine the underlying cause and to offer treatments that might ameliorate the clinical symptoms, when possible. -- Dr. Tolbert</p></div>		</li>
