Also, what if I wanted the tints to mix on my own, could I get those?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each store might have a slightly different formula, but typically for a primary blue you'd do something like 10-12oz of phthalo blue into a clear base paint. If the phthalo isn't the perfect primary blue (maybe a little too much green undertone), they could adjust it by adding a few drops of one of the brighter reds to cancel that green out.  </p>
<p>My store didn't sell the colorants, but they are available:<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can buy tint but that stuff isn't cheap and the smallest you can get is like a quart.</p>
<p>As for 'pure' blue, you'd be talking about reflected light of a single frequency you define as blue.  That's not really what paint is.  You can get a single pigment like aquamarine or cobalt blue, but even those have a characteristic spectrum.</p>
<p>Realistically, just find the paint chip you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you consider to be pure blue. If it's phthalo blue or aquamarine blue you can get those colorants. If it's not, you will have to add another color to nudge it over to the color you need BUT the more of other colors you add the less bright or saturated the resulting color will be. Like if you mix red and yellow together you get orange but it is duller, sadder looking orange than if you used an orange colorant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically paint stores and sections are decades behind the times? If they have all that other stuff it seems super simple to add some that automatically translates hex to paint colors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. One problem is actually matching the hex color on screen considering monitors are slightly different. Another problem would be that you'd have to find colorant/tint recipes that would translate into hex code. Maybe you could break it down to each colorant/tint is matched to a hex code but then you'd still need to figure out how much tint of each color to make X color. That would be hard to translate into hex.</p>
<p>Prehaps whatever they use to design prints for clothing? (As in screen printed tees and the like) Unless that uses hex code. I'm not sure how they make the colors/dyes/whatever to do screen prints on clothing.</p>
<p>Source: Worked as a paint specialist/color match expert for Home Depot for several years . Also did the exact same things u/jojawhi did in their specialty store.</p>
<p>P.S. hex is just the example I'm using but I think it's pretty much across the board for all &quot;virtual color codes&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, sorry for misrepresenting your position! I didn't realize that Home Depot paint departments did in-depth colour matching. It's fun, right?  </p>
<p>And you're right, it would be difficult to write a program that was able to translate hex into a colorant formula for many reasons. A lot of people here have already said that hex's RGB is problematic, so a CMYK system would work better. Still though, you also have to take into account the base paint (white/medium/clear) and all the different ways to achieve similar colors with different pigments (like using Burnt Umber vs Brown Oxide with Lamp Black and Yellow Oxide to make a neutral taupe). It might require someone sitting down and actually matching by eye a bunch of core colors and their codes to colorant formulas and then writing an algorithm to match the rest. Would probably take a lot of time and cost a lot for only a small benefit.</p></div>		</li>
