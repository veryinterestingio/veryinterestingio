			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes.</p>
<p>Eccentricity (e) is the measure of how elongated an orbit is. If you have a circular orbit (e=0) and accelerate at a given point, you're elongating the orbit (0&lt;e&lt;1, and there's a point where the orbit has so much eccentricity it becomes a parabola (e=1), it keeps going and going without coming the other way around. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OrbitalEccentricityDemo.svg" target="_blank">Here's a diagram where the green line is a parabola</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's dope. So what is special about that e=1 angle? Because from that diagram I can still imagine an elipse that would come all the way back around. In fact I can imagine one even from the blue line.</p></div>		</li>
