<p>Actually this is not necessarily the case. Bankruptcy is declared when a person doesn't have the cash to pay an immediate debt, which just means they don't have liquid assets available. A person can have a ton of property and stakes in privately held companies, but not be able to make loan payments or acquire another loan on demand. Their main assets might be significantly larger than their total debts (I actually think this is fairly common for personal debts for rich people), but they are still stuck with a cash-flow problem that could result in bankruptcy.</p></div>		</li>
