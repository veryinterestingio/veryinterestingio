			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. My parents used their cordless home phone infrequently as I grew up. the battery was useless for anything longer than 15-20 minutes after a couple of years. These batteries were stocked every where when I was younger, because they would absolutely wear out just like modern phone batteries. If you didn’t notice that the batteries were terrible, you weren’t using the phone much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you use it for an extended period of time. It's only jobs are sending and receiving 1 type of wireless signal and decoding and encoding the audio transmitted over it</p>
<p>Smartphones are doing hundreds of other things while on that phone call</p>
<p>So baseline of the battery life on a big block of cells in a home phone is going to be stretched much much farther than a cellphone</p></div>		</li>
