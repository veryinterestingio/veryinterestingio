			<div class="markdown"><p>The important thing to add about student loans is that they essentially destroy a traditional market.  You're giving 18 year olds access to six figure loans.  If a college raises its price by 10%, they know that kids will be able to get loans to cover it.  Then colleges use that money to add amenities like rec centers and new dorms.  Which means they can charge more.  In a normal economy, you can't keep raising prices without offering something substantially more attractive, but universities can!  It's because of these loans.  And a college education has become so essential, that price doesn't phase people anymore because it's just a necessary expense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I just think universities a particularly shady with how they hide their costs between the lines.</p>
<p>Ateast a Mercedes dealership will straight up try and you that you can’t afford this car. If you drive away with it that’s your problem.</p>
<p>Universities just tell you that their cost is so high because of the “quality of education”, and that the average student makes $x (eventually) to justify it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean we don't need a million administrative costs and a bunch of on campus bull shit that ultimately doesn't affect quality of education so some amin can boast how they increased attendance 150% year over year?</p></div>		</li>
