			<div class="markdown"><p>How did it start in the first place then? I mean it had to come from somewhere and if it's human-only and can't just appear and hasn't appeared in a long time.. then how did it appear the first time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smallpox is an ancient disease. There is evidence of infection of smallpox <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/history/history.html" target="_blank">thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt</a> and likely smallpox evolved with humans over the past millions of years. There are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818276/" target="_blank">related poxviruses</a> that are genetically very similar to smallpox. Monkey pox infection in humans causes a similar disease as smallpox and camelpox virus infection of camels causes a similar disease as smallpox would in humans. There was likely a common ancestor to these 3 viruses that over thousands of years accumulated mutations in its DNA and evolved to 3 different viruses:
-Variola virus causes smallpox in humans
-Monkeypox virus infects a variety of rodents (and occasionally humans)
-Camelpox virus infects camels</p>
<p>So to answer your question, smallpox &quot;started&quot; by evolving over many many years from an ancestor virus. Bacteria and viruses have ancient ancestors they evolved from just like humans. </p>
<p>It is possible that a related virus could find an opportunity to evolve and accumulate changes in its DNA to readily infect humans. The evolution of smallpox took place over millions of years so there is no immediate risk of a new smallpox appearing. </p></div>		</li>
