			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool experiment was done where they had folks wear noise cancelling headphones while they ate crunchy potato chips. When folks worse the headphones, they couldn't perceive the crunch, and rated the chips as being &quot;stale&quot;. </p>
<p>Folks that lose their hearing are liable to eat less crunch foods because they don't receive the positive feedback of the &quot;crunch&quot; sound while they munch.  </p>
<p>So it turns out that HEARING also has a huge impact on the perception of texture and the pleasure people take in eating. It's a weird side effect of acquired hearing loss that food might becoming less appetizing.</p>

<p>a quick google says there are 10 types of smells to go along with the 5  tastes.  (a livescience article)</p>
<p>And one can point out that there are industries that are constantly trying to synthesize tastes (artificial sweetners, flavoring, like vanilla for instance) and smells (there are a lot of air freshners, perfumes, colognes, etc).  It is not trivial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's interesting about oleogustus (the fat flavor), is that by all accounts it's actually an <em>unpleasant</em> flavor. At least in high quantities. Subjects typically describe it as rancid.</p>
<p>So, there's two likely explanations for why fatty foods taste good. One is that it's not the flavor of fat, but rather the mouthfeel. Think of the rich, filling sensation of hot, freshly buttered popcorn in your mouth. </p>
<p>Two is that oleogustus is actually a pleasant flavor, but only in very small quantities. This isn't crazy, for example saltiness is kind of like this. Salted foods taste good, but overly salted foods are usually gross.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can actually taste more than just those! The basic 5 you mentioned (sweet, sour, savory, salty, and bitter) are all receptors on taste buds on your tongue.  Scientists hypothesize that there are also taste receptors for different types of fat. All of those are sensed by your 7th cranial nerve (Facial nerve, corda tympani branch), which enervates the front of the tongue. </p>
<p>But we also have sensors for other tastes including: spicy, minty, and carbonation (CO2). Those are sensed by the 5th cranial (trigeminal nerve).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is spicy a taste?  I thought that was handled by the TRVP1/temperature receptor, and the flavors came from the rest of the fruit?  Now I have to extract pure capscasin and see if it tastes like something or just feels like something by itself.</p>
<p>Why do we only taste the minerals in water instead of the water itself, like dogs can?</p>
<p>Also I'm really curious how CO2 taste works since the gas doesn't really smell like anything at low concentrations.  Could this actually be the H2CO3 carbonic acid that's also present in carbonated drinks being detected by the sour receptors?</p>
<p>That's really cool about those other nerves, do they both terminate in the tongue?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's hard to decide what a &quot;taste&quot; is. You can have a broader or a more specific definition. Maybe some people want to say that &quot;spicy heat&quot; isn't a taste. But we have a receptor for it, we perceive a sensation, and it affects how we perceive food. Why is that fundamentally different than having a receptor for bitter or for umami? Just because it isn't on the tongue? </p>
<p>Studies have shows that perception of CO2 is NOT due to the presence of carbonic acid. It is a sensation over and above the presence of the acid.</p>
<p>cranial nerve 7 goes to the front of the tongue. trigeminal nerve has several branches. The one that is relevant here is the branch that gives sensation to the lower jaw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't taste spicy and CO2 they way you taste other things.</p>
<p>With spicy food, the capsaicin activates the receptors associated with burning in your mouth. And we can say it isnt a taste as capsaicin will have the same effect if you get it on a number of other parts of your body. Where as a saline solution will taste salty, but you wont feel anything if you were put a drop in your eye.</p>
<p>As for CO2, it doesn't have a taste itself. Instead when it is dissolved into a liquid, like water, it forms minute amounts of carbonic acid which has a sour bitter taste. You can make soda water with n2o and it doesnt have a taste, though it isnt nearly as bubbly because of the difference in solubility between the gases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And you're incorrect about the CO2 being related to the carbonic acids. Studies looked at both bubbly and flat champagne. When the champagne was carbonated, it affected the overall taste of the champagne. When it's flat it is perceived as &quot;sweeter&quot;. You can do the same experiment with soda. Flat soda and bubbly soda have the same pH. But you can't pretend they &quot;taste&quot; the same!</p></div>		</li>
