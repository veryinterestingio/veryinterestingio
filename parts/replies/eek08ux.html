			<div class="markdown"><p>If the speed of light is an absolute in any frame of reference, how is this possible? From the perspective of passengers on that ship, crossing four light years in 65 days significantly surpasses the speed of light (yes, I understand that from a &quot;neutral&quot; vantage point the trip still takes four years). Does that mean that, for those on the ship, since their maximum velocity is still <em>c</em>, the distance traveled is compressed? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're forgetting that speed is a function of distance over time. Distance is relative between two time frames. Light works normally for those aboard the ship, the universe just squeezes together so that they can pass that distance without violating the speed of light relative to their own time frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait...</p>
<p>So, from light's perspective, from when it gets emitted it instantly arrives at whatever touches , regardless of 'distance?'</p>
<p>Does that mean from light's perspective, everything is touching?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you made this trip, spent 1 day there, then came back you'd have only aged about 4 months while people on earth would be 8* years older?</p>
<p>If so, that's amazing. Simply amazing.</p>
<p>*Edit: 8 years not 4</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If velocity is relative, from the perspective of the ship they are stationary and the earth is moving away at 99% of the speed of light. So why would the people on the ship be younger if they made a round trip and not the people on earth. Is it to do with the fact that it is the ship that has to accelerate to turn around not the earth? (As acceleration isn't relative)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about people on Alpha Centauri?  </p>
<p>Not only is the ship moving relative to Earth and Sol, it is also moving relative to AC and it's sun, and all three are moving relative to the center of the Galaxy (and galaxies relative to each other). </p>
<p>When we consider whether or not another planet might be habital, are we looking at how fast that planet is orbiting it's sun and thus how much quicker or slower time may be passing for living creatures there?</p>
<p>Or am I over complicating it?</p></div>		</li>
