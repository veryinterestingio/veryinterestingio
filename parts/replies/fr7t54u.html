<p>Tribe 2, which had a sizeable refugee population outside the country, gathered forces and attacked Tribe 1 from outside the country and managed to overrun Tribe 1's forces.</p>
<p>Tribe 2 commits some atrocities as well as it takes ground, making large numbers of Tribe 1 to flee the country and become refugees. Tribe 2 takes over the country.</p>
<p>A series of trials are held at varying levels of success and fairness. The country establishes a Unity and Reconciliation commission to try and keep the peace between Tribe 1 and Tribe 2.</p>
<p>Tribe 2 still controls the government today and the leader of Tribe 2 forces who took the country is still the political leader of Rwanda (25 years later.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have 6 ethnic groups...... 6 really similar ethnic groups. After WW1 ethnic group 1, which already had a country before the war takes lead of a new country containing the other 6. It was a semi stable-ish kingdom. WW2 comes along and ethnic group 2, helps the Axis powers overrun the country. This makes the other 5 ethnic groups resent ethnic group 2 for being collaborationist. The  Red Army “liberates” this multi ethnic country at the same time as local communist partisans. A communist (but not Stalinist) dictator finds his way to power. Resources are more equally distributed but it’s still an authoritarian regime. The communist policies strip away some aspects of ethnic group 1-6s culture. After the USSR collapses ethnic group 3 petitions the government for independence. The government actually lets them vote on it. Ethnic group 2 says they want independence too, ethnic group 1 says<br />
no. Ethnic groups 4,5 also say the want independence, the government also says no. Ethnic groups 2,4,5,6 rebel. Ethnic group 4 is mostly Islamic, ethnic group 2 is on a nationalist / religious high following anti-communist protest. Ethnic group 5 and 6 don’t really like each other but fight along side to rid themselves of ethnic group 1s influence. Ethnic group 1 uses heavy artillery on civilian forces in their capital. Ethnic group 2 starts a genocide of mostly Islamic civilians in area that used to be controlled by ethnic group 4. Ethnic group 6 is seen as an extension of a separate already existing country so ethnic group 5 gets mad when they proclaim their own independence. The UN steps in spearheaded by the US and begins bombing runs against belligerent factions. A peace treaty is signed a bit later basically solidifying the borders we see today.</p></div>		</li>
