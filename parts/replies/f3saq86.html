			<div class="markdown"><p>I‚Äôm glad you can picture the process, albeit very simplified! Hopefully that keeps reminds you to apply enough soap (not over the top, but also not too little), then rub your hands to apply the soap every where and make sure it reaches all the ridges and crevices of your palm and back of hand where all the bacteria‚Äôs reside, and finally, rinse all the soap away to get rid of all the bacteria/dirt as you think to yourself saying Hasta la Vista, Baby! to the bacteria. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is the mixture of the soap dragging the bacteria/oils away from your hand the reason why it is more effective than hand sanitizer? Also, does that mean that soap will always be the most effective way to get germs off of us, or will they still be able to evolve and become resistant to soap and hand washing??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell, yes. The soap allows the bacteria, and dirt etc to be lifted from the surface and rinsed away. Hand sanitizer might kill (some of) the bacteria, but it doesnt wash it away. Given that what makes some bacteria nasty is the chemicals they excrete, it's better to get rid of it all. Additionally, viruses are pretty hardy and might not be damaged much by hand sanitizer (usually isopropanol in a gel), so they can still pose a threat to you as well. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course, by washing your hands with soap you wash off your own oils which keep your skin supple and moist. Always moisturize!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hand sanitizer will kill most gems with alcohol by displacing water and drying the bacterium out. But gems also poop out toxic chemicals which hand sanitizer does not affect.
Soap will physicaly remove both the toxins and bacteria and is the better option if it is available.</p></div>		</li>
