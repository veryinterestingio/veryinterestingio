<p>The key is that insects don‚Äôt make these decisions by choice, their flight patterns are very much controlled by their nerves responding to stimuli (smells) and a whole lot of randomness.</p>

<p>Does this scale up? Are we ultimately just controlled by our nerves responding to stimuli and just think we have free will?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Everything has a cause that you're not in control of, especially when you think about it on physical and biological levels. Search &quot;Determinism&quot;. But you can always define &quot;free will&quot; as &quot;doing what you want&quot;, even if you were not in control of what you wanted in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in a theoretical philosophical perspective, humans may not have a free will. In practice though, even the most stubborn philosophers consider themselves to have a free will in everyday settings.</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, insects never worry about that philosophical paradox. Their nerves react much like our reflexes. </p>
<p>Just as you don‚Äôt choose to contract your pupils in bright light or vary your heart rate when exercising, the mosquito does not choose to fly in a seemingly random target-seeking pattern. It just does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you can raise your right arm for absolutely no reason if you want to, humans aren't driven purely by stimuli in the same way less intelligent insects etc. are</p>
<p>that being said determinism is an interesting concept, i.e. if you were fed the exact same stimuli, in the exact same situation, with the exact same starting point, you would make the exact same decisions, or at least not meaningfully different ones. while we can never actually test this properly without control over time itself it's a fun thought experiment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I might raise my right arm - or even my left arm - somewhere later down the line when I've totally forgotten about your comment, but then the stimulus would be me having read about determinism, and wanting to do something disprove it because I found it disquieting.</p></div>		</li>
