			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel you man. I lived in an apartment just like that and it was terrible. 5 college kids above us and would have parties with like 80 people. We eventually bought a house and it's so amazing having nobody live above you. Good luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After all my adult life in apartments,  we moved into our house, which has old hardwood floors that squeak. Took me a year to stop (momentarily) worrying about disturbing the people downstairs. There was just our own basement. </p>
<p>No more beige cheap carpets. No more eggshell walls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually live in a student apartment complex. It's basically an apartment complex but they only rent out to students since we're a small college town and campus itself is only 1-1.5 miles away. Rent includes all utilities including wifi and cable and each student gets their own, pretty decently big bedroom. It saves us the headaches of having to deal with bills for other things like water, electricity, and garbage but the building is old. They redid out kitchen 3 years ago and some units had their floors re-done which is why the girls above us have hardwood floors. I first thought it'd be great to have new floors but they never re-did ours and now I realize how stupid of an idea it was to rip out the carpets on a multi-level apartment complex that exclusively houses students.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my old apartment, we were required to have carpet/rugs covering a large portion of our living spaces. I’d be curious if the lease has similar language that was being ignored. (We ignored ours as we were on the first floor with a basement under us and we’re quiet people).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lived in one of those but with several thousand students in en suite rooms with about 12 sharing kitchen and living room per &quot;pod&quot;. I think at one point it was more about just crossing off a name from the list than matching. &quot;Oh hi did we have sex yet? No!? Shit let's go&quot;. It was raunchy. </p>
<p>Would do again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As bad as you'd think. This was one of those brand new apartment building complexes. Ours wasn't lived in before. Community pool. Gym (that I thought I'd use but never did), things like that. Seemed great. But they build them really quick but really cheap. No sound proofing at all. The apartment above us would get SO LOUD, we would not be able to hear our TV from our couch. In the laundry room, we would have the ironing board collapsed but leaning up against the wall. It made it rattle.</p>
<p>They moved out before we did so that was a little but of relief but I do not look back fondly on those days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a teenager I lived in an apartment and my upstairs neighbors had two little kids who ran up and down the carpeted hallway for hours. It was really loud and annoying, but that was nothing compared to years later when I stayed at a boyfriend’s apartment and his upstairs neighbor wore her big clunky high heeled shoes in the kitchen on linoleum. Clomp clomp clomp, I’ve never heard anyone walk so loudly before.</p></div>		</li>
