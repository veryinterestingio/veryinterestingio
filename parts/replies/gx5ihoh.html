			<div class="markdown"><p>I am able to vary the heartbeat rate by using 'mudras' - the positioning of the tips of the finger tips. Through the use of mudras I change my breathing pattern - it happens on its accord based on the mudra. I am a yoga practitioner. I also can cause the temperature of my palms and fingers vary by 'mudras'. It just happens. I know that is not in my mind, because others can feel the cold hands. What is happening here?</p></div>		</li>

<p>A yoga practitioner about 20 years ago demonstrated that he could vary which part of lungs would expand depending on the positioning of the finger taps and the palms. He could increase or decrease his heartbeat with manipulations of the breath and the mudras. I later discovered 'bandhas'. And by incorporating 'bandhas' and 'mudras' into yoga asanas I could experience tingling sensations across different parts of the body. If you were to keep your hand over my head without touching it, you could feel a column of cold air gushing out. Same experience for you if you could keep your palms over my palms without touching them. Not sure what is happening. Please note that I did not have any kundalini awakening experience.</p></div>		</li>
