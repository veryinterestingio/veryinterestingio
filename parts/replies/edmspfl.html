<p>Sea ice is visibly different from an ice cap on land, any Arctic explorers would notice that.</p>

<p>Pretty much. Sea ice is of course frozen sea water, with very little topographical irregularities. &quot;land&quot; ice is compacted snow and of course has significant irregularity in topography as it builds up on the underlying land. The two are very different colors and even smells, so anyone familiar with sea ice and snow ice would be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>In fact, the north sea is so topographically uniform (for the most part), you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear:_Polar_Special" target="_blank">drive a  truck</a> to the north pole with proper equipment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this super interesting. I figured most of the entire North Pole area would be snow-covered anyway - wouldnâ€™t a pretty thick layer of snow ice build up over the sea ice and make the whole area look the same? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, the north pole doesn't get a lot of precipitation because it's mostly surrounded by land and the majority of weather patterns don't actually go up into the Arctic, they blow West to East or moisture in them dumps out on land.</p>
<p>Looking at a US high arctic town, Utqiagvik/Barrow - 71 degrees north Latitude. It's cold/dry and classified as a polar climate and gets desert levels of precipitation - less than 5&quot; rain equivalent a year</p>
<p>Alert Canada, Canada's northern most community at 82 degrees north only gets 6.23 inches of rain equivalent a year</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The North Pole is technically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_desert" target="_blank">desert</a>, because it doesn't get much precipitation. All the moisture is locked in the ice. The South Pole is also a desert - the world's largest desert, actually. No sand, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this from first-hand experience: it smells like brine. If you have a chunk of sea ice, you smell the sea. When sea ice forms the salt isn't actually freezing with it, it's caught in the ice in tiny droplets of very high salinity brine. The brine will slowly work it's way down through the ice if it's around long enough, so older sea ice is actually pretty much just frozen water and wouldn't have that smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no expertise whatsoever, but I'm guessing that sea ice, because it's formed from salt water, has salt (go figure) and other impurities in it (like marine microorganisms) that would make it smell different from snow ice, which is mostly-pure freshwater.</p>
<p>Again, though, just guessing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So it doesn't really count, imho. People shouldn't think you could drive a regular truck there, that's for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first time I flew to China it was a Chicago-Beijing flight that went straight over the top. Polar ice cap isn't a solid sheet but more like a pond that has been thawed and remfrozen. It's very uneven and has tons of gaps where water peeks through.</p>
<p>I've also seen Greenland from the air, on the way back from Iceland. It's a solid white mass and looks a lot more like a snow-covered hillside. It's also higher in elevation than sea level, but the polar cap is not.</p>
<p>TLDR: sea ice: level but not smooth. Frozen pond. Land ice: smooth but not level. Snowy hill.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Woah I've never thought about the fact that flights could go north/south to get to the other side of the earth rather than east/west.</p></div>		</li>
