			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, this is typically caused by people not following the recommended dosage.  More specifically overdose.</p>
<p>Any medication can be dangerous if taken incorrectly.  </p>
<p>The margin or safety for Tylenol is greater than ibuprofen only because the levels needed to reach toxicity are much greater.  </p>
<p>You need to take a lot more Tylenol to damage your liver than you need to take ibuprofen to damage your kidneys.</p>
<p>Neither is a completely safe drug.</p>
<p>Nothing is completely safe.  Not even water.  Drink enough and you'll die of water toxicity.  However, it's considered &quot;generally safe&quot; because you'd have to drink ALOT of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is patently incorrect.  In terms of acute overdoses taking enough ibuprofen to cause acute kidney damage is <em>much</em> less likely than taking enough Tylenol to cause acute liver damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always heard that Acetaminophen is significantly harsher on your liver than Ibuprofen. And that ibuprofen might be hard on your stomach but is safer for your liver, which is why I’ve heard to take Advil when your hungover rather than Tylenol. Was I just given bad information?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes and no. Acetaminophen is processed in liver so it's definitely harsher on your liver than ibuprofen which is processed in kidneys. They affect different organs.</p>
<p>But! Both alcohol and acetaminophen are processed through liver, so taking it after a night of drinking would be a bad idea. In that case ibuprofen would be safer option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weirdly enough, alcohol intake is protective against acetaminophen associated liver damage. Long-term alcoholics can be at risk of increased liver damage from acetaminophen, but this risk is more hypothetical than clinically realistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are actually correct.  Acetaminophen is harsher on the liver than ibuprofen. </p>
<p>However, ibuprofen is significantly harsher on the kidneys than acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Basically, it's one or the other.</p>
<p>Depending on which doctor you talk to you will likely get different opinions.</p>
<p>However, the prevalent one I hear is that all things considered Tylenol is the safer bet as you typically have to take ALOT of acetaminophen to cause liver failure whereas a moderate amount of ibuprofen can cause kidney damage.</p>
<p>If you already have damage to one or the other your doctor may recommend one over the other.  </p>
<p>For example, I have kidney failure and am on dialysis.  I can take the occasional Tylenol, but any ibuprofen is completely off limits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NSAID nephrotoxicity is usually associated with dehydration or when combined with diuretics and some blood pressure drugs. Nephrologists are a little overzealous to say it should be taken off the market. They are subject to observational bias because they see the worst case scenarios, not the millions of people who take it with no problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't argue if Nephrologists are overzealous one way or the other.</p>
<p>I can only say what I hear day in and day out.  </p>
<p>I provided a starting link for people to do their own research from Kidney.org in an earlier post.</p>
<p>Personally, I would prefer to not take the chance given the possibilities.</p></div>		</li>
