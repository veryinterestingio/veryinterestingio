			<div class="markdown"><p>What can you not like about it? Maybe the fact that they make a TV remote - which we bury in our lap, under our cushions and inside blankets while we watch and then get up sleepily, sending it flying across the room - out of fucking GLASS!</p>
<p>Never had any TV remote break, no matter how bad I treated it. AppleTV remote shattered in a few weeks, cost about 80$ replacement and now needs a rubber case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it's mostly symmetrical so if you just grab it in the dark half the time you're holding it upside down. I know someone who glued googly eyes on the bottom to help mitigate this...</p>
<p>The touch pad is too sensitive and feels inconsistent. I'm constantly under/over-shooting the thing I want to click on, and when I do click, sometimes my finger moves that 0.2 mm or so to move to a different item and clicks on that instead. I've been using track pads since they first appeared on laptops, and have used them on various models of MacBook Pro, IBM ThinkPad, Dell, Asus, and Toshiba, so it's not like I'm accustomed to that input method.</p>
<p>Part of the problem for me is also the Apple TV user interface, but I'll grant that might just be unfamiliarity. When possible I use my LG OLED TV's built-in apps (e.g. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon) and only end up using the Apple TV when I can't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to say this. The simple Samsung remote for the Smart Hub is honestly the best remote I've ever owned. I just got an OLED LG and the remote is complete shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the opposite experience. I hate the remote for the Samsung smart hub. It's laggy (tho maybe thats the TV? IDK), doesn't have a good feel, and there is no goddamn quick switch button for picture modes. Have to go into the menu everytime to switch picture modes between &quot;film&quot; &quot;dynamic&quot; and &quot;natural,&quot;all of which I've tweaked for optimal settings based on my ambient light situation and content preferences.  super annoying. </p>
<p>My LG remote (Magic Remote or whatever) was amazing. Sad I had to give that TV back and it wasn't available again for me to re-purchase at Costco.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one has the same preference. I prefer less buttons and all via on screen selection. I also hate how the LG cursor comes up whenever the remote moves a little. Like damn! I just want the remote on the couch without it flicking on constantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you can set it up to control many devices. I do not like the one that comes with the Samsung app, it is missing many features that the physical remote has. The upside is I found a great 3rd party app that has the layout and functionality of the physical remote.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't tried my Samsung remote on a none-Samsung TV, but it does work on my xbox and my surround sound speakers. Not sure if that's because these are also connected to said Samsung TV though, might be worth looking into.</p></div>		</li>
