<p>dingle = sqrt(dongle)</p>
<p>And say &quot;Its a definition, just accept it on faith.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything is straightforward if you pull definitions out of your ass that conveniently solves the problem, but mathematical rigor requires a very stringent analysis of imaginary numbers. Similar to the Dirac Delta Function, you're not allowed to pull mathematical miracles out of your ass without the appropriate rigor t o justify its existence.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be well past this point but in case you aren't, it's also helpful to think of it as an orthogonal axis (or component or dimension)</p>
<p>In the same way we represent 3 dimensional vectors as 2x + 1y - 9z, we can just think of <em>i</em> as the component of a vector along the <em>i</em> axis.  You can scale it, transform it, integrate it, plot it, etc...</p>
<p>In this way, the complex number 12 + 3i is analogous to the 2D vector 12x + 3y.  It's one of those really simple things (once you can conceptualize it) that scares people into thinking it's more complicated than it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you expand on this? What part of learning Diff EQ helped you understand imaginary numbers better?</p>
<p>I have a grasp of what they are (this thread has helped), but I don’t understand why they’re useful. I can see why 0 is useful, but not so much an imaginary number like <em>i</em>.</p></div>		</li>
