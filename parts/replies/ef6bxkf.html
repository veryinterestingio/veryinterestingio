<p>I tried googling it, but I don't quite understand what the word means. Does it have anything to do with humans?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing it means to be around humans. Like how raccoons/opossums dig through trash. Rats, cats, mice, and dogs being in/around homes/fields. Probably a field of study for how our food, waste, homes, and local pollution affect those species. A big change of lifestyle to go from forest life to scavenging through trash in suburbs.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It just clicked:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Peri&quot; from the first half of the word &quot;Perimeter&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Anthro&quot; meaning humans</li>
</ul>
<p>i.e. &quot;Around humans&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, 'peri' means around, or near to, and 'anthropic' means relating to human beings. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means species that live near/directly around human populations. Some examples would be racoons, foxes, opossums, etc.</p>
<p>peri- a prefix meaning “about” or “around” ( perimeter, periscope ), “enclosing” or “surrounding” ( pericardium ), and “near” ( perigee, perihelion )</p>
<p>anthropos - &quot;man, human being&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit of opossum trivia: the older folks here in the South used to say that the opossum had it's babies through it's nose. From what I can find this wive's tale seems to have started with the slaves. </p>
<p>Why would they think such a thing?  </p>
<p>Simple, a female opossum cleans out it's pouch before the young are birthed. She also makes a saliva trail from her vaginal opening to the pouch. When the very premature baby opossums are born they crawl along the saliva trail to the pouch. Once inside the pouch they attach (literally) to a nipple where they stay until they are more mature. Some fail to complete the journey, survival of the fittest. </p>
<p>People saw the opossum cleaning her pouch and right after there were young opossums in the pouch. Therefore they thought she had the young through her nose. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Something worth noting is that, during certain months of the year, there is a dark orange/dark red colored discharge present in the pouch, at least in the tropical species Didelphis Aurita. Usually during or soon after the female's reproductive cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's very cool, what do you mean soon after their reproductive cycle? When would it be relative to when their joeys are born, or does it only happen when they don't get pregnant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it happens in both cases, as a means of preparing the pouch for potential babies. My opossum has never mated but she still does this, regardless. </p></div>		</li>
