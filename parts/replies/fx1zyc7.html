			<div class="markdown"><p>While reading online forums I take everything will a giant grain of salt. I'm highly skeptical and rarely take anything as fact but sometimes I read about certain connections other people have made and it just simply makes me think more. I haven't made those connections. I'm a different person. Its not definite truth, its not something from an encyclopedia, its not even something that was backed up from a source.. But its still cool to think about things and make connections within topics that I haven't yet. It a discussion forum anyway</p></div>		</li>
