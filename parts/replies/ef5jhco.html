<p>When the cold receptors in your skin are all suddenly stimulated they cause an involuntary gasp and, for about a minute after that, hyperventilation. ... Either that first gasping breath will fill your lungs with water (drowning you instantly), or the hyperventilation will make swimming almost impossible.</p>
