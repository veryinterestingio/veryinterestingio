			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good question. In fact, the &quot;unexpected&quot; has really been to not have any big problems or showstoppers to carry out these first observations with the EHT! It was certainly a lot of work, but it worked beautifully well. Scientifically, the results we've got are fully consistent with Einstein's theory of General Relativity. However, it is important to remark that the ways to discover &quot;scientifically unexpected&quot; things, like for instance seeing that General Relativity does not work well close to a black hole may require more resolution and fidelity in the images that what we currently have. But we will try in the future with an improved EHT that may get us there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that we have no new information after all this work, except for a blury pic? </p>
<p>And is the fact that we have no new information a good thing, since it means that we were right? (As of now)</p></div>		</li>
