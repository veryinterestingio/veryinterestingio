			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, there is a turbulent low pressure area created behind anything that’s moving through the air. Anything that gets kicked up into that area (water, dirt, salt, etc) can swirl and end up sticking to the back of the car. Sedans, coupes, etc have a low pressure area behind them too, but the rear window isn’t in it so it doesn’t get all full of junk. The trunk lid and rear bumper certainly do though but you don’t need to see out of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why don't the have a little jet that can spray the camera? They build the trunks so high and the read windshields so small these days it's basically impossible to see out the back without the camera, especially in tight spaces. Now that slush and dirt season is in full swing, a 5 minute trip at high speeds means I have to get in and out of tight parking lots with the side mirrors only. Gahh</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The airflow can clear the heavier rain on my coupe, but obviously only when going fast. Driving slow then it's just looking through the water. Lighter rain the rear window heating is actually strong enough to just evaporate the water (with the help of airflow I guess)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some are country requirements. For example, in Japan, they are required. The Mitsubishi Evo was such a low volume production that it was more cost effective to just leave it on rather than develop a version without the wiper. Plus, JDM cool.</p></div>		</li>
