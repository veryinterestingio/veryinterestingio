			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid my mom told me if I opened the soap it would all instantly foam up so don't touch it.<br />
I was a college student when I learned this truth for the first time.  My mind was blown,  my friend was very confused,  and we cut a soap pump in half for proof.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to note that soaps designed for these dispensers are much lower in viscosity. Otherwise, it would be nearly impossible to pump through these types of dispensers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However: you know those foaming dish soap pump bottles that say they can only be refilled with special (overpriced) foaming-soap refills? 1 part regular dish soap to 5-10 parts tap water works just as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. We found a bunch of cherry blossom Dawn dish soap at a discount store and we've been cutting it with water to refill our foam dispensers for a year now. Smells just as good as Bath and Body Works and cleans a lot better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a dispenser not tied to a brand, apparently, because it has a line close to the bottom marked 'soap' and another line at the top marked 'water.'</p>
<p>YMMV, but for my particular dispenser it works out to 3 parts soap to 11 parts water.</p></div>		</li>
