			<div class="markdown"><p>We follow these rules to a T for night sleeping. Should we be doing the same for short daytime naps? Right now, here in my office, my 6mos baby is sleeping on a couch, on his side, with loose blankets, one of which he's pulled up over his head. He's super comfy, so I just let it happen, even though I'm paranoid and keep an eye on his breathing the whole time. Should I put the kibosh on allowing this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here’s the TL;DR;</p>
<p>At six months, is he rolling over front to back and back to front, independently? If so, it may be hard to maintain him sleeping on his back, but he should be put down the same way for every sleep period, whether it’s at night or for a nap. If he rolls over independently, it’s usually OK to leave him that way.</p>
<p>From the 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics evidence-based guidelines:</p>
<p><a href="https://phpa.health.maryland.gov/mch/Documents/AAP%20Technical%20Report%20(Peds%202016).pdf" target="_blank">2016 guidelines</a> </p>
<p>INFANT SLEEP POSITION</p>
<p>To reduce the risk of SIDS, infants should be placed for sleep in the supine position (wholly on the back) for every sleep period by every caregiver until 1 year of age. Side sleeping is not safe and is not advised.
The prone or side sleep position
can increase the risk of rebreathing expired gases, resulting in hypercapnia and hypoxia.79–82 The prone position also increases the
risk of overheating by decreasing the rate of heat loss and increasing body temperature more than the supine position.83,84 Evidence suggests that prone sleeping alters the autonomic control of the infant cardiovascular system during sleep, particularly at 2 to 3 months of age,85 and may result in decreased cerebral oxygenation.86 The prone position places infants at high risk of SIDS (odds ratio [OR]: 2.3–13.1).87–91 In 1 US study, SIDS risk associated with the side position was similar in magnitude to that associated with the prone position (ORs: 2.0 and 2.6, respectively),88
and a higher population-attributable risk has been reported for the side sleep position than for the prone position.90,92 Furthermore, the risk
of SIDS is exceptionally high for infants who are placed on the side and found on the stomach (OR: 8.7).88 The side sleep position is inherently unstable, and the probability of an infant rolling to the prone position from the side sleep position is significantly greater than rolling prone from the back.90,93 Infants
who are unaccustomed to the prone position and who are placed prone for sleep are also at greater risk
than those usually placed prone (adjusted OR: 8.7–45.4).88,94,95 It is therefore critically important that every caregiver use the supine sleep position for every sleep period.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant in situations in which a new caregiver is introduced: for example, when an infant is placed in foster care or an adoptive home or when an infant enters child care for the first time.
Despite these recommendations,
the prevalence of supine positioning has remained stagnant for the past decade.19 One reason often cited by parents for not using the supine sleep position is the perception that the infant is uncomfortable or does not sleep well.96–104 However, an infant who wakes frequently is normal
and should not be perceived as a poor sleeper. Physiologic studies show that infants are less likely to arouse when they are sleeping in the prone position.105–113 The ability to arouse from sleep is an important protective physiologic response to stressors during sleep,114–118 and the infant’s ability to sleep for sustained periods may not be physiologically advantageous.
The supine sleep position does not increase the risk of choking and aspiration in infants, even in those with gastroesophageal reflux.
Parents and caregivers continue to be concerned that the infant will choke or aspirate while supine.96–104 Parents often misconstrue coughing or gagging, which is evidence of a normal protective gag reflex, for choking or aspiration. Multiple studies in different countries have not shown an increased incidence
of aspiration since the change to supine sleeping.119–121 Parents and caregivers are often concerned about aspiration when the infant has been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux. The AAP concurs with the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition
that “the risk of SIDS outweighs
the benefit of prone or lateral sleep position on GER [gastroesophageal reflux]; therefore, in most infants from birth to 12 months of age, supine positioning during sleep is recommended.... Therefore, prone
positioning is acceptable if the infant is observed and awake, particularly in the postprandial period, but prone positioning during sleep can only be considered in infants with certain upper airway disorders
in which the risk of death from GERD [gastroesophageal reflux disease] may outweigh the risk of SIDS.”122 Examples of such upper airway disorders are those in which airway-protective mechanisms are impaired, including infants with anatomic abnormalities, such as type 3 or 4 laryngeal clefts, who have
not undergone antireflux surgery. There is no evidence that infants receiving nasogastric or orogastric feedings are at increased risk of aspiration if placed in the supine position. Elevating the head of the infant’s crib while the infant is
supine is not effective in reducing gastroesophageal reflux123,124; in addition, elevating the head of the crib may result in the infant sliding
to the foot of the crib into a position that may compromise respiration and therefore is not recommended.</p>
<p>Once an infant can roll from supine to prone and from prone to supine, the infant may remain in the sleep position that he or she assumes.</p>
<p>Parents and caregivers are frequently concerned about the appropriate strategy for infants who have learned to roll over, which generally occurs
at 4 to 6 months of age. As infants mature, it is more likely that they will roll. In 1 study, 6% and 12% of 16- to 23-week-old infants placed on their backs or sides, respectively, were found in the prone position; among infants ≥24 weeks of age, 14% of those placed on their backs and
18% of those placed on their sides were found in the prone position.133 Repositioning the sleeping infant
to the supine position can be disruptive and may discourage the use of the supine position altogether. Because data to make specific recommendations as to when it
is safe for infants to sleep in the prone position are lacking, the AAP recommends that all infants continue to be placed supine until 1 year of age. If the infant can roll from supine to prone and from prone to supine, the infant can then be allowed to remain in the sleep position that he or she assumes. One study analyzing sleep-related deaths reported to
state child death review teams found that the predominant risk factor for sleep-related deaths in infants 4 to 12 months of age was rolling into objects in the sleep area.134 Thus, parents and caregivers should continue to keep the infant’s sleep environment
clear of soft or loose bedding and other objects. Parents may be reassured in being advised that the incidence of SIDS begins to decline after 4 months of age.16</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info! Yes, he does roll over on his own. Lately I've been seeing him on his side in his crib during the night, and I've been rolling him back to his back.</p>
<p>It's nice to see your source here also speak on the subject of aspiration. My baby's had some aspiration issues, and I've been curious if sleeping on his back right after eating, was an issue. I've kept forgetting to talk to our pediatrician about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Our oldest did that when he was little too, and still does today (he's 9 now). IDK how anyone could sleep like that without feeling like they're running out of oxygen or something, but he's done it since he was old enough to pull blankets over his head.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
<p>Sure made us nervous, though!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're still going through this with our 16 month old. She started pulling the blankets over her head at a year old. For a while, my wife would sneak in and remove them only for her to grumpily yank them back over her head.</p>
<p>We ended up asking her pediatrician about it. He pretty well shrugged it off. The gist seemed to be that if they're strong enough to move around, they're strong enough to get out from under a light blanket. Still freaks us out though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for this advice! (I'm the gf of OP) what is your advice on swaddling? We have had differing opinions on it - my mum is a nurse and a massive advocate, but the lady at the antenatal class last night said swaddling can increase the risk of SIDS? I did ask her but she didn't go into any detail and refused to give us any advice besides it being 'personal choice'. I don't want choice! I want a live child!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I have read and seen, that is a personal opinion and not fact. While it’s true they shouldn’t have loose blankets, a tight or fitted swaddle isn’t increasing any risk. I know you can get ones that tie or Velcro so they don’t wiggle out of them and become a risk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congrats to you too! Your concerns are common and it can often be hard to know what to do. I’ve been there, both as a pediatrician and as a parent. </p>
<p>Here is a great, semi-concise resource on infant sleep from the National Institutes of Health that summarizes best practices and includes some good questions and answers. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pubs/Documents/NICHD_Safe_to_Sleep_brochure.pdf" target="_blank">NIH Information</a> </p>
<p>My take on swaddling: there is no evidence that swaddling decreases the risk of SIDS, which means that it shouldn’t be thought of as protective. Swaddling past a certain age can actually be risky. If a baby is old enough to roll onto his or her side or face while in a swaddle, the swaddle can limit the ability to roll back into a safe position. Most babies start really, truly having the ability to roll around 4-6 months of age, so swaddling before then should be safe and does a good job of helping a baby soothe before their brains are mature enough to self-soothe. </p>
<p>You may hear a lot of people say that their babies fought the swaddle or didn’t like it. In my experience, which by definition is anecdotal and therefore not evidence-based, this is usually because the swaddle wasn’t properly done. If you want to learn how to properly swaddle a baby, ask the nurses in the newborn nursery. A proper swaddle brings the arms snug and close to the body and suppresses the whole-body startle and Moro reflexes present in early life that can disrupt soothing and sleep. Hips shouldn’t be tightly swaddled so as to lower the risk of hip dislocation, but getting those arms nice and snug against the sides of the body is a great way to start soothing. </p>
<p>Best of luck to you, and congrats again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! That's great advice :) I've done a few practice swaddles but obviously it's not the same! Only a few weeks and we can try for real so we'll see then if we can do it properly and if he likes them!</p></div>		</li>
