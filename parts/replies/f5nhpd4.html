			<div class="markdown"><p>The UK has very similar stuff to the US, from what I have read. (Not surprising considering how closely linked the two programs were.) But other than that, I don't think anything is published on warheads for other nations. The Russians released some stuff about their very early work (1940s-1950s) but it's mostly about testing, not actual warheads, and I don't think they've released anything on their safety measures except occasionally noting that they've had PALs and things like that installed at some point.</p></div>		</li>
