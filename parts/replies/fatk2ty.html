			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more that a time chunk of data hold more information than a time chunk of voice, so multiple conversations can be processed, sliced, multiplexed, then recombined at a fast enough rate that the brain doesn't notice it. This is one method.</p>
<p>Else data is channelized so they can stack and be transmitted simultaneously.</p>
<p>Of course, doing both simultaneously is an option, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, you are correct. Digital switching is extremely fast. However, maximum switching speed can be better described in Hz or cycles per second than in meters per second, so it isn't really comparable with the speed of light. </p>
<p>In signal multiplexing, the signals actually don't take turns. Instead, multiple sinusoidal signals are combined into one, complex signal which is sent down the wire. The recipient would perform a fourier transform on the signal and recover the components of that signal (frequency and magnitude). The fourier transform is one of the most broadly applied pieces of mathematics ever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>qam is that you make an alphabet with a friend with different sounds. Loud chicken noise means A, quiet chicken noise means B, a loud horse sound means C and a quiet horse sound means D. We call that 4QAM.If you good listeners/speak you be able to also use an in-between loudness and more different sounds, so can differentiate 16 sounds in total. Than we  have 16am. And maybe everything is perfect and can go up 64 different sounds. But when it is very noisy we stick to loud/quiet üèá/üêî</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that captures the amplitude modulation (Loud / quiet) it  doesn't get at the relationship of the signals (Horse / Chicken). There would have to be some sort of wheel or doorknob analogy to drive home the phase difference. </p>
<p>Also, 256-QAM... Lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Multiplexing is how they can carry multiple streams of data, but has nothing to do with how you prevent external or even interference interference during transmission.  You could have a single stream of data over the same medium that would be equally prone or immune to interference at equal distance.</p></div>		</li>
