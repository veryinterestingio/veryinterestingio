			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice, thanks for the explanation. </p>
<p>My hygienist told me he could see tangible difference since I started using the interdental brushes daily. But when I mentioned I use Listerine, I was under the impression he thought it was snake oil. </p>
<p>Do you notice a visible difference if someone started using mouthwash regularly?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hmm honestly that's hard for me to answer. First and foremost, consistent brushing and flossing with proper technique is most important. If a patient doesn't have that down first, mouthwash won't do much to help; however, we do give a prescription strength mouthwash after scaling and root planing (deep cleaning) that helps with healing the gums by killing more bacteria (called chlorhexidine). I have seen a noticeable different when patients don't use the chlorhexidine after SRP. </p>
<p>I can use myself as an example. I floss, waterpik, and brush consistenly, but I'm still prone to cavities. Ever since I started using a fluoride mouthwash (and started using it correctly), my small signs of cavities (incipient lesions) haven't gotten any bigger. </p>
<p>I wouldn't call mouthwash snake oil. It's just an extra thing some people use and some don't. Some people can benefit, and for some they don't necessarily need the extra step.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add, since you mentioned &quot;proper technique&quot;, that an electric toothbrush for me was a gamechanger. I was always prone to cavities and aa much as I tried, my dentist was always telling me I was not doing a good job with brushing and flossing. She then told me to try an electric toothbrush becaise it does all the work and I don't need to worry about the technique. It's been great, and I even feel I waste much less time brushing and flossing now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a dentist. People bring up mouth rinses a lot. The issue of why we answer but generally steer away is that most people that ask aren't doing the basics, so until the basics are perfected we don't want to add complexity. </p>
<p>The absolute most important part of cavity prevention is diet. It's the part people want to ignore and mouthwash away. As long as a diet is highly cariogenic (cavity causing) even perfect hygiene can fail.</p>
<p>Next comes the brushing with fluoridated paste. That needs a minimum of 4 minutes per day to show the acceptable level of caries prevention. The modified Bass brushing technique of angling the brush towards the gums and brushing plaque and  debris from the gums is the best method in my opinion to clean teeth. Most people utilize a power brush better than a manual even though a manual can do just as well in a person with proper technique.</p>
<p>Once all of that is perfect, we can talk mouth rinses, but many people won't necessarily need a mouth rinse by the time the other factors are addressed.</p>
<p>Listerine is arguably the best antiseptic mouthwash available over the counter. The active ingredients are a mixture of four essential oils. The alcohol free version is as effective as the alcohol version, but without the issue of alcohol drying out your mouth. Cheap generics are available.</p>
<p>The most recommended brand of anticavity fluoride rinse is ACT. It is available in generics. I sometimes buy it at Walmart. When it's cheaper, I buy the generic children's bubble gum flavor because I don't care about the flavor and the fluoride ion concentration is identical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, just wanted to give my opinion on the matter.</p>
<p>I live in Sweden, and our dentists are state owned so they can't really sell products to us, (in other words we can really trust that they aren't trying to rip us off). But they speak very poorly of listerine, and instead recommend something that has a high fluorine content, about 0.2%, it might also say 0.2% NaF which is sodium fluoride, either way it's the same thing. Our version of mouthwash that everyone uses is called Flux Original coolmint, if you wanna look up what its ingredients are.</p>
<p>For comparison, listerine has only 0.05% NaF.</p>
<p>I hear this is also because if you use a bad mouthwash it will actually remove the Fluorine that gets in your mouth after you brush your teeth, similar to if you drink water shortly afterwards (don't do that, wait 30 mins at least).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, tap water is fluoridated. Is this the case in Sweden, too?</p>
<p>I'm just wondering if the reason our mouthwash isn't as strong is so that people don't get the brown stains on their teeth from too much fluoride, since it's already in our water. I could be totally wrong about that though.</p>
<p>Separately, listerine isn't something you'd typically get from the dentist. It's found in most grocery and drug stores.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any perspective on the idea that our mouth, like our gut, can potentially cultivate a healthy biome of bacteria, and that in some cases using mouthwash might actually be detrimental to that process? I wonder if people who compulsively use alcohol-based mouthwash actually create a cycle where they've killed all the good bacteria, and then they reinforce their perceived need for mouthwash because of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's 'good' bacteria and 'bad bacteria in the mouth. The bacteria multiplies so quickly, it can create a biofilm on your teeth in less than 24 hours. When you use mouthwash, yes you're killing more good and bad bacteria, but at the rate it multiplies, I don't know if there is really an issue tbh </p>
<p>I also know everyone has a different composition of bacteria on the mouth, which  could play a role in what you're saying too </p>
<p>This is not something I've fully researched, so please don't take my word for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks for the info! I appreciate that it's anecdotal. I've often wondered if there might be a use case for such a thing as a 'probiotic mouthwash', so just kinda spitballing whether it would even make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically, when a mouthwash states it's helping to restore minerals to the enamel, it's referring to fluoride mouthwash. Yes, fluoride helps by strengthening weak spots in your enamel. It will not reverse a cavity if you have one forming, but it can stop it from getting worse (usually called incipient lesions). </p>
<p>I highly recommend the fluoride treatments to you can get at your dental office as well. It's basically a stronger amount of fluoride than what you can buy at the store. I like to say that's it's cheaper and easier to prevent cavities than having to treat them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For everyone else (I'm sure you know this already) fluoride actually permanently strengthens your teeth. That's why it's given to kids when they start getting their adult teeth in. Your enamel is made of a mineral called hydroxyapatite, and the fluoride replaces a hydroxide turning it into fluorapatite, which is stronger.</p></div>		</li>
