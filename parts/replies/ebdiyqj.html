<p>Frequency bandwidth is increasingly very limited in cellular networks and there's no economical way to give calls 20k of bandwidth without seriously limiting the number of calls that can fit on the network.</p>

<p>A higher carrier frequency usually allows for higher signal bandwidth though, correct?</p>
<p>It's why the carriers are rolling out several different +2GHz bands (Verizon's B66) to help with capacity VoLTE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you've ever used google hangouts or something similar to place a call you'll notice the audio quality is usually much better because they can afford a wider bandwidth over wifi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're right, but I wonder why when I have Wi-Fi Calling enabled I still get that shitty quality, when theoretically I should be afforded more bandwidth on my 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channel, let alone my 5GHz channel.</p>
<p>I know if you're on the cell network and you're on LTE, some carriers (depending on your phone) will hand you off to CDMA until you're done with your call. But you'd think the &quot;Wi-Fi Calling&quot; option would prevent that from happening.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No matter how high the frequency, the bandwidth would still need to be the same. Using a higher frequency doesn't solve the issue because filtering becomes more challenging and expensive as the bandwidth to carrier ratio goes down. And the spectrum is crowded even at +2GHz and you can bet the cell companies will pack as much as they can into the spectrum they own, aka keeping the call bandwidth as narrow as they can.</p>
<p>As for wifi calling, I'm not completely sure why the quality is the same. It might be because the same bandwidth is used for simplicity, even though more is available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WiFi calling is the same as the data gets sent to the cell carrier of which then broadcasts the call out just at it would normally (The only difference is the upload to the cell company/tower is done over WiFi)</p>
<p>The part of “bandwidth needed for 20k” is correct when we talk about a fully analogue connection however if we managed to send our calls digitally we could fit a high quality call even on a 2G network (pretty much just dial-up internet). The reason why we haven’t is mostly compatibility (and possible latency) as if we were to ring a home phone it would just sound like a dial-up connection.  (We would need to fit everything with a modem for this)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spectrum is cheaper at higher frequencies for this exact reason, because with a higher carrier and the same bandwidth you need better hardware, i.e. more expensive hardware, so the spectrum is harder to monetize and therefore less valuable per Hz.</p>
<p>Companies making a move to higher frequencies regardless have decided the technical challenges are less expensive to solve than the price premium for lower frequency spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're probably 100% correct. This makes the most sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my country they started implementing the new 4G, which comes with Voice Over LTE an OH MAN, the quality went up. On the other hand, Google hangouts and all the internet based calls are just plain awful.</p></div>		</li>
