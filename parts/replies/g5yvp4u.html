			<div class="markdown"><p>This might sound like an empty platitude by yes you can by going out and having new, boundary pushing experiences and learning new things. Make yourself uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Fight or flight is triggered as emergency reactions to unknown situations.  The more you experience and subconsciously know how to how to handle, the less you will be affected by similar experiences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesnt work for many forms of anxiety. For example, people with agoraphobia will generally have a panic attack every single time in their triggering situation(s), and the panic attack makes their fear of the situation even worse, adds the fear of having another panic attack, and makes the sufferer avoid the situation completely. </p>
<p>Extreme social anxiety is another example. The extreme anxiety will inhibit social performance, cause the sufferer to feel awkward, judged etc. and make the anxiety worse for next time out of fear they will be awkward/judged again.</p>
<p>In many cases of clinical anxiety, you need to be more methodical in exposing yourself to your triggers with guidance from a mental health professional. Anxiety can snowball and making yourself uncomfortable may add more fuel to the fire instead of putting it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's cool to learn the names of what these things are but what do they do? So the amygdala sends some kind of signal somehow? What's the vagus nerve and how does it cause that pain? Does it vibrate a lot or leak chemicals or something to cause pain? cause it feels like the entire inside of your chest is reacting sometimes but I don't think that nerve makes up you're entire chest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhh whoa cool. so nerve, should i be thinking of it as one little nerve in one spot? Or is it it's own nervous system? Cause if it has roots throughout my abdomen or something like that then that totally makes sense how I can feel it throughout my chest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comes from the fight-or-flight response moving blood to your limbs and brain, so you can escape from the threat, which causes blood to move away from everything not immediately essential for survival, i.e., the digestive system. What you are feeling is the blood rushing <em>away</em> from the stomach.</p></div>		</li>
