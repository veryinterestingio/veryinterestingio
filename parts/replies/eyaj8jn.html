			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched some documentary awhile back about cheesemaking and one of the cheesemakers was insisting that true Parmesan cheese can only be made in the traditional areas in Italy. Is there any truth to this from a strictly cheese composition perspective or is a lot of that to attempt to protect the trade income?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrapping cheese tight with saran wrap and only touching it with clean utensils is the best you can do. If you buy a block of cheese it would technically be possible to &quot;re-age&quot; it although difficult as it's probably already contaminated with random molds.Still its virtually pointless because the second you cut into it again you would be back where you started, and in the process have turned some of the delicious edible cheese into a tough less-palatable rind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you vacusuck it lasts a looong time.  Or, we buy big blocks of cheddar and grate it all, and store all but a reasonable portion in the freezer, because we mostly use it grated anyway.  It seems that grating dries it out enough that it lasts longer in the fridge in that form too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s really good that you’re asking this question in general, and don’t feel too down about not having some master plan all worked out. I kinda feel like it’s an unreasonable expectation to put on someone who hasn’t had a chance to truly see what there is to do in this world. Also, if I may, my 2¢ would be: pick something productive that you like and run with it. Nobody is saying you have to do that thing for the rest of your life, but it gets you on a path, and it’ll likely lead you to another thing, which leads you to another thing, etc etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do what I did, find a cheese plant and email HR saying you're interested. If a position is open, you're likely to get it. I'm part of the non-unionized science staff, however there is a union for those who do production! Cheesemake is a fun career, though it's really 90% cleaning/sanitation and 10% making cheese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the soft cheese it is a little more involved depending on the type maybe a 25% making cheese/75% cleaning. I was a assistant to a cheese maker for goat cheese for 3 years a long time ago. We were short handed for most of the time I worked there. Montchevre Betin, Inc was a tiny cheese making factory in a rural town, but still one of the largest goat cheese facilities in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, just try things out, because there is no perfect route to take.  If it sounds interesting, try it!  Apply for positions that sound cool. Pay attention to what you always gravitate towards.</p>
<p>I was leaning hard into business and was getting sick of it, noticed that I always find myself reading about advances in medical science, so I went back to school and got into research and development of new therapeutics. I love it!  Took me almost 10 years after graduating to figure that out.</p>
<p>It's a good idea with any profession you are interested in get to know people who do it and express your interest in doing that work.  The best way to find these jobs is through knowing people.</p></div>		</li>
