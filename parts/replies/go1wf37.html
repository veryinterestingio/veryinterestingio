			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm always for a follow up study. The hygiene hypothesis states that early childhood exposure to a variety of pathogens is beneficial to immune tolerance and regulation, but (as usual with science) it's a bit more complicated than that. Our immune systems can be regulated by pathogens - most of the research on this agrees that the &quot;good&quot; bacteria in our gut can play a role in this, and it's been found that gut flora is altered in autoimmunity and allergy. We obviously can't rule out any role that &quot;bad&quot; pathogens may have in modulating immunity, but generally having a healthy population of beneficial bacteria in your gut will be better for your immune system than seeking out stuff that will make you seriously ill. And that can be achieved by eating a healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruit and veg.</p>
<p>Edit: natural sugars in breast milk will also encourage formation of gut flora in infants, and most infants develop a good start during childbirth due to exposure to their mothers' mucosal membranes and her own flora! Otherwise, parents are still doing amazingly by providing a good diet and interacting with their child.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so just to clarify your point, while a broad spectrum of pathogens are involved, it is mostly our own gut microbiota which seems to be implicated in the development of tolerance rather than infections so to speak, and as such babies are likely to get these kinds of exposures whether or not they are in quarantine or not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pandemic has provided an amazing natural experiment to test the hygeine hypothesis. So far we've really only had developed vs developing world as groups for observation. Now we have developed world pre-pandemic vs post-pandemic for comparison, two cohorts which are virtually the same by all measures except the pandemic. Of course there have been many other collateral effects and variables that could affect rates of autoimmune disorders, but for something that cannot ever be tested in a randomized controlled fashion, this is about the best evidence we'll ever have.</p>
<p>Also, there is all this talk of returning to the &quot;dirty old world&quot; - I don't think that will ever happen. Sure, we'll return to music festivals, clubs, big weddings, etc. But the sanitizer stations and Plexiglas are, for the most part, here to stay. We're leaping into a vastly more sterile and distanced future, which I find extremely depressing for a variety of reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm definitely okay with my cashiers being behind plexiglass so they don't get sick 5x a year.  Realizing we can easily expose the poor to less sickness is a good thing. I don't really need to share respiratory droplets with strangers at the grocery store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If vaccines turns out to be effective for building up sufficiently long term immunity, we possibly would skip the sanitizer stations and plexiglass in five to ten years or so.</p>
<p>Some places are likely going to keep maintaining them for long term, but just like nowadays we don't care much about the &quot;Spanish&quot; Flu or many of the other diseases we have eradicated or normalised, we probably won't worry about this pandemic anymore once things gets under control. At least, I hope.</p></div>		</li>
