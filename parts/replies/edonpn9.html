			<div class="markdown"><p>Morrowind GOTY from Game Informer back in the early 2000s had 2 files on the disc that were completely useless to the actual game. Ripping an .ISO of the disc allowed you to see them, and if you removed them it allowed you to burn copies of the image that worked flawlessly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you know a bit of assembly language and the DRM is primitive, you can use a decompiler on the software's executable file and change the code as to circumvent the DRM.  That's about as universal as you can get for &quot;DRM removal software&quot; and a lot of the time it's harder than it might seem</p></div>		</li>
