			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, it may be a reasonable safe distance. But the point of our article was that it is not always the case. If a sick person sneezes in an unventilated room the chances of the droplet nuclei spreading over the entire room, which may be bigger than six feet, is quite high. The sick person wearing a mask is very effective since it blocks most of the droplets (but some small ones do get through the mask).  Ordinary cloth mask is little less effective for the receiving person since it does not block nuclei (or aerosol particles) that are a few microns in size or smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2020-04-16/coronavirus-airborne-transmission-3-hours-covid-19/12146526" target="_blank">Haven't researchers also stated that the virus can stay air-born for up to 3 hours?</a> That's a long time so if you're in a closed space with bad ventilation almost everyone will catch it, right? This virus is pretty deadly and it seems social distancing does not really do much but can maybe make a small difference. Thanks for the AMA dude</p></div>		</li>
