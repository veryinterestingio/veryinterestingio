			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. All methods of birth control for women are 100% covered by the ACA. You should only be paying the copay for the office visit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's weird. I have copays for qll my doctors visits, including OB/GYN, but any appointment I had relating to my IUD (blood work, ultrasounds, insertion, discussion, check-ups) had no copay. It may just be my plan, but I had assumed since it was relating to birth control, the copay was included in the ACA coverage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I knew about this but hadn't thought about or wondered whether male contraception or sterilization would be included. It's not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only sorta-kinda an explanation of the question.  Lots (more than 1/2 of the U.S. population) of states had this requirement prior to the ACA, but the <em>why</em> that law was created is important to understand the crux of the question which is why the treatment is <em>different</em> for male sterilization and female. And...that is all about the logic of insuring and how risk is thought of, and how the boundaries of things like families are managed through prior legislation, civil rights act and a variety of other well established considerations in insurance.  I find the ACA answer to miss the point, especially given that most people experienced no change in coverage on this topic with the introduction of the ACA.</p></div>		</li>
