			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for asking a question!  My contract is to do all I can to achieve identity, indicate context (associated with the race massacre/not associated/not determinable), and document the cause of death, traumatic or otherwise.  I'm being cautious about the prospects of publication.  Academia has a long history of using Black bodies for science, without the least representation of the deceased as a stakeholder, let alone their relatives.  I am a student of that tradition, but I hope to let the next of kin have a voice.  I do suspect cultural context will figure highly, I suspect in the patterning of trauma, but it's a hypothesis waiting for testing.</p></div>		</li>
