			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless your family is from Africa and your bloodline never existed outside of Africa, you have some. It's present in all modern day humans except those in Africa. That's because a branch of humans broke off and mated with Neanderthals but the ones that stayed in Africa never did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s very interesting. Were the traits that the Neanderthals had more conducive to survival outside of Africa, or was this more out of chance? Did the Neanderthals of the time have significant physical and mental differences from homo sapiens?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We share almost 99% of our DNA with Chimpanzees, and we are much more closely related to Neanderthals than we are with Chimps. So your initial statement does not make sense.</p>
<p>The reason some present day humans have DNA, that can be linked back to Neanderthals is that our ancestors interbred with Neanderthals. We also have common ancestors before that and share much more than a few percent of our DNA due to that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And I had already mentioned the interbreeding elsewhere but thanks</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So really it's more accurate to say that non-African humans share slightly more DNA with Neanderthals than African humans.</p></div>		</li>
