			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for finally answering a question I've been wondering about for years.</p>
<p>Are there any kind of organism that live in both oxygen rich and oxygen deprived environments?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Lots of them. They are called facultative anaerobes. They can switch between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. E. coli is an example. They live happily in your oxygen-deprived gut interior and thrive as well in an aerated culture medium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do facultative microbes typically obtain oxygen from other sources (SOx, NOx, etc) or have an entirely different energy cycle. </p>
<p>Also a note that this sort of thing is important for wastewater treatment, anaerobic basins help break down products that are not able to be broken down by aerobic microorganisms</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microbes can be broadly classified by how much oxygen they require metabolically. <strong>Obligate anaerobes</strong> are poisoned by the presence of oxygen. <strong>Obligate aerobic</strong> require oxygen presence metabolically to survive. Another category are the <strong>facultative anaerobes</strong> and can switch their metabolism to survive in either the presence of lack of oxygen depending. There are also <strong>aerotolerant anaerobes</strong> that don't need oxygen metabolically but have the enzymes to deal the damaging free radicals oxygen cause. Finally there are the <strong>microaerophiles</strong> which need oxygen, but only at low concentration, high concentration will poison them.</p>
<p>To answer your immediate question, both aerotolerant anaerobes and facultative anaerobes can be found in environments that either contain or lack oxygen, with each category behaving differently towards it's presence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What kind of mechanisms do facultative anaerobes use to detect oxygen levels? And are there cases where facultative anaerobes are strictly less efficient than aerotolerant anaerobes? My guess is that facultative anaerobes would sometimes be more efficient in oxygen-rich environments than aerotolerant ones, because they probably have some faculties that take advantage of oxygen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A really interesting consequence of this: until 2.4 billion years ago, most life on earth was (single celled) anaerobic bacteria.  Then cyanobacteria started turning CO2 into O2, causing the &quot;great oxidation event&quot; aka &quot;oxygen holocaust&quot;, where the new oxygen killed most forms of life on earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, I came here to say the same thing. It’s not that they don’t survive in an oxygen rich environment, but that they exist in their spore state. They need anaerobic conditions to become vegetative, the state in which they can produce toxin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those spores are tough buggers. If you are canning something (meat, vegetables, including tomatoes!) that is not going into a vinegar solution in the jar, you need 240-250° F to kill off the spores.</p>
<p>The number of people I meet who can tomatoes in a regular water bath without adding acetic acid powder is too darn high. Tomatoes on their own are not acidic enough to be safe without pressure canning.</p></div>		</li>
