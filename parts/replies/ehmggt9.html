			<div class="markdown"><p>A black hole can 'burst' through Hawking radiation if it's too small but there is no upper limit on the size of a black hole. When they say 'nothing can escape, not even light', they mean it. It is the ultimate form of gravitational collapse, with gravity so strong that it effectively rips a hole in the fabric of space, hence the name. The more mass it gains the larger the hole grows. Anything inside the hole is lost forever</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we are in a closed universe, where gravity will eventually overcome the expansion if the universe, yes. It doesnt look like that's the case though. There will be some truly monstrous black holes in the centers of galactic superclusters in the far far future though, trillions of times the mass of the sun or more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first, is that things can only move up to light-speed, but the universe is expanding faster than that (no individual part of it is moving faster, it's just that space expands from every point at once, and the <em>total</em> is faster. No FTL) so there is a limited number of objects that can fall into any specific black hole, and some objects are far enough away from any black hole that they will never fall into one. </p>
<p>The <em>second</em>, is that black holes evaporate through hawking radiation, and eventually dissipate entirely. (though it takes an incredibly long time)</p>
<p>This doesn't violate the 'nothing escapes' clause, because hawking radiation isn't actually emitted <em>per se</em>. It's just that particle-antiparticle pairs are created, and cancel each other out all the time, and when a pair forms along the edge of a black hole one can escape and the other cannot.</p>
<p>Because total mass must always be preserved, and we now have a particle with mass outside the black hole, the particle that fell into the black hole must have <em>negative</em> mass. Thus when this negative mass particle falls in, the total mass of the black hole decreases by one particle, even though nothing has actually left it. </p>
<p>Eventually, enough will fall in that the black hole's total mass is zero, and it ceases to exist.</p>
<p>This is not a bursting though, and it actually goes slower the larger the black hole gets. (because it can only happen along the outer edge, and <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" target="_blank">volume increases faster than surface area</a>).</p>
<hr />
<p>That is assuming that Hawking Radiation actually exists. It's hard to get close to a black hole to test it.</p>
<p>If it doesn't then point two is struck down, but point one would still hold, and things wouldn't fall in that are really far away and getting farther faster than they are approaching the black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they can have GRBs a Gama Ray Burst, witch happens because (we think) of a star being sucked into it causing a ray so hot is can evaporate plants in a instant light years away.  </p></div>		</li>
