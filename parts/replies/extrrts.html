<p>If there was an example of a species capable of living 80,000 years (Pando) while still banging out non-clonal offspring every year then we'd absolutely be able to see evolutionary differences between an 80,000 year old individual and one 80,000 generations younger. (Assuming environmental pressures exist etc etc).</p>
<p>But there isn't one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean. Quaking aspens (like Pando) are an example of what you described. Most aspens flower and set seed every year, so there's been 80,000 years of reproduction in quaking aspens since Pando first germinated as a seedling.</p>
<p>The issue here is that Pando is not genetically frozen in time. Clonal individuals, like a clonal stand of aspens, will evolve over time at approximately the same rate as the general population since they accumulate mitotic mutations that are passed on vegetatively. There can even be natural selection and genetic drift occurring among the genetically different parts of a clonal stand.</p>

<p>That's more than enough time to go from wolves to pugs (domestic dogs as an example took 20k to 40k years. So 10k-20k generations?) - I'd even argue it's likely that 80k generations later the descendants are likely to have speciated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evolution in dogs occurred very quickly because of human selective breeding, so they're not a good standard to compare against. 80,000 years is not all that long for evolution, especially in a widespread and outcrossing (wind-pollinated) tree like aspens.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd need a source for that one, because my brain says that sexual reproduction creates dramatically more varied offspring than clonal reproduction</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Oh definitely - just at a fraction of the pace of sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>My point was 80k <em>generations</em> - I used dogs intentionally as an example of rapid speciation in a fraction of that time.</p></div>		</li>
