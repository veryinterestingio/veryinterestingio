			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes from taking the derivative of the force due to gravity: </p>
<p>F = GMm/R^2</p>
<p>ΔF/ΔR = -2GMm/r^3</p>
<p>and ΔF = [ -2GMm/r^3 ] ΔR</p>
<p>Where r is the distance between the two bodies and ΔR is the radius of the body experiencing the tidal force.</p>
<p>This is a first order approximation, but for celestial bodies where r is much larger than ΔR, then it holds true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If gravity is a force, then how does another force form from its derivative?</p>
<p>Like taking the derivative of distance is velocity. Its a completely different property(?). </p>
<p>Are there other real life examples similar to gravity/tides?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity scales with 1/r^2, so the tidal forces (which are just the difference in gravity between the near and far ends of an object) scale with the derivative of 1/r^2. That'd be 1/r^3 up to a constant multiplication factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tidal forces arise from the gradient of the gravitational potential. The potential can be expanded out to have terms of order 1/a 1/a^2 1/a^3 etc. When taking the gradient the 1st term vanishes. The second terms is responsible for the orbital motion of the tide raising body (another way to think of it is that in the non-inertial frame this equivalent term would balance with the centrifugal force) everything else contributes to the tidal force. So strictly speaking the tidal force also has 1/a^4, 1/a^5 and so on terms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What exactly is a here? I'm assuming it's not distance? And of you take the gradient wrt a then none of those terms disappear, the 1/a term would become -1/a^2.</p></div>		</li>
