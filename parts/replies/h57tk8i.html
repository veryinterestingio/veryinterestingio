			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't really answer the fact that cells aren't replaced with cells from a factory somewhere in the body (except blood) the cells replace themselves thru cell division. So a transplant cell will replace itself with more copies of the same cell. Same DNA.  if your body could replace those cells on it's own you wouldn't need a transplant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it maintains original dna </p>

<p>that was the answer. Im sorry if I didnt feel it necessary to explain that part further.   </p>
<p>Correcting OPs other misunderstanding was of greater interest to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm general, each time the cell divides, it loses one notch on it's Telomerase. Each new cell has 1 less than it's mother cell. This continues until the telomeres run out and the cell line dies. Both are the replacement. Cell division doesn't really in a mother and a baby cell. The mother cell grows and splits into 2 full grown cells.</p>
<p>This is part of why we age and die. Only some cells like blood and skin get replaced completely new from a stem cell. Even skin cells eventually run out of telomeres.</p></div>		</li>

But if it were to be done, then its not so much a heart transplant as it is a collegen matrix that is seeded with the implantees own cells and grown out. Totally different scenario...and still totally hypothetical</p></div>		</li>
