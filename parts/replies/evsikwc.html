			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! The idea for LOCKR grew out of a <a href="https://www.bakerlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/680.full_.pdf" target="_blank">2016 paper</a> (you may notice some authorship overlap :) ) where we described how to create really well-behaved helical proteins. We wanted to add function into them, so after a couple whiteboard brainstorming sessions, we decided to try to get one part of the protein to switch in the way we published — and install function in such a modular way. Then, within the IPD and with Hana/Andrew, we developed the functions we’ve published and got it to work in living cells! There’s a lot of work still to do to determine if a cell that uses LOCKR will have any unintended side-effects. Of course, we are attempting to engineer the cells in a way to mitigate that in a predictable way. TBI is an initial indication, but the field of engineering therapeutic cells — especially using LOCKR — is so new that working on other kinds of inflammation and autoimmune diseases is certainly on the table. What indications would you like to see researchers like us work on? - BL</p></div>		</li>

<p>In broad strokes, whenever you mess with cells inside someone's body, two main categories of things can happen: (1) The body starts attacking those cells, or (2) the cells start behaving in an unexpected and pathologic way.</p></div>		</li>
