			<div class="markdown"><p>regardless of whether or not that is the case (I don't actually know what the most up to date thinking on that is) the arthropods and vertebrates in caves are all descended from surface-dwelling animals.  Perhaps the ancestors of <em>those</em> animals once lived underground, but there was a lengthy surface-dwelling period in the ancestry of all these animals.</p></div>		</li>
