			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation, but I’d like to add there are better versioning schemes out there.  SemVer is a better standard.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the versioning convention we use where I work. It's a common standard that has formalized long-standing conventions.</p>
<p>Not everyone uses it though, unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that the build number is more likely a source control version number. We used to do that on one project, it was the hex id of the last commit before build. That would explain the ridiculously high number. Why it's decimal and not hex however is a different question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reasons I can come up with off the top of my head without knowing anything else about the conventions used in either OP's software or your project:</p>
<p>1) That's converted from hex when displaying to OP for some reason that I don't dare speculate on</p>
<p>2) Their version control stores IDs in decimal for readability because they don't expect a product to get to however big a 64-bit integer can get</p>
<p>1.5/2.5) For either 1 or 2, it could just use decimal because they think it's more human friendly when talking about what build you're on since humans tend to think in decimal.</p>
<p>3) It's a set of 4 hex pairs that a) just so happens to not contain any digits a-f, and b) dropped a leading zero (maybe because conventions? I dunno).</p>
<p>I agree that in my limited experience that seems weird, but I can also recall seeing some version numbers that seemed to follow the same pattern, but not on any software I ever worked heavily enough in to notice/care, or that I supported (and as I've never done professional development, everything I do has a version of 8.675.30.9 or 3.141.59.265 when I absolutely must put in a version #)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be a date/code + number combination, or something like that.</p>
<p>I thought it was high as well, but with 11 main versions it's entirely within the realm of possibility.</p></div>		</li>
