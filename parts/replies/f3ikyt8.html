			<div class="markdown"><p>The cool thing about cubing is that noone solves a scramble the same exact way. How you solve your first step may result in a hard last step, and vice versa. On top of that world record holders like Feliks Zemdegs and Mats Valk both have memorized literally thousands of algorithms. So what may be an &quot;easy&quot; scramble for their knowledge, may be harder for another world class cube's knowledge. And of course they sometimes top 15+ turns per second. Any of the 43 quintillion different ways a rubik's cube can be scrambled can be solved in 20 moves or less. But even world record solvers take roughly 40-50 moves on average. Meaning that no solve is pure luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you not allowed to see the scrambled cube before you start unscrambling? I'd have to imagine, having certain algorithms memorized, you could glance at a cube and recognize the patterns/steps you'd need to solve it before you even really pick it up and check each side.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there a mathematical proof of this? I’d love to see it if so</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Single solve world records are in part skill (obviously), but also in part luck. Say, if someone were to beat the current single solve record by .05 seconds at an upcoming event, it wouldn't necessarily mean they are the better cuber.</p>
<p>As an overall measure of skill, the average solve time over a set amount of solves is the more accurate indicator and where the competition really lies, as &quot;anyone&quot; can technically get exceptionally lucky with a solve (provided they're already close to WR range in time) and beat a WR if their approach to the scramble was opportune enough to allow for a slightly faster solve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree and disagree with lyriktechs response to you. I do think there is an element of luck in the world records. That being said, you're not likely to see world records coming from anyone but the top few. </p>
<p>This can be seen by the current world record holder, Yusheng Du, who blasted the 3x3 record away with a 3.47s solve. But his average on 3x3 is over a second longer than previous leader, feliks zemdegs. May not sound like much, but a second is a long time to these top pros. </p>
<p>Now, these guys have insane look ahead. Look ahead is the ability to see pieces that you are not actively solving. Now an average cuber will use this knowledge to continue their solve after they've finished what they were solving to have zero pauses in their solve. Top cubers will alter the way they are solving the current pieces to make the next pieces (the ones they have &quot;looked ahead&quot; to) easier to solve, or in some cases they will incorporate them and solve them at the same time. All while looking ahead to the next set.</p>
<p>Now lookahead separates the world Champs from the insanely good. However, lookahead is still there for a reason. No cuber can look at a solve and know the exact subset of moves to solve it. Even if they had memorized a few, the chances of it coming up in competition are infinitesimally small.</p>
<p>So, what this means is that there is still an element of luck to their solve. They may be solving 2-3 steps at a time, with insane lookahead. They may know what algorithm is going to come up before they finish the first phase completely by looking ahead, but they can't tell you by looking at the cube that they will have to perform &quot;this algorithm&quot; until they get there.</p>
<p>In the leading method, there are 2 algorithms performed. One is after you have solved the first 2 layers to orient the top layer, the other is to permutate the top layer so it is solved. You have a 1/57 chance of skipping the first algorithm, and a 1/21 chance of skipping the second algorithm. There's a 1/1200ish chance of skipping both (has not happened in a world comp and a strong scramble makes this almost impossible) This doesn't change based on their first part of the cube. The best cubes can &quot;force&quot; certain skips by knowing thousands of algorithms if the last layer is properly oriented (you cant always force a skip), but even then you might miss an Alg you knew to force a skip because you're going so fast.</p>
<p>All that being said, every record in the past while for 3x3 has involved a skip. This most recent one by Yusheng Du is no exception and he skipped the final Alg. (this next part includes a little jargon) In a standard solve there are 4 f2l pairs to solve. His scramble included 2 solved f2l pairs which were able to be maintained and inserted [skipped] (suffice it to say this is incredibly rare, the best cubers may get 1 solved in the scramble and force another through good move set) after solving these two easy pairs (with some clever moves and good loomaead, I wont deny that), his 3rd pair was staring him in the face with an easy solve,  lookahead almost not necessary, and the 4th proved the same. After this he got the easiest orient algorithm (in my opinion) followed by a permutation skip (a solved cube).</p>
<p>So. Could I have gotten 3.47 seconds on this cube? Not likely. Could feliks? Probably, yeah. But feliks hasn't gotten this scramble before or one equally easy. So there IS an element of luck to getting that elusive world record. That's why I look at average to determine the better cubers. </p>
<p>Not to mention the controversy with the last solve, usually they are beat by a few milliseconds, or really big ones are done by like 25ms. A full second is huge.. And it happened in China, by a Chinese participant. There was no video recording (later a &quot;surveillance video&quot; surfaced that was clearly being held by a person). They input the results on their own Chinese cuber site and didn't share their results with the world till word somehow spread. They only had a picture. Seems about as authentic as the Beijing Olympics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, don't buy a &quot;rubik's&quot; branded cube. They're stiff, blocky, and turn terribly. There are tons of online stores like thecubicle.com and speedcubeshop.com that sell many kinds of speed cubes that range from $3-$50 ( the average is $16).
From there you pretty much got it, weeks and weeks of youtube! There's actually a really strong social media and welcoming social media community of &quot;cubers&quot;. As far as competitions, they are run by worldcubeassociation.org and there normally is just a small fee to enter, and anyone who can solve a 3x3 in less than 10 minutes is welcome (believe it or not, even the most basic method of solving a rubik's cube takes only takes a beginner about 2 minutes to solve!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can sign up for events near you at worldcubeassociation.org Anyone can enter, regardless of skill level. </p>
<p>Usually the entrance fee is based on what events you pick, but most of the competitions I've been to were less than $20 for 5-6 events. Most of the time you can spectate for free.</p>
<p>As for getting better, the biggest things are practice and new techniques. Owning a proper speedcube is also very helpful. The beginner's method will easily get you down to sub-30 seconds, and I was down to sub-20 with a mix of beginner's and advanced techniques. r/cubing and r/speedcubing are great resources for getting started!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started a few months ago, I’m not super great, and haven’t put in enough effort to get good times, but I’m getting there. I’d recommend getting a decent cube on Speed Cube Shop, and then JPerm on YouTube has some great beginner’s guides and walkthoughs. After you learn beginners, you start CFOP, which is where it gets much more intensive but also you get much faster. Good luck. It’s a lot of fun.</p></div>		</li>
