			<div class="markdown"><p>You can look at the spectrum to determine the red shift. From red shift you can calculate the radial velocity of the observed object </p>
<p>Radial velocity is related to distance by </p>
<p>V = Ho* d</p>
<p>Where Ho is The Hubble constant. We use this to find the distance to very distant objects. </p>
<p>The Hubble constant is not well defined, but is constantly refined by using other methods, including this already mentioned such as type 1a supernovae from white dwarves etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need the standard candle distance measurements for verification though. Otherwise you could explain red shifted frequencies by drift in other constants. For example if the fine structure constant was lower in the past then objects further away (older) would appear &quot;red shifted&quot;. </p>
<p>So you need both to be sure. It's a rabbit hole I went down junior year of undergrad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Changing the fine structure constant doesn't change everything proportionally, spectroscopy is one way people measure if the fine structure constant changes over time: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/01/05/distant-quasars-show-that-fundamental-constants-never-change/#7a3054a847ee" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/01/05/distant-quasars-show-that-fundamental-constants-never-change/#7a3054a847ee</a></p></div>		</li>
