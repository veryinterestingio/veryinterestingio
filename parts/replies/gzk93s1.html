			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard it explained already that since you really cannot have a system crashing while lives are depending on it, having older proven systems is better than upgrading just for the sake of upgrading. Also the more features you try to put into it the system there's a greater chance of having a fatal bug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and for that same reason, FAA certification for key systems, and upgrades of them, is brutally expensive. That is why you still have piston GA aircraft that are relatively new, or newly rebuilt, but burning leaded gas with magneto ignition, which hasn't been current ICE tech for about 70 years.</p>
<p>Edit: actually there's a good reason for magnetos, it's not just that they are proven they're a good design (batteryless)</p></div>		</li>

It was really funny when we had a single standard payload on a CD though, it would be like 20KB on a 700MB disk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aeronautical engineer here, sure good speakers are heavy but it’s mostly to do with old crappy electronics. The digital modulation of the transmitted signal (your voice) is quantised poorly (and band passed) by the amplifier module so instead of hearing perfectly what your voice would sound like you only hear what’s good enough for you to understand. I would imagine (I haven’t designed any so I can’t confirm) that the intercom and radio amplifier are integrated and so you hear the same standard as to what the pilot hears through his Headset. The reason that the Pilot hears such poor quality is to lessen the amount of bandwidth taken up on the usable frequency, so i was told many years ago. Don’t quote me on that last part ha ha</p>
<p>TLDR: There’s no reason for it with today’s electronics other than aircraft technology being light years behind everyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ee, you're pretty much right on.</p>
<p>Also the mics pilots use are special, think they're old carbon condenser mics or something but with special amps because they are very serious about limiting Interference, and a normal Amp could easily couple nearby Interference so a terrist could just tool up with a simple signal generator and the pilot would suddenly be no comm.</p>
<p>Forget all the bs they tell you about cell phones, early analog systems actually could interfere with an airliners radio like this which is why they bark at us every time even though modern ofdm qam systems have almost 0 chance.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But it is also light years away in things like reliability. If the mic. on your smartphone stops functioning, it is just an annoyance, if the pilot's mic. stops functioning, there are cases where lives of passengers are at risk.</p>
<p>Moreover, validation of electronical components for automotive and especially aeronautics applications is extremely expensive, so most of the time, as much as many components are just carried over; the best plane in the world is worthless, if you can't find a customer to sell it to, so price of the said components plays a major role why you can't hear the pilot telling you the air temperature at destination.</p></div>		</li>
