			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I think this is in the realm of my question. I grew up in the 90s so I do have memories of landline phone audio quality from that time, but not quite as far back as the recording I edited into my OP. I understand that in telephony this is because of the low sample rate needed to effectively communicate voice over the wire, but singing/music has so much more important acoustic information in it... so I'd think this sample rate issue wouldn't apply to music recordings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no concept of sample rate when recordings were made on analog mediums. Only bandwidth. And the old equipment bandwidth wasn't that great. Its not that didn't want better, its the equipment to do better didn't exist or was too expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should check out techmoan on YouTube, especially his video on wire recorder. Also microphones and the entire circuit that goes between the mic and the recording media were very different back then. If you have ever heard of the expression hifi, that simply means high fidelity and was made to distinguish equipment as capable of reproducing recordings faithfully and got popular in the ‘50s/‘60s</p></div>		</li>
