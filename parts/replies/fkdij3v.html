			<div class="markdown"><p>None of these cases create money. They simply affect how liquid existing money in the system is.</p>
<p>Creation of money requires a EIL5 on how the federal reserve works, but it is not one of the levers generally pulled for monitary policy. Countries that play games with money creation to adjust the economy usually get burned hard.  The levers the fed pulls generally changes liquidity in the system (by adjusting how much risk the system is willing to take. Case in point: allowing banks to keep lower reserves increases the risk of money not available on withdrawal but also increases liquidity)</p>
<p>2A and 2B are both levers to affect the federal funds rate (the market rate for extreme short term lending to stable financial institutions).  This has a direct impact on liquidy due to essentially benchmarking debt.</p>
<p>Basically, if you can lend to a stable institution at 1% overnight, someone will lend to stable institutions a two day loan for 1.1%, and go borrow a single day loan at 1% two days in a row.  This person makes the .1% if the rates stay the same, but takes on the risk that the overnight rate goes to 1.2% tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thus the rate for super safe money (overnight at stable institutions) Cascades into the rates for less stable products.  So moving the federal funds rate down essentially moves all lending rates down, moving it up moved all lending rates up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the reserve rate is dropped from 10% to 8%, does it not mean that bank with $20 million in reserve can now lend out $250 million instead of $200 million, effectively adding $50 to the economy? What am I getting wrong?</p></div>		</li>
