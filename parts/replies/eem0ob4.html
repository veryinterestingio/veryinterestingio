			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the essence of the question is, if the bodyguard can see that somebody is trying to take a shot at the client, and he is reasonably sure that the attacker is going to open fire in the next second, would the bodyguard be expected and/or obligated to get between the attacker and the client, knowing full well he may end up being shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the client I guess, if you ducked under a table while someone shot at Vladmir Putin, I doubt you'd live long anyways. I imagine the secret service puts the life of the president, and the safety of the nation above their own. Body guards of celebrities and pop stars probably do their best to protect their client. I imagine they are paid well and are most likely former police or military so they have training to handle heavy situations, but I doubt they have a &quot;my life for theirs&quot; mentality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, and the answer to that is whether you're doing the job for money or for patriotism. If the latter, yes. The Secret Service is supposed to die for the President if need be. A hired bodyguard will not die for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this.</p>
<p>OPs question is flawed from the start. In the event of an attempted shooting on the President, the secret service go into a meticulously practiced action plan. Several members surround the president and immediately move him to a safe location, while others look for/neutralize the threat. Everyone knows their exact role in the situation, and through drills, they know exactly what to do.</p>
<p>Knowing this, the question really becomes: &quot;would a secret service member just freeze up and not do what their trained response while the rest of their teammates acted appropriately because they do not agree with the ideals of the person they are protecting?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say the question is more flawed by lumping the secret service in with other body guards. Also your statement &quot;several members surround the president&quot; answers OP's question that yes, they are expected to actually take a bullet for their 'client.'</p></div>		</li>
