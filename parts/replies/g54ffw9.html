<p>Just an eclectic reader here: IIRC, there's a case where the neural tube fails to be &quot;capped&quot; or closed off at the top. The result is that the necessary &quot;where&quot; signals to trigger brain formation are not produced. If not detected, this can result in birth of a brainless (&quot;acephalous&quot;?) baby, so these mistakes can be pretty horrible. </p>
<p>It makes u/crashlanding87 's work incredibly worthwhile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As much as I remember from my genetics class, polydactyly, i.e., extra fingers is an Autosomal Dominant trait.
But maybe only a particular type of polydactyly is Autosomal Dominant trait.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a brief addendum from someone who's admittedly a lot less qualified, concentration gradients are extremely important to development early on as well. Even as a single fertilized cell, there is a concentration gradient of molecules within. This carries over when it divides, making two separate cells with completely different concentrations of various molecules which essentially orients the cells. An experiment was performed on sea urchins at the 8 cell stage where some were split in half such that each half had the same concentration, and the rest were split such that each half maintained an equal number of cells of each concentration. The latter group eventually grew into normal sea urchins, whereas the former group failed to because there was no concentration gradient to orient the cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazing! I was going to ask a follow up question on how symmetry is broken during early development. And you answered that: turns out the embryo is asymmetric from the start.</p>
<p>Is this asymmetry in the zygote due to random processes? If so, are there developmental disorders where these random processes have an uncommon outcome and the normal expected asymmetry isn't present?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plenty, that's how you get extra/less copies of organs, organs on the wrong side, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I've learned is that in C. elegans, when the sperm fertilizes the egg, its pronucleus and centrosomes move towards one pole. This pole then determines how certain proteins are distributed/polarized in the cytoplasm, which in turn align the mitotic spindle so that the zygote divides in an orientation that actually yields two cells with different concentrations of these various proteins. From there, this process can occur multiple times to create more axes. So to answer your question, the way the cell gets polarized is dependent on the direction the sperm enters the egg from. This ties into the general theme that small factors end up creating cascades of many, many developmental processes. </p>
<p>As a side note, the sonic hedgehog gene is iconic not only for its name but also how it easily demonstrates how concentration gradients outside of the cell affect determination as crashlanding mentioned above. The example I learned was that before the hand grows fingers, the SHH protein is most concentrated towards where the pinky should go, and least where the thumb should go. From this gradient, the cells of the hand can determine what they should become in order to form each finger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very early on in development cells acquire “sides”, which aid in their positional identity and the development of body axes (anterior/posterior, dorsal/ventral). This is usually formed by concentration gradients of various morphogens, but can also be caused by fertilization or even gravity. In the case of X. laevis (African clawed frog; classic developmental model), fertilization sets up the dorsal/ventral body axis. Wherever the sperm fertilizes ends up being the ventral side of the egg. In another classic developmental model, G. gallus (chicken), the egg rotates inside of the hen’s reproductive tract. Gravity and the rotating of the egg form the anterior/posterior axis by causing one end of the blastoderm to tilt up; this then becomes the posterior end of the embryo.
I wouldn’t say that asymmetry is ever caused by a random process. In some cases it may appear that way simply because we don’t fully understand it yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This concept also applies to immune cells. When T cells get activated in an immune response for example, they can divide into two --- dividing concentrations of key molecules differently among the daughter cells, such that one may stay a short-lived effector cell (ie, continue killing infected cells or helping B cells make antibodies, etc.) or convert to a long-lived memory cell (that can reactivate years or decades later when you re-encounter the original pathogen). Asymmetry is really cool</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, my main point was that the difference in concentrations across the cytoplasm results in asymmetric division. This creates two daughter cells that are different from each other from the very beginning, as opposed to cells that are the same at first but differentiate later due to external factors. One such factor is the presence of morphogens as described above with the SHH molecule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, not sure this is always the case. Concentration gradients outside of the cell are also important in determining cell fate, establishing body axes, and also differentiation.</p></div>		</li>
