			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  I read somewhere that virologists think it's likely some flu strains went completely extinct this year because there was so little opportunity for transmission.  It makes sense that basically everything that passes through incidental person-to-person contact (and _especially_ anything spread by respiratory droplets) would see a huge decrease in cases this year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This page from the CDC has a bunch of interesting charts on influenza infections in the US over the past few years [<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm</a></a>  ].  I found the one showing the drop in influenza-related infant mortality to be especially compelling.  It's about 80% of the way down the page at the previous link, or here's just that chart by itself [ <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/PedFlu23.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/PedFlu23.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2020-2021/PedFlu23.html</a></a>  ].</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder how this has affected planning for this year’s (and maybe next year’s) flu vaccine. I imagine the epidemiological models that are normally used to predict what strains will predominate have been thrown for a loop by a year where there was little to no flu transmission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a few minutes reading those charts I was like, “Cool! It seems like we’re having a tangible impact on influenza’s ability to kill people.” </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cost of this achievement has been massive. Seems to me that Covid isn’t going away any time soon. It’s like we’ve just replaced one family of seasonal deadly contagious viruses with a family of deadlier, more contagious, more robust ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Measles is one of the worst diseases you could choose to compare this to because it's legit airborne (one of the most, if not <em>the</em> most, airborne diseases), flu is a better choice to look at and flu rates were incredibly low this year.</p></div>		</li>
