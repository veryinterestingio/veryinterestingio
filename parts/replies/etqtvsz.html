			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in any way. A potentiometer can be configured as either a straight up variable resistor, or a potential divider. The former operates as a valve in line with the pipe. The latter acts as a tap; there's current flowing through the pipe, and you can tap off a small amount depending on how open the valve is.</p>
<p>Water analogies tend to break down when you talk about converting voltage and current. Here's an example that's closer to the physical reality, but makes no sense in practice.</p>
<p>A potentiometer in divider mode is a pressure valve. You have an input and feed it with any pressure you like. The fixed output usually is just an open drain, very little water flows through it. The center tap outputs pressure based on how you set it, basically a needle valve. It outputs a constant <em>pressure</em> but at a low flow rate. However, this is a special valve, the pressure it puts out is a percentage of the input pressure <em>vs the drain pressure</em>. That's why the drain is either left open, or feeds right back to the tank. Doesn't make much sense for a fluid system, but potential dividers are fundamental in electronics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would make sense for amperage, this is more like that spray nozzel you have on the end of a hose. So you can adjust the force of the water coming out not the volume roughly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most volume knobs these days aren’t potentiometers though. They are usually feeding a digital value into an amplifier. This way you can display the volume on a screen, change it remotely, change it for different sources, use alternate volume change buttons, etc. In cases where the knob doesn’t have a max or min value, turning the knob increments or decrements a loudness value which is sent to the amplifier based on its last stored value. When it does have a min and a max value,  a rotary encoder provides a value representing the location of the knob. In both cases, this would then fed into a logarithmic function to approximate human loudness judgment so that any interval of volume change seems the same across the possible loudness range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol’ed. I see you have also experienced the MOPAR Magic.</p>
<p>I went for a ride in a friend’s Hellcat. It was a beast and everything I expected from a dick contest winning muscle car - but I still troll him because his fancy radio gauges that showed horsepower and such locked up and crashed like an old Windows 95 compaq. </p>
<p>$70k car and they can’t keep the radio from crashing. Nope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this gets way way past ELI5 level though. In the end the sound is produced from an analog speaker. Somewhere in the chain the same thing is happening there are just a ton more components involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not a top level comment so I wasn’t going for an ELI5 explanation necessarily. But the top level comment makes it seem like the audio is just going through the potentiometer, but that’s not the case - if it were, you'd be wasting all of the energy you don’t want to hear as heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, but its important to understand that speaker power isn't run through the volume control knob, or the audio at all. On the old analog ones it was a potentiometer that controlled the downstream amplifier. On modern systems its actually a knob that puts out up and down increments, thats fed to a microcontroller and that decides on a volume level and sends it to the amplifier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentiometers are actually getting quite rare in audio volume control. Now we use encoders most of the time.</p>
<p>Also potentiometers are pretty much NEVER used to decrease the voltage of the signal, pretty much always they are used to set the amount an amplifier will increase the power (voltage and available current) </p>
<p>So your answer is pretty much flat out wrong except in the most basic of audio power control which would never be used on an actual audio product.</p></div>		</li>
