<p>I personally use it to thicken liquid artificial sweeteners to make sugar free syrup :) it's quite nice for protein pancakes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does it increase the volume of the water? Like, honey has water in it, but it's adding a lot more of the other parts of the honey too, so how would the volume increase enough to make it runny?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it helps visualize it think of it as melting ice into water, but the ice has salt in it.</p>
<p>When that happens you just add water by volume and the salt is there but dissolved.</p>
<p>So for OPs question you would assume (as did I before reading all this) that the honey would be there but just mixed in. But that doesn't happen, it actually &quot;breaks down&quot; so to speak. all that water (around 18% of the volume) just gets added to the rest of the water. And you're left with the sugar which just gets added to the rest of the sugars in the BBQ sauce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honey can be thought of as a mixture of sugar and water (of course there are other things derived from pollen and the bees themselves). </p>
<p>Adding even a small quantity of water to the honey will cause the sugar to be more disperses and separated by water molecules within the mixture. This new sugar water solution is more runny than the honey you started with and occupies more volume than the water you started with. </p>
<p>As a result the final mixture of honey and your sauce has a viscosity closer to the runny sugar water.</p></div>		</li>
