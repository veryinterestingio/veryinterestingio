			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, basically we get a boost of dopamine when we discover/notice a pattern. We are hard wired to notice patterns, like the way a leaf is shaped and repeated over and over on one particular kind of tree. When you look at any art, generally speaking, the idea is to find the pattern; does it contain trees, people, clouds etc. It's pleasurable and so you're more likely to look for new patterns as a means of survival, like wet ground likely means water nearby. Once survival (core needs) is dealt with, humans are more likely to continue to exercise that pattern recognition, and in doing so we looked for patterns in our imaginations, and thats basically the beginning of technology. The continual mental pattern generation (imagination) is probably one of the things that kept us alive. </p>
<p>One thing for music specifically, when we move faster our heart beats faster; with music when the beat goes faster we dance faster. Understanding the way nuerons impulse and mimic similar movements or sounds others make (phantom signals I think) it would make sense that our steady heart beat was likely the origin of rhythm. Sort of like an internal metronome. </p>
<p>I'm not a scientist just trying to think it through. Take this with a grain of salt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're 90% there with the pattern recognition. It's not just noticing that there's a pattern. You have to notice the pattern first. Then, when you anticipate the pattern, it's how the music plays to or subverts your expectations that creates surprise or pleasure in response to the music.</p>
<p>For example, if I set up:</p>
<ol>
<li>A B C</li>
<li>A B C</li>
</ol>
<p>On the third time, you expect another:</p>
<ol>
<li>A B C</li>
</ol>
<p>But sometimes a composer will write:</p>
<ol>
<li>A B Z</li>
</ol>
<p>To subvert expectations, then give you relief with another:</p>
<ol>
<li>A B C</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a central aspect of emotional response to music, socializing the pattern is just the first step.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read numerous times that humans are quite fond of patterns generally. Music is just another pattern. Not just that, it's one which we can physically express and add to in real-time. </p>
<p>At the same time we like patterns, we also like novelty. Music has the additional advantage of presenting us with a pattern, then changing it rather suddenly (key change, the drop, changing tempo, etc. :p ) to give us something novel.</p>
<p>... although, apparently this is no longer true since the invention of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I" target="_blank">four chord song</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The four chord song doesn't really disprove the novelty thing, it proves the pattern thing. We like that pattern <em>because</em> we've heard it before and we know how it's going to end every time. The reason why we never get sick of the four chord song is for all of the &quot;novelty&quot; things you listed (key change, the drop, changing tempo, etc. :p ).</p></div>		</li>
