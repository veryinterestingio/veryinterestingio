			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight correction: alcoholâ€™s effect is to reduce the amount of vasopressin produced by your body, which regulates your kidneys ability to retain fluids. Without vasopressin, your kidneys release more water than they bring back in to your body, and your bladder actually fills with fluid which is correctly interpreted as an urge to urinate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always looked at it this way like, alcohol is a poison and your piss is so white when drinking is because your body is working to filter that alcohol out, hence why you wake up with a hangover if you hadn't keep up on hydration.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct. The diuretic effects of alcohol are seemingly unrelated to its processing by the body, as the majority of it never ends up in urine.</p>
<p>Alcohol is not filtered out, it's processed by the liver in several stages. The majority of it is ultimately turned into a acetyl-CoA, which then enters the Krebs cycle to be used as an energy source for the body, and then released as water and CO2. (This is where the calories in alcohol come from, in addition to whatever other calories come from the left over carbohydrates)</p>
<p>You should still hydrate though, dehydration is one of many possible components of a hangover. (but rarely the only one)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your liver filtering out alcohol is largely unrelated to the diuretic effect alcohol has on your kidneys. Science also has almost no clue about why we get hangovers or how to prevent them. There's no evidence to suggest hydrating will prevent hangovers, you just won't be dehydrated the next day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: can the pee being more concentrated due to dehydration have the same effect? I've noticed that sometimes when I'm not drinking enough I'll feel the need to go, even though there's not much liquid in there. </p>
<p>I always assumed it was just the body's way of getting rid of toxins fast when it didn't have much water to spare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be the higher concentration of urea in your urine that's irritating your bladder for an extended amount of time and making you pee before you need to. I'm not a doctor though so just some thoughts</p></div>		</li>
