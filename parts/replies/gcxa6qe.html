<p>When the AC was broken in my bucket, it would take at least ten minutes to start defrosting. Once I got it working that summer, the windows didn't frost at all till the next winter! </p>
<p>Seriously though, defrost time went down to minutes instead of &quot;still kind of foggy&quot; as I pulled into work.</p></div>		</li>
