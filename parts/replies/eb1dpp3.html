			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the specific history of 3 and 5.  I just know that inversion between 2 and 10 has meant recession for the last 70 years.</p>
<p>Based on what I've read today, some people seem to be thinking that the 3 and 5 inversion is a sign that the 2 and 10 will invert...unless the Fed lowers rates or changes some other specific actions, which they very well may do.</p></div>		</li>
