<p>Interesting! I can understand the donkey-carrot dynamic the physicists must be going through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At some point the temperature is such that most heat is emitted in the form of X &amp; gamma rays, which can’t be reflected well by any material we know. At that point additional energy added into the plasma will immediately escape and the temperature can’t be increased further. Perhaps a gravitational mirror created using a black hole could overcome this limitation, but at that point you might as well harness an actual star</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By Wien's law, 100M kelvin has a peak wavelength of about 0.03 nm, which is already x-ray and starting to get in the gamma-ray territory.  We have techniques to manipulate x-rays, but I wonder how much gamma radiation leaks from this reactor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a variety of theoretical energy limits to temperature, pressure and density of matter, but they're defined in terms of particle physics, using experimental observations, cosmological observations, and theoretical math formulations; While these do form a number of useful predictions, we don't have complete understandings of them either.</p>
<p>Fusion power doesn't have much trouble with that part, though; It's not operating at those extreme limits.  Instead, the project of harvesting energy from controlled fusion poses a large number of practical engineering challenges involving geometry, maintenance, constructability, shielding, wear from neutron radiation, operations, and efficiency, which have various speculative engineering solutions.</p>
<p>It gets very complex because the only thing that's allowed to interact directly with these plasmas are magnetic fields created by distant conductors; You can't have them in contact with plumbing pipe or resting on top of steel structure as in many other engineering fields, because that will immediately destroy structure or plasma or both.  We don't reason terribly well with magnets or with plasmas, we have to engage with the math directly, and there are a lot of effects that you can't experimentally validate without an expensive large-scale apparatus.  As a result, there is still considerable disagreement as to basics like &quot;How to best confine these plasmas in magnetic fields&quot;, and substantial theories like Robert Bussard's Polywell magnetic cusp strategy are still wide open as to whether they actually function in practice.  Without extensive computational numerical modelling of plasma turbulence we'd probably never be able to design something like a large-scale stellerator, but whether stellerators are the optimal path forward for fusion is unclear.</p></div>		</li>
