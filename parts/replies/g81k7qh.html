			<div class="markdown"><p>I used these balldrive screwdrivers in a robotics class in high school. We worked with Vex parts. All the little bolts we used were fine. Kids in that class would somehow round down the ball end of the screwdrivers though. My teacher had to grind them down to make them work again.</p></div>		</li>
