<p>I know, there's google and all that, but I kind of have the notion that googling for mindfulness and meditation might end up with a lot of mumbo-jumbo that's dificult to discern from actually helpful content without a solid grasp of the subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did the same when I started therapy. It was the first time I actually realized there was a real reason why I had horrible understanding and control of my own emotions.</p>
<p>But now I have tools to be better at it. I have learned I have to take time to think about how I'm feeling, understand what I'm really feeling , and why. And sometimes I realize the &quot;why&quot; isn't fair for other people involved. </p>
<p>I have what she called anxious attachment because of my childhood experiences. And honestly, just learning that there was a reason to why I would sometimes act in a self-destructive way just made me break down. Because that meant it wasn't just how I am, and I can learn to control it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Story of my life. Was never quiet photographic but I tested 99th percentile in reading/writing and 95th percentile in math my sophomore year. This was the same year I ran away from home three-ish times. I know state tests aren't the best measure of intelligence but keep in mind that I had stopped paying attention in most classes for at least a couple years by that point. Too many problems at home to deal with school. Not long after that, began close to a decade of blacking out near nightly to forget the trauma of those years.</p>
<p>I've been working to accept that I'll never be quiet as quick or even as physically healthy as I once was. I feel like I was cheated. If I had just a single adult who was looking out for my best interests, I'm positive things would of gone differently. Not one adult helped, not one. </p>
<p>It's a god damn wonder I'm not a total misanthrope.</p>
<p>It's a god damn wonder I made something of myself and it's a god damn wonder I'm alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the feeling. I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm not actually that intelligent, I just did well in school with minimal effort because I had a really good memory. Especially excelled in memorization heavy subjects like history and foreign language. As an adult i don‚Äôt have that recall I used to and my critical thinking skills are pretty average so I feel like a moron now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is too relatable. Is there any methods you know of to reverse the damage? I feel fully retarded now. I used to have an almost full photographic memory and now my short term memory is worse than a sponges. I use to be able to recall anything I saw or heard. Even specific smells from when I was 4 years old</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it's nice to read all these comments that other people struggle with that as well.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna say that I had a photographic memory but I was a good student with a great brain. Then at 12, life came down like a mf'er.</p>
<p>I did smoke a lot of weed during my teens, and went to a lot of parties (started doing all sorts of drugs later on) (only at parties and only the good ones, not heroin and such) and I guess I always blamed it on that. Although I did found it strange that people who did even more crazy stuff than me, never had any issues with it.</p>
<p>I thought I was having dementia for the longest time.</p>
<p>I still managed to get my bachelor's degree but damn, the older you get the harder the studying becomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's relevant. Our brains forget reoccurring events like eating, driving home from work, or simply whether or not you locked the door. We also tend to forget information that isn't deemed useful. That's why you can look at the time, and then completely forget what time it is.</p></div>		</li>
