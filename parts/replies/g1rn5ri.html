			<div class="markdown"><p>The more CO2 is in the atmosphere the more the ocean absorbs. Water and carbon dioxide combine to make carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is what makes soda so acidic. Carbonic acid is also what carves caves.</p>
<p>This article explains why melting ice increases the CO2 in the water. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While countering it globally would probably be quite costly in terms of logistics, apparently there are ways to help neutralize it locally. The use of alkaline rocks like olivine might help, since naturally alkaline substances are able to neutralize acidic substances. For instance, if sodium hydroxide reacts with hydrochloric acid, the end-result is sodium chloride and water.</p>
<p>Granted it'd need to be done carefully, with the counter-solution keenly tuned to counteract the effects of carbonic acidification, but this kind of water treatment might be able to help combat ocean acidification. As for what substance should be used, I would propose extremely dilute limewater, with just enough calcium hydroxide PPM to counter the projected acidification without causing too much harm. The reason why I propose this particular substance is because when calcium hydroxide reacts with carbonic acid, it forms calcium carbonate, which IIRC is actually important for certain forms of marine life in regards to shell formation. So not only does it benefit ocean life, but it could also serve as a carbon sinking method while we work on tearing down the fossil fuel industry.</p>
<p>Hell, apparently Sweden agrees with my hypothesis, since they've been &quot;liming&quot; their streams and lakes since the 70's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be a lot of confusion in this thread. </p>
<p>Ocean acidification and the melting of Greenland ice are two separate phenomena caused by the release of CO2 into the atmosphere. </p>
<p>We should be clear that the melting of Greenland ice is not an important driver of ocean acidification and vice versa. They are merely both driven by the effects of climate change.</p></div>		</li>
