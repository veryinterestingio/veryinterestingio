<p>What were the more important things? Essentially, what was gained in the tradeoff?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dumping a feature that you don't need that's costing you energy to produce IS the thing that's gained.</p>
<p>It's also the reason that you lost the ability to produce vitamin C internally, it was super abundant in our evolutionary homestead. This meant hanging onto the machinery is negatively adaptive. Every process and machine in your body is one more point of failure and bad mutation. Why maintain the machinery to produce vitamin C when we can just get it ready made from foodstuffs.</p>
<p>Also the same reason underground animals with eyes have ones that tend to be pretty useless and small. Having large eyes isn't helpful in the pitch black, and they're points of infection and failure in the body, so evolutionary pressure leads towards them being shrunken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most importantly, lack of vitamin D in infancy and childhood will mess a person up real bad. You'll develop rickets and your bones won't form right; it can affect mental development too. It's super serious and I imagine in the times of hunter gatherer tribes pushing ever northward you probably wouldn't make it if you got rickets. Rickets &gt; skin cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the same gene mutation that gives people red hair also makes them more sensitive to high temperatures and less sensitive to cold.</p>
<p>Redheads have a higher chance of hypothermia but a lower chance of frostbite, maybe because losing function of a limb is as life threatening as hypothermia in the grand scheme of things</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the main reason.  The Inuits of Canada are one of the only (if not THE only) natives of the north that have darker skin.  Their diet of fish and other sea life is rich in vitamin D so they don't need to produce their own, so that evolutionary pressure isn't there and other ones, such as cancer protection, take over and allow for darker tints.</p>
<p>As to absorbing heat from the sun, I don't think that's much of a factor.  If you were naked, you'd lose more heat to convection* from the wind than you would gain from direct radiation from the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but the Inuit split from Asian populations in Siberia about 4,000 years ago and arrived in Eastern Alaska about 1000 years ago.  Comparatively, the Sami (Scandinavian indigenous peoples) have been there for between 5,000 to 10,000 years and potentially longer.  The Komsa (now gone) predate the Sami and migrated from NW Russia.  Time passing and where they traveled from would definitely impact what kind of adaptations they would have.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Komsa haven't necessarily gone. Just assimilated with the greater population. However you interpret that. A popular interpretation is that assimilated with the Sami people and influeced the northern Sami culture and language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, I dont think any color of skin would aid inuits in absorbing sun light. Since their enviroment requires clothing covering most of the skin, during most of the year. </p></div>		</li>

<p>My understanding is that the invention of agriculture was a significant factor driving the selection of lighter skin at northern latitudes. Early farming diets were pretty much rubbish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, agriculture developed in the middle east(ejypt, sumarians, greeks, romans). Invading sea or Gothic peoples of nomadic tribes from the north, or the Mongols had lighter skin. </p>
<p>Or just look at the Indian peninsula, or China. North=lighter skin; south = darker. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense to me. Europeans especially were impacted since Northern Europe is in a unique position since itâ€™s very far north compared to other agricultural societies but is warmed by the Gulf Stream which allowed the large-scale adoption of agriculture. Having a poor farming diet at such a northern latitude drove an even stronger selection for lighter skin.</p></div>		</li>

There's an extremely strong selection pressure to generate enough Vitamin D, given that if they don't have enough your kids all die young.</p></div>		</li>
