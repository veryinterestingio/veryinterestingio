			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think people are talking enough about how much the hysteria in the 80's and early 90's around crack babies was based on one study with a sample size of 23 people that turned out to be largely untrue.</p>
<p>The reporting around crack babies in that time was truly awful, with a huge racialised component. It's not hard to find articles from major news sources like news week or the new York Times claiming that crack babies would grow up to have IQs of 50, would be totally incapable of empathy and would bring a devastating crime wave when they grew up. The effect was to criminalise black children before they could even walk. Truly awful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have 2 adopted siblings that are both &quot;meth babies&quot; and the first 3 months of their life was hell for my parents. </p>
<p>They're both good kids but unfortunately not as happy as your ending. Because they were exposed to meth at such an early age it ultimately damaged some portions of their brains and they both really struggle as adults. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother in law is a Fetal Alcohol Baby. Unfortunately for him he has just enough mental issues and the telltale physical deformities to make life very difficult. He spent his whole childhood being mocked and made fun of and now is an incel. I dont blame him, he's just become so bitter.</p></div>		</li>
