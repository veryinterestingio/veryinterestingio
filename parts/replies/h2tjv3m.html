<p>I can vouch for this. Many rarely used words in English are commonplace in other languages and translate directly, this in turn expands your vocabulary quite a bit.</p>
<p>I have also read somewhere that people who are bilingual or multilingual can more easily visualize abstract concepts. Please don't ask me for the source, because I do not have it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That would be news to my dad. He thinks that the entire English vocabulary is limited, even though many words in Spanish (our native language) can and do translate into English words. I'm pretty sure he only thinks that because 1) <em>his</em> English vocabulary is limited, and 2) the people he often associates with aren't exactly wordsmiths. And this is despite the fact that he often has found himself asking &quot;What does that word mean?&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, English actually has a large vocabulary, because it often has several words from different sources for the same thing. It'll usually have one germanic word and one latin word for the same thing, but one will be much rarer than the other. English also has a ton of &quot;verb+preposition&quot; verbs that lets it duplicate normal verbs. Enter-&gt;get in, leave-&gt;get out, disappoint-&gt;let down, etc. On the other hand, I think this duplication doesn't really affect normal speech, because the rarer synonym will be received as odd and affected, like if you say &quot;ingress&quot; instead of &quot;enter&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HAH! English has the largest vocabulary in the world. Of course, most people don't know even a tenth or 20th of it. Due to how wide spread it is, how many different circles have English as their first language, how many sources of loan words it has, and how many areas in (especially) academia it takes over as -the- language to speak, you will never find a language with more words in it. Unless you take a language that can compound words excessively, but that is cheating.  </p>
<p>I think Spanish has roughly half as large a vocabulary, but don't take my word for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally find modern english to be relatively shallow in contrast to other languages. This stems from a teaching standpoint, culture, etc.. Spending a month with family overseas learning a new language from a local teacher (in my non-dominant language) while visiting was more interesting than the collective history I’ve spent learning and executing the English language in academia and with other people in a variety of contexts throughout my entire life. Raised bilingual/trilingual effectively from a young age and I still find English to be lacking in some regards. It almost punishes the common user of the language for trying to experiment or even use expanded vocabulary and grammar (the amount of times I’ve been redlined by Word and automated graded papers when the words I used were legitimate and correct is a common theme for me).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because different languages speak about things in different ways. I also don't have a source, but I'm sure you've heard of people who are bilingual not being able to quite describe the essence of a phrase (hoping someone could chime in on this), or translations not being quite right on a film or show (not because the translation was poor, but because <em>it doesn't translate well</em>). Being multilingual creates and maintains a plasticity in your brain that allows you to think of the world in a way that single lingual (a fun phrase to say out loud) people cannot understand.</p></div>		</li>

Some weirder things also pop up like how rain and buses &quot;walk&quot;. &quot;The rain is walking&quot; rather than &quot;It is raining&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually does not delay language skills. Speaking as a speech language pathologist and a bilingual person, many language norms/expectations are based on monolingual children. Not as much research has been conducted on multilingual children so if you’re only counting words in one language, of course it looks like the child’s language is delayed. It’s been proven that bilingual people tend to have better cognitive abilities because they’re able to think about language and analyze its structure more intuitively than monolingual people can. </p>
<p>BUT that isn’t to say children can’t have language delays if they are bilingual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah so it's probably more to do with who she's trying to talk to than her knowing which words are from the same language at her age. It's more like &quot;Grandpa always uses these words and old uncle Jack uses all the other words&quot; rather than &quot;grandpa speaks Vietnamese and uncle Jack speaks English&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn’t tell you what went through my head as a kid but I did know my grandparents only spoke Armenian so I wouldn’t speak English with them. I went to an Armenian school until kindergarten, so 1st grade was an adjustment. Also, to go from a school where everyone spoke Armenian to the only one that spoke Armenian was a challenge b/c there were words I didn’t know the English equivalent of. For example, didn’t know the word fork. It all adjusts itself as you get older.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's deeper than who's talking. They really do recognize which language they are supposed to respond to. You could ask the same question to a bilingual child at 2 years old in 2 different languages, and a developmentally normal child will respond with the appropriate language. Our brains are hardwired for language and are incredibly good at learning them. It's all context, and using a brain with the plasticity of that young of a child, they are able to parse out which language they are supposed to use really, really early on.</p>
<p>Edit: and I mean the same person asking the question who is also bilingual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they're very young, I think that's right. But at a surprisingly young age, they know which are which, actually. My daughter was able to correctly label things (say which language a word is in) when she was 2. My son was significantly less advanced, verbally, and has only started labeling things around the age of 4-5. He still knew which language to speak when he was younger (like with my English-speaking parents or his Korean grandparents), but he just wasn't interested in the word and translation games my daughter liked.</p></div>		</li>
