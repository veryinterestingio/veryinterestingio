			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this, atrial fibrillations (cardiac arrythmia) can happen when the normal heartbeat switches from a stable cycle to a chaotic attractor (<a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cardiac_arrhythmia" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cardiac\_arrhythmia" target="_blank">http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cardiac\_arrhythmia</a></a>). The existence of these chaotic attractors is unavoidable, a consequence of the math. Our bodies are simply very good at avoiding them most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think of an attractor as a stable pattern of behavior. The behavior could be really complicated, but if you perturb the system and it returns to the same pattern, we say the behavior is caused by an attractor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember hearing somewhere that Feigenbaum's constant applies to some cardiac arrhythmias as they descend into chaos, and that defibrillators utilize it to determine what rhythm of shocks to apply. Is there any chance you know anything about that? Because it's an old memory for me and I haven't been able to verify the veracity of it in recent times.</p></div>		</li>
