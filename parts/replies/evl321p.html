			<div class="markdown"><p>Humidity and personal adaptation make a huge difference as well.  </p>
<p>Sweating doesn't work as well in higher humidity (because the sweat can't evaporate).  People aren't used to drinking enough water to sweat enough.  Bodies acclimated to heat after a few weeks have more blood vessels close to the skin for radiating heat , and sweat glands release more water and less minerals and oils.  Also cultures adapt to heat by doing more at night and less during the day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you please come to Queensland and start teaching that to everyone? I moved here 2 years ago and even in the summer the shops close at 5.30 and most restaurants are closed by 9.30...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Where'd you get the idea that human bodies rapidly undergo these changes when exposed to a warmer climate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in continental climate, when in winter we sometimes have temps as low as -20C and in summer it's usually +30-35. It's actually a mild continental, farther east - spike is even higher. But I can confirm that +30 in May can feel worse than +35 in August just because body isn't used to it yet. Same is even more correct for winter. I usually feel as if I'm gonna freeze to death when it's -5 in November, but -15 in February is managable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've lived in the deep south USA as well as Phoenix (now in Michigan). Summer there is like winter up north.</p>
<p>You go from an air conditioned car, to an air conditioned office, to an air conditioned house.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>You go from a heated car, to a heated office, to a heated house.</p>
<p>The difference is that houses are designed for the heat down south, but designed for the cold up north. Down south, you need to do outdoor stuff early in the morning, or late evening. I was mowing the lawn at 7am most weekends, for example.</p></div>		</li>
