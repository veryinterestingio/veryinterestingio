<p>Totally! </p>
<p>E: my math might be wrong. It's actually closer to 5.6% increase in risk. But still there's a selfie involved, so it's totally OK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should, I don't know exactly how digital photos capture but radiation usually doesn't mess too much with electronics. However you won't be able to use film because the radiation will streak the film, that's actually why if you look at the old pictures of the elephants foot that's it looks so weird because of the film being affected by the radiation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photographing highly-radioactive anything is difficult.</p>
<p>The high-energy particles cause &quot;Static&quot; on the light-sensor of digital cameras.</p>
<p>You can see the effects of this on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCwk6gCFtSI" target="_blank">NASA's SOHO satellite, just after a solar flare.</a> </p>
<p>For a film-based camera the X-Rays and other energy will cause the film to turn white.</p>
<p>Both of these can be worked around by taking a picture of the radioactive thing using a mirror and placing the camera behind a thick shield. The mirror will reflect light, but high-energy radiation will pass right through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes are an exposed organ and therefore are more vulnerable to radiation, especially alpha particles which will not penetrate your skin unless they're at extremely high energies.</p>
<p>You can hold natural U-238 in your bare hands and be fine, but if you put it closer to your eye, well, you may get some cataracts or other eye damage if you're exposed long enough. U-238 predominantly decays via alpha particle ejection, but also gives off some low energy gammas which are safe enough to handle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An old family friend used to work in a lab that was a hard-core viral genome sequencing and protein biochemistry lab in the 1980s. So lots and lots of P-32 and S-35 labeled gels being run. Some the of the long time technicians didn't wear safety glasses nor had eye glasses when loading the big plate gels, so they were putting their eyes right in front of the wells where they were being blasted by electrons or beta particles. This was multiple times a day for the better part of a decade. Their overall radiation dose was low (they did wear their badges) but the focal nature of it didn't do their corneas nor lenses any good. Within 10 years more than one developed cataracts at very early age and I believe there was a bit of a lawsuit over the whole thing.</p>
<p>It's sort of sad, because any regular eye glasses or plastic safety googles of any grade would have substantially cut down on the dose.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought the range of alphas in water (assuming your eye is all water and assuming a 5MeV alpha) is about a few microns!</p></div>		</li>
