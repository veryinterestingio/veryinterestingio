			<div class="markdown"><p>Read it with caution. Sometimes the correlation doesn’t mean causation can get lost with his writing. Also some, maybe not pseudoscience, but some of the research findings if you read the publications itself vs what is being extrapolated for the book aren’t sound. But in my opinion this is true for all Malcolm Galdwell books. He makes very complex and often subjects that are not understood too “simplistic”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have this problem and found a solution that might be helpful. </p>
<p>Instead of asking &quot;what should I do/eat/whatever&quot; I ask myself &quot;in 20 minutes, what will I be doing?&quot; It helps me realize that no matter what, I'm going to make a decision, so I might as well just do it. I've found it to be especially helpful with food - I used to forget to eat, get sick, and then be indecisive about what to get. Now I just ask myself, &quot;what will I have eaten?&quot; </p>
<p>Obviously don't use this trick to name your baby or decide your next tattoo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite method when having trouble deciding between 2 options is to flip a coin. If you’re fine/happy with the result and aren’t upset with the result, go with that option. If you’re at all upset with the side the coin landed on, then you clearly wanted the other option more — even if only by a little bit — all along, so you should go with the one you wanted.</p>
<p>The way I see it is that the coin toss forces an outcome on you. No matter what you may have thought you preferred before the coin toss, once the coin lands, you’ll have an immediate gut reaction to the outcome. This will tell you your true preference so that you can make your decision with ease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading somewhere at some point that it was found that basically every decision we make isn't done by our conscious brain, but already decided upon by our unconscious brain, but we have the power as the consciousness to veto the decision, effectively meaning that instead of us having free will, we have free won't, which is to say that we can decide to stop doing or not go through with whatever we want, which logically means we effectively do have free will, because we can veto the option to sit around doing nothing, and veto the option to do basically anything, allowing us to do everything we'd normally be able to do if we had free will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also leads to certain terrible decision making skills in some people who, through biology, trauma
or upbringing,  haven’t developed a good “power of veto”</p>
<p>Basically, at the core is an emotional decision maker (a “child”) who operates on wants, desires, fears and gratification. Then the logical “veto” power can come into play (the “adult”) and redirect or negate harmful impulses.</p>
<p>It becomes a problem when the logical “adult” process becomes more of an enabler to the emotional self, justifying and rationalizing all sorts of “gimme gimme” decisions. Like an overwhelmed single parent who caves in to the every whim of a child, and they end up entitled, spoiled and kinda of a dick. </p>
<p>There needs to be a healthy symbiosis between emotion and logic, to achieve objective happiness. Swing too far in either direction, you end up acting like an entitled douchebag, or just a fatalistic pessimist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a very long sentence though, for sure a run on one. I really just wanted to keep it short and simple but it kept ballooning as I wrote and that long ass sentence is what you're left with.</p></div>		</li>
