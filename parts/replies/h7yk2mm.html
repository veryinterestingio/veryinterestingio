			<div class="markdown"><p>What u/trey74 said. You risk corrosion, rupture damage from freezing (water expands when frozen), and system failure when the water boils under pressure and becomes a compressable vapor. </p>
<p>Most hydraulic fluids are mineral oil or synthetic oil bases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a side note - brake fluid is hygroscopic.  Over time it picks up water.  Eventually it gets enough water to drop the boiling point into a dangerous area.  That is why you should replace your brake fluid regularly (follow OEM recommendations).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine oil has a few extra advantages over water: it's a constant supply of lubricant – which is great for pistons and other mechanical parts – and it's more viscous than water so it will be less likely to leak. Also a high pressure pump for oil may be more efficient than for water due to the higher viscosity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The important part here is expansion of the water when converted to steam.  Think of steam engine, where steam pushes the piston to drive the wheels. According to fire fighting principles, they say water expands to 1700 times it's volume when turned to steam.  </p>
<p>Just consider if water was used in a closed braking system, the water getting hot would automatically apply the brakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when fluid boils it doesn't apply the brakes.  Just the opposite.  It introduces a compressible gas into the hydraulic system.  When you press on the pedal you now compress that gas instead of activate the pistons at the calipers.</p>
<p>It would be much safer if it applied the brakes, but instead it leaves you without brakes.</p>
<p>edit:  I think what you are missing is when the brakes are no longer applied any residual pressure will push fluid back into the reservoir.  The master cylinder has compensation ports that are closed when the brakes are applied, yet when the brakes are not applied the system is open to the reservoir and any pressure in the system would simply be eliminated by fluid being pushed into the reservoir, not in applying the brakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty confident that the temperature related braking issues that arise the most when taking a street car on the track has way more to do with pads and disks than it does fluid. It's why I chuckle at carbon ceramic brakes as an option on high end SUVs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A large SUV that you might tow a heavy load in hill country might benefit from high end friction materials as organic materials can not handle as much heat. They are much more expensive. </p>
<p>Auto manufacturers have to balance cost vs performance. Think of you save 100 bucks on a few million vehicles. </p>
<p>It's also important to understand the performance of the more exotic materials at low temp. </p>
<p>We get in our cars and are often at high speed before anything is actually at operating temps. Some exotic materials do not perform well when cold. We watch race cars warm up the tires,  some actually need to get some heat in the pads for optimum performance. </p>
<p>Good stuff on this thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you're right.  Brake fade is typically caused by a layer of superheated air between the pad and rotor.  Slots and cross drilling are great for reducing or totally eliminating the phenomenon.  If your brake fade is a result of boiling fluid, you need to change your fluid.</p></div>		</li>
