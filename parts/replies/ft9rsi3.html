			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark#Size" target="_blank">Whale Shark</a>. It's a shark, not a mammal, but is known to grow up to 18m in length, comparable to Humpback Whales. </p>
<p>This is certainly unusually large (largest non-mammal), but it shows there are some species that can grow that large. You can also look at historical sea animals such as Ichthyosaurs, that may have gotten up to 20m in length.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Large bodies are just more energy efficient in cold climates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I laughed when that nut job was trying to insist humans had mermaid like relatives in the ocean. The illustrations were slim built, and its almost laughable people jumped on that band wagon even though other mammals in the ocean had a substantial coat of blubber from necessity not gluttony. I think he was exposed as someone trying to stop naval sonar experiments and didnt really think mermaids existed, but was hoping his crazy claim would start a #savethemermaids conservation movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>another factor is that living in water means your body weight is supported and not being smashed against hard ground by gravity, so great size isn’t so much work like it would be if you had to support it with legs, etc</p></div>		</li>
