			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this is actually the roundabout answer. I don't know for sure, but I'd assume the guitar came after the violin and other stringed instruments. Having never played the violin I'd instinctively place it on my left shoulder so I can used my right hand for the bow or whatever the hand piece part is). I'm right handed, which goes back to your comment on the history with lefties. </p>
<p>As the instrument evolved I'd bet this part came with it. The left hand still was in charge of pushing down the strings and the right hand did the strumming. I don't play the guitar but took a couple lessons. I instinctively wanted to play it backwards.</p></div>		</li>
