			<div class="markdown"><p>There is not since the only thing slowing you down to create terminal velocity on Earth is air. The highest velocity of anything in a vacuum is the speed of light. Granted, if you’re just falling on the moon, the highest speed you could achieve is the escape velocity, since the moon’s sphere of influence isn’t infinite to speed you up to the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand it correctly, this velocity can be worked out in terms of a parabolic orbit with periapsis at the body's surface: escape velocity is equal to the orbital velocity at periapsis. This is unaffected by how far you consider a sphere of influence to extend, because any orbit with eccentricity ≥ 1 is an escaping orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Escape velocity is defined as the speed necessary to reach an infinite distance with v = 0 at infinity. Even if the sphere of influence was infinite, your max impact speed would still be escape velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is escape velocity the fastest you could fall on the moon? I feel like there might be some weird abstract (impractical) setups to get faster than that. Though they maybe fall into the category of &quot;are you really falling on the moon then?&quot; (such as orbiting earth in such a way that you collide with the moon)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In vacuum there is no terminal velocity (excepting light) so theoretically yes.  In practice, you can only fall from as high as the gravity extends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have the right equation but you’re applying it to time instead of distance. His question included “if you fall from a distance 6x farther”. If we examine falling from a height of 5m, we find that it should take 1 second on Earth and 2.5 seconds on the Moon. The average rate of travel is then ~4.95 m/s on Earth and 2 m/s on the Moon. If I go 6x farther, the rate of travel becomes ~12 and ~4.9 m/s respectively. Since it’s only weight that changes and not mass, I would assume that if you’re traveling at any decent speed that it’s still going to hurt a lot when you impact. So I would say “no”.</p></div>		</li>
