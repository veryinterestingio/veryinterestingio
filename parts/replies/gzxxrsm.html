			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m having this done next week since I have issues swallowing any food that isn’t liquid. I feel like I’m going to choke/forget how to swallow each time I attempt to swallow. If the swallow muscles are paralyzed or weak is it possible to fix or is it a permanent thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the cause of the dysphagia (swallowing difficulty). After your video fluoroscopy the speech therapist/pathologist will explain what’s going wrong with your swallow (if anything is) and show you some exercises or different swallowing techniques if these are suitable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your reply, it means a lot. Do they only do liquid for the study? Or do they do actual food as well? I have zero issue with liquids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the issue is found to be above the upper esophageal sphincter an SLP (like myself) will help you address it (either by fixing the deficit or teaching compensatory strategies). If the issue is below the upper esophageal sphincter (e.g., esophageal stricture) you’ll likely be referred to a gastroenterologist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The answer to your question depends on what is found on the study.<br />
If the problem is to do with the actual swallow mechanism, the speech pathologists can give tips and exercises that will decrease the chance of problems. If the problem is that there's some sort of physical blockage in your oesophagus (a tissue web, a stricture, etc), then those can be treated, though it's often temporary.  If the study suggests there's something outside the oesophagus pushing in, then you'd get more tests to work out what it is (CT scan). If the problem is that the muscles in your oesophagus are just weak or not coordinated, there's not really much to be done, other than to eat slowly and chew really well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I’ve had this for about 20 years since an incident as a kid. Hopefully I can this figured out. For the test is it usually just liquid being used or is there normal foods as well? I have no problems swallowing liquids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add that there are other risk factors for aspiration pneumonia than swallowing difficulties .
Poor dental hygiene and lack of mobility are two massive ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom died from severely scared lungs from frequent aspirations and pneumonias caused by Parkinson’s (because Parkinson’s affects the muscles, and in her case, the epiglottis). The last year of her life, she continued to aspirate on her own saliva. </p>
<p>There are times it feels like my epiglottis is being lazy and letting liquids get into my trachea. Especially when I eat pickles, for some odd reason. Sometimes I even accidentally inhale my saliva. It’s so annoying. And why do I have to cough, for like, an hour, when the liquid obviously out of the trachea by then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m an SLP working with people with swallowing disorders. I also often cough when eating pickles. I don’t necessarily think I’m aspirating them but I think it’s the acidity — it must irritate the tissues in our pharynx.</p></div>		</li>
