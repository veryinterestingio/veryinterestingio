<p>I thought the eua had a timeline that could be extended also, but I could be mixing that up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it can be revoked when the landscape changes. For example, in April, they revoked bamlanivimab administered alone because the criteria of EUA were no longer met and clarified it was “not due to a safety issue.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great! The link you shared is gold.</p>
<p>To see if I understood correctly: if we look solely at the steps for approval, the emergency approval has exactly the same steps as the full approval. However, because it is formally a different process, a full approval does require that the steps are done in the required order. Basically, it's just an administrative difference.
Is this correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EUA vs full approval for these vaccines is due to needing to get data on <strong>long-term efficacy, not safety</strong>. Here is an interview with a world-renowned vaccine scientist who advised the FDA on the mRNA vaccines. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's true that the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA and not full approval yet.
But that's <strong>only because not enough time has passed to show how long the vaccines stay effective</strong>, Offit said.</p>
<p>&quot;Frankly, the only real difference was in length of follow-up,&quot; he said. &quot;Typically, you like to see efficacy for a year or two years.&quot;</p>
<p>He stressed that the vaccines' EUA status doesn't mean they're less safe. As a member of the FDA vaccine advisory committee, Offit said the vaccines are reviewed with the same level of scrutiny as they would to get full approval.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Offit, is director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, thoroughness then?</p>
<p>A lot of answers in this thread seem to be dancing around this fact. If EUA was as thorough as full approval, then there'd be no need for a difference... EUA WOULD be full approval. </p>
<p>I say this as someone getting the vaccine today. I get the need to expedite the process, but let's be honest about it.</p></div>		</li>
