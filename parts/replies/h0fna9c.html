<p>It kinda does. It gets partially absorbed into the skin like other liquids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sucked back in sounds kind of different from reabsorbed into the skin, it's like the original source of it is pulling it all back in with a certain force</p></div>		</li>

<p>The liquids just evaporate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well actually since we’re talking about the vagina, some can be absorbed. (However, that’s not to say that vaginal lubricant will get cleanly absorbed back into the body as a method of post-coital cleanup.) </p>
<p>Water cannot permeate regular surface skin (though water can be absorbed into the skin cells themselves, resulting in that swelling/pruning effect), water <em>can</em> be fully absorbed through the skin inside the vagina. You can actually deliver some drugs effectively by inserting them into the vagina because the epithelial tissue inside your vagina can absorb certain substances. Just like in your butt! (Ya ever heard of teens soaking tampons in alcohol and inserting them in their vagina/anus to get drunk? Because that happened a lot at my high school!) </p>
<p>Because a vagina is actually an internal organ, it has <em>non-keratinized</em> stratified squamous epithelium skin lining the inside rather than stratified squamous <em>keratinized</em> epithelium (regular body skin). The keratin inside the outermost layer of (technically dead) cells that compose our epidermis is what makes humans effectively waterproof, and we don’t have that protective layer of dead keratin-filled cells on the skin inside our organs which is why trans-epithelial absorption is possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the smell varies from woman to woman.</p>
<p>I'd look at diet for nasty smells, omfg, coffee and cigarettes are the worst, but meat is right up there, especially full of nitri(a)tes.</p></div>		</li>
