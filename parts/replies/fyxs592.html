<p>that look for microbes in the blood</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've worked in a microbiological laboratory in Germany.</p>
<p>If you are screening for microorganisms you take 4 &quot;bottles&quot; from the patient usually 2 from two different regions of the body for example 2 from the left arm, 2 from the right arm. You do this in order to minimize the risk of contamination.</p>
<p>Each bottle is filled with a medium that supports growth of aerobic or anaerobic organisms. When it arrives in the laboratory it's put into a instrumentation that cultivates these bottles usually for 5 days but if requested it can be cultivated for 14 or 21 days. In my laboratory we've used Bactec's from BD for the incubation. They are really good and will provide you with a lot of useful information like a growth curve or will tell you through fluorescence detection which bottle has shown signs of growth and you can put the blood from these bottles on different agar plates for cultivation and screen the blood under a microscope for the bacteria that has grown in the bottle.</p>
<p>Under the microscope you can usually get a good hunch of what bacteria will grow over the next 12-14 hours.</p></div>		</li>
