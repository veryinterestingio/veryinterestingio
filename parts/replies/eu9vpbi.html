The ejected material is expanding outward at ~10,000 km/s, so over time the outer layers become physically spread out enough that you can see through them and deeper into the expanding matter. If you watch over time the spectra will evolve from showing elements present in the outermost bits of the explosion to those at deeper and deeper points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s no way the entire star collapses in less than a second. Wouldn’t that mean the matter would have to move faster than the speed of light? Stars are enormous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a few different things going on. Once a star is formed it takes between millions and trillions of years depending on how massive the star is (larger stars die faster). The type of supernova people typically talk about is known as a core-collapse, which is a very literal name. The core is the part that is mostly iron, and is only a small fraction of the stars total radius. This is what collapses on the order of a second. Once the core collapses enough it becomes rigid, and then material falling in &quot;bounces off&quot; and creates the shockwave that propogates out.</p></div>		</li>
