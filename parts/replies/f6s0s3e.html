			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs don't get worms from water. Typically, it's from eating grass, rodents, or poo with worm egg in/on it. Your dog may get giardia from water like humans. </p>
<p>But to your point, animals can get sick from water. People think every water source that isn't purified isn't safe to drink and that is simply not true. It's just precaution not to drink it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to comment basically this, I just want to add for anyone curious that another very common way for dogs to get worms is through fleas. Tapeworms begin their lifecycle in fleas and if a cat or dog ingests a flea (common if they have fleas and groom themselves), they can get tapeworm. If you keep your pets on a good monthly flea/tick preventative you will rarely have to deal with worms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hike and camp a lot with my dogs and they LOVE jumping in random swamps and streams and, of course, drinking the water. My vet vaccinates them for leptospirosis. It used to be every six months but they now have a yearly vaccine so we switched to that.</p>
<p>The only health issue we've ever had from my dogs being out in the woods so much is that one of my dogs tested positive for Ehrlichia. Subsequent tests showed she had already cleared the infection with no symptoms so she didn't even need to be treated for it. That said, both dogs take Trifexis monthly so they are covered on fleas, heart worms, and various other parasites.</p></div>		</li>
