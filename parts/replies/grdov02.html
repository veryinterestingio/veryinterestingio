			<div class="markdown"><p>There are no inherently bad smells. Its alle just beeing interpreted by your brain. Context is a powerfull thing, the chemical that makes parmesan smell like it does also makes puke smell. If i give you a small glass full of butric acid, Yyou either find it appealing or disgusting depending on what i tell you, you are supposed to smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a genetic component to that? For instance I can't <em>stand</em> the smell of parmesan. If I'm even in the same room as it I feel like I'm going to throw up. Yet other people sprinkle it on their food like it's the best thing ever. </p>
<p>Could that be genetics or learned behaviour? Or something else?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If someone gave me a glass and told me it was full of liquid parmesan cheese, I'd still eye it sideways.   Pourable parmesan falls flatly in the &quot;suspicious&quot; category.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smell is just your body detecting airborne trace chemicals. It’s interpretation to many people could be VASTLY different. Same with taste. That’s why I can’t STAND cilantro and other people love it. Why would you want to eat a plant that tastes like chemical soap wrapped in rubber bands</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the opposite is true of good smells, too.</p>
<p>It should be fairly intuitive, but the modern world has exposed us to so many new chemicals (and thus smells) that our brain (and nose) aren’t tuned to, so there are plenty of “bad smell = harmful” exceptions now, but it still works for the classics!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it means they’re not used to you. Generally you get used to body odor if you live with them or are directly related. Humans used to live in small tribes which have a similar smell so it’s used to identify people who are outside of your tribe</p></div>		</li>
