			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn’t a logical fallacy per se, it just limits the conclusions you can reach. If your argument is about “Scotsmen”, and keep limiting the definition of Scotsman, you can still reach logical conclusions, they just become severely limited in their utility with respect to the initial argument.</p>
<p>Anyone using the no true Scotsman fallacy is really just saying that the example is an outlier and is not representative of the general trend you are trying to establish.</p>
<p>For example: </p>
<ol>
<li>“golfers have to be athletic.”</li>
<li>“My dad is not athletic.”</li>
<li>“Your dad isn’t a true golfer.”</li>
</ol>
<p>so, “golfers” now doesn’t mean people who play golf, and it’s still a correct conclusion if you really meant “golfers” as professional golfers.  But it defeats the whole purpose of the initial assertion, which is likely that playing golf at a high level requires athletic ability. What you really mean to say is that your dad is not part of the class of people who are good at golf and play it very seriously/professionally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation is great but No True Scotsman is definitely a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman" target="_blank">logical fallacy</a>.  Deleting your first sentence would probably be a great help to people who are just learning this because if they start saying its not a logical fallacy, that's going to make them seem like they don't know what they're talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. If you say some Muslims kill people, and they say those are not true Muslims,  then yes.</p>
<p>If you say &quot;Islam&quot; is violent, well, what does that even mean? Islam is an idea, not a person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh, that's a complicated question for obvious reasons. Arguably it isn't, if you take the position that nonviolence is a definitional part of being a Muslim. For example, I don't think anybody will say it is a fallacy to say that somebody who claims to be a pacifist, but kills people, is not a pacifist. Pacifism, by definition, excludes killing people. </p>
<p>So if you are willing to take the stance that violence is always forbidden by Islam, then you can say that by definition people who commit violence aren't Muslims. But, as an outsider, that seems like a pretty hard argument to make given that Muhammad himself and the people who knew him personally killed plenty of people. So violence is allowed by Islam under certain conditions, but you disagree with other Muslims about with those conditions are. Whether or not saying that terrorists are inherently non-Muslims is a fallacy, it is unlikely to be a convincing argument to somebody from me outside who sees what they perceive to be many Muslims who support, or at least do not oppose as strongly as is desirable, violence generally and terrorism specifically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is.  The valid response would be that it violates Islam and so people doing the killings are <em>bad</em> muslims and are following a perverted and warped interpretation of the rules.   Not that someone is simply not a Muslim. </p>
<p>Now, this gets a bit thorny, because with any sectarian conflict, there are lots of different sects and some sects get pushed to the margins. Some Christians say Mormons are not Christians (and Mormons disagree).  But anytime you get near the generally accepted boundaries of a definition, things start to get fuzzy, and then you end up having an argument about the definition of things themselves, rather than the underlying point.</p></div>		</li>
