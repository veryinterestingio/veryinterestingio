			<div class="markdown"><p>Herd immunity won’t make a disease disappear, just slow down the spread as R goes to 1. You will reach an endemic steady state of infections, and the chance that you get it sometime in your life approaches approximately 1-1/e =63% depending on what model you select. Perhaps higher in other models. Not really a good “ending” is it?  </p>
<p>I am hopeful that we can eradicate it with an effective vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldnt herd immunity make the current R go below 1?</p>
<p>ie if everyone got it tomorrow and then recovered within a month, assuming they are immune there would be few left to infect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If 70% were immune he is saying R would near 1 making it endemic.  If 90% were immune R would go less then 1 and it would ebb and flow until 70% ish were immune again I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses are constantly mutating. If a mutation made SARS COV2 less effective at reproducing, that new mutation would die off. Not the original strain. It would keep spreading as before. </p>
<p>Likewise, if a mutation made it so it could evade antibodies from COVID 19, that wouldn’t end the original pandemic. That would just give us 2 different strains to worry about at the same time.</p>
<p>When a virus mutates, the new mutation only exists in a single virion which can then reproduce. It doesn’t magically change all the viruses around the world at once.</p></div>		</li>
