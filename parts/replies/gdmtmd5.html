			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's to shield the pastry from radiant heat. The foil reflects a bunch, and absorbs a bunch and re-radiates half of <em>that</em> back away from the pie. Plenty of heat is still getting through to the pastry, because the air under the foil is about as hot as the rest of the air in the oven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also traps the moisture/steam under the foil so the crust doesn't dry out, if it's dry it'll burn quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd add low specific heat, as well. It just isn't holding that much heat energy relative to something like water to get to a certain temperature. It's not super low, but pretty low</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. u/MultiFazed's point about low mass is only half true. It's about the mass*specific heat. Aluminum foil has a small mass and low specific heat, so it stores very little energy, even at high temps.</p></div>		</li>
