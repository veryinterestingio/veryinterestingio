			<div class="markdown"><p>They give off heat, but not enough to boil water. That's the kind of heat we need to make power. In the end, nuclear power is just a really neat way to make a steam turbine turn. </p>
<p>Spent fuel still has usable uranium in it, but in order for it to fission and make energy, it has to be hit by a neutron. When it fissions, it releases more neutrons, so that's usually not a problem... But after a while, all the leftover junk from fissioning gets in the way and blocks the neutrons from reaching other uranium atoms. We call it &quot;poison&quot; for the reactor. We take out the old fuel for either disposal, or reprocessing to extract the leftover good fuel from the poisons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of a reactor is to increase the density of free neutrons to increase the probability of fission events. Fission events release an enormous amount of energy. When a reactor is not active the neutron density is very low, and fission events exceedingly rare. Far more common are instances of natural radioactive decay, which don't release nearly as much energy.</p>
<p>The rate of this decay is constant regardless of outside factors. We measure the rate of decay in what is known as a halflife. This is the time it takes for half the population of an isotope to decay into daughter elements. </p>
<p>U-235 (the stuff used in reactors) has a halflife of 703,800,000 years. Such a long halflife means that while it will be radioactive for a long time, it won't release nearly as much radioactivity per unit time as say cobalt 60  (with a halflife of 5.27 years, and a major contaminant in nuclear systems) because the decays are spread so thin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are engineering reasons why a fuel assembly has to be removed after a certain period of time, much shorter than the time it would take to burn 100% of the fissile material inside.</p>
<p>You could still get a very small amount of energy (compared to the full operating power of the reactor) from the decay heat of the fuel. But the power produced just due to decays is much lower than the power you get from induced reactions while the fuel is still in the core, and the core is critical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Also IIRC the spent fuel rods tend to become brittle due to accumulated effects of intense radiation on the casing. You really don't want them to break. Corrosion may also be a concern? But in short there are mechanical/chemical limits to their usable lifetime too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: that power CAN used, but not by the type of nuclear reactors that we limit ourselves to, namely, light water reactors. </p>
<p>The problem is that uranium fueled nuclear reactors generate significant amounts of plutonium when they operate, and Plutonium is what you make atomic bombs out of. </p>
<p>Nuclear reactors can “burn”plutonium,  but they have to use heavy water (deuterium) instead of regular water as the neutron moderator/working fluid, and are much different in design. </p>
<p>The problem is not a technical one, it is a political one. We don’t trust other countries to have a bunch of plutonium sitting around, since it doesn’t really take al that much of it to make nuclear bombs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immediately after shutdown our reactor would still generate 6% but that decayed away very rapidly. The decay heat is not enough to generate commercial power but it would be great way to heat a swimming pool.
The fuel bundle is reused. It will be put back in the reactor to obtain a specific reactivity profile. Sometimes the most spent ones are stuck on the outside rows to shield the vessel from the rest of the reactor. Even when the fuel bundle has been cycled through the reactor there is plenty of fuel left. Its just not in the right configuration to sustain a reaction. Reprocessing the fuel is possible but it is its own can of worms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, fresh fuel is basically uranium isotopes and not much else. These are primarily alpha emitters which are safe unless ingested (do not eat nuclear fuel). Activation and decay products on the other hand are NASTY with all sorts of emission going on (including neutrons I think). But there's a lot of high energy gammas coming out of the actinides that it's just... Not something you want to be around for very long. </p>
