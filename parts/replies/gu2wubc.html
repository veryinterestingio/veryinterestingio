			<div class="markdown"><p>The mRNA “competency” is not really an issue. All life reads mRNA in the exact same manner and we know how human cells package and protect their natural mRNA for transport in the cell and for identification. Once the sequence of the protein of interest is found (which can be done very quickly with mass spec proteomic analysis) then an mRNA for the protein that is capable of being used in humans can instantly be determined. Production of mRNA is also very fast compared to having to produce loads of the specific protein in vivo and then isolating and purifying that protein. mRNA product can be done in vitro, so isolating and purifying is much easier and faster.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seems worthwhile to try some different approaches, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think no, when your body recognizes something as non self, it’s recognizing a minuscule protein variation on a protein it otherwise ignores daily.  This is how some auto immune disorders work, by mistaking self for non self</p>
<p>If you recognized ferritin as non self you’d be dead lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not necessarily recognizing a variation to something it normally sees. It is often something completely foreign or something already known as bad. That, and/or it is something being associated with a direct immune response (ie adjuvants and immunizations). Thus the same way other vaccines cause our bodies to create antibodies to harmless proteins (inactivated/killed vaccines), it could hypothetically cause us to create a similar response to the ferritin. I was just curious if anyone had any more details as to how this has been looked into, if it has. </p>
<p>Also I doubt you’d be dead. We have people living with autoantibodies to DNA, RBC, and all sorts of other vital things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Respectfully, that's like saying &quot;what if our bodies recognize air as dangerous while using an emergency inhaler&quot;.</p>
<p>Certain parts of our genetic code for our immune systems are whitelisted to be ignored.  The possibility of that mutating is negligible, but the possibility of it mutating on a mass scale is pretty much zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lot I could say to that. I’ll just say It’s definitely not like saying that. Here our immune system is being stimulated to react against something and create a defense. Not gonna touch the rest, but he screening process is far from perfect. Autoantibodies have been created by illnesses and vaccines before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not entirely true. The lipid envelope fuses with the cell and releases the mRNA, which every cell in our body can can turn to protein (well almost any, not red blood cells). Then the cell degrades the end product and those pieces of the spike get put on the surface of the cell through MHC I proteins. Alternatively you can have uptake by antigen presenting cells and presentation of the those degraded products by MHC II proteins. Both are how the immune response is activated. Its not just proteins floating around out there. The only efficiency problem is having the right genetics to make these MHC I and II molecules as well as antibodies. And also having a functional immune system.<br />
