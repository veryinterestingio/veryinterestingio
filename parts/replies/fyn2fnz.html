<p>I believe it was in the Frontier bankruptcy they claimed they had to give their CEO and other high level employees a large pay check or they'd leave.</p>

<p>Like one case where the IT department of a company going down learned that &quot;expandable employees&quot; like them will most likely never see a dime. So they told the bankruptcy management that either they get properly paid, or the new management will have to sort out what's left without any IT whatsoever. Miraculously, they found money to pay them very, very quickly...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>at the end of the day it all comes back to the value of your work. If you are a high value employee because you provide a service which is hard to find and hard to do then you have the leverage needed to ask for what you want in terms of compensation. </p>
<p>If you are a basic office admin then you are basically worthless because you can be replaced by the thousands of other people who can do that job. This is expanded on even more when you realize that companies no longer need to hire people from their own city/country, but have access to almost the entire worlds working population pool for a given field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sounds like IT is run by Stretch Armstrong and Mr. Fantastic.</p>
<p><em>expendable</em> is probably the one autocorrect was looking for.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or a normal day in IT, where employees are stretched so thin that you can read the newspapers through them.</p>

<p>No autocorrect here, it is all my fault. Not a native speaker, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really good explanation, thanks! It does makes sense to pay a CEO a competitive salary to stay in a sinking ship but I was just having a hard time thinking about one person being paid millions of dollars instead of investing it back to the company to stay afloat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Toys’r’us was a great example of this. </p>
<p>The execs were paid a ton while low level people were kicked to the curb, however without those execs they wouldn’t have had a shot at surviving, which they were getting close to doing. And to lure execs of that caliber to a company where the chances of failing is high you have to pay a bunch.</p></div>		</li>
