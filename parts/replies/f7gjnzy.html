			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. When the summer is over and I have to put my daughter on a plane back to her mom and I know it will be close to a year before I see her again. This is the first thing I feel. The lump and the feeling of not being able to breathe. The pain afterwords is actually excruciating. But the lump is the first thing you feel when you know you're about to lose all control of your emotions.</p></div>		</li>
