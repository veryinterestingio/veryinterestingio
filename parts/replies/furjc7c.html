<p>I didn't know this, I thought pigs were one of the few exceptions and just wanted to add it as a sort of &quot;fun fact&quot;. </p>
<p>Most animals I can think of right now don't scream in pain...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure if it’s exactly known why but studies have been done and screaming and cursing when in pain does show a measurable increase in pain tolerance.</p>
<p>Screaming in fear is for a different reason though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about screaming, but Mythbusters tested cursing vs mild language, they had a bowl of freezing water and they tested to see if swearing loudly helped them keep their hands is the bowl longer compared to shouting regular words, and on average they held their hand in the bowl 30% longer when swearing.</p></div>		</li>
