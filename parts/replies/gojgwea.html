			<div class="markdown"><p>Even news interviews are terrible.</p>
<p>I got picked to be the cute kid on several &quot;person on the street&quot; bits.  I never put up with it so they didn't air.</p>
<p>I was at the &quot;John Beargrease sled marathon&quot; in Duluth when I was little (11ish).  The news team filmed me with a script pretending to be so excited to meet a woman that was popular at the time then they filmed me at the start.  I went to her trailer and pretended like I gave a crap but I didn't so it didn't work for them.</p>
<p>I acted as myself.  They didn't like it. </p>
<p>My favorite part was when they asked me to say what happens at the start.  They wanted something cutesy and I said, &quot;They line up, the guy says 'Go!', then they go.&quot;</p>
<p>I still remember the look of failure in the news lady's eyes.  It still warms my heart.  It's a sled dog race.  Go talk to the dogs if you want something to say.  Go talk to the mushers.  Don't bug some kid that wants to watch the race.</p></div>		</li>
