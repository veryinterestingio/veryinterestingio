			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also much more common when the water is more pure, I believe. Do you use distilled or filtered water? We use distilled water at work and it happens a lot, but the straight tap water at my house never does it. </p>
<p>I believe this is because, without a point of impurity, water cannot begin the crystallization transition from liquid to solid. Tap water has <em>many</em> impurities, so it can start the transition at many different parts of the ice cube. But distilled or purified water typically stays liquid longer in your freezer, searching for the impurity to start the state change. Once it finds it, BOOM rapid ice cube generation. The faster is flashes over, the more likely to spoke up while it expands. </p>
<p>What's really cool, is you can super-cool water lower than freezing temperature if it's <em>really</em> close to being pure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can do this with some store bought waters. It's not a sure thing, but if you freeze multiple bottles some won't crystallize until disturbed. If you take them out carefully you can do cool party tricks like pouring ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve always wondered this! I grew up with rural well water (which is delicious) and it never happened, but I see it all the time with my freezer in NYC. Iâ€™ve always heard that NYC has some of the purest tap water for a city, pretty amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now Iâ€™m curious why Iâ€™ve never seen this with any of my ice cubes and trays before. Whatâ€™s the key factor in whether a tray does this?</p>
<p>EDIT: I use tap water, not distilled, but itâ€™s relatively pure compared to a big city. The blower is pretty strong but itâ€™s also blocked by my third tub of ice cream that week, so itâ€™s probably because my ice trays are nice and slippery, easy to get the cubes out with minimal swearing and bending</p></div>		</li>

<p>One major one is how well the ice sticks to the side of the container.  If the ice can slip then the whole cube will expand upwards instead of creating a hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water shouldn't have any dissolved solids. Try putting distilled water into your trays and see if you get a spike.</p>
<p>(any bumps in the top of your ice cubes are baby ice spikes that just didn't make the big league).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This relies on the outer ring of the top surface freezing before the rest of the ice. If air blows across the top of the ice cube, it could create enough mixing to stop ice from forming outside-in.
Does your freezer have a heavy blower?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metal vs Plastic ice cube trays may have something to do with the irregularity people observe. Metal will more likely cause freezing more from the outside in. In the inverse insulation case for example, often used to make clear ice cubes for hard drinks, fill an insulated cooler with water and freeze that whole. The block will be perfectly clear to saw clear chunks off. I don't think they produce those spikes due to the added insulation that produces this effect but I'm not sure where I would even find anything on that.</p></div>		</li>
