			<div class="markdown"><p>At least the Cheetah genetic problem isn’t due to human interaction. It’s from something like 15,000 years ago. However that’s also really sad and scary because you realise how SLOW natural selection/evolution</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Koalas are plagued by STDs, chlamydia and an equivalent of HIV in their case.</p>
<p>Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics, but they have a bunch of symbiotic bacteria in their guts that help digest eucalyptus leaves and these are also wiped out by antibiotics that treat chlamydia.</p>
<p>There is also a koala retrovirus that attacks their immune system and makes them prone to cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that human beings have a historic bottleneck about 50,000 years ago where we were down to about 15,000 people. I don’t have a source but the theory was that the lack of physiological variation in our current world population stems from that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s an unfortunate bit of incorrect info that’s been repeated all too often.</p>
<p>What you’re referring to is commonly called the Toba Extinction hypothesis and is more like 70,000 years ago.  Didn’t happen though.</p>
<p>The problem is that a small group of people entering a new area and rapidly radiating to fill it look very much like a near extinction event at a genetic level, despite it being literally the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Each of the bottlenecks in human history is tied to a specific time <em>and</em> place and the genetic restrictions are found on one side of that physical barrier, but not on the other.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of references in the following link and I believe I have more references tucked away elsewhere. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's really interesting is where I read about this small group of proto humans we sprang from survived by living near oyster rich waters.  As a result they started to survive off of harvesting those oysters. Eventually noticed how it was easiest to harvest during a full moon because the tides would be at their lowest and the night the brightest.  This created an ample and steady food supply for those who were the smartest.</p>
<p>Hence the beginning of our ability to recognize abstract patterns and create novel associations.  Which really is the basis of our intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> people seem to be confused, here's a link to explain it.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read about this and other comments say that this problem can be overcome with time. So with 50000 years and billions of humans why haven't we overcome this problem? They say even a handful of apes is more diverse than us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strangely enough I heard another theory that we breed much more selectively than other species. So much so that you can see the emergence of contemporary beauty in modern humans vs 500 years ago.</p>
<p>This seems a little less scientific to me, and even then doesn’t explain the lack of variability.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that once removed, variation is difficult to re-introduce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>50,000 years just isn’t that long evolutionarily. Also the world population only reached a billion in the 1800s so it’s not like it’s been 50,000 years of 7 billion people cycling through every generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(1) We didn't have billions of humans for 50,000 years.  In fact, about 7 percent of the entire number of humans who have ever lived are alive today:  <a href="https://www.prb.org/howmanypeoplehaveeverlivedonearth/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.prb.org/howmanypeoplehaveeverlivedonearth/" target="_blank">https://www.prb.org/howmanypeoplehaveeverlivedonearth/</a></a> .</p>
<p>(2) Geographic separation and cultural segregation have combined so that human mating is not random across the entire global population, but generally has happened within ancestrally similar groups.</p>
<p>The US is one of the most mixed-race societies in the world, and yet only about 6% of the population is mixed-race.  (That number is jumping rapidly, though--it's 6% of the overall population but 14% of American babies born in 2018.  In 1960, it was not only rare in all of the country, but illegal most of it.)</p>
<p>When 50% of the world is mixed-race, we'll have overcome that genetic-variation problem.  (Of course, well before that, the entire socially-constructed concept of race will probably have collapsed, except for a few Slytherin-like purists out there.)</p></div>		</li>
