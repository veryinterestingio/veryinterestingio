			<div class="markdown"><p>The mutations are nearly always imperceptibly minor. This is why every creature beyond a microbe does sexual reproduction. You need a mechanism to transfer mutations so you can combine them. </p>
<p>A mutation might be something as minor as 2% more of an enzyme in your saliva. 100,000 years later, a descendant can digest cellulose. Most mutations don't really help you. They aren't there to benefit you, they are just random.</p></div>		</li>

Thereby a very relatively small mutation in the concentration of sonic the hedgehog could easy give rise to a large mutation such as an extra finger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered how everything comes to its right place in gestation, like very specific instructions and the cells can understand what to put where at what time, but reading your comment it makes sense, &quot;procedurally generated&quot;. I guess that's why faulty genes can make deformities that affect many parts of the body instead of one thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, mutations can affect a single nucleotide, a whole gene, many genes, or even a whole chromosome.<br />
See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation#Large-scale_mutations" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation#Large-scale_mutations</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation#Small-scale_mutations" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation#Small-scale_mutations</a></p>
<p>And even small-scale mutations can have large effects. For example sickle-cell anemia is caused by a single nucleotide mutation. Large-scale mutations are more likely to cause large-scale effects, like Down Syndrome which is due to an extra copy of chromosome 21.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever studied molecular genetics (I'm pretty sure you might have seen in high school bio at least) a codon is 3 nucleic acids that code for an amino acid. There is a lot of redundancy. for Proline, CCx (x being any of the 4 nucleic acids) is the codon. So if your gene is CCU and it gets changed to CCA, there is no change in expression at all, you still have a proline there.</p>
<p>But UGA is a stop codon, meaning expression of a protein stops there. So if you have UGG (Tryptophan) and that gets changed to UGA, suddenly your protein stops in the middle of being built and you may not have a functional protein at all.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Think about it this way. You take a full-length novel and change a single character (including spaces, punctuation, etc.) to another at random. What effect does this have? Most likely it's a typo. &quot;The&quot; becomes &quot;thj&quot;. Most mutations are going to break something. It gets fixed by spell correct (your DNA repair mechanisms) or slips through and doesn't make much of a difference because it wasn't anything especially important (one of the title pages now has a stray 'n' on it where there should only be empty space, weird but it doesn't change the understanding). But if you do it often enough every once in a while you'll get something that changes the meaning in some way. Your copy of <em>Harry Potter</em> has a single instance of &quot;wand&quot; changed to &quot;wang&quot;. And if there's some selection criteria, like laughing at that change, it might be enough to give it a greater chance of reproducing and get passed on.</p></div>		</li>
