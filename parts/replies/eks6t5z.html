			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to clean some Sturgeon the other day and the fish had been in the fridge for about 3 hours. When I took it out to clean the lips and gills were still moving like it was struggling to breathe. My chef said it was just muscle reflexes but man I could have sworn that shit was alive. I gutted it and cleaned it out like I had to but it was still moving a bit afterwards... Creepy shit.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It could be both. Tissue needs to be alive to have reflexes. Doesn't mean  the fish as a whole can be considered 'alive'. It takes a while for individual cells to all die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My uncle once killed a rattlesnake in his back yard (it had been going after the family dog so he cut the snake's head off with a shovel) and decided it would be rude to waste good meat. That thing was decapitated, skinned, gutted, and seasoned (meaning it had definitely been dead for more than half an hour) <em>and it kept trying to slither off the grill for a good 20 minutes after that.</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid I caught what I think was a bowfin at the lake. My father told me that it wasn't a particularly desirable fish, but it was huge and the biggest fish I'd ever caught, so I insisted we take it home. We left it in the freezer in a plastic bag for well over a day. About 30 odd hours later I grab the bag and immediately feel it moving. </p>
<p>Dumped the bag in the sink in a panic and this fish flops out and is 100% alive. I filled the sink up with water and it started swimming. Told my dad to come see cause he didn't believe it wouldnt be frozen by then, but there it was trying to swim in circles. </p>
<p>Ultimately we decided this immortal fish wasn't worth eating and the poor fella suffered enough. We went back to the lake that night and released it and it swam away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bowfins are some of the few fish that can breathe air. It's a wonder it didn't freeze but that's why it didn't suffocate.</p></div>		</li>
