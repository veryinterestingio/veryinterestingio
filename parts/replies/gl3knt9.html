			<div class="markdown"><p>The one that appeals to me the most is the 'Prime Directive' scenario, wherein there is an advanced civilization that has cracked FTL travel, but that has also decided for whatever reasons to leave 'primitive' societies alone, and may indeed shield those lesser worlds from outside signals.</p>
<p>The one that sometimes keeps me up terrified at night is the 'Dark Forest' scenario, which posits that every civilization that becomes sufficiently advanced comes to the realization that broadcasting evidence of their existence makes them targets for hyper advanced predator civilizations, which themselves are all but guaranteed to exist because of a cosmic equivalent of the natural selection principle.  That is, there will always be hyper advanced races that cannot afford to NOT destroy lesser civilizations, lest those smaller races become more advanced and destroy the other.  Thus, the only races that survive are (A) xenophobic and impossibly advanced, or (B) invisible.  In this scenario, we simply have not made ourselves a juicy enough target yet for the predators, and the rest are perpetually in hiding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't like the Dark Forest theory for one reason:</p>
<p>Why not just toss an asteroid at anything that develops life? </p>
<p>We've already realized that an atmosphere of a planet with life would be very visible. Radio waves have only been coming off our planet for a hundred-ish years, but we've had an oxygen-rich atmosphere for over 2 billion, and that's a huge sign that something strange is happening on a planet.</p>
<p>You could destroy any life-bearing planet very easily if you're already a hyper-advanced civilization. No reason to wait and deal with it when it becomes a threat, just use a minuscule amount of energy to ensure it never becomes one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple reasons as to why the Dark Forest scenario cannot exist. </p>
<p>A. For a civilization to advance to the state of FTL travel, would require massive population, coordination, cooperation, and obviously ever increasing intelligence.  The problem is that these do not exist in a vacuum. Societies need to exist with rules and laws that create a environment that nurtures and promotes technological progress. We can see that as we have progressed and became more of a civilization of city dwellers, that we have a need to become more less violent, team work focused,  accepting and ethical. By the time FTLs are created, the protocols and laws to adhere to when meeting other extraterrestrials would already have been created.  Based on our own knowledge of intelligence, we can easily deduce that ethics at the point of societal progress during the time of FTLs would be easily a society of pragmatism and proper law with moral obligations to treat other extraterresital civilizations fairly. </p>
<p>B. If simply divide civilizations of different technological ages into tiers. For example. Stone Age being Tier 1. Industrial Revolution being Tier 3, FTLs being hypothically Tier 6, a Tier 1 civilization would never catch up to a Tier 6 civilization because of technological compounding. (Steam rolling effect) progress begets more progress. Only way for a civilization to be able to close gaps much faster would be if that said civilization taught the lesser civilization their own technological progress without us needing to trial and error our way to victory. </p>
<ol>
<li>Hypothetically, back to point 1. A highly advanced society capable of FTL should possess an equally advanced law of morality that would most likely leave extraterrestrial civilizations alone to let them progress and evolve on their own, without the God like intervention of higher advanced civilizations.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is <em>when</em> this civilization existed is very crucial.</p>
<p>Even if a spacefaring civilization is long-lasting, if they happened long enough ago it would not have left any discernible remnants. There could be a civilization that took the 100,000,000 years time to do the &quot;touch every stars in the galaxy challenge&quot; and we would see nothing of their interstellar project if it happened a hundred million years ago.</p></div>		</li>
