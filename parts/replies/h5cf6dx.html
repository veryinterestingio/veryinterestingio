			<div class="markdown"><p>so i'm actually a trained opera singer :P this is something that was a regular part of my collegiate lessons-- learning how to manage my sound in unmic'd environments versus mic'd. basically, opera singers today without mics are using very similar techniques to what was used in the middle 20th century. although even in the early part of the century (and obviously before), there WAS very much this idea that &quot;louder singer = better singer.&quot; </p>
<p>i took a few workshops with soprano Sylvia McNair. I've heard recordings of her from the 80s that sound nothing like when I studied with her in 2010, even though she was already in her fully-matured adult voice on those recordings. she claimed her voice dropped a bit (very common with age--think elton john 1975 vs 2020) but otherwise she's kept mostly the same technique through her career.</p>
<p>even the recording tech in the 80s had a pretty noticeable impact on the way her voice sounded to me. i acknowledge the 30 year difference has an impact, but the sound is SO distinctly different.</p></div>		</li>
