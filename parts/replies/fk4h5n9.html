<p>If you are ready for exercise, but not exercising, then sitting around will feel easy. This feels like having more energy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anytime is a good time to start :). After a long break I started exercising again at 27. Now I’m 37 and my body is an absolute machine. There’s something obscenely gratifying being strong and fit and seeing everyone around you struggle to lift things, lose their balance and add a spare tire every year.</p>
<p>Stick with it my friend :). Fit for life! Workout for your health.</p></div>		</li>
