			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinking about what water sources “in the wild” would tend to be warm or cold, I wonder, and this is purely speculation, if the purpose was to help drive a preference for drinking running water over standing water that would be more likely to contain parasites.</p>
<p>Like your body saying “Hey, you need some water, but if you’ve got a choice, maybe opt for the water from the stream over the pond water?”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It kind of is, though. You feel thirsty because your body is telling you it needs more water. You feel “refreshed” because your body is telling you that it is happy with what you just did to solve the problem.</p>
<p>If it sends more “happy signals” in response to cold water, you’ll prefer to drink cold water in response to feeling thirsty. If drinking cold water is better for your survival than drinking warm water, then people with a preference for drinking cold water when thirsty will survive better than people with a preference for warm water.</p>
<p>So people who feel more refreshed after drinking cold water survive better and the genes that trigger that response get passed on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps it’s because when water is colder, chances are it’s colder out and we don’t need to drink as much to cool down, and while it’s warmer out, the water will be hotter and we’ll need more water to sweat, so our body delays the feeling of hydration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or possibly because drinking too much cold water too quickly would lower your core temperature more rapidly? Especially if you're already in an icy region.</p></div>		</li>

<p>UCSF researchers discovered that when  the fluid is colder, these alarms shut off faster.   They still shut  off with warmer fluids, but the colder it is, the faster they shut up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps because cold water from a running stream of a spring would be safer to drink than warm water from a puddle thats been sitting in the sun all day?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, since you would prefer cold water over warm water. </p>
<p>But humans evolved in warm climates with no streams (?), so I doubt this is it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% not a certified scientist but my guess would be that the brain tells you you're thirsty before you need it because of how long it thinks you can handle the current conditions without needing more water. I'm guessing that ambient temperature is one reason, so when your body gets a cold signal, it knows it wouldn't have to worry about cooling you through sweat anymore.</p>
<p>Again, a total guess.</p></div>		</li>
