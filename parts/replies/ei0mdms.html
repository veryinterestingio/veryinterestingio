			<div class="markdown"><p>Significant? No. The mass of a proton is 10^-27 kg. The mass of the Earth is 10^24 kg. The density of the solar wind is 10 particles/cm^3. Solar wind speed is like 400 m/s (40,000 cm/sec), so about 4 x 10^5 particles per second per square centimeter. The area of Earth facing the solar wind is roughly 10^8 square kilometers, or 10^18 square centimeters. </p>
<p>So, 4 x 10^23 protons hit Earth per second!</p>
<p>But that is such an insignificant amount of mass. Roughly 10^-4 kg per second (and that is if every. single. proton. becomes part of Earth and Earth loses no mass out of the top of its atmosphere, which isn't true).</p>
<p>So, if Earth loses literally zero mass, it will accumulate about 10 kg per day from protons. Or, the mass of Earth increases by .0000000000000000000001% per day.</p>
<p>I really just pulled these numbers out of my head, but the point stands that it's such a small fraction of Earth's mass that it's largely insignificant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for doing the calculations. Someone once proposed that animals could grow larger during the dinosaur ages because the Earth wasn't as massive then as it is now. So, I wondered if there was a substantial difference in gravity from about 100 million years ago or so. (Not that I want to take advantage of your generosity, but I've never had access to anyone who could actually figure these things out, before). Okay, so if I calculated correctly, going back 100 mya at -10Kg/yr would make the Earth roughly 400,000 tons lighter of these protons, which is about the size of a very large building. So, even for that length of time. It's insignificant.
Thanks again, for your reply.</p></div>		</li>
