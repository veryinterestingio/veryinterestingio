			<div class="markdown"><p>The temperature gradient within the earth has been essentially stable for billions of years. But it is cooling. So the answer to your question would be - all of it. The radiogenic activity just slows down the cooling process.</p>
<p>Fun fact: The sun will burn out 85 billion years before the Earth's core is estimated to <del>solidify</del> <em>cease cooling when it reaches 0 K</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That doesn't answer his question. Half the core heating comes from radioactive decay, half comes from primordial heat left over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Study Earth science, and I thought I remembered the number being a bit lower. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_internal_heat_budget#cite_note-Turcotte-2" target="_blank">wikipedia page on the internal heat budget</a> provides a source suggesting that they are roughly equal contributors in the internal heat budget. But its important to remember that most of the heat at the surface comes from solar radiation. Taken the total energy budget into account, this internal heat is about ~0.03%. Very low in comparison to solar radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that about half of the heat is left over from formation.  The rest is from radioactive decay and some gravity/friction.  I suppose it depends on whose thinking you trust, what you accept as the proportion that applies.  Not exactly a precise calculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The core is cooling slowly and the solid inner core growing into the liquid outer core as its temperature decreases. The heat isn't from mass accumulation, which would be at a rate far too low to have maintained the temperature of the 4.5Gyrs of the planet's existence, but from a mix of primordial heat from when Earth was formed and radiogenic heat from the decay of radioisotopes (estimates vary from 25-90% of heat from decay). There is also minor heating from solar and lunar tidal forces, the latent heat of crystalisation from the solidification of the outer core etc.</p>
<p>Edit: typed quickly and made a mistake in the location of radioisotopes - most are found in the mantle and crust, not in the core. As e.g.thorium and uranium are not siderophiles (elements which are readily soluble in molten iron) they were not incorporated in large amounts into the core during formation, but instead resided in the mantle. Further, these elements are 'incompatible'; they will be further partitioned into the melt phase during any partial melting of the mantle as in simple terms, they do not 'fit' well within the crystal structure of most minerals. This results in increased concentrations in Earth's crust. The total contribution to Earth's heat budget from radioactivity is still quite wide-ranging in estimates, and there is still an open question as to the exact concentration of radioisotopes in the core, even if it is small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool! Also interesting to think that geothermal energy is, in a way, directly killing the planet! (I realize it's impact is insignificant, though). I don't know enough about the makeup of the earth offhand to do the dead-reckoning, but it'd be interesting to get an idea of how many joules of thermal energy the earth possesses. I'll update this post if I get around to calculating it tonight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much what was happening with the Kola-Superdeep Borehole in Russia and they didn’t even make it to the mantle. I don’t think the crust they were drilling into fully melted, but they ran into problems with the rock effectively being a little to plastic-y to drill through. That and the temperature meant a little over 12 km was where they had to stop.</p></div>		</li>
