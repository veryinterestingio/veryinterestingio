			<div class="markdown"><p>Those scales typically have equivalent scales that look much less scary.  Like B flat major and A sharp major are the same scale.  But B flat major only has two flats so it doesn't look so bad but A sharp looks like a nightmare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I learned from my church organist: the existence of double (or even triple, I saw it) flats and sharps are to conform with the “grammar” of the music. </p>
<p>If a particular price is keyed in a Cmaj, notes will be written to be referenced off of Cmaj and compatible notes. </p>
<p>That’s my 5 year old understanding. I’m not schooled in musical theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how much explanation is too much, but I'll give it a shot:</p>
<p>All the white notes on the piano have specific letter names, &quot;A&quot; through &quot;G&quot;. If you start at the bottom of a normal piano, thats A, and if you count all the way through B, C, D, E, F, and G, then the next note will start over at A. If you play every white key from a &quot;C&quot; to the next &quot;C&quot; you'll have a C major scale. </p>
<pre><code>C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C</code></pre>
<p>To make a major scale starting with any other letter you have to use black keys. For instance, the F major scale goes like this:</p>
<pre><code>F-G-A-Bb-C-D-E-F</code></pre>
<p>Where Bb (or &quot;B flat&quot;) is the black note just to the left of the white B key. The question is &quot;Why is Bb also referred to as A#?&quot; and the answer is that we want to use each letter exactly once in every scale. In the B major scale, we use these notes:</p>
<pre><code>B-C#-D#-E-F#-G#-A#-B</code></pre>
<p>A# in this scale is the exact same note as Bb in the previous scale; we call it A# because it would be confusing to have the letter &quot;B&quot; twice in this scale. </p>
<pre><code>B-Db-Eb-Fb-Gb-Ab-Bb-B</code></pre></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. There will always be every letter (A-G) in a key. Consider F# harmonic minor (harmonic minor is a natural minor scale but the 7th in the scale is raised):</p>
<pre><code>F# G# A B C# D E# F#</code></pre>
<p>There really is no <code>E#</code> in music, it's technically just <code>F</code>, since <code>E</code> to <code>F</code> is a &quot;half-step&quot;. Same goes for <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>. However, since the last note in the scale is an <code>F#</code> we notate <code>E#</code> as such to make the scale consistent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something no one has addressed yet but is also true is that an E# and an F aren't necessarily precisely the same. On a piano, yes. Pianos have what's called &quot;equal temperament&quot; where am octave is divided into 12 equal steps. Because it's... Close enough? And in 99.999% of cases it genuinely is just close enough. On an instrument such as a violin, you have more freedom to find the tiny gaps between the notes that actually resonate better with the other chords. A violin will produce different overtones, undertones, and harmonics based on really REALLY small differences in the tuning of a note that are practically indistinguishable in isolation but noticeable when played against something else. Writing E# instead of F gives the player a clue to what else is going on around them, and helps point the ear in the direction of finding those miniscule tuning differences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pianos have not always been equal temperament.  In fact, tuning your piano this way is just the current trend, you can have it tuned to one of several systems.  Much classical music was written on pianos tuned to just temperament, which is why a composer might choose a particular key to get a particular mood to the piece - because the different keys all sounded a little different, aside from just pitch.  When you play that piece on a piano tuned to equal temperament, you lose a little of what the composer intended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to this.. imagine if you were in this key and had to play F, F#, A, and D all in the same chord. In written music, you'd have both an F and an F# in the same spot on the staff, which would be impossible to notate. By using an E# instead of an F, each note in the chord will have it's own separate spot on the music staff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes zero sense, I thought sharps/flats were in between notes on the scale. So B# is in-between B and C. If B# is the same as C then there is no point to sharps or flats in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about blues scales? Take G blues for example: G Bb, C, C#/Db, D, F, G. It's a musical catch 22!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A blues scale falls outside the category of <em>diatonic</em> scales. A diatonic scale would be a scale with every note name used exactly once.</p>
<p>Blues actually has lots of advanced music theory in it. For example, the reason the one you quoted goes from G to Bb instead of G to A# is that you often play a note somewhere between Bb and B in G blues tunes, or slide between the two, or otherwise ornament it. &quot;Bb&quot; in this context is closer to &quot;A note that is lower than, but related to, B&quot; rather than &quot;the exact pitch 100 cents below B and above A&quot;.</p>
<p>That kind of thing can't easily be described using the music theory and terms that we've established to describe most other music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert, but usually when we refer to &quot;music theory&quot; we're really saying &quot;music theory according to European dudes from a couple hundred years ago&quot;. I'm not sure if they even considered hexatonic scales like the blues scale, because that was not a sound that was in western harmony. Obviously, the passing tone between the 4th and 5th existed, but usually just as an accent and not as a featured &quot;sound&quot; of the overall harmony / melody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be a very real progression in western classical music. Typically would be a part of a chord progression like I - V7/V - V - I. The V7/V would have the sharp 4th as a &quot;leading tone&quot; to the V chord before ultimately resolving back to I.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I 100% agree with your sentiment but also I got a Music Theory minor and we spent more time in 20th century and post-tonal music than in the common practice era. I took the minor because I wanted to learn about Baroque era harmonic conventions and voice leading but ended up mostly blocking out set theory and filling out tone row matrices. So at least nowadays, theory has a really comprehensive scope.</p></div>		</li>
