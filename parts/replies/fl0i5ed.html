			<div class="markdown"><p>One bizzare form of weaponry and fighting behavior that comes to mind for me are sea anemones! Sea anemones display some serious aggression but do so in an odd way, because they move so slowly. During aggression, they scrape each other with their limbs which have nematocysts to sting and damage their opponents. During this process, they actually end up damaging themselves too! They are super interesting organisms to study the costs of conflict and weaponry. </p>
<p>Here is cool video depicting an anemone fight:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA9s3wNGaro" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA9s3wNGaro" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA9s3wNGaro</a></a></p></div>		</li>

<p>For weapons, I would say some harvestmen from the Amazon ( <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/33022918@N07/25628541607/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/33022918@N07/25628541607/" target="_blank">https://www.flickr.com/photos/33022918@N07/25628541607/</a></a> ). Males have these two giant tusks (or nipples) on their bellies which are used against to squish competitors.</p></div>		</li>
