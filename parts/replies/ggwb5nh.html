<p>This isn't necessarily true depending on what you are keeping constant. If the two objects are made out of the exact same material with the same charge and magnetic susceptibility (i.e two pieces of iron) then the force on them is proportional to their mass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's say I put 2 1kg weights in the magnetic field. If I glue them together they wouldn't suddenly have 1/2 as much force exerted on them. So shouldn't they move as fast combined as separate? If they are put near eachother but separate do they 'consume' the magnetic field and mean there is less left for eachother?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say the 2 1kg objects are each pulled by a force of 100N =&gt; a = F / m = 100N / 1kg = 100m/s2. The combined object contains also contains the magnetic particles of both 1kg objects, so the 2kg object will experience 200N. a = 200N / 2kg = 100m/s2. So same acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's kind of how gravity works (you may have seen the Veritasium video explaining Newton's third law using gravity as his example). That's not how force generally works though. The magnetic force is exerted on the object. If you glue two things together, you have a new object.</p>
<p>That line of thinking works for gravity because mass is what creates the gravitational force. Magnetic force comes from magnetic fields, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Based on what I asked, you are implying that if two objects were placed next to each other in a magnetic field, they would each have a force F exerted on them, and if you glued them together the total force on that new object would still be F (not 2F). That isn't right, but I'm not a magnetics expert so I can't explain what would happen.</p></div>		</li>
