			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently herniated a disc in my back and was just trying to understand more about it from PT's on youtube.  Came across a guy's video where he had been having back pain working construction and it was not going away.  He's in some moderate pain, but had to take a flight home for one reason or another, and fell asleep on the airplane for like 6 hours....But he fell asleep bent forward with his head on the tray table :o</p>
<p>When he woke up, he instantly had the most excrutiating pain imaginable, could not move and had fully herniated 3 discs in his back (that were probably already bulging).  Having a partial herniation of one disc pushing on the sciatic nerve I can't even imagine 3.</p>
<p>By the way if you ever are unfortunate to experience a herniated disc look up the McKenzie method...there's some good extension exercises even healthy people should be doing to keep your spine and discs in good shape- especially if you do a lot of sitting.</p></div>		</li>
