			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most specific (and correct) answer so far.
Apart from boiling the food in solvent and measuring the residue by weight, fat can also be measured by a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR. The food is first mixed to a paste and then smeared onto a piece of paper that is put on special scale that continously measures the weight while the food sample is dried by microwave radiation, which yields the water content. The sample is then placed in the NMR unit which measures how protons in fat behave in a strong magnetic field.</p>
<p>Relative fatty acid composition is determined by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector after hydrolysis of the fat and derivatization of the fatty acids  (usually methylation).</p>
<p>Fibers (both soluble and insoluble) are measured after enzymatic digestion of starch and protein, as well as specific solvent washing to remove fats and sugars. The sample is dried and its ash and protein content is measured and subtracted from its final weight.</p>
<p>The description of sugars by hplc is correct, CAD detector is common for sugars. There's multiple methods for measuring various carbohydrates. Glucose and starch can be measured by enzymatic digestion followed by photometric quantitation of the enzymatic product (NADPH). </p>
<p>As mentioned previously, carbohydrates are usually calculated by subtraction of fat-, protein-, water-, ash- and fibercontent. Energy is usually calculated from the nutrient content. </p>
<p>Also, protein can be measured by elemental analysis. The sample is combusted in oxygen and the NOx is converted to N2 by a catalyst and subsequently measured by a thermal conductivity detector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How often is testing done on natural foods? Fruit, vegetables, raw meat, etc. I read once that there's a database of natural foods, from testing that was done on them long ago, and that everyone still refers to that database.  Meaning that they haven't updated that reference in ages and so have no idea if the nutritional value of any foods have changed over time. Any truth to that?  </p>
<p>And again, I mean natural, real foods only- apples, carrots, beef maybe, beans, etc. Nothing manufactured.  (In the packaged/processed foods sense).</p></div>		</li>
