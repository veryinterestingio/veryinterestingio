			<div class="markdown"><p>Photons are most certainly a physical object. </p>
<p>I think you might be confusing ‚Äúbeing a physical object‚Äù with ‚Äúhaving mass‚Äù. Photons don‚Äôt have (rest) mass. </p>
<p>However, photons have momentum. When they are absorbed by an electron, that momentum is used to knock the electron loose.</p></div>		</li>
