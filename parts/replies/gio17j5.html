			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but what makes one group of atoms able to replicate a structure, where as another group cannot and does not do that? Why does putting 4 things which do nothing on their own, together, for example, cause this to happen? And HOW? For replication to occur I understand it must split and then grow, which must mean at an atomic level one thing is becoming another thing, and/or that somehow one thing can split onto two things. How does this work with the the conservation of energy? Iâ€™m so confused by it, even though I understand the RNA world theory it does not (and perhaps can not) answer or explain the process at the lowest level.</p></div>		</li>

<p>>at an atomic level one thing is becoming another thing, and/or that somehow one thing can split onto two things.</p>
<p>No, &quot;thingness&quot; is something we sapiens layer onto the universe from our brains.  It refers to patterens or relations of matter, but has not fundamental material referent.</p>
<p>Cut a straw in half in the right sort of way, you get 2 straws. The division of proto-cells was quite likely mechanical or thermally induced. </p>
<p>>How does this work with the the conservation of energy? </p>
<p>Pretty simple, life needs external input. Earth is not exactly closed or stable system. Day/night cycles, thermal convection, and geologic cycles all provide potential  sources to drive proto-life cycles.</p>
<p>Then proto-life simply needs to develop in way that catalyzes these gradients and in doing so becomes entropicly favored and well on it's way to actual life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But what makes 2 bricks twice the hight of 1 brick? When they're stacked on each other. If that happens, they're taller than 1 brick. If not, they're not. It's an emergent property of how they're organized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but the two bricks wonâ€™t replicate just because theyâ€™re stacked on top of each other. I donâ€™t get it ðŸ˜­</p></div>		</li>
