			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it less like two people arguing over whether to turn left or right and more like a dial that can be set to parasympathetic or sympathetic.  </p>
<p>You know when you’re in the shower, trying to get the right temperature of water, and you turn the shower dial a bit too far - and the water turns icy?  Then you turn it the other way and suddenly it’s a bit too hot?   Then back again and it’s just right?   That is what it’s like with the sympathetic/parasympathetic system in your body - controlled by your brain.   </p>
<p>Above all you want to keep something called <em>homeostasis</em> - which means <em>the same state</em>.   Basically, that is this narrow range of conditions in which a human body can survive.   Our body spends a lot of time and energy - most of it, in fact - just keeping itself within those limits.   Things like being a certain temperature, making sure all our cells are healthy and functioning, stamping out illness, keeping our fluid levels right, making sure we have enough food for the next little while.   It’s all about that balance. </p>
<p>The fight-or-flight response is like when you suddenly turn the water all the way to cold because you need to put a burn under it.  It’s an emergency, so the normal other checks and balances are overridden - for a short while.   (This is not the whole story - even here, there is a lot of interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic to keep things under control and going the way that you want them to.   You’re never without a captain in the storm.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI do not put a burn under ice cold water. It shocks the cells causing more damage. Better to be more lukewarm and then gradually lower temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always pictured it as a triggered response and not a balance. I'm prehospital so we don't them for long. That's the disconnect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a constant balancing act. These systems rely off of feedback loops so normally they will be balancing each other out until a stimulus sets one or the other off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is why things like coffee and adderall (enhancement drugs) are bad for you in the long term</p>
<p>do this, take coffee for 2-3 days then do a cleanse for 1-2 then repeat. cleansing is basically drinking lots of water excluding any heavy on the kidney foods and peeing everything or sweating everything out. rinse and repeat.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For people with anxiety disorders/hormone disorders, this is the issue, their parasympathetic nervous system doesn't know when to kick in. This can create massive problems as there is a bell curve of the effectiveness of flight or flight. Too much when you don't need it doesn't make you perform any better.</p></div>		</li>
