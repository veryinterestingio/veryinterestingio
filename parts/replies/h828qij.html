			<div class="markdown"><p>You can <a href="https://youtu.be/7J52mDjZzto" target="_blank">check out this video</a> for more on how heat pumps work and the potential benefits of using them. They’re pretty much standard practice in high efficiency homes now.</p>
<p>Edit: I strongly encourage anyone in a climate where winters go below freezing to consult the Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnership’s <a href="https://neep.org/smart-efficient-low-carbon-building-energy-solutions/air-source-heat-pumps" target="_blank">list</a> of cold-climate certified heat pumps. There are lots of systems that can handle below 0F temps now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Knew someone would mention him as soon as I read the thread question. He's been making videos about this idea for awhile. He talks about energy efficiency a lot in a way that makes it seem like common sense and explains just not what products are inefficient, but why. Plus his style is just refreshing on YouTube. He's not yelling or trying to HYPE ME UP SO I SMASH THAT MOTHERFUCKING LIKE BUTTON SO HARD THE SUN EXPLODES. Very peaceful videos with tons on information about a large variety of technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you mean, and trust me, I love heat pumps, I love the idea of moving heat from the general environment and using it. But the problem is the coefficient of performance goes right down when you need it; often around a COP of 1 in the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the model and how cold you're talking. Mitsubishi and Fujitsu have models that work well below zero, and unless you're talking a house in Zone 7 or 8 you're not going to spend that much time that cold. If you are, then absolutely an air-source heat pump isn't for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Also, cars are extremely consumer facing whereas home heating is much more related to code requirements and is a matter for housing developers, so it’s not something a regular person would hear much about unless they’re really interested. In my city, code was recently updated that requires new construction to be all electric. This doesn’t effect anyone who lives in an existing building so there’s not very much noise about it, but it is a thing that’s happening</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Policy has a lot to do with this thing and it cannot come by 'awareness' itself. Imagine a guy renting a home for his family which has pre-installed gas run heating system. Why would he care about what system is installed? Owner should care, but they installed it when they built home so de-commisioning existing working system is kinda bad for personal economics. However, if local or state policy make essential to shift to electricity in next 10-15 years, whoever is replacing their systems will go with electric automatically.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really, water should be heated from solar thermal.  Its cheap to produce but not well adopted, at least in California.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solar water heaters only really work in warm climates, but they are a good option there. </p>
<p>You can also get heat pump water heaters that pull heat from the room they're in. They're about as efficient as a normal water heater in the winter, but during the summer (or places that are always warm) they contribute to the air conditioning of the home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not actually even that cheap though.</p>
<p>For putting PV panels up, roughly 25% is panels, 10% is inverters, and 65% is the cost of design, permitting, and wiring it in.</p>
<p>In contrast to PV, which is &quot;install panels that weight 5 lb/sqft; run wire; connect to relatively small inverter box, connect to electric circuit&quot;, thermal solar is going to involve a some pretty heavy collectors (I don't have a number to quote), plumbing a circulation loop full of glycol-of-the-day (including circulation pump, expansion tank, etc), a big heavy heat exchanger tank, with enough thermal mass to store the day's hot water, a control system, if it's parabolic a sun-tracking system, etc.  I would be astonished if that didn't cost similar or more than a basic PV install.</p>
<p>Additionally, that amount of plumbing and moving parts is going to have a significantly shorter lifespan without major maintenance, compared to a fully static and solid-state PV system.</p>
<hr />
<p>And then when we consider efficiency, we can use a heat pump water heater to get a ~3x gain over electric resistive.  Combine that with a 20% PV efficiency, and you're looking at roughly 60% from sun to water.  I expect that's fairly competitive with thermal solar, once you include the various places you lose energy there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our power goes out on the regular.  We have a gas furnace, but it doesn't run without electricity.  We also lose water because we're on a well.  Basically we're lucky that we can light the stove without electricity because boiling a pot of water that we keep on the stove all winter is the only way to introduce heat when there's no power.  A battery backup might solve the furnace issue, but I doubt that an electric furnace would be much use without the power being on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there's definitely a push to electrify buildings in the energy/government sector. Some states (e.g., CA, OR, NY, CT, MA to name a few) already have programs to do this. It's not quite mainstream yet because we are still figuring out how to do it on a massive scale -- retrofitting buildings across the country will require significant investment (something that is included in the reconciliation bill in Congress, but was stripped in the bipartisan infrastructure bill).</p>
<p>If you work/follow the industry, building electrification/decarbonization is very much in scope of the climate agenda.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Building electrification is not a new thing - in the mid 50s to mid 60s, GE and other prominent manufacturers of electric appliances promoted &quot;<a href="https://dahp.wa.gov/historic-preservation/historic-buildings/historic-building-survey-and-inventory/live-better-electrically-the-gold-medallion-electric-home-campaign" target="_blank">Gold Medallion Homes</a>&quot; - all-electric homes which were granted the privilege of displaying a cool-looking medallion by the front door. Electrification at the time was a bigger deal than increasing efficiency. Of course, this was a time when nuclear power was still new, nuclear disasters were small enough to sweep under the proverbial rug, and the promise of limitless nuclear-generated electricity &quot;too cheap to meter&quot; was an ardently-sought goal.</p></div>		</li>
