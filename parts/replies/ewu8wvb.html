			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you fall in lucid dreams. Lucid usually means you have some awareness of your dream state. So do you like falling or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the weird thing with my dreams haha I just don't know why I keep dreaming about falling. Usually my lucid dreams mostly about me going on some adventurous exploration Sometimes I even dream of random things falling, like a pile of dishes or books from falling down. Guess I do like falling lol</p></div>		</li>
