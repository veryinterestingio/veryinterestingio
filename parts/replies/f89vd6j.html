			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also important to note that the capsid proteins are attached to the envelope by “matrix proteins.” If the envelope gets torn apart (easy to do), it pulls apart the capsid too. Naked viruses don’t need to worry about this.</p>
<p>Virus capsid proteins (usually just a repeating unit, but sometimes there’s more) are absolutely <strong>not</strong> bound together by covalent bonds. Viral capsids must be easy to assemble (covalent bonds require a lot of energy to make and break) and disassemble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a series of proteins called the capsid that surrounds the genetic material.  This is why soap isn't going to affect non enveloped viruses (proteins don't dissolve in fat).  Depending on the specific virus, non-enveloped viruses can also be resistant to very low/high pH, extremely high temperatures, etc.  I don't know the exact reason why this is so protective in non enveloped viruses, but I'd imagine it is due to the exceptionally strong covalent bonds present between protein molecules.  It takes a lot of energy to break one of these bonds, which is most likely why they are so resistant (my hypothesis, haven't looked into whether this is the actual mechanism).</p></div>		</li>
