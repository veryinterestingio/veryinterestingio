			<div class="markdown"><p>Yooper here and we get 300+ inches of snow in a season. The DOT uses sand here on highways the trouble is, they use <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_sand" target="_blank">stamp sand</a>. </p>
<p>In the early summer (such as it is),  the snow melts and flows into lake Superior and its tiny tributaries.. The metal concentration in stamp sand is no good for Marine fauna. </p>
<p>We also get a lot of stamp sand in our yard in the summer. This renders our soil infertile. </p>
<p>Sucks all around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recieved a degree in Environmental Science from LSSU in Sault Ste Marie. I can confirm this is a huge problem in the St. Marys river as well (connects Lake Superior to Lake Huron for non Michiganders). Several of my classmates studied through several seasons and found alarming concentrations during the melt months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear about so many things like this - your research finding hazardous concentrations of salt or stamp sand in the water for one, other research finding a new word for me -- microplastics -- being too concentrated in the ocean.  But then I never hear about follow up.  What's the follow up? Does the new knowledge just sit there, like a stone, or is something done with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know .... too bad kids swim in this stuff in shallow areas of the lake.  Now, is the entire shoreline adulterated?  I do not know.  But stamp sad does make it's way into the lake and our yards, that much I do know.  We had a water test done (from a lakeside property, not our main house) couple years back and it did come back with high concentrations of microbes and some metals, I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what Seattle uses, but on the Olympic peninsula we just use plows and sand. We don't get a lot of snow, or very often so they just try and keep the levels down on the main roads and throw sand for traction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seattle uses some sort of salt, although I dont know what kind nor if it's used on the main roads as well. I've seen it in different varieties (most obvious differences being color) but definitely not sand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They use a mixture of magnesium and calcium salts with sugars to prevent metal impact. Other places (like Michigan) just use sand, and I've seen places like Minnesota use corn steep liquor (which is natural but can smell horribly). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We should probably use sand more often here in Wisconsin. It's more effective in low low temperatures. I know there are places in town that have free sand in the winter for you to put on your driveway and walkways. Some landlords have free salt, but I think it's probably better to use the sand for the reasons laid out in this thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sand is fine out in the country but in cities/towns with public water systems it can can actually cause an issue by collecting in drains and sewer tunnels—hence its conservative use in those areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Madison, Wi they don’t use a lot of salt due to pollution of the 4 lakes that are part of the city. They finally for the first time in forever salted every street due to the rain storm and ice we recently had. The salt pollutes not only the lakes but can be a problem with wells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately sand isn’t a good option where I live since the temperature is typically close to the freezing point. If the snow and ice melt a little bit and then refreezes the sand is almost useless. Like you said, it’s better for places that experience extremely low temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, there are areas in Finland where the groundwater reservoirs are close to the surface and there'll be signs notifying drivers that due to this the salting has been reduced, i.e. drivers should exercise caution due to potentially slippery conditions.</p></div>		</li>
