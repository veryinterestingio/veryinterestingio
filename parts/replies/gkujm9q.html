			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 40+ and I'm super sad at how poor my home education was. I constantly encounter things like this.</p>
<p>I thought the season's were caused because the earth was not on a perfectly circular orbit, which caused other paradoxes in my reasoning though. (Ie: how could other planets have relatively similar temperatures when they are so much further away.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, (I think I understand it correctly) the seasons are more about how long the day is because of the tilt of our axis? (edit)ie: longer days means hotter surface temp to keep warm at night?)</p>
<p>(other planets without a tilted axis would not have seasons is that accurate?)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT 2: (I should have edited awhile ago, sorry): My assumption was inaccurate. It IS due to tilt, but not due to longer days, as I've learned from this thread. Rather, it is due to the &quot;angle of attack&quot; the of the sun's rays hitting the surface of the Earth. (it's explained very well several times further in this thread...I didn't want to mislead with this post though).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that it's not the length of the day that's as important as the intensity of the light. Summer is like pointing a flashlight straight at the ground. One small spot is getting the full intensity. Winter is like laying the flashlight sideways on the ground. The same amount of light is kind of stretched out so it isn't as intense in one spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, as I read more of the replies in this thread, it does seem like most people are indicating it's more of the intensity of the light as opposed to the length of the day. </p>
<p>Something didn't make sense about my earlier assumption but I couldn't put a finger on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the tilt means that the sun will hit the mid-latitudes more directly in summer. For example the sun will be directly overhead at midday in summer, but 30 degrees lower in the sky at midday in winter. Higher in the sky means more Watts per square metre hitting the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not with oxygen, but this is totally a thing with carbon dioxide (CO2)! It depends on which hemisphere you are in (as winter time in the Southern Hemisphere is summer time in the northern hemisphere) but there are certainly large variations in atmospheric carbon seasonally and it’s due to the lower rates of photosynthesis!
Here’s a better explanation, actually a lesson plan about seasonal flux in carbon dioxide! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The northern hemisphere also has way way more land than the southern hemisphere, so atmospheric CO2 actually does spike every year during the northern hemisphere’s winter and fall during summer.</p></div>		</li>
