			<div class="markdown"><p>Octopus intelligence is somewhat controversial and probably overrated by the general public. They're also not the only short lived intelligent animal. Small mammals and birds can be as intelligent or more yet have similarly short lifespans. Rat annual mortality is 95%, e.g.</p>
<p>I still think octopuses are cool, though. Their nervous system is very different from ours*, more distributed; each arm has it's own neural processing capacity and can move independently without input from the main brain which sends general commands like &quot;move that way&quot;. They're like hyperintelligent slugs with rending parrot-beaks. And their vision is really amazing.</p>
<p>I think squid are even more interesting because of their free-swimming lifestyle. Their evolution has converged with that of fish, ichtyosaurs, dolphins, penguins, etc. They even have a &quot;quill&quot; which is basically a primitive backbone. Cuddlefish also have this.</p>
<p>They say that if we ever find alien life it may be unrecognizably different from earth. But given the trend towards that body plan, if it has a clear ocean, it will have something that swims in it and uses bilateral vision to see it's way around.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've sometimes interacted with octopuses in my former career working in aquariums. Giant pacific octopuses absolutely humble me in my perception of intelligence. Not just in their ability to problem solve, which is far beyond nearly every other animal I've ever met, but their unbelievable ability to communicate and express what I can only call as emotion. Ruby the GPO knew and liked me. I never even fed her myself, so it wasn't a trained behavior in that regard. She &quot;talked&quot; to me with her touch, coloring, and body language. </p>
<p>If course you could say I'm assigning behavior to action, but it's not like I'm gushing about the wolf eels or jellyfish. When you can clearly communicate with a different species beyond the basic, universal signals of the animal kingdom (&quot;get the duck away, I'm not your lunch&quot;), you take far greater interest in them. And when you can have sort of &quot;conversation&quot; or intentional exchange of complex signals with them, it's hard not to see octopuses as being more intelligent than the vast majority of other animals you meet.</p>
<p>Even though we diverge from octopodes by several hundred million years and wildly different habitats and life cycles, it blows my mind that we're somehow able to converge in our ability to share meaning and feeling with one another. Octopuses are absolutely incredible.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I love octopuses, but ironically I think they get a lot of credit for smarts because humans find them easy to relate to in some ways.  I know they are the classic &quot;alien intelligence&quot;...but really, like humans and unlike almost any other animal they are very dexterous and good at opening things, and their camoflage skills are targeted at our best sense, vision.  I can open a screw top jar, and an octopus can open a screw top jar, and very few other animals can.  I can be impressed by an octopus's color matching and totally ignorant of a mammal that cleverly hides its scent.  But that's less a matter of general intelligence and more a manner of specific skillset.</p>
<p>A rat can't unscrew a jar, and perceives the world mostly through smell, sound, and taste.  And something like a snake or fish is even more foreign in how it interacts with the world.  We don't always recognize intelligent actions as easily when they come in a foreign shape.  </p>
<p>Which isn't to say that octopuses aren't smart (bearing in mind that there are <em>loads</em> of species and they all likely have different intelligence levels) but they aren't as outstandingly smart as people sometimes think.  Still outstandingly awesome though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I interacted with a baby elephant at a reserve once, she was almost 2 but still clearly a baby, running around, falling over, bashing into things and annoying the adults. Most animals at 2 years old are basically adults, or at least have the instincts of adults.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this has to do with developmental intelligence like the op of the reply was suggesting, the reason humans remain infantile for so long is because our brains take so long to develop, the same is likely true for elephants since this is also the case for many primates</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans decline way earlier than age 60 though. </p>
<p>Full sexual maturity is not signalled by onset of puberty, but is about age 18-20. Pregnancies before age 18 and after 35 are high risk, health wise, with a larger risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, one new marker being found as relating to the longevity of an animal is not its absolute size so much as the relative size of an animal's kidneys and how that determines blood phosphate levels. Animals with larger, more advanced renal systems will be better able to regulate the blood phosphate levels. Looking at relative kidney size and lifespan gives a very good correlation. The kidney is also responsible for the regulation of so much more in the body, like blood pressure for example.</p></div>		</li>
