<p>Well said.  Its an extension of &quot;the more you know, the more you know that you don't know&quot;.</p>
<p>I've struggled a bit with this in my life.  Sometimes the anxiety can be constructive.  I'll feel like I have to 'catch up' which leads me to prepare more and double-check all the details.  I'll panic and psych myself up for exams, talks and presentations.  All of this makes my work better. </p>
<p>But there is an annoying flipside.  Some hyperconfident idiot with Dunning-Kruger may shoot me down in a planning meeting and my first instinct is to go back to my desk and look for more evidence instead of standing my ground.  And I tend to have substantial periods of unemployment between jobs.  I always imagine there's flood of applicants with 'more specific skills' than me.  On more than one occasion, I've argued against my candidacy in a job interview.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a reason it's prevalent among academics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hate when they ask those “what makes you think you’ll be a good fit/what makes you better than the other candidates” questions. </p>
<p>“Well I meet the description, but if I’m being honest, it’s very likely that I’m not the best candidate. Thanks for meeting with me though, this was very stressful.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, I think they ask that question for you to expand upon your skills/worth, not to put you in a box. If you suck at one part of your job, but are great at another, THIS is the time to call attention to that fact and steer their attention towards that instead of your shortcomings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a feeling of low self-worth and the anxiety it breeds. For many people, one way around it is to get a mentor. Do you have someone (outside of family/significant others) who can point out when your beliefs about yourself aren't necessarily accurate with your talent level?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I now know we were both wrong. This happens everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Definitely not. It's not that literal. It's a feeling, and a deep anxiety that may be grounded in something society has created, or in erroneous belief patterns, or both. It happens everywhere, and it's largely rooted in feeling you have to prove your worth, that you somehow didn't earn it through hard work, skill and determination, as if you don't deserve a seat at the proverbial table. </p>
<p>Really bright, motivated young women experience it because people often associate youth and femininity with a lack of competence. </p>
<p>People of color who work in &quot;historically white&quot; industries (think banking, finance, education) experience it when they feel like they were the &quot;diversity hire.&quot; </p>
<p>People switching industries after being in a field for a long time experience it, because they feel like they might have no transferable skills or degree in that area. </p>
<p>It's definitely, definitely not just in tech or highly technical/heavy hard skills environments. It's less about a measure of skill and more about a feeling. Some people can have it even if they're the most skilled person (by far) in the room.</p></div>		</li>
