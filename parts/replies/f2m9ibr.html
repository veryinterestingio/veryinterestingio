			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really cool. I don't think I understand the relationship between the development of silver sulfide and how that indicated the stuff about orbital angular momentum. Could you help me understand please</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>After venting to release the vacuum, Gerlach removed the detector flange. But he could see no trace of the silver atom beam and handed the flange to me. With Gerlach looking over my shoulder as I peered closely at the plate, we were surprised to see gradually emerge the trace of the beamâ€¦. Finally we realized what [had happened]. I was then the equivalent of an assistant professor. My salary was too low to afford good cigars, so I smoked bad cigars. These had a lot of sulfur in them, so my breath on the plate turned the silver into silver sulfide, which is jet black, so easily visible. It was like developing a photographic film. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, the lines that were made by the silver was initially thin and possibly deposited on a silver/grey plate (&quot;flange&quot;). The lack of contrast and lightness of the line would have made it invisible. The black silver sulfide provided contrast with the flange it was deposited on, which made it visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Without the chemical reaction, the silver would have still be deposited on those lines, but you would have to take other measures to make it visible to the naked eye. For example, they could have a black background with a silver line on top or they could have run the experiment for longer so there was more silver deposited to make a denser line.</p>
<p>I was going to go for a more in-depth explanation, but I found two blog posts that try to explain. I also found the original image of the flanges.<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ArDoWzECXSo/RgjCb-CtiqI/AAAAAAAAAJU/Z2jLfPrK9hE/s400/STERN+GERLACH+2.jpg" target="_blank"> The left is with no magnetic field and the right shows the two lines.</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It didn't indicate anything about the orbital angular momentum, just that the results of the experiment could be observed when the silver was tarnished black. It aided in the observation of the results of the experiement.</p></div>		</li>
