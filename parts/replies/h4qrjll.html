			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact about this, prior to the film being made science was already aware that some, if not most dinosaurs were feathered. The decision to keep them scaly for the movie was a conscious one to keep the visuals in line with the public perception at the time.</p>
<p>It can also be explained in-universe because they were tweaking the dinosaur DNA during the cloning process anyway.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just because so many people are completely missing the nuance here, I need to clarify. What a lot of those replying to me are missing is that when I say (or when science says) dinosaurs were feathered, it's not feathered like modern birds are. They weren't covered head to toe in feathers. Almost certainly very few dinosaurs had feathers like this. But most of the dinosaurs that we find who were living just before extinction had some amount of feathers. And yes, to the few who mentioned it, the early dinosaurs were likely not feathered. Feathers evolved over the millions of years, but the later dinosaurs who lived before extinction seem to have been feathered to some degree.</p>
<p>I apologize for the confusion. The idea was for this to be a quick, fun fact. A lot of the details get left out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually fun fact, the Jurassic Park velociraptors were based more on Deinonychus! Deinonychus was t quite as big as the raptors in JP but they were definitely closer than little velociraptor. They didn’t discover Utahraptor until after JP was released!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's debatable.  It was a hypothesis, but no fossil examples had yet been found with feathers or feather-like structures.  There was always a high degree of uncertainty about the hypothesis until actual fossils turned up.  By contrast, impressions of scaly body coverings were known from multiple dinosaurs since the 19th century.</p>
<p>Scientists strongly suspected that birds and dinosaurs were closely related by at least the 1970s or 1980s (technically birds are dinosaurs if following modern classification, Ostrom in the 1970s strongly making the case), but that's not enough to tell when exactly a feathery body coverings evolved.</p>
<p>It was generally agreed it was <em>possible</em> feathers were more widespread than merely birds, if not likely because they seemed to be a prerequisite to flight, and some artists started depicting some dinosaurs with feathers, particularly theropod dinosaurs.  That was bold, given the lack of direct fossil evidence.</p>
<p>The Jurassic Park movie came out in 1993, and the book was published in 1990.</p>
<p>The first reasonably convincing feather-like fossil evidence found on dinosaurs was <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinosauropteryx" target="_blank">Sinosauropteryx</a></em>, which was described in 1996.</p>
<p>People debated whether the structures on the surface of <em>Sinosauropteryx</em> had anything to do with feathers because the structures are &quot;hair-like&quot; filaments rather than unambiguous feathers.  People supportive of the connection to feathers called them &quot;protofeathers&quot;, but there was plenty of skepticism.</p>
<p>It wasn't until finds later in the 1990s, such as <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudipteryx" target="_blank">Caudipteryx</a></em> (1998) that unambiguous feathers were found (e.g., with a shaft (rachis) and branches (barbs) coming off it).  Since then, there are dozens of other examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Archaeopteryx was discovered in what, the 1860's? Though I don't know if the earliest fossils found included feathers, I know several of the later ones did.</p>
<p>I remember seeing one with feathers in at the Smithsonian in the early 90s. Even my elementary school eyes could clearly see the feathers on it. It actually blew my mind since the popular thought at the time was dinosaur=reptiles with scales. Definitely remember it... 30... plus... years later...Fuck I'm old.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, I didn't go into detail in my comment, but most evidence of feathers on dinosaurs are these protofeathers. Very few dinosaurs would have walked around looking like peacocks, if any. I've been doing my best to clear that up, but I got <em>so</em> many replies to my comment...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I try to read it every year. It's one of the few books that ends in the most boring yet incredible ways. Spoilers!!!</p>
<p>The way that book just kind of ends is haunting. There was nothing they could have done. They never found a cure, they never found out how it works, hell the had just barely discovered the reason the old man and the baby both survived when the threat just stopped being a threat on its own. And nothing was learned. It was here, killed a fuck load of people, and strolled away like it owned the place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: in fact, this is a major theme in Michael Crichton's writing, seen in this original book and others - we can't always predict accurately or know with certainty what is going to happen in response to our actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sort of, I'd say his writing themes are more like Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.  Ian Malcolm's role in the book is to use mathematics (chaos theory) to predict that something WOULD go wrong, except none of the people who ran the park chose to listen to him.</p></div>		</li>
