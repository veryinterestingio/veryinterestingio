			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, but if the inclination  is about 90 degrees, won't the star &quot;wobble&quot; because of the planetary pull? Or is that wobble too small to measure?<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the star always wobbles, and when the orbital axis aligns correctly the wobble is parallel to our line of sight and the Doppler shift can be used to deduce the presence of exoplanets.  It's called the radial velocity method and is common alongside the transiting method as a means of detection.</p>
<p>To &quot;notice&quot; the wobble depends on the resolution of your spectrograph and a lower limit on the velocity is set.  The ELT is planned to drastically improve this limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radial direction of such a wobble is the easiest component to measure, and it needs an inclination that is not too close to 90 degrees. That means the radial velocity method is biased towards low inclinations as well.</p>
<p>It's possible to measure the wobble in tangential directions, Gaia is expected to find many planets that way, but it's much more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question for you as an expert, if you don't mind? Primordial gas clouds from which stars in the Milky Way formed gave their angular momentum to their daughter stars and planetary systems.</p>
<p>Naively, I'd expect that as the Milky Way has angular momentum, the primordial clouds would have some correlation of their angular momentum direction with that of the galaxy as a whole, on average (as they are subclouds of the overall huge cloud from which the Milky Way as a whole formed)?</p>
<p>Is that idea completely bonkers, or is it correct but the resulting average correlation is too small to detect?</p></div>		</li>
