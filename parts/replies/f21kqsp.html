			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. Definitely not used to quantum physics/chemistry though haha
It wasn’t easy to understand either since I study in french and ask questions in english somehow but you guys have different ways of explaining it and I get to figure the idea better. Anyways thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often wondered if people doing theoretical physics with concepts like this actually have any kind of intuitive understanding of any part of it, or if it is purely thought of in terms of formulas and/or computation. Is it even possible to have an intuitive understanding of it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or you had a good teacher.  If they spend all their time telling you about how unintuitive it is, you'll believe them.  On the other hand, there are multiple reasonable coherent pictures of QM that have workable intuition.  (So-called &quot;Many minds&quot;, for instance.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene is an excellent read for laymen (like myself).</p>
<p>It gives you the foundation from Newtonian physics, through Special Relativity, and then moves on to the weirdness of Planck's scale, quantum probability, and superstring/M theory, giving great analogies to get a grasp of quantum absurdity and make the classical rules concrete in your mind.</p>
<p>It is a great read and you may view the world (and the universe) in a new light - pun not intended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also like to chip in with a recommendation of Carlo Rovelli's Reality Is Not What It Seems. Sounds very similar to the Elegant Universe in that it gives you all the foundations in easily understandable chunks before carefully laying the weirder bits on top. Coupled with the fact that it's beautifully and passionately written, I give it a perfect 7/10.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term I'd use is probability wave. If my understanding is correct, the &quot;wave&quot; represents an area where the particle could be anywhere within. </p>
<p>But it's not like throwing a marble into a dark closet, where you know the marble is a single place in there but not where. With quantum mechanics, the &quot;marble&quot; is <em>everywhere</em> in the closet until you look, then it &quot;collapses&quot; into a single spot somewhere inside. That everywhere-at-once state is called &quot;superposition&quot; and it's the basic principle behind the famous Schrodinger's Cat thought experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mind you, the thought experiment was a famous attempt at proving that superposition should have been bunk; either the cat is dead or not, it can't be both. It's funny when attempts at mocking an idea get co-opted into the idea itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s my understanding, mostly based off of Sean Carrol, that particles simply don’t exist as we imagine them: as little round pellets of microscopic matter. They are, indeed, the field itself. The field has a value at every point in space, and the electron is most likely to be observed (amplitude squared) where the energy level is highest. Everything is an excitation of its field, aka a wave. </p>
<p>I don’t know if this is helpful, but I like to imagine the classic trampoline stretching out really far. From underneath, something very tall and skinny is poking up, and the trampoline has a spike in it: a very tall skinny wave. That wave IS the particle, in this case, the electron. The particle isn’t attached to the wave, the particle is what we see when the amplitude of the wave (the spike) is very high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this true? That every fundamental particle type is just a field with different probability densities at different points? Because TBH I've had the same thought before, and that seems TOO simple for quantum mechanics. Like, it's got to be missing something, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The quantum part comes from the fields not being simply a single number like the height of a sheet, but a function that tells you how likely each shape of the sheet is to be observed when another system interacts with it. Each particle type is its own sheet and they can push/pull on each other which makes particles emit and absorb other types of particles. And the probability of the sheets being a given shape in one region can be highly correlated with the probabilities for another region (entanglement). </p>
<p>So yeah, it's more complicated, but the simple cases do look mostly like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read “Something deeply hidden” by Sean Carrol and listen to his podcast/interviews.  He’s a better QM popularizer than anyone out there right now (all handful of them). He admits he puts forward one interpretation of QM, namely The Many Worlds Interpretation, but he acknowledges the others and argues them in good faith.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer I can give you is to abandon the idea of the wave function collapsing. It doesn’t know we’ve looked. The trouble is admitting that what we observe isn’t really what’s there (google the measurement problem). When we observe a field/wave, it looooks like what we conceive of as a particle, but what it really is is the (usually high) amplitude of the wave. </p>
<p>Also, I’m not a physicist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interaction of the measurement/detector breaks the particle-wave into pieces that are a similar size to the measurement device, like it's being cut into bite sized chunks. The detector itself has to split into several versions that each &quot;eat&quot; one of the chunks (and knows which one it ate). In this way the state of the particle and the detector are &quot;entangled&quot;.</p>
<p>We end up only seeing one of the chunks and the one version of the detector that ate it (more conventionally &quot;observed that outcome&quot;), and there are competing answers to why this happens, called interpretations of quantum mechanics.</p></div>		</li>
