			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn’t get through the series either. Despite their claims, private zoos like Joe Exotic’s do absolutely nothing good for tigers. They are not contributing to conserving tigers in any way. They perpetuate an endless cycle of breeding so that people can cuddle cubs, which produces surplus tigers that are expensive to keep. There is no doubt that some of these are illegally killed and traded for their skins and body parts, helping to fuel demand for dead tigers, whether wild or captive bred. A bill before congress, the Big Cat Safety Act, would address some of the worst aspects of private ownership of big cats in the US, and is worth supporting! Call your elected congressperson if youre in the US.</p>
<p>R29 has a good article explaining it:</p>

<p>Well, they keep alive more tigers than exist in the wild.</p>
<p>How does that not count? The tigers are in bad conditions, but that qualifier was not in your statement, and you included the absolute 'any', which shows it wasn't implicit.</p></div>		</li>
