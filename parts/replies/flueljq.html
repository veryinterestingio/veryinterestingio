			<div class="markdown"><p>So if a person with 20/20 vision is looking at an object in VR that's 10 feet away, while the screens are 1 inch away, why doesn't their view get blurry?  Won't their eyes be focusing incorrectly for where the light is actually coming from?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good question! The way we perceive depth is actually our brains combining data from our eyes. Due to the eyes being slightly apart (about 2.5&quot; for adults) each eye gets a slightly different view. Here's an easy way to try this at home: Hold out your thumb in a 'thumbs up' a foot to eighteen inches from your face. Look at it with your right eye open and your left eye closed, then switch to your left eye open and your right eye closed. One eye will see more of the nail side, and one will see more of the fingerprint side. This difference in the two eye views is combined in our brain to 'perceive' depth!</p>
<p>When your eye is focusing on an object in VR, the depth is created from the amount of change from the left eye to the right eye. Big change = close object, little change = far object. So each eye is pointed in a certain direction and lens/iris position to create both the convergance and the focus. </p>
<p>...Actually, I'm kinda in the weeds on this one. Dr. u/hotpoopchunks, do you have anything to add?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Turns out I had my concepts backwards! You are correct - the eye is <em>focused</em> on the screen at all times, while the <em>convergence</em> changes with virtual distance. Because focus is created with both the flexing of the lens and the convergence of the eyes, if you can't see in the distance outside of VR, you can't see it in VR either. Thank you for giving me a chance to clarify!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno about others, but I can override my eyes focus and convergence at will, so I don't think it's too much for the brain to do it automatically when a VR headset causes convergence and focus to not match. At least with a bit of practice.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it's the same on a 3DS console. Your eyes focus on the screen, but the convergence is usually past the screen, or sometimes closer.</p></div>		</li>
