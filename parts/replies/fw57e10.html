			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and the fact that we were able to detect the waves given that it's so far away, meant that it had to have been extremely large to start with, so for the visual representation, it would have been &quot;loudest&quot; at its origin</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are those recordings in realtime, like not sped to make them work as sound waves? As in, is that little bweep! at the end is two of the most massive things in the universe orbiting each other ridiculously fast due to the immense gravity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The graphs' x-axes are labelled in seconds, from 0.5 to 1. Considering the whole sound lasts for around half a second by the feeling of it, I'd say this is real time. Black holes 'bweep' together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn’t entirely sure what the time axis referred to since the video didn’t really include context, so: wow. Just wow. I would have thought it would have been a much slower collision with minutes-long orbits until their event horizons overlap or something. That little bweep is a stark reminder of how much freaking energy the system is dealing with.</p></div>		</li>
