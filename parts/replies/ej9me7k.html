			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it could be. Our observations indicate that there's far more energy than we can see that's making the universe expand. That expansion could just be part of how space itself works, but until we understand the source, we're naming the observed phenomenon Dark Energy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a good point to bring up the fact that regular old atoms only account for less than 5% of the universe. The rest we are clueless about, but it takes up the other 95%. But we mainly assigned some of the values just so the math would work out and some experimentation points to that maybe being right, we just don't know enough yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_matter.html" target="_blank">nasa has a nice little page</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>WMAP determined that the universe is flat, from which it follows that the mean energy density in the universe is equal to the critical density (within a 0.5% margin of error). This is equivalent to a mass density of 9.9 x 10-30 g/cm3, which is equivalent to only 5.9 protons per cubic meter. Of this total density, we now (as of January 2013) know the breakdown to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>4.6% Atoms. More than 95% of the energy density in the universe is in a form that has never been directly detected in the laboratory! The actual density of atoms is equivalent to roughly 1 proton per 4 cubic meters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>24% Cold Dark Matter. Dark matter is likely to be composed of one or more species of sub-atomic particles that interact very weakly with ordinary matter. Particle physicists have many plausible candidates for the dark matter, and new particle accelerator experiments are likely to bring new insight in the coming years.</p>
</li>
<li>71.4% Dark Energy. The first observational hints of dark energy in the universe date back to the 1980's when astronomers were trying to understand how clusters of galaxies were formed. Their attempts to explain the observed distribution of galaxies were improved if dark energy were present, but the evidence was highly uncertain. In the 1990's, observations of supernova were used to trace the expansion history of the universe (over relatively recent times) and the big surprise was that the expansion appeared to be speeding up, rather than slowing down! There was some concern that the supernova data were being misinterpreted, but the result has held up to this day. In 2003, the first WMAP results came out indicating that the universe was flat (see above) and that the dark matter made up only 24% of the density required to produce a flat universe. If 71.4% of the energy density in the universe is in the form of dark energy, which has a gravitationally repulsive effect, it is just the right amount to explain both the flatness of the universe and the observed accelerated expansion. Thus dark energy explains many cosmological observations at once.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fast moving neutrinos do not play a major role in the evolution of structure in the universe. They would have prevented the early clumping of gas in the universe, delaying the emergence of the first stars, in conflict with the WMAP data. However, with 5 years of data, WMAP is able to see evidence that a sea of cosmic neutrinos do exist in numbers that are expected from other lines of reasoning. This is the first time that such evidence has come from the cosmic microwave background.</p>

<p>Science really isn't made to answer that kind of &quot;why&quot; question. Physics is supposed to model the universe based on our observations, not to explain what the universe &quot;really&quot; is. If that's not satisfying, then that's just science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(Accelerated) Expansion is a gravitational effect. It's something you get out of Einstein's theory of general relativity (out of the Einstein field equation) if you feed it the right type of substance (dark energy). That theory will give you a field g (the metric) that encodes the geometry of spacetime, and expansion describes a particular behaviour of that metric (just like the gravitational field around a black hole or a planet is a particular functional shape of that metric).</p>
<p>It can in so far be seen as an intrinsic property of the universe in that &quot;vacuum energy&quot; in quantum field theory (ie the energy in the ground state of quantum fields) behaves like dark energy (which leads us to the cosmological constant problem: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant_problem" target="_blank">&quot;the cosmological constant problem or vacuum catastrophe is the disagreement between the observed values of vacuum energy density (the small value of the cosmological constant) and theoretical large value of zero-point energy suggested by quantum field theory.&quot;</a>). So that gives a natural candidate to be considered for dark energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark matter can and has been studied in more detail than dark energy. For example, farm matter isn’t uniform, but can be studied via the effect (gravity) it has on its surroundings. Another name for dark matter would be invisible matter, since  it doesn’t interact at all with electromagnetism and can pass through visible matter without interacting at all (or extremely little)</p></div>		</li>
