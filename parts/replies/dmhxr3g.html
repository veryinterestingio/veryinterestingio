			<div class="markdown"><p>i'd say even then tumble drying will be softer as the fabric fibres are massaged while drying, and won't stick together.. kinda like how wet pieces of paper stick together if they dry while touching.. water allows the little hairs on the fibres to tangle and hold like velcro, whereas agitation while drying breaks these holds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would strictly air dried clothes potentially last longer than dryer dried? I'm assumiung air drying is less tough on the garment and it will probably retain its shape and quality longer right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dryers obviously wear out clothes - they flex and rub the fabric just as you do when you wear them, but for a short period of time and with more intensity. If you mix fabrics it will be harder on softer clothes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Y'know that lint in the drier? That's literally the result of your clothes being mechanically worn away by the action of the drier. Add to that the fact that getting cotton hot and very dry causes it to break more easily, then yes air dried clothes will absolutely outlive machine-dried clothes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why you should always air dry things like sweaters, bras, anything with lace, and delicate fabrics. It makes them last much longer and they don't lose their shape. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, forgot to add this. Dryers on a campus I lived always had a lot of lint in that collector thing, because a lot of people used them, so it was more noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure. I moved from a country where line drying is standard to one where houses don't tend to have clothes lines and everyone uses dryers (partly because it's too cold to dry outside for a good chunk of the year). Clothes definitely don't last as long here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something that you should look into a little more closely. I think most people don't dry when it is cold because they don't want to go out in the cold. If the air is dry it will indeed dry your closes in the daytime. I have seen clothes drying in the winter where I grew up when more people hung their clothes on the line outside. I lived outside of boston and in the summer when the humidity was high I always had to finish drying in the dryer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in an area that doesn't have particularly hard water, and while I'd never call line-dried clothes crunchy in the same way that a muddy pair of jeans dries crunchy(as in, you bend them and they make audible crunchy noises), I would certainly call them stiff. They don't crunch, and they won't stand up if you prop them against a wall, but the fabric isn't fully flexible as it was at the store. If that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never understood why people claim line drying is better than tumble drying. I suppose if they are used to soft water it makes sense. In my hard water area tumble dried clothes are so much nicer.</p></div>		</li>
