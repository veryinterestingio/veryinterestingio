			<div class="markdown"><p>But I get that feeling even if I’m not actually in any danger lol. For example if I’m in an extra quiet space, I guess my body gets nervous even though I know there’s no  danger . And for some reason that place is always World market - even though it’s just a retail store, something about the quietness of it makes me have to go find the bathroom everytime when my stomach starts to feel butterflies lol so strange </p></div>		</li>
