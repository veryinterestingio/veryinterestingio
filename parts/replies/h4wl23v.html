			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation! I was evaluated by a physical therapist at age 40 for something unrelated, but that person noticed something else: my lower back was rounded too much. &quot;If you don't have back problems, you will soon.&quot;</p>
<p>For me, it was a combination of sitting and something else. When I was ~18, someone made an off-hand remark about how I slouched too much. I took it upon myself to &quot;fix&quot; my posture, but overtrained myself in the process. For years, I was overcompensating for this and complicating it with my sit-down job.</p>
<p>I followed the advice he gave me and soon realized that I had already started to have some back problems but hadn't really noticed much yet.</p>
<p>I'm still working to retrain myself years later, but I think I'm on the right path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello what are some good exercises to lessen/prevent lordosis. </p>
<p>I usually sit a lot so I've got a bit of an arched back. Now I'm at work I stand and walk around for 8 hours every day, which is good exercise but I worry about that improper back posture can do. Im 23 male.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's almost impossible to give specific advice without seeing someone. </p>
<p>The best thing to do as a preventive measure is to take care of your assmuscles. The purpose of those is to not only move you legs but to also help your pelvis to stay upright. (They also support the hip joints but that gets a bit deep for now). Stretch them, squeeze them together, whatever, just keep them active. </p>
<p>But a little worry is healthy, means that you care. Usually people like you get away with less problems because you're prone to do something about it if the pain comes up :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some ideas would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>stretch your hip flexors. Kit Laughlin is a stretching guru with great videos on this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen your glutes: lunges, deadlifts, squats </p>
</li>
<li>strengthen your abs, particularly with plank-type moves (face up / down / left / right)</li>
</ul>
<p>-strengthen your upper back, particularly with row-type moves</p></div>		</li>
