			<div class="markdown"><p>would like to ask a question based on your first part.</p>
<p>If I were to have purchased a new laptop in 2010, but never turned it on, would it boot up exactly as fast for the first time a decade later - in 2020 - as it would have in 2010?</p></div>		</li>

<p>And SSD rot might have set in - though I'm not sure how accurate those studies are on SSD powered-down reliability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can chime in on this one.  I had to do a house call for an attorney's bedroom workstation that had no internet access.  First thing I did was reboot the machine as it had been left in suspend mode and I woke it up.  I see it's running Windows XP but with some old  banner I know I had seen before, just not in a long time.  I am rather impressed by the quick reboot.  I go into the system applet and my jaw drops when I see that it was just Windows XP, with no service pack, and the machine only has 2 gigs of RAM.  I can't remember what version of Office it had, but it basically was only used with a flash drive.  I was there to repair Microsoft Office, I can't even remember what version.  I ended up just uninstalling and reinstalling Office and THAT flew too.  Remember, Windows XP was later packed to OEMs with SP3 installed.  I don't think the original XP version had many of the security features we grew accustomed to later.  I knew there was overhead but that machine on 2 gigs was extremely responsive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming no physical issues due to various factors, yes. It would be equally as fast. The issue is that it will feel slow relative to 2020 computers because our technology will have changed dramatically. For example, a $350 SSD now would've cost closer to $6000 in 2010, and SSDs are a major technological improvement that make our modern computers so fast.</p>
<p>Moore's law is pretty common and states that the speed of computers doubles every 1-2 years (although this is very general and not precise). A 2020 computer would be about 64 times faster than a 2010 computer by this metric. However, software also grows exponentially at the same rate- with strong computers come heavy programs. So computers are improving, but in terms of a normal user, the computer will be limited by the speed of the human, so we use the rest of the speed the enhance security and other features.</p>
<p>When the new software starts running on old hardware, that's when we have issues, and computers 'slow down'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the same case for phones too. As older phones get updated with new OS versions and apps, the newer software is more bloated and eats up more resources, and the older phone basically has to work harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is top voted but isn't the complete answer.</p>
<p>Mechanical drives wear and do become slower over time. Your CPU wants to run at a certain speed, and will do so as long as your cooling components adequately dissipate the heat from it, but over time the paste that conducts the heat from your CPU to your heatsink becomes dry and less effective at conducting heat, and the fan on your heatsink can become clogged with dirt and move less air as a result.  So no, a computer that has been used will not over time be exactly as fast as it was out of the box when it was new, even if it was never connected to the internet.</p>
<p>This doesn't even need to be an extreme use case. Normal wear and tear is absolutely enough to cause this. Even not using a computer for a long time can still cause the thermal paste to dry into an insulative clay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about completely solid state devices like phones/tablets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid state drives (like in desktops) and FLASH memory (like in your phone) are actually not the same thing. They don't degrade in the same way... They just sort of die when they're at the end of their life.</p>
<p>See the reason mechanical hard drives get slow is the spinning disk has sectors (literal sections) on the platter that it can magnetically set to be a 1 or a 0. Over time, sectors begin to lose their magnetism, but the drive can correct for that. When the drive sees that a sector is bad, it just marks it as no good and moves on with it's life.</p>
<p>Eventually so many sectors are marked bad that it's like trying to write a novel on Swiss cheese, or read one off of it. The number of bad sectors doesn't have to be enough to significantly reduce the amount of storage available to you on the drive in order to substantially hinder it's performance.  This is of course much more prevalent on older drives than newer drives.</p>
<p>The wear on solid state storage is much more predictable and works in a totally different way.  To be honest I don't want to type it all out on mobile, but if it interests you, there are plenty of articles on it or maybe someone else will chime in.  Long story short, it's less of an issue until the whole drive dies, and the type of workload done on phones and tablets makes that sort of failure extremely rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an issue. The &quot;problem&quot; with SSDs is that they have finite read/write cycles. For example, before TRIM was implemented, people were seeing SSD failures because they were using Defrag on their systems. That accelerates the wear on the drive because it creates unnecessary read/writes on the drive. SSDs are constantly getting better and their failure rates are almost non-existent these days.</p>
<p>This is anecdotal, but I've been running various types of SSDs since they came out. The only failures I've had have been in HP 840G1/G2 laptops. Other than that, they have been rock solid. Samsung drives are great, and paired with Samsung Magician and their RAPID technology, they are insanely fast! NVMe x4 drives are by far my new favorite though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is true, this isn't what 90% of people experience. You can take an old Windows machine, nuke the hard drive and do a fresh reinstall, and the thing will run like a top. One of Windows' many weaknesses is that way programs and program configuration is stored, By far, by leaps and bounds, Windows' worst feature is the registry. Over time the registry gets bloated with shrapnel and remnants of forgotten programs, installed and deleted, or of older versions of programs, and the programs you use currently get bogged down plowing through that stuff. It's an absolute rolling dumpster fire that should have been removed from the OS at least a decade ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This just isn't true. The maximum size of the registry is 102 megabytes. There is zero evidence that errant registry keys cause any measurable performance impact.</p>
<p>Sounds like you're living in early 2010, along with all the other snake oil promoters of &quot;registry cleaners&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
