			<div class="markdown"><p>Being a man, i can confirm there is something called &quot;terminal beard length&quot;. Just like stated above, every hear folicle reaches its maximum grow time before breaking off. My beard grew really well and fast, but reaching something like 10-12cm/4-5in, it just seemed to stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make sure you're oiling and taking care of your beard! The reason the lower hairs might be growing faster is because they're less prone to be touched, twisted and dried out. The hairs around your chin tend to dry out faster, especially if you smoke, and tend to break off of not taken proper care of!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it happens with my hair. I have waist length hair that hasn't grown any longer than it's current length for about 10 years. I get it cut occasionally but there's really no need to since I dont get split ends (because my hair isnt growing and I take good care of it)  even when it gets cut it just grows back to the same length and stops again.</p></div>		</li>
