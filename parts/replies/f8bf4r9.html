			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as some experts have put it, &quot;Faking the moon landing as accurately as they did, would have been so difficult it would have been easier to just fly to the moon and shoot on location.&quot; A number of effects that we see were literally impossible to create at the time. </p>
<p>As for the tech itself, it's worth remembering what sort of stuff was going on during the cold war. The F117 stealth fighter was already in service, along side the F-111, the U2 was flying along side the blackbird.</p>
<p>Hell, the blackbird itself is still in some respects, the most advanced piece of tech to ever be declassified, and it was in service in the 60's.</p>
<p>I'm not saying Aliens landed at Roswell, but the capability of human engineering is often beyond our imaginations.</p>
<p>People still aren't 100% sure how they built the pyramids and many argue we simply couldn't do it today in the same time frame. But not because we don't know how, but because getting 10,000 laborers on site for 16hrs a day, and finding 1000+ skilled stone masons ro carve just wouldn't be feasible. </p>
<p>So it's worth remembering, that in the post WW2 era, we had a massive surplus of brilliant scientists who had spent their whole careers dedicated to aircraft, rockets, and various other techs that culminated into these projects.</p></div>		</li>
