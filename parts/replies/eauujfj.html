			<div class="markdown"><p>As many responses pointed out already, when you hear people say a virus or bacteria is “smart,” it’s meant more in an anthropomorphic way. A virus has no brain and obviously can’t think or make conscious choices. </p>
<p>However, like every other living* thing, viruses and bacteria are killed off or survive based on traits that they possess to maximize their ability to survive. The ones that survive continue to reproduce and are better adapted to infect new hosts and continue the propagation of their species. This is natural selection in its most basic form. </p>
<p>*I use the term “living” very loosely here for the sake of simplicity because viruses are not actually “alive” in the strictest definition in term of biology. This classification is constantly changing and under debate within microbiology/virology because of the way viruses carry out their functions and life cycle. But that’s a separate topic. </p></div>		</li>
