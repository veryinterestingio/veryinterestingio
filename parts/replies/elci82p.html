			<div class="markdown"><p>Any question involving language, politics, or religion will be full of arguments and half-informed answers from non-experts. My half-informed, partially-non-expert opinion (I did study linguistics) is that it's because they're too big a part of how we see our personal identities for most people to either keep quiet if they don't know what they're talking about or for them not to spark arguments, which is how controversy breeds. And now to wait for someone to disagree with me lol</p></div>		</li>
