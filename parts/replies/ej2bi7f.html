			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this: motion sickness happens because the movement you're seeing doesn't match the movement you're feeling (like in a car - you're moving forward but sitting still) and your brain thinks &quot;I've been poisoned!&quot; Then it makes you puke to get the poison out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats essentially it, just adding a bit to that: Within the inner ear canals you have a viscous fluid and very small but sensitive hairs, when you move your head, the fluid moves around the canals which causes the small hairs to move and in turn the ear thinks your entire body must be moving in that direction (this is the mechanism behind the reason why humans can still look directly ahead even when our heads are rotating). Some people have very low tolerances to this ‘artificial’ movement sensation which causes them to feel off balance and nauseous. This is similar for drunk people experiencing that the world is swimming. Alcohol lowers the viscosity of the fluid within the inner ear which means that the fluid can move and flow much easier after consuming alcohol. In turn, this decrease in fluid resistance means that any movement will have a greater than usual sensitivity response from the tiny hairs that detect fluid movement. If thats hard to picture then imagine that your trying to shake a jar of maple syrup (high viscosity) and now compare that to shaking a jar of water (low viscosity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wow, I had no idea that alcohol affects the liquid and it is a cause of balance issues when intoxicated. I thought it’s just a general mess it does with our neurotransmitters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pressure point “neiguen” (p-6) works pretty well for preventing me from getting more nauseous than I already am. I use it a lot when I start feeling car sick and it usually prevents me from having to vomit if I catch it early enough. It’s in the middle of your wrist, between the two main tendons- a quick google will show you exactly where. I’ve told a lot of people about it, and about 75% of people I’ve told seem to be able to get it to work for them. Moving my eyes to follow the road like I’m driving the vechile also helps (I don’t get motion sickness if I’m driving).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing happens with me and vertigo. I'm sitting still, but the room looks like it's spinning so my body stupidly thinks I've been poisoned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually that's more because there is a connecting between the receptors that trigger the feeling of nausea and the receptors in your ear that register vertigo. So in that case your body doesn't think you are poisoned. But the same things telling your body it's spinning when its not are triggering your nausea in a separate system. It's a case of overlap. This is also why Zofran can be used to treat vertigo. </p></div>		</li>

Turns out it was my gallbladder being funky the whole time and now my sides hurt from the gas build up and my abdomen hurts pretty bad. Not a fun experience </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a variety of (relatively mild) GI issues and I often experience nausea that is actually hunger. I've learned to identify it as opposed to nausea from other causes, but it still happens. Took awhile to learn how to force myself to eat in those situations, when that's the last thing I want to do - but then I instantly feel better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk how accurate this is but I also heard that sympathetic nausea (vomiting bc you saw others vomit) was beneficial to prehistoric humans. Since the community's food all came from one source, if one person ate bad/poisoned food that means everyone probably ate it and will need to vomit too.</p></div>		</li>
