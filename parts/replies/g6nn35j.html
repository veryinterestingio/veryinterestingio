			<div class="markdown"><p>But here’s the mind blower: so were we. Humans who liked dogs had protection and hunting buddies, which would have given them a reproductive advantage. Over a long enough time, that means dog lovers had more kids than their awful non-dog-loving neighbors did, implying that we’ve evolved to love dogs.</p>
<p>We didn’t just domesticate dogs. They, in turn, domesticated us. We evolved <em>with</em> them in a case of mutualism. We didn’t change as much as they did, obviously, but I’d stake money that modern humans would react much more favorably to a given dog than our deep ancestors would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably, but that's not the same as being domesticated. On the other hand there's the process of self-domestication, which is irrelevant but did occur with humanity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Every year in my state, fish and game have to put down bears because humans thought it would be a great idea to feed them, and every single time, a bunch of people scream and cry about it that they could just put the bear somewhere else, they don't have to kill it.  I get it, bears are cute when it's not your chickens they're going to eat, your shit they're going to break, your home they will break into.  Once they associate people with food, they're going to be a safety hazard no matter which patch of woods you put them in.  All of this could be prevented by people not feeding bears, but nope.  They're cute!  Ugh.  Poor bears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does one feed a bear? I know a lot of bears are actually timid, but one would have to be some kind of special to try hand feeding one. And throwing food at a bear seems like a bad idea since you'd be throwing something at a bear and that just seems like a way to have an angry bear.</p>
<p>I guess you could leave food out for a bear. But I thought the big problem was that people left food out accidentally (or not even left out, just didn't bear proof it).</p>
<p>It's kind of a shame for bears, they sort of suffer from being too smart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more the second paragraph of your comment.  They leave food out for the bears or don't secure food/garbage that is not necessarily meant for bears.  In the spring when the bears wake up from hibernation, they're really hungry so they go for whatever is most convenient.  People are warned to put their bird feeders away during this time, but they don't.  Some will deliberately leave more seed out for the bears.</p>
<p>Also we have black bears so they're not really the angry type, they are more likely to run away if they see a human, not attack.  But when they get more comfortable with humans by associating human activity with food, that's when they're more likely to attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the freaking deer. I live near a state park that a U.S. route runs through. I used to drive through it frequently to get home and without fail about once a week Spring to Fall there would be some car with &quot;not from around here&quot; plates stopped in the middle of the road throwing potato chips or sunflower seeds at a group of deer eating in one of the grass medians.</p>
<p>This made the deer associate cars with food, and you were taking your life in your hands to drive through there when they were active.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Babies generally have large heads and large eyes in relation to their body size. We're programmed to find these characteristics cute so that we'll love our offspring, ensuring the survival of the species. </p>
<p>It just so happens that most breeds also have offspring with large heads and eyes too, therefore we, almost accidentally, find their young cute as well.  </p>
<p>This is probably the reason that I think baby snakes are cute and would want to pet them, yet I think most adult snakes scary and I would not want to pet them.</p></div>		</li>
