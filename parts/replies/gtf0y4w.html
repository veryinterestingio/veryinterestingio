			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. If you hit the stomach or the sphincter between your stomach and the intestines, you will fill up the stomach cavity. Once this happens, the injury to the lower sphincter, combined with the pooling of the blood in the stomach, will make you puke blood. </p>
<p>This also happens with stab injuries to the lungs. Blood fills the lungs and you cough up blood.</p>
<p>Edit: what bothers me is chest stabs. In movies, I often see folks stabbed in the chest, but not the heart, and they walk around like nothing happened. Like, phew, didn’t hit the heart. In reality they would have most likely punctured a lung and collapsed it. Causing severe difficulty breathing out the remaining intact lung. The punctured lung would eventually bleed to the center causing blood to choke out the intact lung and kill you without medical attention. </p>
<p>Starship Troopers had a female actress die like this. She barely could keep breath until her lungs filled with blood post collapse. Though she wouldn’t have made it long enough to have the romantic death she had, the result was accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Starship Troopers has it. It’s actually quite well done. Just take a tad longer than it should to load Diz onto the escape transport. I remember seeing the laceration on Captain America’s wrist at the Endgame battle with Thanosband being like, hmm, he tied that off a little too late.</p></div>		</li>
