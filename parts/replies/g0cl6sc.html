			<div class="markdown"><p>Stock and currency behaviors are always pretty fascinating to me.</p>
<p>One of my big undergrad projects was an automated foreign exchange trading program that attempted to move currency between the USD-Euro-Yen in any direction, to attempt to always grow.</p>
<p>As part of the background we had to learn about the history of a lot of economic/stock &quot;systems&quot; (sets of rules for making decisions) and there is one with a hilarious story. The Fibonacci System. A Fibonacci sequence is calculated by adding the two previous numbers to get the first one (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc).</p>
<p>There are two ways to get rich being a person that does stuff with economic systems. Way 1: Get good at making systems. Way 2: Leverage a random good month/year into providing credence that companies should pay you to lecture their employees on your systems, then leverage that to provide more lectures, stop making systems.</p>
<p>Well, many years ago some guy came up with the Fibonacci system. The idea was that you grab some stretch of historical data on the stock/currency in question and then established a sort of &quot;average max&quot; and &quot;average min&quot;. Draw a horizontal line for each of these. Measure the distance. Now make a line the same distance above/below each of those lines. Now make a line above/below those lines that is the sum of the two previous distances, repeat. Now the rule to use this is that if the value of that item ever rises ABOVE a line, buy as much as you can as fast as you can, because it's going to skyrocket. And if the line ever rises BELOW a line, sell as hard as you can because it's going to floor like a falling anvil.</p>
<p>How does this predict the behavior?</p>
<p>It doesn't. It's complete bullshit.</p>
<p>However...during the time that the guy who came up with the system existed, there were only a hundred or so BIG companies and he got lecture deals at most of them. So a very strange thing happened....all of a sudden the Fibonacci System started working...because a majority of the stock/currency traders were using the same system to make decisions and generally speaking the behavior was self-reinforcing. There was some slop of course, there always is, but on the whole this random set of rules began churning out a profit.</p>
<p>The core aspect of stocks/currencies is that generally speaking you want to try and match the trends as close as you can...but not TOO closely, because if you are too &quot;curve fit&quot; then the moment the reality of the stock/currency changes it's behavior (and there are millions of factors that can do this without warning), your system will likely lose you vast sums of money.</p>
<p>And so any/all sets of rules are equally likely to produce results and the best systems these days are systems-of-systems. They have dozens/hundreds of these smaller systems running and then based off of confidence values (if a particular system has been predicting correctly lately, give it a higher confidence value [a stronger vote], if one has been predicting badly lately, give it a lower confidence) gives a weighted vote to determine if you should buy/sell/stay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>TSLA is now trading with a P/E of 765. That’s insane for a company that literally would not be profitable without selling tax credits. That’s 5x the P/E of AMZN which in insanely profitable and even that stock seems overpriced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the truth right here. Nothing about how their sedan sold this much #s or how they sell EV credits. Its all due to investors buying their stock in the expectation that they will be the next <strong>General Motors</strong> or even <strong>General Electric.</strong> </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I bought some of this stock for 'fun' back when they were close to bankrupt. The key advantage that i feel now that Tesla has is that its able to make electric cars that <strong>don't suck</strong>. That and it has excellent battery technology. Its brand recognition now is also skyhigh....due to Musk's antics and its very pretty cars. </p>
<p>I would say that the future trajectory of Tesla will almost entirely depend on battery technology. It needs to either research or more feasibly, acquire better tech in order to improve the lifespan/range/charging time of its batteries.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's debatable. There's plenty of Model 3 reviews on YouTube from people showing the QA issues. Some owners are in the showroom every month with a new problem. Tesla fixes them all of course, no problem, but they're nowhere near the QA consistency of the major Japanese autos. But they are very cool and more exciting than the rest, and people love in invest in &quot;cool&quot; things. This is where the professionals come out and short-sell... but they've been trying to short Tesla for years and it just keeps going up. I wonder if a major scandal (ala Diesel-gate) is the only thing which will kick the price back to reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While all true, as an investor this reason has absolutely nothing to do with my desire to buy the stock at current high prices. As far as I'm concerned, Tesla has WON. Where to begin?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Autonomous driving is the future. Whoever figures that out wins. Tesla is years ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Their battery technology is unmatched. No other company can compete with their range. Tesla's cheaper cars will continue to outperform other brands luxury cars in this metric. Again, Tesla has no competition.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Teslas software is far above the rest. Look into how much money other brands are spending on this, and it's nowhere near as good. I'm not even talking about the self-driving AI chip. Tesla has no competition here.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tesla will almost certainly have a fleet of autonomous or semi-autonomous robo-taxis, which will generate revenue at far greater margins than vehicle sales themselves. This is dependent on autonomous driving of course.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tesla is not a car company. They are an energy company. Most of the most valuable companies in the world are energy companies, and Tesla is coming for them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, your response is totally legit, and of course S&amp;P 500 inclusion and 4 quarters of profits has impacted things. But selling EV credits has little to do with how valuable I think they are (although it's a nice perk), and I'm not alone. People are finally waking up to what Tesla really is.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: forgot to mention ICE manufacturers need to cannibalize their own sales trying to switch from being ICE vehicle to EV manufacturers. This is a <em>huge</em> problem for them; I think many brands may fail in the attempt. Also, I've gotten some good responses to this post about how I'm underestimating Tesla's competition. I don't think I am but it's always a pleasure to see people mention what the competitors are up to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They have to actually make it to all these hypothetical future scenarios to be the ones on top. </p>
<p>The reason Tesla is so valuable is because of all the &quot;investors&quot; dumping money into Tesla. Nothing more. They've bought the hype.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well then, where is it? Tesla's been the leader of the EV market since 2012, and every year that a competitor has announced that they'll release a new vehicle to compete with Tesla, it's been either severely delayed, ultra-low volume, or a complete dud.</p>
<p>And that's just the vehicle segment. Tesla is also leading in both home energy storage and grid-scale energy storage. They're the only manufacturer who makes solar panels that are built right into roof tiles. And their regular solar panel business has been growing very rapidly over the last few years.</p>
<p>The autonomy segment is a little more murky, but they definitely have by far the most partially autonomous vehicles on the roads today, which are gathering huge swaths of data for them to use to train their AI models. Companies like Waymo (aka Google) have cars that are fully autonomous, but they only work in totally clear weather and afaik are only in use in Phoenix, Arizona. Tesla's solution is not fully autonomous, yet, but it gets closer to that with each new feature (they recently released traffic light and stopsign recognition), and it works in the majority of weather conditions and functions all over the world.</p>
<p>Investors see all these things as a good bet that Tesla will continue to dominate in its specialized fields, so it's worth investing in them.</p></div>		</li>
