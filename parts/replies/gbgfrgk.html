			<div class="markdown"><p>I should also mention that, aside from these &quot;top down&quot; approaches, researchers have made significant progress in &quot;bottom up&quot; strategies, attempting to build self-replicating systems in test tubes (see &quot;In vitro self-replication and multicistronic expression of large synthetic genomes&quot;, Nature communications, 2020). So far these systems are still dependent on extracting genetic components from E. coli, but they are not far away from being able to make all their own genes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thesis was on this! The most promising candidate for a bottom up strategy had, if I remember correctly, about 70 genes. It didn’t do much more than replicate itself. Not very good for a commercial application, but c’est la vie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t really taken any biology classes, so do you mind if I ask what sort of applications this has? Beyond increasing our understanding of life I mean. My first thought was that it could be useful for developing organisms that produce useful compounds for us; is that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, thats really interesting. It looks like its not clear if the limits have been pushed yet. Also, it seems like it hasn't been done by selection. I think it would be neat to try by artificial selection, keeping strains of bacteria that have reduced genome size to see how far it could go.   </p>
<p>Also, from my understanding in the wiki page you linked, it seems like genomes can get quite small if they outsource some of their genes to their hosts? That's an interesting difference to consider. I wonder if its possible for a free living organism to outsource some of their genes to other molecules or components, e.g. proteins?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Proteins were originally thought to be the information carrier, given the possible diversity with combinations of different amino acids. I think it would be a real uphill to evolve a separate encoding, reading, error correcting system based on proteins when DNA ticks all the boxes. That being said many cells do outsource nonessential genes to free floating plasmids (still DNA) which can be taken in by the cell (antibiotic resistance genes for bacteria), or divide with the normal genome (like the plasmid that codes for our mitochondria).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the interesting answer. Things are always more complex than expected :). It seems like the definition of an organism's genome is a bit fuzzy. Free floating plasmids that divide with the normal genome would really only be a consideration for organisms with chromosomes right? If I remember right, bacterial DNA is mostly plasmids anyway?</p>
<p>Given all this, I guess it would be neat to compare what happens in a sterile environment with the experimental organisms and some essential molecules to a less controlled non sterile environment.</p>
<p>Yup I definitely understand that it would be a huge uphill battle, but in theory it could be possible? If a bacteria was pushed to limits to survive with a tiny genome, some crazy positive feedback process with proteins or lipids or w/e, could enhance survival?  There must be some imagined biological encoding systems that havent been observed in nature yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible to go pretty far with outsourcing your &quot;machinery&quot; to other organisms. Think if mitochondria, who started off as independent organisms but were absorbed into larger cells to form eukaryotic cells. A lot of the things (RNA, proteins, ...) they need are coded into the genome of their host cells.</p>
<p>For organisms that don't live inside eachother things like this are also possible, but to lesser extent. Some bacteria for example only survive in a microbiome if there are other species present, because they feed off of the products the others produce. </p>
<p>Outsourcing genes to other molecules, proteins like you suggest is not possible. Genes are made up of DNA or RNA, they are the template from which we copy RNA, which is the template for aminoacid sequences, ie proteins. It is possible though to use one gene and copy it in different ways to produce different end products. This happens often through alternative splicing (parts of the genetic material are skipped or left in) and other mechanisms. This increases the amount of things you can do with one gene.</p>
<p>Hope this helps a bit :) (source: med school)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses often have overlapping reading frames as well.  Since DNA is read in groups of 3, and it's possible to read forward or backward, there can be 6 different ways to interpret a given piece of DNA.  If you have more than one of them produce something valid and useful, you've done more with the same amount of DNA.</p>
<p>There are probably some tricks to be done with this that might be difficult to arise by chance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Humans also fall somewhere on this spectrum. Every time we eat we are taking in the products of various biologic machinery outside ourselves but essential to our survival. Carbohydrates, fats, amino acids we can't synthesize, numerous different vitamins, etc, are all products of external biological processes that we couldn't live without.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flip side what’s the longest genome.</p>
<p>Is there an advantage to short genomes? I would imagine the shorter the genome the more impactful errors of transcription/translation would be, right? This is assuming the longer genomes have areas of redundancy?</p>
<p>It’s been like 20 years since AP Bio so pls forgive. Man I loved genetics though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just did some googling and found this paper which might be interesting to you :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316904211_Is_There_an_Upper_Limit_to_Genome_Size" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316904211\_Is\_There\_an\_Upper\_Limit\_to\_Genome\_Size" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316904211\_Is\_There\_an\_Upper\_Limit\_to\_Genome\_Size</a></a></p>
<p>Seems like a bigger genome is thought to have higher energy requirements, takes more time to replicate, slowing down key processes, and at some size surprisingly it may limit opportunity for selection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I remember, one of the smallest genomes is that of e. coli. It has virtually no non-conding sequences and some genes even code different proteins depending on which direction you read from. It appears to be optimized for maximum cell division rate. Most non-essential genes code for different environmental adaption mechanisms (like the lac operon). E. colis cell cycle also appears to be the absolute maximum that any organism can achieve under optimal conditions without their genome becoming unstable (~20 min doubling time).</p>
<p>On the other hand, apart from regulation and protecting coding DNA from damage there appears to be no particular reason to have a bigger genome. But it does not appear to be detrimental either (if you can live with a slower cell cycle that is).
As far as I'm aware, one of the largest genomes is that of hermit crabs with an estimated 256 chromosomes (humans have 46). Keep in mind though, that the number of chromosomes does in no way correspond to genome size in base pairs.</p></div>		</li>
