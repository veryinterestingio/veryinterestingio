On my case there's a ring around the power button that lights when it's powered on, and also blinks to indicated HDD activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually why you shouldn't just yank out a mounted disk as well, such as a flash drive, because if you pull it out before the read/write process is complete it can cause data loss or corruption. Modern versions of Windows actually plan for this by automatically umounting the disk after the write process is complete, but bottom line is you should always first unmount the disk before removing it, even in Windows.</p></div>		</li>
