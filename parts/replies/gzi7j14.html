<p>Structures built perpendicular to the  coast also prevents deposition of sediments, that is why one area is being eroded but the sediment is not being replenish because it is blocked by these structures</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who were thinking of buildings built near water (like me for a few suspicious minutes) I think this is actually referring to things like jetties and seawalls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Oregon and they have laws in most of the coastal communities not to build sea walls for this reason. The downside is they’ve had homes built too close to cliffs that start having their decks/homes erode into the ocean.</p>
<p>The seawall protects the homes that were built poorly planned(or were fine until the sea level kept rising) but screws the houses further down the coast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, in Tampa Bay Area of Florida, we have giant ships that pump sand that previously eroded back onto our shore to replenish/extend our shorelines. It costs millions and we just had it done recently, but the &quot;softer&quot; sections of shoreline resort to this or exactly what Geologist said.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the north parking lot, the beach has washed away up to the parking lot to the point there is a manhole cover 5 feet into the sand and sits about two feet above sea level</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeh, I live in a place where the coast is growing (NW England).  There’s a place near me which has a sea wall and promenade despite the fact that the sea no longer reaches it.  I’ve got a picture of my great aunt paddling in the sea there in the 30s but it hasn’t come in that far in my lifetime.  I guess climate change will alter that at some point.</p></div>		</li>
