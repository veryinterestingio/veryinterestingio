			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to pretend there's an animal that can see other parts of the spectrum, like x-rays or microwaves, that would say something like &quot;The concept of transparent trees does not exist in humans.&quot;</p>
<p>Or I guess birds could be like &quot;The concept of a visible/feelable magnetic field does not exist in humans.&quot;</p>
<p>If we ever break the communication barrier with crows, and they can abstract a little, it would be so interesting to hear how they would describe the feeling of magnetic fields while traveling through space in a starship. Does it feel like a breeze? Motion sickness? Does it feel like screaming? Does it tickle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets really fun when you expand this concept to extraterrestrial biodiversity. Eyes, mouths, arms, legs, blood, muscle, and all the other things shared amongst vast majorities of life on earth is simply because we all come from a common ancestor. The idea that alien life could have organs/parts that are nothing remotely close to the kind seen on Earth, that are used to define reality by sensing natural forces that are entirely unknown and impossible to comprehend by any lifeform on Earth is something I think about a lot... especially recently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely they can feel the air pressure difference / air flowing or sense &quot;smells&quot; or other chemicals in the air.</p>
<p>How they respond to these senses, I have no idea.</p>
<p>If you try to push them, they will avoid the air pressure generated by your movements. They don't know what you're doing, they just know something must be causing air pressure disturbances and want to avoid whatever it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that they are sensing air pressure, it's more the fact that the air we move trying to swat them pushes them out of the way, that's why fly swatters are mesh doesn't displace the air</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with much of what you are saying, but one has to be careful with such explanations.</p>
<p><strong><em>&quot;Having and understanding the concept of something&quot;</em></strong> and <strong><em>actually doing</em></strong> something are generally two very different things. One can do amazing things without having a clue of how or why they happen. There are examples of this all around us.</p>
<p>For example, at some point every individual was a single fertilized cell, which then divided, its progeny performing a very complex process of embryogenesis, thus forming the bodies with all their structures, including the brains, etc. The cells do all this, producing an amazing result, but the cells themselves do not have a brain, much less concepts or understanding of what they do.</p>
<p>Likewise, a web weaving spider executes a complex dance, following a relatively small set of instinctive steps, and this creates the web. The ability is there, but why these rules produce the web, or why this web works to catch the flies is not completely understood even by the scientists who study this, much less by the spider.</p>
<p>One famous example is <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/106/Supplement_1/10061.figures-only" target="_blank">&quot;Caddis larva food sieve&quot;</a> -- a rather clever food trap which this tiny animal constructs instinctively, again without any clue of how the design works.</p>
<p>One can point out an endless list of such examples of <strong><em>&quot;competence without comprehension&quot;</em></strong> in all animals, including humans.</p>
<p>This of course does not mean that flies are not acting annoyingly dumb, but only that lack of comprehension <em>per se</em> is not a good explanation for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not understanding your point. Are you saying flies can comprehend the concept of clear glass but just choose to keep hitting it? </p>
<p>Your post seem to indicate that they cannot comprehend it? But I don't quite understand what you're saying at the end since then you say &quot;lack of comprehension is not a good explanation&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No he's saying that the fly will hit the window, or not, regardless of its ability to comprehend the difference between an open or closed window. We know its brain can not comprehend windows. </p>
<p>The fly does not have a brain capable of knowing that a swat will injure or kill it, but it can still evade the attack. It moves because that is its nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am saying that &quot;having&quot; or &quot;not having a concept&quot; of glass is irrelevant for being able to find an open window next to it. Some insects may perform much better in finding their way (I posted a relevant anecdote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/nywcaz/eli5_why_do_houseflies_get_stuck_in_a_closed/h1n709q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">earlier</a>), but in all likelihood none of these insects have &quot;concepts&quot; or &quot;understanding&quot; in the way humans, with our 100,000 times more neurons in the brain, do.</p></div>		</li>
