			<div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays traction splints are much smaller and can easily be carried by the injured person or other personnel. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.quadmed.com/product/kendrick-traction-device" target="_blank">Kendrick Traction Device</a>, it can be applied by a single rescuer, if needed. One of the neat features with this device is the person doesn't necessarily need a foot for traction to be applied, versus other devices (e.g. Hare) that require a foot hitch.</p></div>		</li>
