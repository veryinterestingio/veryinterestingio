			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! That's referring to [cosmic microwave background radiation] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background?wprov=sfla1</a>), which can make up a little portion of static (probably wont be like that image with how much other noise there is on earth and from the sun, and how TVs display stuff it picks up, but it is there) and CMBR is detectable all across the universe. It's a relic of the early stages of the universe, and so is pretty definite proof of the big bang. So what you heard is pretty true! And although a TV in space isn't the best way to pick it up, I'm curious how much TV static would differ in space.</p></div>		</li>
