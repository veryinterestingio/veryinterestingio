<p>So in 2008, the govt simply decided to purchase “shares” of BoA, a distressed company, to keep it going.</p>
<p>People thought it was a poor use of money so they called it a “bailout.” If we could foresee the future, we’d would have called it a “profitable investment” right?</p>
<p>The concept of “giving a bailout” to mean “loaning money” or “purchasing shares” is so misleading, I swear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with the 2008 bailout is the moral hazard. Rescuing people who were making a killing and got too reckless sets a bad precedent. We want the people running the world financial system to have skin in the game. But in retrospect it was the right decision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What wasn't a right decision was to avoiding going after management that allowed for this to happen. Yes letting the economy not collapse is understandable but not going after the parties responsible leads to the issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bank of America is much more likely to stay in business after a bailout versus the average American. A bailout for a bank means very little risk for the government (and thus taxpayers) with a lot to gain in future tax revenue.</p>
<p>bailing out people has no guarantee that they won't get in the same situation again.</p>
<p>Morality is often not in line with rationality. Many people consider it immoral to be a homosexual, though rationally there's nothing wrong with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure why, but there is that misconception that the government just gave banks money without ever getting anything back.</p>
<p>However, the term &quot;bailout&quot; is still appropriate because they would have been bankrupt without it and it set a precedent that they were too big to fail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bad example. The two situations are not related. 2008 was a loan from the government. This is the fed buying repos - basically just trading cash for bonds. It increases the liquidity in the economy but doesn't actually give the banks any money, and it also doesn't involve the government at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not if you have a repurchase agreement. </p>
<p>In other words, if Fed is agreeing to trade cash for Bank assets under condition they’ll trade back, then technically Fed hasn’t bought anything. It’s just proving liquidity</p></div>		</li>
