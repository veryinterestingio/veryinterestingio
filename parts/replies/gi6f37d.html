			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Plates are mostly driven by pull at subduction zones, and ocean spreading is happening largely passively: the plates are pulled apart (at mid-ocean ridges), and the mantle creates new oceanic crust at the boundary between them.</p>
<p>There is also ridge push (the gradient in density away from the ridge gives a net horizontal force on the plates also away from the ridge), which is more similar to how nails grow (sort of), but it plays a minor role in the overall forces driving plate motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that the part that hurts like hell when a potato chip stabs it? And it feels like something strong has happened under the nail? Like a jabby paper cut. </p>
<p>Edit: after reading the comments on the comment</p>
<p>Yes nails also give feedback. Lots of it. Grow your nails out, like to feminine nail salon length... and see how much new and extra feedback you get.  I like to keep mine pretty and the only way to get a nice length is to add polish to strengthen, but after a few days of the feedback, I clip them off.  It’s a lot of a new sensory feedback and it’s annoying after a while.    </p>
<p>I think you should all try it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your nail bed is the most sensitive area of the human body. Based purely on the number of nerve endings concentrated to that area. Technically a lower number of nerves could provide higher sensitivity in other areas of the body based on nerve size or nerve sensitivity, but overall generally speaking, the nerve bundles in nails and finger tips takes the cake for highest sensitivity.</p>
<p>Which I find surprising because I have hit my nail bed with a hammer or other object and had the nail fall off a few times in life, and I've been hit in the testicles on multiple occasions (not necessarily a kick), and can tell you that the nails definitely did not hurt as bad, lol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I admit I thought the clitoris had the highest concentration of nerve endings.</p></div>		</li>
