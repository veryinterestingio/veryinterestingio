			<div class="markdown"><p>The way it was described to me,  my bil woke up in the middle of the night with chest pains and wanted to go to the hospital. He lived with his parents , so they took him.  He started getting cold and clammy in the way in. Poor kid asked his parents on the way if he was dying. I'm thinking it's something hereditary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note not everything with ‘chest pain’ is cardiac. Other things that can happen in young people:</p>
<p>Spontaneous pneumothorax (sudden air outside the lungs where it shouldn’t be). Typically happens in tall, skinny young males. Occurs usually due to blobs on the lung that pop and cause air to leak from the lung into the chest cavity. Typically causes sharp pain and breathlessness and patient can be clammy.</p>
<p>Pulmonary embolism (a blood clot getting dislodged and stuck in the lung). This can happen for a number of reasons - particularly things like long term flights where you don’t move around so blood clots in your legs easier, or inherited conditions where your blood is inherently stickier. Also presents with sharp pain, breathlessness, pale.</p>
<p>(There’s also lots of other things that can present with issues that may seem cardiac but originate elsewhere)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what you’re describing it doesn’t sound hereditary. The HCM described by another poster doesn’t present like that. Has anyone else in the family died of heart disease? Perhaps there’s an element of a hypertriglyceridemia? No way to know without a test.</p>
<p>With the degree of blockage you described, he likely had atherosclerosis. Did he smoke?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There could be some mutation that interacts with this guys paticular lifestyle in a weird way, something that predisposed early plaque deposits. Would be interesting to know his blood pressure - I go to one of those free ones in drug stores, every couple months. I was a decent athlete (swimmer), but got super lightheaded in the hot tub. Turned out my blood pressure was rediculously low</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely sounds like a heart attack induced by lack of blood flow to the heart. (Probably due to thin arteries and build up of cholesterol)</p>
<p>When you have a heart attack, the heart still tries as best as it can to continue pumping blood through your arteries, so you have a good chance of making it if you react quickly and go to the hospital right away. It also depends on the severity of the heart attack and on how often you've had heart attacks before since they permanently damage the heart. People who survived previous heart attacks have a worse prognosis. Heart attacks can be very painful but often the person will remain conscious for a long time such as was the case with your brother in law.</p>
<p>Life threatening arrhythmia such as those caused by HCM are another animal entirely. You can sometimes feel the conditions leading up to it, such as noticing an abnormally strong or irregular heartbeat, but that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. When your heart chambers start contracting uncoordinated due to misbehaving electrical activity, it might result into v-fib or cardiac arrest. This is where the heart stops providing the body with blood completely. Very often this will cause people to faint just seconds after noticing there is something wrong with their heart, and unless someone can defibrillate that person right away or perform chest compressions until help arrives, that person will die in a matter of minutes. Hence why these types of events are also called 'sudden cardiac death'. I don't think this is what happened to your brother in law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are chest compressions to manual pump blood??? I’ve always thought they were for lungs because they were coupled with mouth to mouth. I also heard that these are barely effective...as in...very few people make it. Is this true?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP states his arteries were blocked, so the cause being your second suggestion sounds more feasible.</p></div>		</li>
