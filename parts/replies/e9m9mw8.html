			<div class="markdown"><p>The points aren't moving through space unless measured relative to something, the space is expanding and that is what gives us the illusion of motion. This could also not be true if spacetime itself is a physical 'thing', but if it isn't then the points never move, the space just expands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bear this in mind: the Big Bang took place *everywhere*. Where-ness itself began with the Big Bang. There was no explosion at a point in space. There was no space in any way we understand it. There was no conventional time or space. The Big Bang was he beginning of that, for all intents and purposes, literally. We are not all moving away from a singular point in space somewhere very very ***VERY*** far away. Broadly speaking, on the grand scale, everything is moving away from everything else as the Universe expands, because space itself is expanding.   </p>
<p>To answer your first question, the Universe is essentially the same in every direction we care to look, and there are no 'edges' visible anywhere. The &quot;edge&quot; is simply the observability of light coming at us from all directions, and how much time it has had to get here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is quite something to take in. Human brains are taught cause and effect and then something like this comes along. I can't even imagine it. There was literally nothing, no plane, no medium and then boom. Can you suggest any good books or studies that document the nature of the &quot;Bang&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. It was infinitely dense, to the point where nothing moved and there was no causality or time. But it was not nothing, it was literally everything that is in our universe now, in a spot infinitely small.</p>
<p>This is assuming the big bang even happened. We are pretty sure, but as we can't actually see that far back, we don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably not what you're looking for since it's not scientific or informative in nature, but some of the stories in Italo Calvino's Cosmicomics explore the same concept in a very surreal, fictional way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can see unending universe relatively equally in every direction.</p>
<p>There is no edge, but there is a &quot;wall&quot; past which we can't see because it represents the fiery birth of the universe where all of space was a rather homogeneous fiery gas, and there is another &quot;wall&quot; beyond that which we can't see, but we could never see past that second &quot;wall&quot; even if we could see past the first &quot;wall&quot;, because light hasn't had enough time to reach us from that far away yet.</p>
<p>Interesting, both &quot;walls&quot; are expanding as time goes on, as given more time, more distant light has more time to actually reach us.  There is a third &quot;wall&quot; which is related to the expansion of space, and that &quot;wall&quot; causes our &quot;observable universe of things&quot; to shrink.  To resolve that apparent contradiction, note that the &quot;observable universe&quot; is constantly growing as time goes on, as more light from farther away in the galaxy reaches us, but at the same time, because of the expansion of space, <em>things currently within the observable universe move farther and farther away</em>.  Eventually we will reach a point where we will be able to see more of the universe than ever before (actually this happens every second), but we won't see anything interesting <em>within</em> that observable universe because all light-emitting sources will have moved beyond the &quot;wall&quot; where light can not overcome the increasing expansion of space.</p>
<p>There was no <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9wnkfv/if_hubble_can_make_photos_of_galaxys_132ly_away/e9maszk/" target="_blank">origin point</a> for the Big Bang.</p></div>		</li>
