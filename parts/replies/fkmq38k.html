			<div class="markdown"><p>Silly idea, but can you theoretically infect someone with a non-resistant strain of the same bacteria, so it will compete with resources with the resistant organism? I know it's largely useless, because as soon as you start the antibiotics you're back where you started, but now I'm wondering if &quot;similar infections competing for resources&quot; are a thing or whether that's just going to make people sicker quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While an additional infection would result in a competition for resources, since <em>you</em> are the resource, you would be 'sicker quicker.' In contrast, the microbes on the skin have a beneficial effect because the resources they compete for are not your cells; this idea works for some situations, just not an internal infection.  </p>
<p>However, somethings of interest that are related to your idea: </p>
<p>1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therapy" target="_blank">Treatment</a> via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage#Phage_therapy" target="_blank">bacteriophage</a>: Basically, a virus infects the bacteria infecting you. </p>
<p>2) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21672841" target="_blank">Hypertumors</a>: If you have cancer, a second cancer comes and drains resources from the first, suppressing both via competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding bacteria often store their antibiotic resistance genes on plasmids (relatively short rings of DNA separate from the bacterial genome).</p>
<p>Plasmids are used to transfer genes horizontally through a population (rather than vertically pass them down to daughter cells, pass the genes horizontally from one adult cell to another) generally by conjugation through a pilus (think bacterial sex, but not really)</p>
<p>This gene transfer enables the non resistant strain to develop resistance and can even happen across bacterial species.</p>
<p>So in your scenario it is quite possible that the organism you introduce will develop resistance.</p>
<p>You have the right idea, though instead of introducing the same strain of pathogenic (disease causing) bacteria, you introduce the bacteria that your body would consider part of its normal flora (micro-organism population). This would only work for infections localised in places that you have an abundance of micro-organisms, (skin, GI tract, parts of the respitory system), and would not be as effective as using different antibiotics that the organism isn't resistant against, or bacteriophages as the other commenter mentioned.</p>
<p>Micro-organism transplants do happen, though for other reasons (see fecal matter transplants).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I knew about the horizontal gene transfer, obviously it would come into play here! Thank you for the information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not with the same bacteria, but you can try using other, non harmful bacteria.  Bacteria are considered part of our immune system, for this reason.  So sometimes “helpful” bacteria are introduced that will compete for resources but not release toxins or enzymes that cause illness</p>
<p>Of course as someone has said horizontal gene transfer can occur, so the harmful bacteria can give the helpful bacteria resistance, which is in itself not a big deal, but if subsequently infected with sensitive harmful bacteria the good bacteria could give resistance to the harmful bacteria.</p></div>		</li>
