<p>Q: What do you call a tropical rainforest without the rain?</p>
<p>A: A desert. </p>
<p>Without the evapotranspiration causing rain, the Amazon will look much like the Nile, a large river through arid nothingness. This will leave Brazil about as productive as Egypt: Brazil has 200 million mouths to feed, while Egypt has just less than half that and heavily relies on food import (mainly wheat and maize). Brazil will be reliant on food imports, which it will not be able to afford under its current short-term neofascist economics. This will cause a refugee crisis as large as, or larger than, the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria and will absolutely cause tensions with the US, which isn't terribly welcoming to migrants right now.</p>
<p>Brazil needs the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon rainforest does not need Brazil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or they don’t care. Oftentimes, in areas like these, the choice is between doing this and facing the consequences later, or not eating. </p>
<p>And yes, it’s not all small farms doing this on their own. There are large cattle corporations in Brazil. But the people will slash and burn for the same reason you and I get into a gas powered car to go to work every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats exactly it! This connection is so important, the destruction of the commons is pretty frequently shown in 3rd world countries, when affluence in the first world affords us the means to pollute our commons (air and water and soil) with little to no consideration. I've been looking for these words for so long! Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They know. They just don't care. They will use it for intensive cattle which is fine for that purpose or rely heavily with chemicals for soy plantation. They aren't farming there for food (Brazil is ironically not self sufficient in food production). It's just for export and burning the Amazon is fine for this agribusiness purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The soil in the Amazon is very poor not because nutrients are washed away but because all the organic matter doesn't get transferred into the soil and is rapidly used and converted above ground due to the high level of biodiversity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are true, but the first is more true. The Amazon's soil is ancient - it has been degraded (washed away) for a very long time. </p>
<p>On your second point, you have to question where those nutrients will come from with no tree cover. No falling leaves means no falling nutrients.</p></div>		</li>
