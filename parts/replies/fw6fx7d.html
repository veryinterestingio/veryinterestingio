			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer doesn't answer the most important part of the question, why higher frequencies push and low pull. Your example of resonant frequencies is spot on but is irrelevant (unless im missing something here). If they are resonating, they are in sync and will both push and pull equally. Eli4?</p>
<p>Edit: ITT people that really dont understand resonant frequencies. For everyone still mentioning them: just because something has a resonating frequency does NOT mean that object will move in a single direction, they vibrate back and forth. It goes forwards, it foes backwards, all around the same point. As the vibration increases, its still always around the same point! It does not MOVE, it VIBRATES. Theres a difference. So please stop explaining resonant frequencies. I understand them. The post i commented on explained it very well. They have nothing to do with this thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the other answer talking about nodes/antinodes and ratcheting effects addresses that better, but it's hard to eli5-ize it.  Also, I don't know the precise physics causing that.  Could be related to the amplitude of the motion, surface area of the paper, lotsa things.  Sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it be because lower frequencies diffract more, so more of the low-frequency sound waves 'bend around' the edges of the paper and vibrate the air behind it, where as most of the high-frequency sound stays on one side.</p>
<p>(I've no idea if this is an explanation, just a guess).</p>
<p>This is what I mean about the diffraction:<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess would be different forces at work much like Gravity vs an object's speed, Gravity pulls shit in but if the object is fast enough it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>So could be two forces acting on it and depending on frequency results in more of a pull than push or vice versa. But complete and utter guess</p>
<p>AGAIN JUST GUESSING SINCE IT&quot;S NOT TOP LEVEL COMMENT PEOPLE</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, not every frequency is resonant.</p>
<p>You ever see a competition SPL bass performance? It definitely isn't sucking.</p>
<p>A speaker vibrates at frequency and the resulting sound pressure is what you hear. High frequencies don't push more than low, but a medium like paper is more susceptible to high attenuation frequencies than low.</p></div>		</li>
