			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a super important thing to learn. The bandwidth of many gas spectrums are not instrument limited but limited by the physics of the emitter. </p>
<p>If the gas is warm it will increase the bandwidth due to Doppler effects as well.</p>
<p>So to get very narrow bands the gas has to be very diffuse and exited such that it's temperature remains low.</p>
<p>This is very difficult to achieve.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's electromagnetic radiation. </p>
<p>Particles in an object at a given temperature have a range of kinetic energies, as given by the boltzman distribution. </p>
<p>When those particles bounce off of each other, they accelerate and therefore give off EM radiation. </p>
<p>Hotter substance means faster particles and bigger range of particle speeds, which means bigger accelerations and wider range of accelerations, which means wider and bluer and brighter spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP's question about zooming in to see lines is still an interesting one - at some point line structures are favored, are they not? While energies can smear continuously, the coulomb structure will provide peaks if you were to integrate over extremely long periods of time with an extremely precise detector given the random nature of continuous processes.</p>
<p>Perhaps this would not be true for, say, a gas, but I imagine it would be true for a crystal especially at low temperature, emitting radiation during cooling. As you zoomed in ultimately you would indeed see the splitting resulting in the bands of the crystal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean. For free-bound and free-free transitions, there are no lines, the spectrum is continuous, no matter how far you &quot;zoom in&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I agree - my point is that you have a spectrum of continuous transitions superimposed on a spectrum of peaks, so if you zoom in enough you will ultimately be able to make out the peaks - not that there are any totally disallowed energies. But I guess even in quantized systems, technically it's just SNR of the peaks vs the continuous distribution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This transition will occur through the emission of a photon with energy E + E' (assuming the transition is direct into the bound state without any kind of cascade).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when you say this, are you speaking about an electron transitioning down from some higher orbital to a lower one, after an initial capture at the higher one? I think I understand the general mechanics of the energy conservation, but I guess my confusion might come from imagining this as some electron going down the potential well gaining KE, then abruptly &quot;Snapping&quot; to an energy level around the proton, where it has energy -E. The excess from the kinetic is emitted as a photon. Doesn't that mean that the energy of the photon would be purely reflective of the electron's kinetic energy up until it reached the bound state? I can only imagine E + E' if we start at a quantized energy level then go down to another, after having also come from an arbitrary distance and becoming bound in an orbital. Am I misunderstanding your original response?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm talking about transitioning from an unbound state into a bound state. Unbound states have a continuous energy spectrum, while bound states don't.</p>

<p>You can't really separate kinetic and potential energies like that in quantum mechanics. If you have a state of well-defined <strong>total</strong> energy, it doesn't necessarily have individually well-defined kinetic and potential energies. This is the case for the situation I described (and really <em>any</em> case where the potential depends on position, so in practice any case except a free particle).</p>
<p>Bound states have negative energies, taking the &quot;zero point&quot; of the potential to be at r = infinity. So to get from an unbound state of energy E, you have to give up E energy just to get to zero, but then the bound state that it's capturing into has some negative energy -E', which. So in total, the particle has to give away an energy of E + E' in order to transition into that state.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That makes a little more sense, although one aspect still confuses me- If we define the zero point for potential between opposite charges to be when the limit for distance goes to infinity, how do we have an electron with what we'd define as positive energy to begin with? Is it purely from any initial kinetic energy?</p></div>		</li>
