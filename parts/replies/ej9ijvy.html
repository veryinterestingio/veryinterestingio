			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. For us, it was an acute episode and things are fine now. He's always been a little different since then, but he's basically back to being himself. I hope things get better for your family soon too!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Day to day I know the disconnect is growing, and there's nothing I can do to stop it because I don't feel in control. More like an observer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my brother's case, the psychosis came on very suddenly and without warning. With hindsight, there were perhaps some subtle signs that we missed that may have indicated that he was in what the doctors called the prodrome, but he never complained of anything.</p>
<p>I really hope you feel well again soon, and I would definitely advise seeking medical help if you haven't already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a very painful and difficult bout of this last fall. I'm still recovering from it today, even after receiving treatment from a psych hospital (in-patient and out-patient).</p>
<p>I had been really depressed, smoking a <em>lot</em> of weed daily for more than a year. I was in a really dark place. I met this girl who I thought would be a good friend to have (I was very lonely). Brought them back to my apartment and quickly realized they were a &quot;sociopath.&quot; Of course, I don't know for a fact if that's true, but I fully believe it to this day. </p>
<p>It scared the <strong>shit</strong> out of me. I managed to get her out of my apartment, but I spent the next couple of days in this intense state of paranoia. To your point about unconnected things becoming linked in your mind, I convinced myself that this girl was conspiring with my landlord to break into my apartment to rob me (I was <em>convinced,</em> like it was absolutely true, and I was terrified. I could not, hard as I tried, disconnect the the girl and my landlord from each other). Called family and friends in a state of hysteria, making absolutely no sense, completely out of touch with truth or reality. Sent a long and very serious text message to a drummer acquaintance of mine (who was kind of involved in the incident with the sociopath) telling her I was worried this girl was going to steal her band's equipment. </p>
<p>The paranoia specifically centered around sociopathy, and remained intense and disturbing for weeks. I became extremely distressed and suspicious of my own <em>family</em>, convincing myself that my own mother, my little sister, even an ex-boyfriend were sociopaths. I became untrusting and suspicious of the people I cared about the most, my closest friends, paranoid that they were manipulating or exploiting me. </p>
<p>I've been sober from weed since December, and I miss it just about every day. But I also know that if I smoked it even once it would trigger the paranoia I have worked so hard to overcome. I never truly knew what people meant by &quot;triggered&quot; until this experience with cannabis induced psychosis. To this day, if someone looks at me a certain way or says or does something a certain way, it can &quot;trigger&quot; intense fear and paranoia. Horrible feeling. </p>
<p>Cannabis-induced psychosis is a real thing and not just a bunch of hokey fearmongering. There is such a thing as being hopelessly dependent and addicted to weed. Weed is not for everybody, and it is not a panacea.</p>
<p>Weed is a great thing and I love it, but I'm not sure I will ever be able to smoke it again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your in depth insight. What is extremely important is that you are very self-aware that your paranoid thoughts have no rational ground, but we’re instead triggered by cannabis use! I hope your recovery process is going well </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds horrendous - I hope you're well on the road to a full recovery.</p>
<p>Some of this is similar to what I saw with my brother, but one interesting difference is that he doesn't seem to have insight into what happened like you do. He seems to just think we didn't understand him properly and it was no big deal.</p>
<p>While he was on the ward, he would tell me incessently about how we 'must always approach with the left hand, because the right hand is dishonest'. When the door buzzer sounded, he would brace against the wall because he believed that's what stopped it. One time when I arrived to visit, he was very excited to reminisce with me about how we'd met in a dream the previous night. He kept repeating 'do you remember?' and was very confused when I didn't. He would hold 3 fingers against the wall, and shift them until he was satisfied with the 'energy'. These are just the examples I remember.</p>
<p>The whole thing came on very suddenly. He finished work one Friday and had a little smoke to celebrate, for the first time in ages. I didn't witness it, but that night he became unhinged. It carried on for the whole weekend, and in the end my dad had to call the police because they couldn't persuade him to come to the hospital. The whole time, he was texting me cryptic messages like 'do you feel my concern?' (I lived abroad at the time).</p>
<p>The cannabis seemed to flip a switch. I'm not anti-drugs; while I don't smoke now, and haven't for years, both he and I were pretty big stoners in our late teens early 20s. But seeing that episode, and wondering whether I would ever see my brother emerge from his own mind again, I would urge people to take it seriously. The odds might be small but the consequence may be great.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is linked to high levels of dopamine in studies such as <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2589-paranormal-beliefs-linked-to-brain-chemistry/" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p></div>		</li>
