<p>Edit- I get it, it doesn't age in the bottle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do overproduce. Extra can be sold off for blending or blended into other labels sold by the same distiller. Worse comes to worse it can be used for shitty party liquor like Southern Comfort or Fireball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do, but not all whiskey ages the same. A lot of barrels might be “dead”, or not impart the same flavour because of where they are in the rickhouse, or weather changes, or a million other reasons. Just because you have a million barrels doesn’t mean they all are going to be useable in your main product</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine they just over-produce.   And now, oh look, we have 9-year-old whisky... 10, 11, 12, ... 50... all because we over-produced.</p>
<p>Guess we can sell that for more!  Or bottle it as another product.</p>
<p>You're only really limited by storage space - you don't have to &quot;do much&quot; to whisky to let it age.  You just need to stick it in a huge warehouse somewhere and leave it alone, checking on it occasionally.</p>
<p>Got too much and need the space back?  &quot;Our new product is blended from a variety of whiskies, all at least 10 years old...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only issue is that a generic 5 year whiskey left for an additional 10 years may not become good enough to sell as a 15 year whiskey. It's not just the age, they usually save the best tasting batches for extra aging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's actually pretty cool, but a bit more complicated than that (and to an extent, I think you're right):</p>
<p>Take Buffalo Trace for example, they make several whiskeys from Buffalo Trace to Thomas Handy and a lot in between.  They have researched their rickhouses (of which there are several, and each rickhouse produces a different product in general (blending) and each barrel, depending on it's location inside the rickhouse produces characteristics that make certain labels (think Blantons, Weller 12, Pappy)  Buffalo Trace basically has a system that tells where you might find those barrels that will produce those whiskeys (like a heat map) from each rickhouse.  So, a 12 yr. old whiskey, may not even be good whiskey, so what they'll do is usually dump those barrels &quot;early&quot; for blending, while the better barrels will be used for their single barrel, cask strength products (Larue Weller, T. Handy, or Blanton's- more $$$).  What's even crazier, Buffalo Trace only has two mash recipes (E: for most of their whiskey), all whiskeys are aged in 100% new oak, and go into barrel at a certain proof (varies), so that goes to show how much of an effect rickhouse placement and barrel selection has on the finished product.</p>
<p>I hope that wasn't boring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whisk(e)y ages differently in different climates, and while Scotland can age their whisky for decades, usually an American whiskey shouldn't age that much longer than intended. Not really sure what the situation is like for other countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer. </p>
<p>I’d add that whiskey is not the only aged spirit, but the most famous aged spirit in the US. Rum, cognac, beer, wine, etc. basically anything but clear/“silver” alcohol is aged in some way.</p>
<p>Because many of the big dogs know their sales demand and production expectations from being in business for decades and sometimes centuries, there are plants of companies that white label their products for newer brands while they figure it out.</p>
<p>Very famously, Bulleit bourbon sources from MGP in Indiana. They buy barrels worth at a time, harvest, proof down, bottle, sell, and profit. Some small brands will do this same process, but mix in their home made whiskey that’s much younger. Then they can call it a blend, they can say it has their whiskey, and they can control production in real time vs guessing 100% of their product needs. Not selling? Hold onto your own whiskey and let it age up more then sell as a new release later. Selling too much? Blend a little differently, or source. </p>
<p>Most new whiskey distilleries do not make their product. If they do, it’s seldom great quality because it’s not old enough. It’s seldom old enough because a new brand would not have enough time OR enough money to literally buy time to age longer due to taxes, fees, opportunity cost, storage, regular production overhead, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, a bit more in the weeds, but I hope it helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100%, but as for selling those distillates,  it always the case. I’d argue less often than half. </p>
<p>There is not a demand for white dog like there is for aged whiskey. As for beer, the demand for aged beer is steadily becoming the highest profit margin and faster growing segment than unaged.</p></div>		</li>
