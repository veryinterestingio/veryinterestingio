<p>Now, run the same scene forward in time: as the Universe expands, it becomes less dense, and cooler, and the quarks first join into protons and neutrons, and then these join into the light elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the cosmic microwave background tells us a lot about that event (recombination), because the change from a plasma to neutral atoms made the universe transparent to photons emitted by blackbody radiation. It's like a pervasive fingerprint of the early universe left behind.</p></div>		</li>

They'll figure it out, but they'll have to work a bit harder. We're lucky because we only have to look up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Free charged particles, eg. electrons, scatter light by Compton scattering. So when the universe was still hot enough that the electrons and atomic nuclei were separate, the light would be bouncing off electrons randomly all the time. But once the temperature dropped, the electrons and atomic nuclei combined to form electrically neutral atoms, and the Compton scattering stopped. So then the light could just keep going. It has been going ever since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For really small stuff, our intuitions about particles mislead us. Quarks are excitations in a field, like the way ocean waves are excitations of the water. Those excitations move around and seem stable over time, but if the field is <em>too</em> excited you just have a bunch of random-looking sloshing. In a sense, then, the quarks popped into existence when their fields settled down enough to talk sensibly about separare particles rather than a roiling ocean. So far as we know, the fields existed in some form or another further back in time toward the big bang than our theories can explain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Pretty good job&quot; means different things to physicists than it does to, say, a cook.</p>

<p>True. If a cook has an ingredient off by a factor of 10, they throw the results away and start over. The physicist says &quot;Look! I was correct to within an order of magnitude!&quot; and publishes the results to great fanfare.</p></div>		</li>
