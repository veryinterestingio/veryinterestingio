			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny, I smoked for almost 20 years, because I told myself that 'the damage was done' so there was no point in quitting. Then I saw <a href="https://personalexcellence.co/files/infographic-stop-smoking.gif" target="_blank">this infographic</a> that gave me hope, and I haven't had a cigarette in 7 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That info graphic is awesome and very motivating and I’m sure a lot is accurate. But if you smoke for 30 or 40 years and then quit, I doubt you risk of lung cancer drops back to that of a non-smoker in 10 years, or ever. I haven’t seen any research, so that’s just my skeptical brain saying hmm. I should actually read up on this.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think the idea that while the raw incidence rate might not go back to the same as a non-smoker, after 10 years you're sufficiently more likely to be affected by one of the other cancers (breast/prostate) that the difference is not relevant anymore. And the reason why it's 15 years for heart attacks is because heart attack is just that much more common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this info graphic. I saw something similar when I was in school. While I can’t vouch 100% to the validity of it, I do know your health can improve after you quit. I didn’t mean to make it sound like it wouldn’t when I replied to OP, I was answering his question regarding the lungs specifically. Smoking causes a myriad of health problems other than damaging the lungs, and many of these will correct themselves if you quit. The damage to your lungs, like I said, cannot be repaired however. </p>
<p>Now bear in mind, how much damage varies wildly from person to person. Some people smoked more than others, so their lungs can be much more damaged. Some people could have underlying breathing problems, like asthma, that can magnify problems associated with smoking. </p>
<p>That’s an excellent accomplishment! Here’s to many more :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I understand, no worries. It just struck me that as skeptical as I am, I never researched that. I believed it because I wanted to believe it, and that hope gave me the push I needed. Took a week off work, for my birthday and locked myself in my room.</p>
<p>By day 2 I would have punched a baby in the face for a cigarette butt.</p>
<p>After that, it got better. I still had cravings, but I started timing them. They kept getting shorter, and further apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just quit three months ago after 25 years of smoking. What should I do to check in on my lungs? I've never had any major issues, but I do have some slight tightness sometimes that worries me:/ I also don't have health insurance so it might be limited what I can do, yeah?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’ve ordered hundreds and had only 2 lung cancer detections. Ask yo’ family MD or NP or PA. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d say in general the best thing for you to do is to get a checkup, at least yearly. This way, a medical professional can examine you, while considering your history, and will be able to keep a trained eye out for anything that might be a problem.</p></div>		</li>
