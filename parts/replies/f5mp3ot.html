<p>I don't know what this is meant to mean. There is nothing physical placed inside a weapon to arm them (at least not US weapons) — it is an electromechanical activation, a &quot;switch&quot; that is activated. There are a number of &quot;links&quot; that translate a fire signal into actual use, some of which are things that can be coded (e.g., a &quot;strong&quot; link), some of these are things that will fail under adverse circumstances (a &quot;weak&quot; link, one that might fail if the weapon gets too hot, for example), and some that are triggered by environmental sensors (e.g., for a missile, the warhead will not fire unless it is launched at a high speed — so just telling it to detonate, while it is in a silo, shouldn't work).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shaped charge needs to explode in a gradient fashion to exert the maximum possible force on the core. If all the wires are the same legnth they all would activate at the same time, having them different lengths means different timings of detonation.</p>
<p>Modern charges however have moved onto using a single detonator wire and gradient-ed explosive mixtures to replace this wired fashion to ensure a smoother detonation of the primer explosives.</p></div>		</li>
