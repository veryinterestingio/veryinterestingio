<p>But, back to your point, most animals, from flies and ants, up to humans and whales, have a basic &quot;mouth (where food is broken down mechanically) - stomach (where food is broken down chemically) - intestine (where nutrients are absorbed into the body) - butt</p>

<p>So you're kind of right, but also the fly is such a weird example that isn't quite true!</p>
<p>Flies don't have a mouth that has any kind of breakind down, and they do have a stomach but they also pre-digest their food by vomiting acids and saliva rich in enzymes onto it, then suck it up through a soft, tubular proboscis. </p>
<p>So they do the same things, they just do it in a Quentin Tarantino-style weird order.</p></div>		</li>
