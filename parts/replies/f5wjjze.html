<p>Timing seems less practical because 1C rice + 1.75C water is going to take a lot less time to boil than 2C rice + 3.5C water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some yes, but others no. Maybe if you had a cheap rice cooker, yes. But if you're like my household whose primary grain is rice, you have a fancy Zojirushi rice cooker with Neuro Fuzzy Logic.</p>
<p>It apparently takes into account the external temperature, and control the multiple heating elements throughout cooking to make really good rice. It isn't just a simple thermal cutoff,  rather it regulates the temperature, and on top of that, has extended keep warm options and the ability to reheat without drying it out. Oh, and it knows how to cook the rice hard or softer, but do it properly (not wet and gloopy or dry and crunchy).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived with a friend who had a Tiger rice cooker with fuzzy logic. You could cook white rice, brown rice, red rice, oats and other cereals, and make congee. It was amazing. </p>
<p>I especially liked the timer feature which allowed you to set the time you wanted your grain preparation ready for, add the grains and water and hit start. It would turn itself on so that your food was ready at the time you set. It was great to wake up early for work and have your morning porridge all cooked and warm for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically they use weight. As the water boils off, the pot weighs less. That probably influences the time table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i agree with /u/theshreikingpines , the simple basic rice cookers utilize a temperature detection. it's pretty much a circuit breaker idea, when it gets too hot, it'll trip, turning it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't make sense. The rice absorbs the water and steam doesn't escape in most rice cookers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are probably not Asian lol</p>
<p>When I first met my husband, an American, I was so shocked that he did not own a rice cooker. And that he cooked his rice by boiling it in a pot, like a heathen. He was so amazed with the cheap rice cookers that just boil too. I call them the &quot;manual&quot; rice cooker. </p>
<p>Then I showed him the ultimate kitchen contraption that every Asian has on the kitchen counter, the fuzzy logic rice cooker. It can cook congee, any kind of rice, heck even steam your chicken with the rice. Adjust consistency as necessary, has timers, has alarms, has any other feature you can think of. I honestly think fuzzy logic is just a buzz word and I think of it more as a programmable rice cooker because you can set custom preferences on it such as consistency and how warm you want to keep the rice and profiles, etc. </p>
<p>So the entire point of this is.. It's not as simple as boiling water. Because there's the type of rice, water level, time and temperature to also consider to make the perfect rice.</p></div>		</li>
