			<div class="markdown"><p>(A) Doesn't make sense to me. Water freely flows through cellular membranes, it's the solutes dissolved in them which actually keep them where they are. So how does this make sense for lactose, particularly because it's a very large molecule, compared to glucose? In other words, how does lactose make breast milk more &quot;free flowing?&quot;</p>
<p>Neither does B. There is elaborate cellular machinery to produce and handle glucose throughout the body. We already store glucose as glycogen. So while I'm not an evolutionary biologist I don't think glucose producing/storing structures would be &quot;more complicated.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A. Producing water is easy. Producing glucose is easy. Producing a liquid high in water and glucose is tough since ideally milk should be more sugar rich than blood and osmotic pressure makes that hard. Since lactose can't pass the golgi apparatus membrane, that allows it to become the right consistency of nutrient rich and water rich. This allows it to be free-flowing enough that it can pass through the milkducts without much of an issue but still not be absorbed back into cell tissue. In more primitive mammals it could also be &quot;sweated&quot;.
B. The only animals producing a glucose solution use a modified digestive system, because making a flowing glucose liquid is a fight against osmotic pressure. As is storing it. And keeping it bacteria free isn't easy either. And there is no easy way of fixing that since you need your cells to be able to absorb glucose (or they would starve!). Milkproducing cells on the other hand don't have to be more advanced than sweat producing cells or other glands that exist in the skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it also be that it’s used <em>because</em> it can’t be consumed by the mother’s cells directly, thus making storing and secreting it easier?</p></div>		</li>
