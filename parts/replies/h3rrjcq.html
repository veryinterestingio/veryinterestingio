			<div class="markdown"><p>The general area supplied by each nerve remains the same, so the nerves also tend to look almost exactly identical. There are however a couple of exceptions. </p>
<p>For instance, the sciatic nerve in your leg passes through a hole in your pelvis and splits into two nerves (tibial and common fibular) as it descends down your leg all the way into your foot. Now this splitting could either happen as it leaves the pelvis, or at the space behind your knee, but it really doesn't make a difference since it only starts to work below your knee and doesn't innervate your thigh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sensory territories of both of these nerves are below the knee but the tibial nerve does innervate the posterior thigh, providing motor innervation to the hamstrings.  </p>
<p>The reason this splitting location doesn't matter is because the common fibular and tibial nerves are always independent in their function even when wrapped together and appearing as one. The sciatic nerve isn't a traditional nerve at all, it's just the name given to these nerves as they travel together to leave the pelvis. It's much like the cords of the brachial plexus in that sense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For most folks, yes, but it certainly does for me. When I'm doing a regional anaesthetic and am blocking a nerve for surgery, it makes it a much bigger faff if the sciatic bifurcates somewhere stupidly high. Having to do a peripheral limb block as a sciatic nerve block instead is a (pun intended) utter pain in the arse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are variations sometimes there too. I got stumped in a gross anatomy practical because I like working acronyms backwards and the cadaver had extra branch next to the tagged musculocutaneous nerve. </p>
<p>One of the first things they point out in gross anatomy is how unique people are relative to the textbook. One cadaver had his pec insert all the way down by his elbow instead of at the head of the humerus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of my favourite scans we do at work are contrast MRIs looking for problems with circulation. Had this guy come in, two femoral arteries until about 1/3 of the way down his thigh then they just completely stopped and a bunch a smaller vessels had formed to get around the blockage. Angiogenesis is really cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wanted to see my scan (not that I'd know what I'm looking at probably).  I was born with some sort of anomaly with my IVC.  They said it doesn't appear on normal scans and looks collapsed or something. I've heard some surgeons refer to it as occlusion of the IVC.  They way it was described to me is that I'm missing a big pipe and that a little vein created a sort of bypass.  My circulation is terrible and I've had several DVTs.  It would be neat though to be able to see and understand my test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is. I had coronary bypass in January, and they harvested my saphenous vein from just below my knee to just above the ankle to make the bypass grafts. When I woke up in recovery my entire leg was dark purple and swollen to twice its normal size. Swelling went down in about a week, bruising took a month or so, but I still get bouts of edema below the knee. My surgeon told me it would take about a year for the leg to sufficiently revascularize, so my life is one of compression stockings, frequent walks and elevating my leg when I sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm one of those people with absurdly bizarre venal structure.  I won't go into it but am the subject of a published report decades ago (wish I actually had the report now). I also grow collateral circulation amazingly fast. In fact, that's the reason I'm alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean it depends on the scale. The closer you get to capillaries the more random stuff gets.</p>
<p>It's basically like two specimens of the same tree: they'll all have the same trunk, then the larger branches mostly in the same places and then the variation stack up so you could take a single small branch to identify an individual tree.</p></div>		</li>
