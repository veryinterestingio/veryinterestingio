<p>Edit: I deeply regret making this comment. The level of idiocy and the volume of replies... Like all these Reddit economists think they have something to contribute by explicating one element already implied in my comment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And <em>that</em> is precisely the broken windows fallacy being discussed. We've gone from lots of skilled, highly-paid jobs in manufacturing, gutted those good jobs and replaced them with unskilled, lower-paid service jobs, now we're gutting even those service jobs for even lower-paid on-call jobs with fewer benefits, no minimum hours and no security.</p>
<p>The post-War boom didn't just see the economy boom, it saw <em>people's lives change for the better</em> as they got good jobs, bought their own homes, and moved up into the middle class. Now the economy booms, but only the 1% at the top see any benefit. Everyone else is treading water.</p>
<p>It used to be that the poor were under- or unemployed. Now (especially in the USA) the poor are typically working two, three or four jobs and still going backwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my store has people walk around those self-check-out registers and make you feel like you’re up to something when you’re not, and then they have to disappear when the machine needs help.  I don’t know where they find these skilled workers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s cute you think they hire new people to do that or give extra hours to do that. No, they just add that on to the people still there’s responsibility. When my store added online pickup there was no increase in hours, just a new thing for us to do as well as everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with automating existing jobs is that the gains from the automation are quite concentrated and not likely to be redistributed. It just creates a one-way upward flow of wealth. Value is added, sure, but not for the cashiers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the major issue with free market economics (IMHO). If your only goal is to see the total amount of wealth increase no matter what then an unregulated free market is going to do that job (at least in the short term); free markets are great at generating wealth. The problem is that free markets are terrible at a lot of other stuff that's really important like equitably distributing wealth, sustainably using resources, not treating employees like crap, not destroying the environment, etc..</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure why, but it made me think about the economic impact of fast food vs healthcare, and why spending money on healthcare only helps create value in the long term if it’s preventative, like vaccines or healthy living, as opposed to reactively dealing with the consequences of sickness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm inclined to agree. But because I  have the brain of a former debate teacher, my first thought on reading this was, where do we draw the line? Should it just be free or should it be compulsory, for the good of the wider society?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It doesn't reduce the cost of care during ER visits or institutionalization.  It just reduced the chance of needing it in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not correct. People get sick, people have injuries. If you don't deal with the consequences, you have to pay the opportunity cost of previously healthy people no longer being healthy.</p>
<p>All else being equal, prevention is better than cure. But cure still creates value in the long-run, since those people you cured can return to being productive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mm it depends. Most ‘healthcare’ doesn’t offer a cure, but a chronic therapy. And many of the people receiving it are no longer productive to society (retired). There’s also some statistic (too tired to find it) about the proportion of lifetime healthcare spend that is spent in the last year of people’s lives - on average it’s extremely high. </p>
<p>So when it comes to say, fixing a broken bone in a healthy working person - kind of like the broken windows fallacy, it wouldn’t do to go around breaking people’s bones simply to fix them, but I agree there’s the added dimension of the opportunity cost of that broken boned person not being able to carry out their work (assuming they can’t work with a broken bone), but in most cases i think it’s a lot more nuanced and complicated, especially when it comes to whether value is created as a result of the healthcare intervention. </p></div>		</li>
