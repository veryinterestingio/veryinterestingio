			<div class="markdown"><p>Even now, the vast majority of people in India grow up barefoot and so are very used to walking on rough surfaces all through their lives.  And sitting cross legged on hard stone.</p>
<p>Fun fact: one holy mountain in Tamil Nadu, Arunachala, can have millions of people walk around it (15km) barefoot every full moon.  It's more auspicious to do it barefoot. While the majority do it in the evening, some are fine walking in the heat of the 40C sun on dark concrete roads. My feet would get burned within 5 seconds of contact, but theirs were fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I lived in Arizona, I rarely wore shoes. We were going boating once, so I jumped out of the truck to help guide the boat into the water. My friend's brother, from Ohio, also barefoot, saw me and jumped out to help as well. Never made it out on the boat that day... had to divert to the hospital for the burns on his feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to college with &quot;barefoot boy.&quot; He only wore shoes when required. It was not entirely uncommon to see him hold the flame from a lighter up to the sole of his foot at parties and be amused/win bets against the &quot;I'm big and tough,  it won't hurt me!&quot; crowd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s similar to how we used to chew much more (soft/processes foods weren’t a thing even 200 years ago) and over the course of your youth, our jaws would grow more muscle and grow larger to accommodate our wisdom teeth. Now, those muscles mostly remain unused and our jaws are smaller, so we have to have our wisdom teeth removed.</p></div>		</li>
