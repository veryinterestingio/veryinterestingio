			<div class="markdown"><p>Why? Its a highly engineered system built with a high safety factor that has successful operated thousands and thousands of times before you walked upto it.  Its also not a &quot;Wear part&quot; so should continue to work for a very long time  afterwards too.  </p>
<p>Though as another poster said, don't google ski lift brake failures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah rollback is a scary thing. They made us watch a video of it happening before we worked on the lifts and it scared the shit out of us. I always tell people if you're on a chairlift and it starts going backwards, jump off. Broken legs are preferable to what happens at the bottom</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. People always worry about the shit that’s not likely to break lol. Flying, skii lifts and elevators. What they should really be worried about is the tires and suspension on their car lol. Far more likely to go wrong and fuck you up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a ski lift tech but a nerd.. can't speak as to all detachable lifts but Doppelmayr (i think) has a setup with an RFID tag on each cable grip, and grip force is logged on each attach/detach as well as number of cycles. Supposedly will ID weak/failing grips before they're shot.</p></div>		</li>
