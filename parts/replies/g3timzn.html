<p>Isn't this where the time dilation aspect of near speed of light travel comes into play? So, while you might see the other object pass next to two different objects of known distance apart, your perception of the time between the two passage events would be distorted ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to time dilation, there is also length contraction, whereby the space in which you travel contracts in the direction of travel, as your velocity increases.</p>
<p><del>This is incorrect,</del> as /u/ExFavillaResurgemos pointed out. The length of object moving contracts from other POVs.</p>
<p>EDIT: Undergrad was a long time ago, but apparently we were both right. So I guess I feel better about my memory and intuition</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm having some trouble grasping a part if this. If part of the equation is distance/time and the objects were traveling at the speed of light, then time would be zero? How do you handle division by zero here? Or does it only matter if mass is involved?</p>
<p>Edit: i see that in the relative equation if both objects are traveling at the speed of light away from eachother that their relative speed from eachother is the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's this video, that explains this with some nice visuals. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/R5oCXHWEL9A" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/R5oCXHWEL9A</a></p>
<p>However, as this clearly shows that you are talking about adding velocities traveling in the same direction, I'm not sure if this is the correct answer for velocities traveling in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Edit. I think the better explanation would be using the  Doppler Effect and wave compression. I'll look for a video later (at work). Imagine the sound two cars make travelling towards each other, it's much higher in pitch to each other than to the observer. This is where the above formula would come in. At the same time You should be able to use landmarks in space to determine velocity. For this I believe you would be able to determine individual velocities, and the gap would shrink at or above the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's the same. Velocity is a vector, so in the case of all but exactly opposite directions some trig needs to be used.</p></div>		</li>
