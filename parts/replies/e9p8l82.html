			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! It is very interesting. I want though first wiki link and it seems deceptively 'simple' - and that probably means that I'm not understanding it at all. Will do further reading!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It turns out that the hard part of optical quantum computing is really simple--you need to make the photons, manipulate them, and detect them with at least 2/3 probability.  We can't really do that: if you multiply the world records together the number isn't good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic theory is relatively simple. However, experimentally it can be quite a challenge. In order to get photon interactions, they need to be &quot;indistinguishable&quot; in a beam splitter.</p>
<p>They're also very good for long distances (its very hard to store a photon), but they can quickly become absorbed so aren't too reliable. Also, generating single photons is a probabilistic approach - very difficult to get one whenever you want one.</p>
<p>This is quite a basic explanation of it, and many people are working on fixing these problems, which I'm not too up to date on.</p>
<p>Hope this helps a bit!</p></div>		</li>
