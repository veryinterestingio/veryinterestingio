			<div class="markdown"><p>The earthquake didn't harm the Fukushima reactors at all. They shut down safely without damage of any kind. The problem was they put their backup generators on low ground behind inadequate seawalls, and the tsunami knocked out all their backup power. The reactors were designed and maintained just fine, but they skimped on the seawalls.</p>
<p>The current generation of reactors would survive even that event without issue as well since they are designed with gravity fed water, i.e. they don't need backup power for several days after an event to safely cool the reactors.</p>
<p>I know that the Fukushima reactors got all the press at the time, but they were really a trivial problem compared to all the damage caused by that earthquake and the accompanying tsunamis. Almost 16k people died and whole towns were wiped out. The Fukushima meltdown didn't (directly) kill a single person. Most of the harm to people was related to the evacuation.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No it doesn't. Reactors across Japan have lived through decades of earthquakes.</p>
<p>Fukushima is what happens when you have an earthquake that triggers a tsunami large enough to breach your anti-tsunami berms, and inundate the (ground level) emergency generators for pumping coolant.</p>
<p>That sentence alone demonstrates why it was absolutely insane for Germany to wholesale close their nuclear plants and go back to coal (and import... umm... nuclear-generated electricity from France).</p>
<p>Corner cutting and pushing back closure dates on reactors seems to be a problem globally - in the US and at TEPCO.</p>
<p>The simple fact is however that nuclear overall however is extremely safe. Of the top four worst global atomic energy incidents only one resulted in an open release of fuel materials - and it was the one with the known-flawed design (which had been suppressed by the KGB) and no primary containment vessel.</p>
<p>Fukushima had a meltdown, no loss of fuel material. 3-Mile Island was the same.</p>
<p>The total health impacts from those incidents are less pervasive than that of PFOA/PFOS dumping by DuPont (and others), or of the Bhopal disaster which directly poisoned half-a-million people.</p>
<p>It's weird how people (and the press) seem to treat civil nuclear so differently to other (objectively more serious) industrial accidents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s why facilities should fight for hard-ass safety operators. My late uncle was one, and I’ve got some second hand stories about him from other people who worked at the plant with him. Apparently the guy who lost his one leg to cancer from exposure to radiation materials gets listened to on health and safety matters. Period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, at least one major disaster (Three Mile Island) occurred because the operators thought they knew better, and could stop the mess.</p>
<p>Of course, even then the total amount of radiation released was not a big deal and there were no deaths or even health effects.  Even long term effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were very large long-term effects on nuclear power, though. Which sort of sucks, because nuclear power is low carbon. And there are reactor designs that are incapable of going <del>critical</del> <em>into thermal runaway</em>. But because of things like TMI and Chernobyl and Fukashima, nuclear power is getting decommissioned all over the place.</p>
<p>EDIT because I said the wrong technical term. Thanks /u/CommondeNominator for fixing my error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This really is one of the most unfortunate side effects of TMI. I took a course during my physics undergrad on nuclear fusion and nuclear power in general, and the first few weeks of it were essentially just outlining what went wrong during TMI, Fukushima, and chernobyl, and how with modern nuclear power plants that really should never happen again. It's unfortunate that nuclear power has this negative stigma attached to it nowadays even though it really is safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw this TED Talk (real academic, I know) where this guy made a good point that, although the potential for catastrophe is there, it’s really no different than — and in some cases might be preferable to — the damage which greenhouse gases do. It’s just that it happens much more quickly and conspicuously than fossil fuels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fukushima was so unfortunate in its timing. It really did feel like nuclear was picking up support around that time and it all evaporated because of an ancient reactor used past its prime due to regulations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you go back and read the history of nuclear accidents the vast majority of them were caused or at least exasperated by the human operators ignoring or overriding the safety controls thinking they knew better. Fukushima doesn't really count into that mostly because it was triggered from a tsunami. But Chernobyl would have been prevented had they not recklessly discarded all of the safety systems and safety guidance to hurry up and get the test done. Same with a lot of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fukushima absolutely counts, because the people who built the plant disregarded all the safety information that they were given about what would be required to build a plant in an earthquake and tsunami zone. It had in the original plans, multiple fail safes to prevent exactly what happened from happening, but they were ignored when the reactor was actually constructed in an efforts to save costs, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the Majority of nuclear incidents occur because of either misunderstanding of testing instructions and poor testing conditions (Chernobyl), operator error/manual bypass of criticality controls (including incidents in nuclear fuel/weapons processing facilities) and the last most rare form of nuclear incident : unprecedented/unforeseen circumstances (read Fukashima) HOWEVER the severity of the first and last category can be dramatically reduced with existing reactor technology, the most commonly used reactors are LWR class reactors, light water reactors, where the pressure is multiple atmospheres in order for them to function, which adds to the potential explosion risk, an alternative class is MSR, molten salt reactors. these reactors use a molten liquid salt capable of absorbing different radioactive elements, or that are radioactive on their own. they can be set up so they only need to have their fuel reprocessed every 30 years, which means little to no waste for 30 years, and the fuel can then be reprocessed to continue to work while pulling some of the heavier elements out. there are also configurations that do not produce weapons grade radioactive elements, and the best part is they work near atmospheric pressure, so the risk of explosion is fairly mitigated. what happened with Fukashima was an absolutely insane series of events. the earthquake removed power and damaged the reactor, and the tsunami wiped out any chance for damage control. The fact that the operators were able to do everything they did, and that they were able to reduce the scale of the disaster in the first place is absolutely astonishing. also, we talk about Chernobyl as if the disaster was the end of the facility, however the site continued to operate December 15th 2000, with staff and operators working in the facility around the clock. reactor 1 had a partial meltdown before the reactor 4 explosion, reactor 2 had a turbine fire and was shutdown due to political climate, and reactor 3 was the last to be decommissioned with zero incidents. every single incident was either operator error, or in the case of the partial meltdown,  the reactor was damaged, and not noticed, which lead to partial meltdown. All of which could be avoided, including the reactor 4 explosion which was caused by poor testing conditions and poor understanding of the test, and from what I've seen from first hand operator accounts they were too afraid to admit they didn't know what they were doing because they didn't want Moscow to bear down on them.</p></div>		</li>
