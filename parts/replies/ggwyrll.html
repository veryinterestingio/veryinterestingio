			<div class="markdown"><p>To support this with real-world data: in the New Zealand Mandatory Isolation &amp; Quarantine system, a new arrival must undertake two PCR tests, one at day 3 of their stay, the other at day 11. They must pass (negative) both (and show no symptoms) to be released into the community on day 14. </p>
<p>As a result there are no known community cases of COVID-19 in New Zealand and there hasn't been one in months, so the 8-day double-test regime seems to work successfully.</p></div>		</li>
