			<div class="markdown"><p>Food/ingredients are the biggest cost, about 35% of revenue. Wages are like 20%. Rent should be under 10% unless you have low revenue and/or are in a city where rents are high. This is for a normal sit down restaurant. Fast food and buffets will be slightly different</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a dumb question but what about credit card processing fees? On average cc fees are around 2%-3% per transaction. So if a restaurant does $1M in credit cards annually, that's $20K they're paying in fees each year. That's probably up there with rent and wages, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have only 10 employees and pay them only 1000 dollars a months, that's 10,000 dollars a month, and both are low figures. Rent seems like it would be significantly less than wages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waitresses are being paid like 2.17 an hour where I live. And they likely work part time. You are likely paying like $9-10/hr on average for your wait staff for the day. Another 7.25/hr or w/e min wage is  for your dishwasher and maybe 45-80/hr for your cooks (buffet). So if your operating hours (simplifying this as cooks may get in earlier to prep the kitchen or something) are from like 10am to 10pm (12 hours) you have about 1200 a day tops but likely closer to 720 a day in wages. So you are really looking at about 20-30k a month in wages for an average size buffet place. Rent on a place big enough for a buffet around here could be upwards of 3-4k a month. </p>
<p>I have no idea how cheap the food can get because I am researched out, but I imagine it is the cheapest stuff possible based on what I have eaten. If I had to guess I'd say about 1-5k a day is spent on ingredients depending on what day of the week it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Food is typically about 25% of revenue. If you run the rest of your restaurant efficiently you can let it go up to 33% and still breakeven</p></div>		</li>
