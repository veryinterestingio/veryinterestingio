			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall from my physics courses (it’s been a while, mind you), a lot of the equations involving magnetism are quite similar to gravitational equations (when figuring out force over a distance, one uses inverse cube law, the other uses an inverse square law, for example).</p>
<p>But, basically, Gravity distorts space-time, but magnetism is really a distortion of a different kind of “field.” </p>
<p>It’s not a perfect analogy between the two because, if you’re thinking in terms of a field, electromagnetism has positive and negative aspects which distort this field in opposite ways, but Gravity does not, at least using general relativity <em>I don’t think</em> “anti-gravity” is possible.</p>
<p>Also, there are basic things in electromagnetism like dipoles which don’t I don’t think have any sort of analog in GR. I hope that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might want to look into the Kaluza-Klien theory.   The tldr is that even though there are positive and negative charges, for some simple theories, you can actually model electrodynamics as a strictly gravitational interaction.  </p>
<p>In KK there is a fifth dimension which is curled up and particles can have momentum in this direction.   Even though particles still follow geodesics (strait lines), the motion in the 5th dimension causes then to move like they are being effected by the electromagnetic force.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't actually work to describe our universe (the particle mass predictions are way off), but it is an interesting example to show how similar em and gravity can be.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you.  For this response.  It kind of clears things up for me.  Keep in mind that I design and install video surveillance systems and have no formal training in any of this.</p>
<p>You say that GR is incomplete.  What are the limitations.  Newton's gravity couldn't for example explain the procession of Mercury so it was obviously missing something.  </p>
<p>As far as gravity being a real/true force I still have issue with this.  Like you (and Einstein) said gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration.  So to me it's emergent in the same way centrifugal force is.  </p>
<p>Do we have any idea what energy level should produce a graviton? 10^19 Tev?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic problem for general relativity is in describing the gravitational behavior of fundamental particles. An electron, which is a point particle, would have an infinite density, and therefore, create an itty bitty event horizon around it. So, we don't really know what that would lead to, or how to explain it, especially given the way quantum mechanics predicts particles behave on that scale.</p>
<p>Separately, though, the issue is that the determination that gravity is an emergent property of curved space time only kicks the problem back another level. We know mass-energy curves spacetime, but how is that information carried? </p>
<p>We know the relevant background parts that create centrifugal forces, a more fundamental understanding of gravity would, in the analogy, explain why the bucket on a string is spinning at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple questions, my knowledge on these topics is limited to fundamentals. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>An electron, which is a point particle, would have an infinite density </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? How does general relativity suggest that an electron should have infinite density?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We know mass-energy curves spacetime, but how is that information carried? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would information have to be carried if gravity is not viewed as a fundamental force? I know this would violate the speed of causality but have we performed any conclusive tests to be sure that gravitational affects travel at C? I mean if a graviton particle exists that means anything with mass is emitting gravitons in proportion to its size which travel at C and somehow cause everything they contact with to accelerate towards the source of the emission? It's just so strange to think of it that way. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You say that GR is incomplete. What are the limitations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so as other people have said, one area where we run into the limitations of General Relativity is with black holes. One specific limitation of GR manifests in what is know as Hawking radiation:</p>
<p>So from general relativity, we know that black holes are infinitely deep gravitational wells in space-time. The event horizon occurs at the point where the curvature is too steep for light to escape. However, we are pretty sure that black holes actually shrink over time, which means that energy does indeed escape from them. This escaping energy is called Hawking radiation and since it is impossible for anything to move faster than speed of light, there must be some other way for this radiation to escape the event horizon. The answer seems to be be that gravity, and thus the edge of the event horizon, undergoes some sort of quantum fluctuations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hawking Radiation is just a theory right? Black holes themselves are entirely theoretical as I understand. Have we even observed anything being affected by a black hole (expect for the large scale effects from the galactic core hole)? The boundary of an event horizon could potentially be very different from our current understanding of physics, right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible that so-called Hawking Radiation is simply &quot;radiated&quot; gravitational space-time stretching energy?</p>
<p>Edit: there are no truly stationary or non-rotating black holes, so the energy is &quot;dissipated&quot; by the influence on surrounding objects, causing the black hole to shrink. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_gravity" target="_blank">if gravitons are massive at all</a>, the analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave" target="_blank">gravitational waves</a> yielded a new upper bound on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass" target="_blank">mass</a> of gravitons.

<p>AFAIK the problem with studying gravitons is that gravity is super super weak compared to every other force so we have to have very high energies to see the particles which we can't get in current (or any near future) particle accelerators.</p></div>		</li>
