			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah and here I thought this was one of those dumb questions that I should <em>really</em> be able to answer myself.....but I was sore today from a run yesterday and rather than just accepting it decided I'd see if reddit had better answer than the first page of the Google machine-- had no idea this was still such a mystery!</p>
<p>EDIT: hey my first award! Thank you so much-- I love that my first post here ended up being so complex. Perfect place for it :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn’t as much a mystery as the previous comment implies.  As they stated, we know there are many factors that play into DOMS (the inflammatory response alone involves a ton of stuff), but we may not know EXACTLY which one, if any are dominant in the process, of causing the soreness. Some others have mentions micro z-line tears which I don’t remember reading in my undergrad so that stuff could be newer research. Tissue damage is usually the acceptable broad answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it possibly just be one of those things your brain does on autopilot? Like the first time it doesn’t know why you’re stretching and tearing your muscles so it sends out pain signals. But if you repeatedly do it your brain isn’t concerned so doesn’t send the same signals?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right! This question came up multiple times over quarentine with people trying out new workouts/being inconsistent with exercise. I kept getting these weird conflicting answers with holes in them, so I was like &quot;to reddit we go!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could this also be related to exhaustion due to working out?  I’m really out of shape and trying to get back into shape.  It’s weird because exercise can give me an initial boost of energy but I’ve found that two days later I’m dead tired...like I’m so tired I have to nap in the middle of the day...</p></div>		</li>

But I’ve been thinking all day “why am I soooo tired, I mean KILLER tired”. Well that’s embarrassingly obvious!</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Just a reminder that you don't have to go all-out at once. You just have to do better than yesterday. If yesterday was nothing, then <em>something</em> today is better.</p>
<p>Don't be ashamed to start with partial or half assed work outs and work up to a full workout over the course of a week or two. Your body has a lot of adjusting to do going from zero.</p>
<p>Also, the reason for your exhaustion could be your diet. Working out and diet go hand in hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ive been on and off exercising a lot in my life.</p>
<p>if i dont exercise regularly i have trouble getting to sleep and regularly only get 6 hours of sleep. if im exercising regularly ill be able to get to sleep and get about 7-8. </p>
<p>so if you're keeping your sleep the same, but adding in exercise... feeling dead tired and needing a nap will happen. </p>
<p>so once you get the sleep in line and regular exercise youll have about 80% of that initial energy boost all the time, without the dead tired.</p></div>		</li>
