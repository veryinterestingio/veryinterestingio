<p>The disease that causes cavities is called caries. Caries is a diet-mediated disease where bacteria in the oral cavity consume fermentable carbohydrates and in turn produce acid that demineralizes the tooth. Once enough minerals are removed, the collagen matrix that suspended those minerals breaks down leaving a cavity.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the frequency of simple carbohydrate intake is much more important than the amount of sugar in the food/drink. For example if you chug a glass of juice, drink water the rest of the day, and brush your teeth to remove the sticky plaque formed, you'd get few cavities. If you took the same cup of juice and took a sip throughout the day, you'd have severe tooth decay after several years.</p>
<p>In the past, refined carbohydrates were not consumed as often. One of the biggest factors in tooth decay is routine consumption of sugary drinks which wasn't a common thing in the past. </p>
<p>That does not mean people never developed dental problems. They did, and the pain was excruciating. Without antibiotics the teeth in the upper jaw can transmit bacteria into a system of veins that feed directly into the brain, and this meant death. Caries was a somewhat common cause of death. Without anesthetic some chose to commit suicide rather than undergo surgeries.</p>
<p>But, there was a developing field of dentistry that was slowly emerging. At least five thousand years ago, the Egyptians discovered that the oil of cloves (eugenol) was palliative to the nerve within the tooth. Eugenol is still utilized to this day. The Etruscans of Italy were famous for crude dental prostheses where they would put lost teeth back in with gold bands and wires. Several civilizations utilized sticks they would chew until they were frayed like a brush and others made brushes of coarse animal hair like the hairs from boars. Eventually anesthetic was developed called cocaine! It was a hell of a drug, and it ironically started the path towards legitimizing dentistry as not a barbaric practice, but rather a field of medicine. Around the late 1960s there was a transition in philosophy to preventative dentistry. It was previously considered a normal part of life to lose one's teeth and get dentures. Denture ads were even targeted towards relatively young women. With preventative dentistry a new paradigm presented that one could keep a full dentition even in to late age by performing proper home oral hygiene, mediating sugar in the diet, and maintaining issues early with dental medicine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uugggghhhh. I prefer to snack throughout the day rather than eat the standard 3x weighty meals, so when my dentist said to me &quot;do you snack a lot?&quot; and explained why, I was gutted. My method of keeping weight off was ruining my teeth haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can still snack throughout the day, but the snacks should not contain fermentable carbohydrate (simple sugars). Fatty foods without sugar do not cause cavities, and may actually inhibit them. Cheese, almonds, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately fats contain ~9 calories (kcal) per gram where as protein and carbs have around ~4 calories per gram.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is true, their diets still put a lot of mechanical stress on their teeth from consuming hard and abrasive foods. A lot of ancient teeth are ground flat, sometimes to the point nerves are exposed even without much decay.</p></div>		</li>
