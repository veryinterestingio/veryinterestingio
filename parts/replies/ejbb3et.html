<p>&quot;Most worryingly, studies have shown that continuous eye rubbing in susceptible individuals can also lead to thinning of the cornea, which is weakened and pushes forward to become more conical. This is known as keratoconus, and is a serious condition that can lead to distorted vision and ultimately the need for a corneal graft.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have kerato conus. You guys can chill out, a lot of these comments are misleading. Yes you can get permanent eye damage by rubbing your eyes, but only certain people are susceptible; These people usually have a relative that has it, skin conditions (such as eczema) and allergies.  Contacts are available that create a layer of tears and kind of fills the cornea thin spots. Cornea grafts are almost always unnecessary as they often don't work very well and take a long recovery time. Kerato conus can be treated with a crosslinking 'surgery' where riboflavin and uv light are used to essentially age the cornea making the stronger.  Kerato conus effects me mostly in my right eye where i can't read anything further than 10 cms away without squinting. Luckily my left eye is 20/20 and so is my right eye (with contacts).  Just don't rub your eyes guys.  </p></div>		</li>
