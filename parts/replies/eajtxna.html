			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several statements here that are not correct. For one, the current proper distance to the boundary of the OU is about 43 Gly, not 13 Gly. Also, light emitted right now from galaxies that far away will <em>never</em> reach us. Not in 35 Gly, but <em>never</em>. Any light emitted right now from beyond about 15 Gly will never reach us, in fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For 2 reasons generally;</p>
<p>1) we are moving away from most of that light. </p>
<p>2) The space in the universe is stretching. Meaning, not only are we generally moving away from all that light, but the distance between us will only increase even move than by just the speed of our travel.</p>
<p>As the previous redditor said</p>
<p><em>Imagine an ant crawling over the surface of a balloon: if you start blowing the balloon up, the ant will end up further from where it started even though the speed at which it can walk hasn't changed.</em></p>
<p>So, imagine the space AND distance between the 'ants' destination are both increasing, and in the 15billion years it will take to even reach where we are 'now', 'this point' and us, would be much rather away from 'this' point than you initially thought because the space itself is stretching.</p></div>		</li>
