			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is why piracy is so unbelievably common. These things may have been bad for business twenty years ago, but what is bad for business now is allowing any of these issues to become a barrier between consumers and a cheap, simple distribution method. Otherwise, there is a FREE simple distribution method about 45 minutes after the content launches in ANY region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially this.</p>
<p>It's not just regions, it's the fact content distributors refuse to evolve beyond business models built around the sale of physical media.</p>
<p>Creating content has a cost, as does distributing that content as part of a physical product.</p>
<p>The realities of digital distribution are very different: You don't need expensive facilities for pressing disks and making packaging; instead you need server farms. You don't need to maintain inventory at warehouses all over the place, and you don't need to ship physical media around; instead, you have to pay for bandwidth and maintain a website.</p>
<p>Sure, it is still expensive, but it's a lot easier for someone like Netflix to optimize their back end to minimize costs than it would be for an old school distributor.</p>
<p>Additionally, as a service you can actually make more in the long run by keeping your month service fees low: Netflix can be a lot like a gym membership.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of what you're saying is true - in terms of fact and reasoning. </p>
<p>It is, however, still bullshit. It's the primary reason that netflix has essentially given up trying to license popular content and poured nearly every dime they can into original content that doesn't have this baggage. </p>
<p>This antiquated way of dealing with distribution was established at the dawn of mass media when movies were physical things that went to new cities when they finished their run in the bigger city, and when television stattions were limited to a geographic area. It is in desperate need for complete disruption, not simple adaptation. </p></div>		</li>
