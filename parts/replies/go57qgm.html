			<div class="markdown"><p>They could have known from other fermented things that they can change colors, so they figured they would try fermenting snails.</p>
<p>Not everything was discovered by accident, usually it's people trying stuff just for the sake of seeing what happens. Kinda like a child pushing food off the table to see what will happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The local &quot;weirdo&quot; (nowadays called a scientist) would have a secret wine cellar with jars and jars of different substances with all different things in them and write down what happened to them and sell the knowledge to the king probably idk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a blue pigment that was extracted from lapis lazuli. It was a very expensive process. First the stone had to be ground to a fine powder, then that powder was mixed with a special mixture of rosin and wax and then kneaded by hand under water for hours, until the pigment separated from the stone matrix.</p>
<p>There are artisans that still do this today, the smallest tube of that paint costs something in the hundreds of dollars range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall codre, that particular lazuli blue was great for painting frescos, but doesn't really bind into fabric fibers very well. But yeah, that's going to be even more expensive than crushed indigo leaves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In many frescos the blue colored areas are largely worn away, faded or completely gone. Other pigments in fresco are drawn into the plaster as part of the drying process. Lapis was too expensive to use in amounts for this, so the blue parts were allowed to dry white, and the lapis pigment was brushed on as a light paint.</p>
<p>The blue areas of many frescos don't endure because those areas aren't true fresco</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, even today, as an artist I prefer to buy my purple than mix it. Even if you get the right red and blue, mixing it yourself as a young artist just results in a lot of wastage if you’re trying for a true purple because it’s so easy to go too warm or too cool.</p></div>		</li>
