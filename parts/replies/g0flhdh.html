			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends on the species. At MPG Ranch, invasive plants grab our attention most. When possible, we use multiple approaches. For leafy spurge, the flea beetles (biocontrol) chow the plants hard. When we spray their remaining leaf tissue with herbicide, the spurge gets hammered. It might take multiple years to completely tackle an infestation, but it works.</p>
<p>We also use biocontrol for spotted knapweed. The root weevils bore tunnels in the roots and weaken the weeds. In some patches, we've weed-whacked the plants before they seed. After a while, we've gotten ahead of the invaders.</p>
<p>Some biocontrol species can definitely get out of control, but I don't know of any in Montana that did.</p></div>		</li>
