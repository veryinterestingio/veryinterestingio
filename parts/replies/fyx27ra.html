			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that excess deaths can likely be attributed to Covid-19 (even if they are only indirectly linked).  But it's a bit more complicated than just taking the difference between deaths this year and in a normal year.  That's because the pandemic has reduced rates of some kinds of deaths compared to a normal year, e.g. automobile accidents and influenza (since so many people were staying home and social distancing).  And you would like to be able to distinguish between deaths directly caused by Covid-19 and indirectly, e.g. people who avoided treatment out of pandemic fear and then died of something that otherwise would not have killed them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not “likely” excess deaths attributable to Covid. Without question, if you peruse the research reports.</p>
<p>If the pandemic has reduced deaths from some causes, and there is a clear spike in overall excess deaths, which is indisputable, then that’s even greater proof of the fatal toll from Covid.</p>
<p>People who feared infection and didn’t seek medical care? Those are Covid deaths too. Most of those people are at high risk of Covid death. It’s hard to blame then from shying away from hospitals.</p>
<p>If we just opened everything up willy-nilly, I don’t think you’d be ok with the level of death. You don’t need to believe that if you don’t want to. I’m just sayin’.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily. The pandemic has also increased deaths from a lot other causes, as well. You can't just assume all those things cancel each other out, and chalk up the excess to covid. Suicides are way up, as are shootings and thus, murder. </p>

<p>No, they aren't, nor are the people who increased suicides. Sure, you can't blame them for staying away from hospitals, but they aren't &quot;covid deaths&quot; if covid didn't kill them.</p>

<p>No one said we should do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a very interesting metric that I'm sure will be used in a bunch of retrospective studies. But it has the same problem as deaths in that it lags current events by about a month. </p>
<p>Additionally it's hard to differentiate from direct covid deaths and deaths from the increased stress in the general population and hospital avoidance, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that differentiation particularly important? What’s important is the number of deaths attributable to Covid. The ones you mentioned count.</p>
<p>I don’t subscribe to the idea that we’d be better off opening everything up because it would save the economy and we’d have fewer of those stress-related mortalities. </p>
<p>It is clear to me that the economy will never get well until the virus is under control. You can open up whatever you want - sporting events, concerts, whatever, but they won’t be successful unless people feel safe. If the baseball games could be attended, how much attendance do you think there would be? It’d be abysmal.</p>
<p>I’ve actually started going back to indoor dining. I feel safe, because very few people are there. If restaurants were jammed with people, you couldn’t get me to go in there at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I’m 63 and around 25 pounds overweight. I’m at risk.</p>
<p>Edit: for Geographical context, I live on Long Island.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where can we view this information? And how can we trust the reliability? </p>
<p>One of the ancedotes that a lot of the patients (neurology) are giving in the hick-ass town I live in is that the numbers are hyper inflated by the democrats. As a scribe, I can’t give me two cents but I can definitely push them the right way!</p></div>		</li>
