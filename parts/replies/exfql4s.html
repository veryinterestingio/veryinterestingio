			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate I've seen in this thread. My husband used to work at a peanut shelling and grading facility and he'd talk about peanuts like Bubba on Forest Gump talked about shrimp sometimes. They have various sizes of grates that they get passed through in this big thing called a shaker, which does exactly what it says. The shells get shaken around and rubbed off (sort of how if you put garlic in a jar and shake it) and then they later get passed through a sorting grate that only lets peanuts of a certain size through and it keeps getting smaller until you get to the peanut crumblies at the bottom, which typically get used for being turned into oil or being fed to livestock. Not all nuts get through the process without being broken, as a lot of nuts are just broken before they even get peeled and some get broken in the process, but that's why they're graded from everything from A stock to B stock to all the way down to Oil stock.</p></div>		</li>
