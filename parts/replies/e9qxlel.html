			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, glass is probably the most underrated material we have found (as far as naming an &quot;age&quot;of it). Very sturdy, virtually hermetically sealed (as opposed to many ceramics and even metals which can diffuse stuff out over time), resistant to a very wide range of chemical substances like acidic basic organic highly tonic etc., transparent, optically active if you change the shape. It's a crazy good material when you think about the many uses for it and imo is right up there with iron or coal in terms of how greatly it impacted humanity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but rudimentary metallurgy is much more simple than the sort of processes needed for any sort of advanced electronics. All you really need is enough heat to melt your ores/metals, something to melt them in that will not melt itself, and a way to measure how much of a given metal you're using to ensure you get the proportions right, all of which can be achieved with fire, clay, and rock if you're patient enough.</p>
<p>Conversely, the sort of chemistry needed to make transistors and the like would require both specialised glassware to store and manipulate various chemicals (particularly acids and solvents) and precise lenses to actually see what you're doing, both of which require comparatively modern glass production and manipulation techniques. You could, in theory, make a computer without either, but the parts would have to be so large that the project would be wildly impractical.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There have been a number of youtubers engaging in basic metallurgy and glassmaking, like Cody's Lab and How To Make Everything.</p>
<p>They attempt it from scratch, and suffice to say throughout all of the examples on Youtube, taking ore to metal is substantially and incredibly easier than producing glass, to the extent that almost anyone who does these videos can take ore to a mostly pure metal, and none of them can reliably achieve clear glass. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also radiation. If there was a previous civilization that reached our tech level then we would be able to detect trace amounts of radiation from nuclear testing. Sites like Chernobyl or nuclear test sites would also be obvious for a very very long time even if they weren't dangerous anymore. The lack of any such evidence means if there was an ancient advanced civ then they definitely did not master nuclear fission. The lack of glass sets any upper bound on tech level even lower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't even need to find sites. Fun fact, we've basically killed radiocarbon dating. Around the same time as we discovered radiocarbon dating, we destroyed it by putting twice as much carbon 14 into the atmosphere as previous. If a similar thing happened just thousands of years ago, we would see all these weird spikes in the record. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not glass, but look into the London Hammer. I only know about this because of YouTube's bizarre tendency to suggest conspiracy theory videos as follow-ups. </p>
<p>&quot;I see you just watched a video about Maesters at the Citadel in the Song of Ice and Fire books, so here's a video about Gobleki Tepi, the archaeological site that shatters preconceived notions about pre-agricultural megastructures. Once you watch that, learn how Atlantis has been undeniably located in Mauritania and science is conspiring to cover it up!&quot; </p>
<p>Why, YouTube? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just looked into the London hammer and it seems way more likely that it's a modern tool that got encased in limestone in modern times (limestone is very soft and chemically reactive. Natural processes easily cause it to change shape and encase harder objects) than to be evidence of some ancient civilization.</p></div>		</li>

<p>lol, read the wiki-page. Occams razor's answer would be, the hammer is from the 1800's and was left in an area, ultimately being encased in a concretion which looks like solid rock that takes thousands of years to form. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that may blow your mind is the first mechanical computer was actually created in ancient Greese around 500 BCE. Forgot exactly what it was called, but it was a navigation device that could take inputs like day of the year, stars overhead, what way you're sailing, etc, and give you an output on what angle you need to keep. It's got something like 100s of highly machined gears, bearings, pins, shafts, wheels, and other parts that come tightly together to make this thing work. Was found in a Roman shipwreck in the Mediterranean I believe.</p>
<p>Edit: Called the Antikythera machine. Not 1000s of gears, but many 100s of objects tightly machined and fitted together in order to produce information about our earth and solar system. Pretty damn amazing. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The suggestions aren't based on what you just watched. They are based on every video you have ever watched or skipped. Also, your emails (if you use Gmail), your searches (if you use Google), every website you have visited (if you use Chrome), every place you have ever gone to (if you have an Android phone with you), etc.</p></div>		</li>
