			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very interesting article. </p>
<p>I'll admit to being (I think healthily) hesitant to blindly accept the results of one researcher and one study with just 38 participants. But it's <em>the only</em> scientific study I've seen that addresses this particular subject, with all the &quot;evidence&quot; to the contrary consisting of anecdotes and untested conventional wisdom. </p>
<p>I may dig a bit deeper into this topic in the future (though, if I'm being honest, I probably won't). But in the future I certainly won't restate my original assertion without good scientific evidence to back it up.</p>
<p>And if my original assertion turns out to be right after all, at least you've given me something to think about; and if I was wrong all along then you've kept me from making the same mistake again. </p>
<p>So thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was the first study done on the subject ever though. So it's the only data we have to counter the (imho quite sexist) assumptions that women are less efficient walkers. Because that hypothesis was literally based on nothing. Or rather, it was probably based on the &quot;women are less perfect versions of men&quot; stereotype that was prevalent in 18th - first half of the 20th century science. Which was, of course, based on nothing but makebelieve (the Bible story of Adam and Eve!). We now know, that's not how you science.</p>
<p>Edit:
Also they interview one researcher, but the research was conducted by the graces of three (!) universities. Also in the article.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly compared to most other species of animal, both male and female humans are superior endurance runners. So I agree. But I will note that I used the term &quot;more inefficient,&quot; compared to human males, which is true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original author said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This makes running more inefficient for women</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How is this different from your “less efficient for sprinting” or “slightly less efficient for long-distance running?” It sounds like the author is making a perfectly valid, factual claim, and you’re looking for something to be offended by.</p></div>		</li>
