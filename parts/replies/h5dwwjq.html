			<div class="markdown"><p>The EHT team is making good progress on this important question.  Making an image of SgrA* is much harder than for M87 because during a night of observing the black hole changes its appearance.  This is because the time it takes matter to orbit SgrA* is only ½ hour (or shorter).  We are working on new algorithms tailored to handle this additional complexity (note: the orbital period for the M87 black hole is many days, so it doesn’t change in appearance during a night of observing, and making that image using data from an entire night was more straightforward).  We expect to have results for SgrA* this year but the exact timeline will depend on all the checks we have to run on the data and algorithms.  We are as eager to get these results out as you are!  But we also want to (and have to) get it right. -SD.</p></div>		</li>
