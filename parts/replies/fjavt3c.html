			<div class="markdown"><p>It's surprising how much energy it takes to turn electricity into heat.  Teslas lose a lot of range, like 10-15% or more, in cold weather if you like to be warm.  They're electric so they don't produce excess heat 'for free' like a combustion engine but I was amazed how much it can cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what they mean is they are using that resistive energy to drain the battery of energy that would normally be used to propel the car forward. So in an electric car you're sacrificing range for that heat regardless of whether making that heat is an efficient process or not.</p>
<p>With a combustion engine, the cabin heat is just stripping heat that the engine is trying to shed anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Showing my ignorance here - you saying they're more efficient than a heat pump?  I know a car is a lot to heat (and doesn't hold heat all that well) but the amount of electricity my x uses just to heat the car on a long drive (in winter) is more than my heat-pump water heater uses in a month.  And that's heating water, which I'd think would take a lot more energy.  </p>
<p>But then the heated water sits in an insulated tank till we use it whereas the car pisses heat right out the windows.  I guess that explains it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common misconception. For many scenarios, a resistive heater is actually the <em>least</em> efficient way to warm an object or area, but the efficiency relative to a &quot;perfect&quot; heater depends on the ambient temperature (and how hot you are trying to make it).</p>
<p>Let's pick a silly example. Say you have an ice cube that you want to melt on a hot day. Now, a resistive heater will take energy to melt that cube, but so will just leaving it out on the bench. The resistive heater, in this scenario, is actually less than 0% efficient.</p>
<p>To take a step back, when we talk about efficiency when heating or cooling objects, we are talking about how much energy it takes to move X joules of heat from place A to place B (aka to create a temperature differential). If they are very close in temperature, this can be done with little effort, but if they are very different - like an oven in sub-zero temperatures - then it is a lot harder.</p>
<p>A good analogy is taking an object from height A to height B. Moving the object (heat) is easy when they are close in height (temperature), but much harder when the destination (end temperature) is much higher (hotter) than the starting.</p>
<p>This is why heating using reverse cycle air conditioning, or hot water using a heat pump, is progressively less practical the colder it gets. As it gets colder, the temperature differential (and so energy) required to move the heat gets bigger and bigger until it's comparable to a resistive heater.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>At 20 degrees, the average driving range fell by 12% when the car’s cabin heater was not used. When the heater was turned on, the range dropped by 41%, AAA said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow.  That's pretty surprising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cars use energy to heat the battery coolant in cold weather, as well as for heating the cabin, Hughes said. Range would take a hit mainly for short trips, and the decrease wouldn’t be as large on longer trips once the battery and cabin are heated, Hughes said.</p>
<p>AAA recommends that drivers heat or cool their cars while still plugged in to a charging station. It says electric cars can still be used in extreme climates with a little extra planning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there is at least a way to mitigate a lot of the problem, heat it up while plugged in before using it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I make sure to leave the heat on while supercharging, but this is mostly for really cold weather.  And it can only do so much.  Once you get out on the road, you bleed heat.  If I'm going supercharger to supercharger, I don't trust the estimates the guidance system makes so I charge way more than they say I'll need.  A couple of times, had I gone by the car's estimate, I would certainly not have made it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a smart ED.
With the app you could set an estimated leave time for (say) the morning, and while it is connected to the house both the battery and the car itself is gently warmed before you set off.</p>
<p>There was a low energy option that just heated the battery and the car seats.</p>
<p>For a 2013 car, it was consistently good for 90 miles summer or winter, which is fine in town.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much better energy management than my tesla, in some ways.  Pretty sure when I finish charging in my garage, it stops forever.  Left it there while on vacation and over a week or so, it'd lost a several miles of range from 'full' as it just ticked over sitting there.  To my surprise, it didn't 'top up' automatically.  Kinda figured it would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It always confuses me when people refer to power rating in hp even when talking about electrical components of a car. 15hp is about 11kW which is much more relatable considering things like fridges and microwaves are advertised with wattages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems high.  Where does that power go?  It would have to turn into heat that's rejected by the radiator since it's not doing any work.  A riding lawnmower uses 15 hp to cut grass and drive around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc peak power output for alternator is around highways speeds at about 3k rpm (depends on car). </p>
<p>But that doesn’t answer your question. Is your car cold? Rpms are higher. Warm with full battery and no huge electrical load? Probs not much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to the resistance from the heating element - it probably has a positive temperature coefficient (PTC). As it gets hotter, the resistance goes up and it draws less current. That would explain the shorter dip from the engine as the element initially heats up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt whether that effect is large.  Instead, I'd say that the engine regulation electronics (perhaps by microprocessor in relatively newer cars) takes a moment to return the speed to a given setpoint.</p></div>		</li>
