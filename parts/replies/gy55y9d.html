<p>We can look at the isotopic composition of the gas giants; it does not match the isotopic composition of the Sun, so we can say pretty confidently that the gas giants are not made of solar wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation ambiguously sounded like one of either...</p>
<p>1) Gas exists in an early solar system. Solar wind then pushes this gas away from the protostar, but can only push it so far, where it then stops and forms planets.</p>
<p>2) The solar wind itself is the &quot;gas&quot; that forms the planet, which also stops at some point far from the protostar to form planets.</p>
<p>Neither of these explanations are correct, because there's no point where the solar wind stops. In a forming solar system, the solar wind is actively eroding away the gas left over from formation. It's literally a race against the clock as planets try to form from the remaining gas before the solar wind removes it from the system in a short few million years.</p></div>		</li>
