			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a terminology thing. A toxin is something natural like a snake venom or the cell wall of bacteria (bacterial toxin). A toxicant is any xenobiotic (molecule foreign to life)  that is not a drug/pharmaceutical, and typically has an adverse effect.</p>
<p>That rule was drilled into my head the first lecture of my first toxicology class.</p>
<p>And yeah that’s a good point, but as far as I know mercury is toxic to red blood cells due to oxidative stress, and I do not think that’s dependent on hemoglobin binding based on the evidence I’ve seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, btw methyl mercury is an electrophile that reacts greatly with thiols for example which are nucleophilic. Mercury is pretty neat in itself, it will compete for binding to Hb in erythrocytes thus reducing oxygenation to cells as well as reduce RBC membrane permeability   resulting in higher intracellular acidity which therefore would cause damage to intracellular components. However that's only one small pathway, I think mercurys ability to inhibit the selenoenzyme pathway of glutathione peroxidase to be way cooler because it creates similiar effects to the immune system as HIV-1.</p>
<p>Edit: Peeked a look at your profile, you got some cool explanations I don't even know why I bothered to comment about one small thing, you obviously know your shit. 😂 </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it is especially toxic to red blood cells because they don’t have nuclei, so they can’t adapt to increased oxidative stress, and they don’t have mitochondria to supply energy for the synthesis of new macromolecules. </p>
<p>All the antioxidant capacity in a mature red blood cell comes from the reduction of glutathione, which is regenerated through a pathway connected to glycolysis (I think; it may be some other substance, but I’m working off of memory). </p>
<p>So if the glutathioneq (or whatever it is if not that) capacitya is exhausted, the cell doesn’t have the organizationalqq capacity or energy to respond as other cell types will. </p></div>		</li>

<p>most natural and anthropogenic Hg exists as inorganic Hg2+ and is only transformed into methylmercury by anaerobic microorganisms—typically sulfur-reducing bacteria</p>

<p>Maybe you're thinking of oxidation of Hg to Hg2+ ? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Methylation is not an enzyme. Methylation is a chemical reaction that can be catalyzed by many different enzymes, but a given enzyme can only methylate specific chemicals. I don't know of any enzymes in humans that can methylate mercury, and the literature seems to be pretty unanimous in stating that methylmercury is only formed by bacteria. What enzyme specifically are you referring to here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stop eating seafood for a while is the best strategy. It has a really long half-life, so if you’re concerned about it, just reduce your seafood intake.</p>
<p>Most supplements against oxidative stress like antioxidants don’t really do much and will only help you if you’re deficient in essential amino acids like cysteine, in part because most cells produce antioxidant molecules like glutathione internally and can’t uptake it from outside the cell.</p></div>		</li>
