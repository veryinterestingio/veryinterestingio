			<div class="markdown"><p>$23 trillion in debt is a bad thing in a vacuum, but most people would argue that government deficit spending can be easily &quot;worth it&quot;</p>
<p>For example, investment in things like education and public infrastructure tend to have great returns in terms of societal benefit, and also drive up future tax revenue. Additionally, money the government spends does not disappear, if you spend it on a regulative body like the EPA, it goes to paying salaries/providing jobs, if you spend it on the US SBA it (in theory) goes to small businesses and you may even recoup some of your investment. If you spend it on bailouts, that money goes to the corporations that you are bailing out. Not all spending is equally good, but $23 trillion is debt is far from unmanageable for an economy the size of the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except everything you mentioned like education and infrastructure isn't happening. Those two have been getting cuts for decades. It would be one thing if all our deficits actually went to a good cause but it just seems to be lining defense companies pockets as cost plus contracts in unnecessary wars that the general public doesn't understand.</p></div>		</li>
