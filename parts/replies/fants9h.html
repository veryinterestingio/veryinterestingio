It always seems to me when these questions arise (and some of the respective answers) that a lot of people don't understand that life doesn't evolve  with this specific goal to improve itself and become optimal , but rather just by random &quot;experiments&quot; (i.e. mutations) that might be passed on if they result in a better or equal chance of survival for individuals of the species.</p></div>		</li>
