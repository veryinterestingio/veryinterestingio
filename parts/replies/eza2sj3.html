			<div class="markdown"><p>P.S. For fun, if you want to see what global warming looks like in your area, one easy way is to use the <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha</a> search engine. Just search &quot;[Your town] temperature&quot;, scroll down to &quot;History:&quot;, and select &quot;All.&quot; The trendline shows changes in average annual temperature. For example, <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=fresno+temperature" target="_blank">here's</a> the page for Fresno California, located in the Central Valley where warming has been greater than in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>(Some datasets for individual towns are broken- if there's a sudden big jump or fall in temps, don't trust it! Also, it's probably only better to look at towns instead of big cities, because urban heat effects or over zealous overcorrections can skew the data.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This trend was also recently addressed on Stack overflow recently. One thing someone pointed out was that most of the time when these graphs were being shared the labels and explanations were being cutoff. Leading to people completely missing the fact the graph was showing that our more recent temperatures were all mostly above the 30 year average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My question is why do normal people feel the need to refute climate change at all? Like oil companies, certain agricultural businesses, a politician whose funding comes from those things; I understand their agenda of trying to disprove it. But I'm under the assumption that OP is talking about some random average person. Someone that doesnt really have any incentive to refute it, and who clearly has access to both arguments for and against climate change. And if you have access to both, why would you choose to support and spread the one that denies the crisis?</p></div>		</li>
