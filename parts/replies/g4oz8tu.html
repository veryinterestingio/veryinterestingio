			<div class="markdown"><p>The interaction between the gravity of the sun and moon also gives rise to “spring tides” and “neap tides”.</p>
<p>If you go out to a beach and mark the highest extent of the high tide, and you do this everyday for ~2 weeks, you’d notice that your high tide mark changes from tide to tide, moving further up the beach or closer to the ocean, then reversing and drifting back to your first marker over the course of 14 days.</p>
<p>This is because when the moon and sun are in syzygy with earth (I.e. all of them are lined in a straight line; I.e. when there is a new or full moon), their gravitational forces are acting along a common axis, which compounds their effect on earth’s oceans and makes the high/low tides slightly higher/lower than average. These are called “spring tides”</p>
<p>Likewise, during 1st and 3rd quarter lunar phases, the gravitational forces of the sun and moon are orthogonal to each other with earth as the vertex (I.e. if the sun is in front of you the moon would be to your right or left). This causes them to partially cancel each other out, resulting in smaller tides, known as “neap tides”.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, according to Wikipedia at least, the sun’s net gravitational effect on the “semi-diurnal” (I.e. twice daily) tide is roughly 50% of the moon’s: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_tide#Tidal_constituents" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_tide#Tidal_constituents</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also you can look at a tide table that predicts the height of tides and compare that to the sun and moon positions on those days. The highest tides are when the sun and moon and Earth are all lined up, both during a full moon and new moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's always satisfying to make a prediction (spring/neap tides co-occur with lunar-solar-terran syzygy) and then find independent data supporting it. Nice find!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a diagram that the Earth's oceans during a tide rise at the points facing <em>to</em> the moon and <em>away</em>. Why would the latter rise too?</p>
<p>(In other words when it's a full moon why do the sun's and moon's gravities complement each other and not be antagonistic?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in interstellar they go to a water planet that orbits a black hole that has huge waves. Is this not accurate? Or are the tidal forces from a black hole just so huge that even when a planet orbits one like we do the sun it can create such large waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two important factors when calculating tidal forces - which are really just gravitational forces - are the masses of the two objects and the distance between them. In the case of Interstellar, the mass of a black hole is enormous in comparison to anything short of another gigantic star or black hole. To the point that the mass of any sort of planet orbiting the black hole is negligible.</p>
<p>The interesting question here, in terms of realism, is whether a planet that near to a black hole would be able to sustain an atmosphere, surface water, or even a stable structure and orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you missed that they were looking for planets that could potentially sustain life. Whikst the planet was orbiting a black hole it was not actually quite as close as that phrase might make you think. The impact on time occurs simply because the black hole is so massive and warping space time so much. If you want to discuss what is realistic than I have to question how they were able to generate the thrust to get to the planet, and then leave it and accelerate away from the black hole after getting close enough relative to their ship that such a large time distortion occurred.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Within the range of loss of atmosphere to tidal forces to something more akin to Earth you also have the realism of a planet probably being tidally locked. It could be in the process of locking though. Realistically it could definitely maintain all of those things, especially a stable orbit.  Contrary to popular belief, until you reach the event horizon, you can have stable orbits just fine. </p>
<p>A large moon could also impact the tides heavily because of the distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the idea is that in a shallow ocean planet thats almost completely covered in water, over time, you'd get standing waves that circle the planet as the tide does on earth. it wouldn't need to be a huge effect, as long as there's nothing to break up the waves, for a massive standing resonance wave to develop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the planet would also need to have quite the right combination of size and rotation speed.  Otherwise it would be pretty 'meh'.</p>
<p>On Earth, in the deep open ocean, tides are about 2 feet in magnitude, which is rather disappointing.  It's only near the coast that things get exciting.</p>
<p>See, the problem is that waves are too slow.  To travel around the world in 24h, the wave would need to be traveling roughly 1000mph.  Wave speed in shallow water is roughly sqrt(gd), where g is 10m/s^(2) and d is depth.  (Note: compared to an earth-sized wave, basically anything is shallow).  With at 1km deep ocean, we get 100m/s, which is around 20% of the required speed.</p>
<p>So, why do coasts have high tides?  <em>those</em> are actually resonant.  If we look up the bathymetry of the legendary tides in the Bay of Fundy, we see that the Gulf of Maine is roughly 400km up in there, and has a depth around 50-100m.  That gives us a wave speed of 20~30m/s, and a &quot;time to cross&quot; of roughly 5-6 hours.  Double that to go back out, and we're pretty much on resonance for a 12h source.  My numbers don't work out perfectly, and are pretty sketchy, but they illustrate the point.</p>
<p>A similar analysis holds for the tidal shelves for other places with huge high tides.  It's almost always a few hundred km of shelf at a 50-100m depth, which together make for a 12h-period resonant cavity.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is that you would need the entire planet to resonate with the tides, on an ocean world.  If it was too far off, such as how the earth is, it would just end up boring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a quick re-watch of the scene and I would say it is very much not realistic. They have rightly increased the tidal amplitude but for unknown reasons they have significantly decreased its wavelength. This effect can occur with tidal waves where as the wave moves towards the shallower shore its wave-speed decreases which essentially decreases its wavelength and increases its amplitude. They seem to have got the tides mixed with tidal waves, the later are not related to gravitational tides.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This was exactly my problem with the movie when I watched it, too. Well, that, and the other planet which supposedly had &quot;frozen clouds&quot;...yeah, that's just snow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neap tides are the smallest tides of the year.  They occur when the sun and the moon are pulling in opposite directions.  Not exactly opposite, but when the sun and the moon are at right angles to each other.  The moon pulls in one direction, the sun in another, and results in a high tide that is lower than normal and a low tide that is higher.</p>
<p>Spring tides are the opposite, when the sun and the moon are pulling in the same direction, and they are higher than normal.</p>
<p>These happen one a week.  Spring tides during the full and new moons, and neap tides during the 1/4 and 3/4 moon.  There's 7 days between each, so every 14 days there's one spring tide and one neap tide.</p></div>		</li>
