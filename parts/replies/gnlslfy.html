			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  As it turns out, A/Cs operate on the concept of moving heat.  Even though making heat is by definition 100% efficient, it's not practically efficient compared to taking geothermal power and moving it from below the surface to ground level, and then augmenting that input heat if it needs to be.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Heat pumps are amazing, and we have decades of working on making it efficient for how we generate and use power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to take into account the power factor. As this is a inductor load, the current with lag the voltage. You also get large in rush currents as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never met an electric furnace that isn't 100% efficient (or 99.99999% efficient I guess a small amount of light could escape the building)</p>
<p>The efficiency has nothing to do with how much power an electric heater uses.</p>
<p>Every electric appliance in your house does what it does and is also a 99.999% efficient electric heater.<br />
(Except ones that move matter or energy outside.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He should have used the COP number but most people don't know what that is. The Coefficient of performance of an electric resistive heater is 1, all the energy sent through the wire ends up in the room. For a Heat Pump the Coefficient of Performance is &gt;1 and can be up to 4 in very efficient systems, meaning for the same heat as a resistive system you use 1/4 th the energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess you got me on a semantic point. I should have said home heating system, which has a lot of room for inefficiency between the heating elements and the thermostat. My description fit well within the scope of eli5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned all electric furnaces are 100% efficient because the heat can be added directly to the airstream. The unit I worked on yesterday was right in range with what you said - about 10kW in heat and about 5kW in cool. Most electric heat units that also have AC made in the last twenty years have a heat pump mode as well however:</p>
<p>Here in CO heat pump mode does very little even during our normal cold temperatures. We also mostly use gas heat - electric can match gas heating capabilities for the same prices in terms of equipment, but at more than twice the cost on energy bills. Gas is also much more likely to be runnable off of a given back up generator setup.</p>
<p>From what I hear in colder climates they tend to have gas or peopane heat units and separate, backup electric heat units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of this is strictly related to strain on electrical systems, specifically in the southern part of the US. An electric furnace, which is suitable for more temperate climates and requires far less infrastructure inside a home, uses more power to satisfy a thermostat than an AC unit does. An electric furnace can use upwards of 40kw of energy, an AC unit runs under 20kw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I. . . Am aware and that's mostly what I just said.</p>
<p>The discussion was on the subject of why this cold snap is taking out the power grid in the south and not up north. Electric heat uses roughly twice the energy it's true, but the point is we mostly don't use it up here. So while some of the difference may come to the electrical infrastructure, a lot of it is that we don't have large electrical spikes in cold.</p></div>		</li>
