During my lifetime I lived less that 200km  (\~120miles) away from all out wars and bombings (Egypt , Israel ,Gaza strip , Lebanon , and more recently Syria) and if it wasn't for the news I would know nothing about it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Watch out with this one... Here in France they activated the State of Emergency system after the Paris attacks, which were supposed to be 30 days maximum. We lived under SoE for over a year until the government voted to include the SoE provisions under common law.<br />
States increase security measures in times of crisis, but sometimes have a tendency to keep those measures when things have returned to normal</p></div>		</li>
