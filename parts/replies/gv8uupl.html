			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the snake isn't a dinosaur.  </p>
<p>That's a specific name for a specific collection of reptiles.  All dinosaurs were reptiles, but not all reptiles are dinosaurs.  </p>
<p>The term you're looking for is Megafauna.  These are the oversized versions of animals that we see today.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Up above someone said that birds are reptiles. I get that birds descended from a specific type of reptile. We learned that birds are warm blooded and reptiles are cold blooded. Where along the way did the divergence occur?  Were (the ancient) dinosaurs warm blooded?
Does this fundamentally change the 5 classes of vertebrates (mammal, fish, bird, amphibian, reptile) to only 4 classes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just like how dolphins look kinda like (non-mammalian) fish, but they're really mammals.</p>
<p>Lots of lizardy things back then looked like dinosaurs, but &quot;dinosaur&quot; means a particular lineage of animals.</p>
<p>The reason lots of things look alike is called &quot;convergent evolution&quot; - basically, if a particular body shape is really really effective at surviving in a particular environment, eventually a bunch of different things in that environment will wind up having that body shape, whether or not they're actually related.</p>
<p>Ooh! Another way to look at it is like car brands. A bunch of different off-road SUVs all look the same, because they all serve roughly the same purpose. And since a lot of people are familiar with Jeeps, it's easy to just call a big, boxy off-road SUV a &quot;jeep&quot;, even though an actual Jeep is made by GMC. So if I had a Toyota 4Runner, and you said &quot;let's take your jeep to the mountains&quot;, I'd know what you were talking about, even though its not actually a Jeep, it's a Toyota.</p>
<p>&quot;That's not a Jeep, it's a Toyota&quot; / &quot;that's not a fish, it's a dolphin&quot; / &quot;that's not a dinosaur, it's a pterodactyl&quot; are all basically the same kind of sentence. If an 8 year old calls a pterodactyl a dinosaur because it came with his Big Box o Plastic Dinosaur Toys, you'll probably let him, even though he's <em>technically</em> wrong. Because you know he meant &quot;dinosaur&quot; in the sense of &quot;thing that belongs in my Big Box o Plastic Prehistoric Monster Figures&quot;, not &quot;creatures that share a common ancestor with both birds and Triceratops, but not crocodiles&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
