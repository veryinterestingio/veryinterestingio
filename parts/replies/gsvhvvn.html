			<div class="markdown"><p>Either physical, or much more likely technological. Human- computer interfacing for instance could allow for you to bypass some of the physiological restrictions on processing time by offloading to faster electronic chips. Of course, our brain is still much better at parallel processing at the moment, but that will change as our technology advances. </p>
<p>Other evolutionary changes like nanomachines in our blood stream that regulate hormones, eliminate foreign viruses and bacteria, cancers, and ensure proper oxygen saturation to our brain and muscles, and ensure that we are at a target nutrition level by efficiently processing waste, can get a human body in peak performance. As we discover more about how our gut microbiota influences our thoughts, actions, mood, and many other things (in a two-brain manner) we'll likely see great strides in overall human health and performance. </p>
<p>All of this to say that we will likely reach the pinnacle of our biological potential and then bypass it through augmented or replacement technology. This doesn't even cover artificially created (with DNA footprint) organs that operate at an increased efficiency compared to our natural ones. All of this seems science fiction but much of it is being worked on currently.</p></div>		</li>

When people select better embryos, do genetic tests before births to weed out issues, we already are in the process of selective evolving, even if we call it differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably, but.... because we have a high base level of intelligence and the ability to identify our own brain limitations I guess there is a slight chance we could use technology to re-wire our brains to some extent.  Sounds far fetched but we can manipulate things to help a blind person see, and can replace failed organs.  The limitation might be conceptual- if we can’t imagine a given skill then we can’t engineer it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remeber watching a program about 8 years ago called &quot;through the worm hole&quot; hosted by Morgan Freeman. He had two episodes I remember vividly. One was a farmer/scientist that removed the web making gene's out of a orb spider and placed them into goats which then successfully started producing silk string (spider webs) in their milk. The second program was really interesting in relation to your comment about new practices to learn new abilities. They took 5 archers, all novice and one archer world champion who was considered a expert in archery. They let the novices try their best to hit a target with no formal training or tips from the pro. They all had on brain scan helmets which scanned the subjects brains for activity while they were trying to shoot with no experience or knowledge for them to retrive from another similar experiences  they didnt have much activity in their brains and they all misses horribly. Now the interesting part, the expert shot 5 arrows with the same brain scan helmet on and he hit the bullseye everytime. The cool part is his brain scans showed tremendous activity is very certain parts of the brain. They analyzed the difference between the novices and the expert and successfully taught the novices how to hit bullseye from using the brain scan helmets to send very small harmless electrical signals to the brain to synthetically stimulate the areas of the novices brains that were lacking in activity compared to the expert. After getting 1 or 2 verbal tips from the expert (how to stand. How to breath) the electrical signals were the difference for them to hit the bullseye and all 5 novices hit the bullseye 5 times each with no formal training and only synthetically teaching their brains how to concentrate on what they were trying to achieve. Basically reminded me of the matrix. Artificially training the brain to so something it had no recollection or ability to come up with on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am sure a lot of smarter animals know their limitations as well.</p>
<p>Recognizing intelligence is a builtin feature that smart animals need to deal with threats. And yet what can they do about it?... I am sure a cat recognizes our skill to pull food out of nowhere without hunting out of that magic box, and they might try to engineer their own thinking like us and figure out how to open that magic bag, just like they engineer themselves to deal with urban environments, they are using their brains and trying to match us and our technology in their areas of interest, but they can't; they don't get even close, it even looks funny to us, how they misuse our technology they don't understand, to satisfy their simple needs; and we make memes out of it, it's literally funny and cute.</p>
<p>But if we see incredibly superior science, we will be as helpless as that cat, yes the cat might adapt to achieve a higher level of intelligence from what they pick from their human master, but can they figure all the lines of production? all the science behind the magic bag?...</p>
<p>The only hopes of humans to create something more complex than their own brain is self learning AI, and we are way too behind on that; but that would be just like evolution, and so a cat can evolve into a khajit, which would be an achievement of the cat as well under the pressure of the environment, AI wouldn't be too different from a khajit if it's a product of generations of humans and selective pressures.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we are all animals.</p></div>		</li>

From a very young age, he already found certain things funny. Is this a uniquely human trait as well? Do we have any evidence whether or not animals find things humorous? What type of intelligence is this related to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was young, I watched a crow teasing our cat in the back yard. It would fly low to the ground to get the cat to chase it, then fly at a wall or something and then go straight up at the last minute and watch the cat try not to slam into the wall. It did it over and over. Sometimes it went up in the middle of the yard, so the cat would just jump up to nothing. It did this for a pretty long time and was clearly entertaining itself. I remember thinking, &quot;Wow, that bird is <em>way</em> smarter than the cat.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife's cat went through this with a magpie.  He was kind of fat and clumsy, not the best hunter, and pretty much incapable of catching a bird.  Never even really tried to hunt, he was just a happy fat housecat.  No stealth skills, no grace at all.  Went on for literally weeks.  The magpie would taunt the cat, call out to get his attention, provoke him, then fly away at the last minute and squawk loudly at him, obviously mocking him.</p>
<p>Over and over, day after day.  </p>
<p>After a few weeks, the cat stayed outside overnight.  We couldn't find him, gave up, went to bed.  Never did figure out where he hid, but he hid.  Stayed hidden into the morning, till the magpie came.  Magpie landed in the yard, started squawking as normal, then suddenly shut up.  </p>
<p>We didn't see it happen, but we heard it.  </p>
<p>The lovely, friendly cat finally caught the bird.  Ripped its wings and a foot off, and left it struggling bleeding out on the lawn, laid down next to its twitching body and went to sleep. </p>
<p>So yeah.  There's definitely humour in animals.  That bird was clearly fucking with him.</p>
<p>And there's definitely vengeance, too.</p></div>		</li>
