			<div class="markdown"><p>Extremely beneficial is right. For livestock it's not even optional. A lamb that gets insufficient or no colostrum is a lamb you are picking up dead off the ground within the day or month.</p>
<p>If a ewe is not producing colostrum there is an expensive powdered colostrum product to try to bridge that 12 hour antibody absorbtion window. It at least will give them a chance against bacteria, but can't protect against local strains of viral disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main reason why many people with livestock around here have some colostrum in the freezer. In a pinch it doesn't even matter what species, cow is easiest to get, and a sheep lamb is better off with cow colostrum than none. </p>
<p>Saved my first ever lamb. Unprepared new sheep owner, and of course the first ewe to lamb had no milk. I called around, rushed to a friendly farmer and got colostrum and bottles. She turned out really well. But it was so much work, I can't understand the people who breed for triplets and then raise the smallest ones by hand. The other two aren't as strong and healthy as they could be and the third often dies anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what you mean. The mothers antibodies can pass through the placenta helping the kid's immune system. This stsys active for some time after birth. Which is great because it can cover the gap between birth and their first vaccin shot. For example whooping cough works this way ... mom gets a shot during pregnancy, baby is born with some protection until their own shot.</p>
<p>After birth antibodies are also present in the mother's milk, which is why breastfeeding is important.</p></div>		</li>
