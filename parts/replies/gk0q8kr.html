			<div class="markdown"><p>In the salt form positive and negative molecular ions strongly attract each other. In the freebase form you have only partially positive and negative forces holding the molecules together. So there's a reduction in charge separation as a freebase. If you were to continue the trend of reducing the charge separation between molecules you'd wind up with something like gasoline, which very easily enters the gas phase. Such molecules are called &quot;non-polar&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
