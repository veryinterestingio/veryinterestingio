			<div class="markdown"><p>But according to the original response he is claiming the muscles are what make your eyes feel tired. Where if you didn’t get deep sleep, sure you’re tired, but your eye muscles should be well rested since they have been closed and the muscles haven’t been used to keep them open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have direct personal experience with this, or expertise, but in that state it's just that you're tired overall so using any muscles is effortful.  If you have chronic fatigue, your legs could feel as tired as if a 'normal' person had just been out for a run.  Similarly, your eye muscles could feel like they've been holding your eyes open all day.</p></div>		</li>
