			<div class="markdown"><p>For anybody curious, this is because as our bodies assimilate the fat that we eat, the fat comes together in what is known as a dehydration reaction (it pulls/generates water from the fat molecules, &quot;dehydrating&quot; it, with the water now leaving the fat molecule and out into our bodies, where we can now use it).</p>
<p>The same happens when our bodies put together sugar, proteins, AND nucleic acids (think: DNA and RNA). It's the exact same type of reaction.</p>
<p>Our bodies also generate water at the end of a very, very, <strong><em>very</em></strong> commonly used pathway called &quot;Oxidative Phosphorylation&quot; (the end of the Electron Transport Chain in a process known as Cellular Respiration). This process is very common because it is the process we use to obtain almost <em>all</em> of our energy.</p>
<p>This is actually one of the reasons you need to pee even if you haven't drank water all day - because your body is making water from the things you at one point ate, and is now using it to filter out bad stuff from your body!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. The &quot;you must smash 34 glasses of water into your face every day&quot; thing pisses me off. We don't need to drink half as much water as people are told - another artefact of conventional wisdom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans being so wasteful with sweating out water does have an upside: evaporative cooling. Humans are almost unique in that way. As long as we're properly hydrated we can function in very hot environments without risk of overheating.</p>
<p>You may be sweating buckets (quiet literally if its triple digit temperatures and nearly 100% humidity) and yet as long as you have enough water and salt in you, you can continue to work in that environment indefinitely.</p>
<p>Other animals cannot do that. They overheat and are forced to stop moving. Humans can slowly jog animals into the ground in hot environments. A slow, steady jog, sustained for hours, is more than almost any other animal species can sustain. They will overheat. They need to stop moving. At that point you bash in the animal's head with a rock and there's dinner.</p>
<p>There is only one animal that can keep pace with a human. That animal is the dog. There's a reason why the partnership between humans and dogs has lasted for so long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah to the water storage - a person can lose 2-4 kilograms through perspiration during strenuous exercise (e. g. marathons, concerts with dancing, space walks) in just several hours, and still be completely functional.</p></div>		</li>
