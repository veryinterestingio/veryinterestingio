			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Someone invents an AND gate out of transistors and everyone else just gets to use it. The next person figures out how to use AND gates to make an addition circuit and then everyone else just gets to use it. The next person figures out how to take an addition circuit and use it to make a multiplication circuit and then everyone else gets to use it. Rinse and repeat until you've invented the modern computer.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution. Early computers were very, very simple and relatively slow. They worked in exactly the way described above but slowly with les storage and with a very simple instruction set. We didn't get where we are today in a single bound but rather through continually tweeking and improving performance as technology got more sophisticated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go back further. When the vacuum tube was invented and people realised they could use it to make a rudimentary decisions, the fundamentals of computing were built up from there piece by piece.</p>
<p>The <em>truly</em> amazing part is when you go back as far as Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, who had none of this available to them, yet still managed to dream up a recognisably modern computer and the programs that it might run, despite the fact they could only conceive of designing it mechanically, and were never able to bring these designs to fruition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So electricity is on or off right? Binary is 0 or 1, representing on and off. Essentially, your computer has a bunch of lights that can be powered or not and your computer assigns each one of them a 1 or a 0 for on or off. </p>
<p>We can then create programming languages to more easily deal with and manipulate binary. And there a different levels of code which refer to how far away they get from basic binary (in a nutshell). Assembly is 1 level up, and languages like Java, C, C++ are higher than that. Those high level languages get translated to Assembly, and then Assembly to binary. </p>
<p>And then your computer does stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sets of those on/off signals are interpreted as more complex (but still simple) commands that can be combined to make very complex commands. Those can get sent to a lot of different peripherals including video cards (which interpret the commands to go to a monotor), RAM, hard drives, sound cards, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Computers don't know what the zeros and ones mean, you tell them what to do with the zeros and ones. We came up with binary so we're able to store numbers other than 0 and 1 by using more digits. Like 01 = 1 , 10 = 2, 11 = 3. More zeros and ones gives you bigger numbers. Then we assigned each letter a number (see ASCI code). So now A is 65, or 01000001. 65 has no meaning by itself, it gains its meaning when we know it is meant to be text, and it says A. Then we tell the computer to start displaying the letter A.</p>
<p>The same goes for pictures. We agree on a way to save images (format, like JPG, BMP or GIF) and this allows us to make sense of the zeros and ones. Let's say we come up with a simple image format. All images are black and white only, 0 is black and 1 is white. Let's say all images have to be 4 pixels by 4 pixels and we start from the top left, going line by line. Then an image would be like this: 1111 0110 0110 0110. Real image formats use RGB colors (so 3 numbers for intensity of red, green and blue - for each pixel), and a higher bit depth of the color (so more zeros and ones for each of the 3 colors). For example, the laptop (and its screen) I'm typing this on supports 8-bit color, so 8 zeros or ones to describe each color. That's 24 bits for each pixel. Now the resolution is 1600x900, so there is ‭11 520 000‬ zeros and ones for the whole screen, and they are changing 60 times a second.</p>
<p>For actual image formats, like the ones mentioned above, you need additional information to know the size of the image, or how many zeros and ones we're using for each of the colors. This is called metadata, and is commonly included at the beginning of the file. For example, PNG files start with 10001001 and then letters PNG, followed by other things like the size of the image, and finally actual image data. This is what tells your computer that the file is an image. If the letters PNG weren't there, it would give you an error saying that the file is corrupted.</p>
<p>In short, computers never know what they are doing - it's up to the people who make software to make sense of the zeros and ones. Because lots of companies write their own software and don't necessarily play nice with everyone else, often they are the only ones who really know &quot;what the zeros and ones mean&quot; for their software. But as computers became an important part of our lives, we needed standards. This forced some of the companies to agree on standard ways to do things - this is why you can play an mp3 file on a phone, PC, Mac or car radio; or open a PDF file on any computer with software that understands it.</p></div>		</li>
