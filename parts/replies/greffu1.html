			<div class="markdown"><p>Royal jelly is made and excreted from special organs in the worker bee's head. It's a nutrient-rich mixture of proteins, sugars, and fats, similar to milk made by mammals. It's fed to all larva but larva intending to be queen's are exclusively fed royal jelly. Worker larva are also fed a mixture of honey and pollen.</p>
<p>The larva eating only royal jelly ends up developing differently due to it's diet and emerges as a queen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The TLDR is that bees use a combination of many fathers used to fertilize the queen and astronomically high genetic recombination rates to avoid the pitfalls of inbreeding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the hives/queens also produce drones, which are male bees that will mate with the queens of other hives. When a new queen finishes emerging and kills her competitors, she goes on a nuptial flight to mate with many drones from other hives. Then she returns to her hive and uses the sperm to make more female larva. Some of those will be queens, who will make their own flights to mate with other drones, etc.</p></div>		</li>
