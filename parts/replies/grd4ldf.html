<blockquote>
<p>Passive nuclear safety is a design approach for safety features, implemented in a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" target="_blank">nuclear reactor</a>, that does not require any active intervention on the part of the operator or electrical/electronic feedback in order to bring the reactor to a safe shutdown state, in the event of a particular type of emergency (usually overheating resulting from a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss-of-coolant_accident" target="_blank">loss of coolant</a> or loss of coolant flow). Such design features tend to rely on the engineering of components such that their predicted behaviour would slow down, rather than accelerate the deterioration of the reactor state; they typically take advantage of natural forces or phenomena such as gravity, buoyancy, pressure differences, conduction or natural heat convection to accomplish safety functions without requiring an active power source.<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_nuclear_safety#cite_note-Schulz2006-1" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the most ingenious designs are ones that use fuel as coolant, so in the event of a loss of coolant, there's a simultaneous loss of fuel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Single fluid fluoride molten salt reactors feature fissile, fertile and actinide radioisotopes in molecular bonds with the fluoride coolant. The molecular bonds provide a passive safety feature in that a loss-of-coolant event corresponds with a loss-of-fuel event. The molten fluoride fuel can not itself reach criticality but only reaches criticality by the addition of a neutron reflector such as pyrolytic graphite. The higher density of the fuel[5] along with additional lower density FLiBe fluoride coolant without fuel provides a flotation layer passive safety component in which lower density graphite that breaks off control rods or an immersion matrix during mechanical failure does not induce criticality. Gravity driven drainage of reactor liquids provides a passive safety component.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It needs to be said, molten salt reactors are an exciting prospect but pose significant safety concerns. Not from a meltdown, but in material handling.</p>
<p>Having a radioactive fuel that is liquid form can be much more dangerous. One of the benefits of solid fuel is that it doesn't <em>go anywhere</em>. Having a liquid radioactive substance will make containment quite a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>We need to test this technology out and work out a lot of the safety procedures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought half of the point of a salt reactor is that the fuel would be sealed off inside the reactor during meltdown?</p>
<p>Like, from what I heard the liquid salt was supposed to resolidify and trap the fuel inside the system. Then again it's been easily 5-6 years since I watched that docu on them so I could be off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are designs like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble-bed_reactor" target="_blank">pebble bed design</a> that use pebbles of fuel. The pebbles confine the fission products to within. With careful choice of coolant, you limit the neutron activated radioactive material in the coolant flow.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc whatever the material is has a melting point above operating range but below the temperature that would be needed to &quot;meltdown&quot;, if that term would still even apply here.</p>
<p>Edit: That said, some of the most fatal refinement accidents involving fissile materials involved liquids mixed in vats. A lot of engineering has to go into how those storage vats fill up and shape the liquid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are mixing it up with molten sodium cooled reactors, which react in the way you describe. The most common salt mentioned, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLiBe#Coolant" target="_blank">FLiBe</a> does not react violently with water. It's a very safe coolant in that respect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's true for just about anything nuclear. Changing a water pump becomes a huge task when the water is radioactive too.</p>
<p>Still pretty neat tech and likely to be much less catastrophic in the event of a disaster then older designs in use today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, that's a good analogy.</p>
<p>Bottom line is we've changed and learned so much since these catastrophic events, and all the factors that contributed to it happening in the first place are all but eliminated in western countries. A plant like Fukushima or Chernobyl wouldn't even make it past the concept design phase as it was, today. The standards are just going so much higher.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nah, hydro has nuclear beat soundly. The amount of devastation that would result from something like the 3 Gorges collapsing would be unprecedented. Heck, one single dam disaster is responsible for like 90% of all direct energy related deaths in history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that the Onagawa plant was actually <em>closer</em> to the epicenter of that earthquake. Both plants survived the tremors, but the Onagawa plant's emergency-cooling generators stayed on because the taller seawall kept the tsunami out, while the Fukushima plant's didn't, and that made the difference.</p></div>		</li>
