The US government labeled Snowden as a traitor as leaking government secrets is harmful to how the agency operates but I can say fairly confidently that most US citizens, both on the left and right, do not agree with them on this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it wasn't only just him...</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavasbit" target="_blank">Lavabit</a> was the email company he was using at that point and Ladar Levinson was the owner/creator of it. He's gone on record stating that there was info that he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/lavabit-founder-under-gag-order-speaks-out-about-shut-down-decision/" target="_blank"><em>couldn't even share with his own lawyer</em></a> in regards to Snowden... seriously? that's one of the founding points of US society. when you can't even talk to your lawyer about your own defense...</p>

<p>Afterwards, Levison wrote that after being contacted by the FBI, he was subpoenaed to appear in federal court, and was forced to appear without legal representation because it was served on such short notice; in addition, as a third party, he had no right to representation, and was not allowed to ask anyone who was not an attorney to help find him one. He also wrote that in addition to being denied a hearing about the warrant to obtain Lavabit's user information, he was held in contempt of court. </p>

<p>i'm all for secrecy when needed but when it comes down to the gov't just covering their ass, oh hell no.</p>
<p>a lot of the things that went on were done by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court" target="_blank">FISC</a> is an interesting read on it's own.</p>
<p>some further interesting reading would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_Wind" target="_blank">Stellar Wind</a>, plus i'm sure <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044364/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1" target="_blank">citizenfour</a> has been mentioned.</p>

US citizens rights have been slowly eroded since the early eighties. but once 9/11 happened it's been a straight up bum rush on the erosion of our rights and privacy in the name of terrorism. the  [PATRIOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#Controversy) act would be a nice place to start.

**edit** sorry the post is a wee bit disjointed, just got home from the bar. best wishes and good health to all.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Rather than investigate the wrongdoing revealed by Snowden, the government has gotten a grand jury to indict Snowden. The grand jury said the government can charge him with one or more felonies. But it's a secret as to what crimes he has actually been charged with.</p>
<p>What we know is that he absconded with copies of classified (secret) documents which showed evidence of unethical and possibly illegal activity by the NSA, he shared them with journalists, and he spoke publicly about those documents and other bad things he had learned the NSA was doing. I imagine the government may also claim he did other things, like sharing the documents with foreign adversaries, either directly or indirectly. All this adds up to a likelihood that the grand jury has in fact charged him with the crime of treason.</p>
<p>There are things that give us confidence in the American criminal justice system: the checks &amp; balances, the protections of the Constitution, the standard procedures that are followed, and about 240 years of judicial precedents which ensure trials are timely and fair. For example, when you're charged with a crime, normally you have the right to examine the evidence against you, and to compel 'discovery' of evidence which may exonerate or explain your actions, and to mount a defense, and to speak in your own defense, and to have a say in the jury selection, and so on.</p>
<p>People charged with treason don't get those protections. They get a show trial with no meaningful defense or semblance of fairness. The government gets to present its case, and Snowden gets very little opportunity to say or do anything in defense. He cannot even say what crimes he saw the NSA was doing or what he was trying to accomplish by being a whistleblower.</p>
<p>In other words, there is no such thing as a fair trial for treason.</p>
<p>Despite the word <em>treason</em> being thrown around left &amp; right by in public, it's almost always hyperbole. Throughout American history, almost nobody has ever gotten charged with actual treason. So the public doesn't think about what it really means at all.</p>
<p>People just say he should come back and stand trial, and they think he's a coward for not facing the consequences of his actions. But this is partly predicated on the idea that he is going to get a fair trial like a murder suspect in a TV show. Also it underestimates the government's adversarial nature when it comes to prosecuting crimes that involve national security. The government cannot afford to lose a trial of this magnitude, nor to lose in the court of public opinion when the defendant reveals what horrible things the government was doing which motivated him to do whatever he did.</p>
<p>Instead, he will just be whisked through a show trial, hauled off to prison, and—if what happened to another famous whistleblower, Private Manning, is any indication—will be mistreated there (or worse). Despite satisfying the bloodlust of some &quot;patriotic&quot; bootlicking Americans who are angry about the whistleblowing, that outcome would be a miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>All that said, he's crazy if he thinks he's going to get the government to agree to give him a fair trial, if he is in fact charged with treason. The law says what it says, and it says (basically) treason charges result in a show trial. If he wants something different, Congress and the President will have to amend the law to make those trials more fair. That ain't happenin'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has gotten worse, and they've gotten better at hiding it. Criminal or not, you have warrantless data collected on you. </p>
<p>We tried to protest when it was revealed - the average American either didn't believe it or just doesn't understand technology enough to comprehend it. There is (effectively, figuratively) a police-level investigation occurring on every single American. </p>
<p>They get away with it because information is power. They know enough to take down any politician, any organization, any person that gains traction speaking out against them. They do, they have.</p></div>		</li>

Don’t tell us or B. Cite national emergencies or write new laws that protect them as long as they’ve deemed you a threat. In their defense they are legitimately looking for actual threats to our national defense and aren’t looking to call the local authorities on you for buying some drugs or joking about bombing something (in the extremely rare case they were even listening to you to begin with) is it massive government overreach?
