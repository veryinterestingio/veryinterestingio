			<div class="markdown"><p>The fidgeting thing is so real. I'm one of those 'fast metabolism' folks, I'm quite thin, and always eat so much more than most everyone in my life, and I don't work out or bike or anything. But I'm basically constantly fidgeting. I do that unconcious leg shake thing. I twirl a pen around in my fingers. Sitting still for long drives me bonkers so like if I'm working at my desk I'll often get up and go up and down my stairs multiple times, like to the kitchen, do a few small tidy-up tasks, pet my dog, whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't seem like it'd burn that many calories though. I'm thin, but I think it's because I get full quickly and feel physically sick if I overeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel pretty sure that over the course of the day it does. I rarely ever feel full and eat very large portions - not all skinny people are skinny for the same reasons, it’s the combination of our appetites and physical exertion (aka every single movement even if small) and body heat that seems to be the reason people are the weight they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The motions themselves use very little energy, it’s the fact that they basically never stop those tiny motions that adds up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched the same show, it had some &quot;expert&quot; estimate fidgeting burns ~200 calories a day.. which adds up quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but I’m quite certain it’s a lot. Like, having seconds when others are full, snacking all day, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same thing as the last guy happen to me.</p>
<p>Ive always been skinny (6’3, 170-180 lb), but started eating a lot more during corona. Then we had a 6 month quarantine with no gym. In this time I gained about 20 pounds, so im now at 197-200 lb. When I went back to the gym I noticed that not only had I not lost any strength, I was stronger in bench press and deadlift.</p>
<p>I had only did push ups once in a while during quarantine.</p>
<p>It makes sense to me genetically, as my dad is 73 and still a strong and muscled man despite never having lifted weights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I remember this one, it was great! Basically their bodies had a preferred weight range and even though they were eating like 4,000 calories a day their bodies just did what was needed to keep them in that happy weight range</p></div>		</li>
