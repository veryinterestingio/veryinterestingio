<blockquote>
<p>...controversy remains over the best evidence-based practices regarding if and when to treat [fever]. There are two basic fields of thought: (I) fever should be suppressed because its metabolic costs outweigh its potential physiologic benefit in an already stressed host; vs. (II) fever is a protective adaptive response that should be allowed to run its course under most circumstances. The latter approach... has been supported by several recent randomized controlled trials like that of Young et al. [2015], which are challenging earlier observational studies and may be pushing the pendulum away from the Pavlovian treatment response.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should let your comfort be your guide. <a href="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/conditions/a-z/fever-myths-versus-facts/" target="_blank">Fever from infection is not dangerous</a>, so you never <em>have</em> to lower it.</p>
<p>As long as you feel cold, your body is still trying to heat up. You should stay warm. Pile on the blankets, drink some hot tea, whatever you need. Do not try to force your temperature down with external cooling at this stage; this will not work, but it will be extremely unpleasant and add unnecessary metabolic stress to your body. If you have shaking chills or feel exhausted, it may be a good idea to take a fever-reducing medicine, which will lower your temperature safely by adjusting your 'internal thermostat' so you can rest.</p>
<p>When you stop feeling cold, your body has reached its desired temperature. You should stay as comfortable as you can, with light clothing and blankets and tea/soup as needed.</p>
<p>When you start to feel hot and sweaty, your body is trying to lower its temperature. Take the blankets off, expose some skin, drink some cold water. It's fine to use a cool bath or shower to help yourself cool off at this stage, but only as long as it feels good; if you start to feel cold or get chills, turn up the hot water and warm yourself back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP was a bit misunderstood. Your body hits a turning point with fever (“fever break”), where your hypothalamus (thermostat) resets back to 98.7*F. You covered yourself in sheets when you were cold and your set point was at 101, and you were trying to warm up. You start sweating and breathing faster when your body wants to cool back down to new point of 98.7. Putting sheets on won’t make you sweat unless you’re above the hypothalamic set-point. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's talking about dangerously high fevers of 40+°C (104°F), right? Because a bit of a fever is in no way dangerous to an otherwise healthy human being. The dangers of you feeling better than you actually are due to the &quot;feversinks&quot; you took, and overtaxing yourself, are nothing to laugh at, depending on the kind of bacteria or virus you're dealing with.</p>
<p>(Source: not a doctor myself but lived with a pharmacist for 10 years whose father is a doctor, and discussed this stuff a lot with them, and I distinctly remember the advice not to take meds that reduce your body temp unless you're breaking 40°C, because all they do then is make your immune system less effective)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the situation. 101<em>F fever with previous cerebral swelling or damage can be way more dangerous than 104</em>F fever from the flu on 40 year old Mrs smith. Neuro patients shouldn’t have fevers period, and they are usually receiving anti-microbials to dampen the stress on the immune system. You also have to consider that with fever comes inflammation, which is usually manageable, but in neuro patients seizures + swelling will kill them. Likewise, you will walk into neuro units with doctors pushing blood pressures of 140-160 systolic which is usually awful for other patients: it’s all relative to the case.</p>
<p>Fever is also only a puzzle piece of the immune response- anti-pyretics will lower the hypothalamic set-point but your immune system is still functioning (albeit slightly less efficiently). It’s definitely manipulated a lot in the hospital. However your body will do better on its own, in most mild-moderate infections, if you let it go through the fever phases itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adults, yes a high fever of 104 is generally the “we need to treat the fever” marker. But a small fever can be more dangerous in newborns and infants, as they can rapidly spike and even smaller fevers (we define small fever being 100.4 F to 103.9) can cause febrile seizures. </p>
<p>Infants and newborns still have a lot of their mother’s antibodies and as a result we generally assume they can fight off an infection without needing the fever, given that the risks of a low fever are pretty high in newborns. </p>
