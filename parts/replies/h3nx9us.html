			<div class="markdown"><p>In Engineering Practices class, this is what they call precision vs accuracy. Measurements can be precise, meaning they have little variation due to error between data entry points, but that doesnt necessarily mean they are accurate. And vice versa, a measurement can be very accurate but still imprecise, so your level of error creates a wide range of variant data points within an accurate window. Which one you prioritize depends on the application you're working on. Obviously this type of measurement device requires more precision than accuracy, since like you said the change in data points from day to day is more important than how closely they simulate your actual step length or calorie burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As with everything. But there is always a level of acceptable error in any human invention, and this is a simple application that requires very little of either in the first place to function favorably, or so i assume. A pedometer is essentially just an accelerometer with a function that allows you to log the steps over long periods of time.</p></div>		</li>
