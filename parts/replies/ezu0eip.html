			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. One eye is like -5 something and the other eye is -6 something. Part of the reason why my lenses are $400ish is because I pay more to get thinner lenses. If I didn't I would have Coke bottle lenses (really thick and goofy looking).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ditto. I also tend to go for the various types of coating on offer. One of the few things I splurge on. Vision is important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If both are +, and you don't have any cyl or prism, then you could easily just buy two pairs and pop a lens out of one and into the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I’ve always been self conscious of how large my eyes appear through my glasses, but contacts can only do so much. My right eye is still incredibly blurry with contacts in and I pay $145 for 6 months worth of just my right eye.</p></div>		</li>
