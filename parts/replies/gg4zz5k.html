<p>What do you feel about the idea of electric jets that compress air so quickly that it turns to plasma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not OP, but I do have an engineering background. This type of electric jet doesn't compress air into plasma (that would take a LOT of energy and really refractory materials to withstand the heat). Rather, they create a plasma in the compressed air with a small spark, then add energy to it with microwaves (air doesn't absorb microwaves unless it is ionized). This type of &quot;electric jet&quot; is good when it comes to thrust to weight ratio, but not good when it comes to energy efficiency (thrust to electrical power ratio). It has applications for things that need to go really fast for a short duration, but not so much for relatively low-speed electric aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, ok that makes sense.  I guess in the future it could be popular due to needing higher speeds but having less energy constraints, but as of now it will be propellers and lithium ions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electric motors can do lots of interesting things for aircraft, not just drive propellers! NASA has researched using pressure (and suction) to change how wings perform in flight by increasing laminar flow or reducing the boundary layer. I hope we see more interesting applications as these technologies get out there. We also have researchers looking at heating the skin of the aircraft to change how the aerodynamic effects work in flight. - Sean</p></div>		</li>
