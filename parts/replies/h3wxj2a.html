			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/33/23/jcliD200366.xml#fig6" target="_blank">Figure 6e</a> gives a fantastic picture of how the increasing amount of cold, dense melt water coming down from the south pole pushes the salinity away from the bottom nearby, and increases the updraft of water and salt from the lower layers after you cross the equator.</p>
<p>Explanation for the figure: The south pole is the cylinder in the middle, and the graphs around it is cross-sections of the ocean salinity at different depths through different oceans. You can see the latitude along the edge of the graphs.</p></div>		</li>
