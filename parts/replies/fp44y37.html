			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent 2 months culturing cancer cells.  For the first week of isolation, all I could think about were the plates as they proliferated and then slowly receded.  Now I'm just disappointed that the work has remained dormant for so long.</p>
<p>I can only imagine there are hundreds of other labs in the country suffering similar catastrophic losses to their work.  What we may gain while hyper-focused on one virus will have compounding effects on the delay in ground breaking work in other fields.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in plant pathology, which is dedicated to studying diseases of plants and for the most part focuses on plants of economic interest: vegetables, fruit, fibers, turf. At our university all research is shut down (except those assisting COVID19 research, or deemed by the Dean of Research to be essential). There are a lot of grad students in my department who are watching their field seasons melt away, and each field season is a very important component of reproducibility in their studies. Thereâ€™s going to be a lot of incomplete thesis chapters and non-replicated publications attempted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would think that plant/field work would be allowed to continue, by virtue of not requiring the densely packed conditions of the lab/office. Our collaborators managed to get a single essential employee approved to maintain plants in chambers and greenhouses but not to start anything new, so the only 'losses' are to opportunity cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having been in a plant breeding lab, I do not see why plant breeding and pathology wouldn't be considered essential. Most of the field work was incredibly socially distant, green house work was pretty much solitary, and the actual lab wasn't that busy with plenty of space..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems... unjust. Walmart can open but they can't let you into your lab to finish your work and <em>then</em> isolate?</p></div>		</li>
