			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose if there was a &quot;master&quot; card that could get free rides, then yes, finding the private key for that card would allow you to create a new card that mimicked the master.</p>
<p>However, that is exceptionally difficult.  Simply scanning the master card would not get you the information you need - you would need to extract the private key from the card itself, and there isn't a way to do that easily. After all, there are no ports on a card that allow you to access the code on the RFID chip itself, and the <em>only</em> place the private key can be found is on the chip of the card.</p>
<p>While this gets out of my knowledge area, you would probably need some very expensive equipment to extract the private key from the card, and it would require being in possession of the card itself for a period of time so you could perform the extraction.  Of course, once the master key is found to be compromised, all they have to do is just deactivate that key on the server, so you <em>might</em> buy yourself a couple of days of free rides for all of our effort.</p>
<p>It just isn't worth it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I heard that the commuter rail into NYC can be $500/mo depending on the station you get on at. That's more than a car payment and insurance combined. So if I were to break even the first year with $6000 worth of equipment, it just might be worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If such a card exists, potentially. It's not quite as simple as you make it sound though.<br />
You can <a href="https://dirtypcbs.com/assets/images/dirty-decapping.jpg" target="_blank">decap</a> the chip and actually &quot;read&quot; it using an extremely powerful microscope and turn around and have a matching chip manufactured but the cost of doing this would be prohibitive and outweigh any gains.<br />
In addition, in high security scenarios the key is stored in volatile memory. So that when the chip loses power, the keys are lost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That assumes a quite advanced RFID interface. I’m not sure the country we’re talking about, much less the city, but if the card is a simple RFID card like a hotel key, they just blurt out their code and the database checks if that code has rises left and opens the turnstiles. </p>
<p>In that scenario one would simply approach other riders and get their RFID codes by walking really close to them and then write new RFID cards with those codes.  A couple hundred bucks worth of equipment will get that done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool info thanks!!</p>
<p>I looked up a couple of those and the data is NOT stored on the central server. It’s stored on the card itself, which potentially makes it more hackable than the description above implies. But I found no mention of the level of encryption used.</p></div>		</li>
