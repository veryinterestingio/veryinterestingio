<p>Do you think we have some dark matter on Earth? If dark matter doesn't interact with normal matter, some of it must be passing through the Earth as well, right? I'm only asking because I'm wondering if 20 years later or even 40 years later someone develops a dark matter detector, could we make it work on the Earth itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark matter detectors are already a thing, because as you surmised there should be dark matter passing through the Earth. There's a number of different ones around the world, typically put deep underground to block out cosmic rays. So far they haven't found any dark matter, so they're instead just able to place limits on its mass and the strength of interaction with regular matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they aren't really &quot;dark matter detectors&quot;, they are &quot;dark matter candidate detectors&quot;. There are different ideas for what Dark Matter could be without being dark matter, but so far they haven't come up with anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There probably is a tiny amount of Dark Matter in/through/around the earth. But physicists seem to think that dark matter can't interact with itself, which means it can't lose energy and momentum, which means it can't really &quot;clump&quot; into small things like stars or planets.</p>
<p>It's very dilute and only starts mattering at large scales like galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does Dark matter violate Pauli's exclusion principle? If they can get &quot;through&quot; normal matter, that must mean matter-dark matter particles could be in the same place at the same time, or even dark matter-dark matter particles.</p></div>		</li>
