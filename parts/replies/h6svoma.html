			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  You'd be shocked at how many people think you could just take all the money from billionaires and distribute it among the entire country.  Billionaires have a lot more cash than you or I do, but net worth =/= cash on hand.  You'd have to find someone to buy all those stocks, bonds, CDs, real estate, art, etc. and in doing so, the price would plummet.  If I had 500 shares of Berkshire Hathaway class A and tried to dump them all tomorrow, I would not get $211,000,000 (it closed today at $422k/share), because after the first dozen shares moved, demand would drop and I'd be forced to sell at a lower and lower price.  Trying to unload nearly half the existing shares would tank the price pretty badly, even assuming I could find someone or someones with the money to buy them all.  There are a lot of issues with wealth distribution, but robbing the ultra rich doesn't fix any problems and honestly, wouldn't move the needle that much even if it was possible.  Even if all those net worths of a billion plus were in currency, a complete redistribution of all the US billionaires to the entirity of the country would be a lump sum of around 10k/person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These answers are what I was thinking. Jeff Bezos, for example, could not come up with $200 billion in cash. It's not possible. Most of his wealth is in his Amazon stock portfolio, which isn't 100% liquid.</p>

<p>When I was a kid many years ago, I remember hearing some adults saying that if all the wealth in the world (maybe they meant individual wealth specifically) would be distributed evenly among everyone on Earth, it would be back in the same hands in 5 years. While this is certainly far fetched, I believe that the concept is valid.</p></div>		</li>
