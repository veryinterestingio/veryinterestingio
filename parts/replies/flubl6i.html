			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate bar soap for two reasons.  One, it causes soap scum buildup, I suspect due to the binders that make dry bar soap keep its shape. Since I switched to body wash in the shower there is never any soap scum buildup. I use liquid hand soap at the sink for the same basic reason. I suspect I could fill the liquid soap dispenser with body wash for washing my hands in the sink as well with fine results.  </p>
<p>The 2nd reason I hate bar soap especially in the shower is that even after I rinse it off my skin has a dry sticky feel to it. Again, I suspect due to the binders in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually due to the lack of binders, funny enough. Soap that has added binders causes less soap scum. Soap keeps its shape and doesn't need any additives. Commercial soap has a lot of the Glycerine removed (various reasons like it clogs up the machines and it can be sold and used elsewhere), handmade soap still has it, so handmade soap can go gooey if it doesn't dry out between use. </p>
<p>I live in a hardwater area, so soap scum is just live here, but as I have to get rid of limescale anyway, the soap scum doesn't bother me. Comes off with the same stuff, any acid will do. Cilit Bang or Vinegar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have very hard water here. Everything gets covered in hard water deposits and scale. Our plumbing is pain in the ass to deal with when servicing. And I probably shouldn't call what I was referring to soap scum. Its more like simply soap buildup, maybe its the glycerin in the bar soap since its not a hard substance but rather a coating of soft but dry soapy buildup that doesn't rinse away without scrubbing. Only get when using bar soap. Never get it with liquid soaps.  </p>
<p>Oh as for the limescale and such. Yes I have pretty good luck just using white vinegar if I don't neglect to clean it often. If I do then its a pain in the ass to get off the tile. I've resorted to 000 steel wool on the glazed porcelin tile. Doesn't seem to leave any scratches in the tile at all but does remove the hard water deposits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My local organic shop makes bar shampoo. It's definitely not cheap, because everything they have is expensive, but not having all those plastic bottles is nice. I'm going to try it after they reopen. I use artisan bar soap for my hands. I have a stash of like 12 bars of soap in my house all the time because I have a lot of friends who make and sell soap. I learned how, but I prefer to just buy it. I'm mildly allergic to pretty much every commercial soap, including dish soap. Sudsing agent maybe?</p></div>		</li>
