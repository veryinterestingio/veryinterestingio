<p>It's important to note here what R<em><em>0</em></em> actually means. In the very simple modeling you are referring to, it means the average number of infections a person will generate in an immunologically naive community. Used this way, R<em><em>0</em></em> is not a fixed number and cannot be used across diseases and across time periods to compare relative contagiousness, because the average number of infections a person will generate in an immunologically naive community depends on how that person interacts with the community. In a society where interpersonal contact is very rare, R<em><em>0</em></em> will be much lower for the exact same disease than a society where interpersonal contact is frequent and extensive. And the herd immunity threshold can also, therefore, be highly variable between cultures, and vary within the same culture if and when the culture changes the way it interacts (for example, as the result of the epidemic disease).</p>
<p>In other words, the herd immunity threshold is a different value, for example, in a society with universal masking indoors than it is in a society with no masking at all. It is a different value in a society with extensive hand-washing and physical distancing than a society with less hand washing that is not as concerned about physical distancing. And if the herd immunity threshold for universal masking is reached and cases begin to decline, and masking behavior then changes, cases could begin to rise again because the different behavior means a higher threshold of immunity is required to control the disease, as it is now easier for the disease to spread from person to person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would divide the herd immunity number from the formula above by the efficacy of the vaccine. So in the case of the Pfizer vaccine with an estimated R_0 of 6, and efficacy of 94%, the herd immunity threshold should be 88.69% of people who need to be immune to effectively stop the spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also not technically proportional.</p>
<p>A doubling of infectiousness doesn't double the herd immunity threshold. But they are positively correlated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the ideal mathematical situation, the maximum proportion of <em>non-immune</em> people allowed is <em>inversely</em> proportional to the infectiousness.</p>
<p>If R0=2, then 50% need to be immune; if R0=4, then 75%; if R0=5 then 80%, etc.</p>
<p>(Of course in real life, immunity isn't a binary thing, and the infectiousness varies with circumstances so much that an exact value isn't a good model.)</p></div>		</li>
