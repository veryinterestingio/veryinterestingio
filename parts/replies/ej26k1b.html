			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with the majority of your comment, I don’t think the cancer effect was completely negligible either. The idea that longevity beyond reproductive age doesn’t matter to evolution is wrong. For a crocodile that births, takes care of its eggs, and then ditches the kids, yes longevity beyond reproductive age isn’t important. But for animals where the individuals who have stopped being fertile are able to care for the newborns of the species, and reduce the risk of death for those individuals in their pre-reproductive years, their is an evolutionary advantage to longevity. So, while the folate effect should not be ignored as it’s probably the most important, I believe it was likely a combination of the folate and cancer effects that pushed for the change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While what you say seems intuitively to make sense, it is not the current scientific theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During most of 20th century, arguments about the selective value of dark pigmentation focused on the protective effects of melanin against sunburn, skin cancer, and overproduction of vitamin D. These factors can no longer be considered significant selective pressures.  </p>
<p>Sunburn and skin cancer have negligible effects on reproductive success. Nonmelanoma skin cancers are common in older individuals from modern lightly pigmented populations inhabiting sunny climes, but they are rarely fatal or incapacitating. Melanoma afflicts younger individuals and is often fatal, but it is much rarer than nonmelanoma skin cancers. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/107/Supplement_2/8962" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>Im not sure I really agree with their arguments here. They are looking at cancer rates in modern people, who have sunblock, clothing and often jobs that don't require them to be outdoors. The question is what are the melanoma rates of light skinned ancestors who would have needed to work without much protection in the sun for long periods. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s also the “grandmother effect” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/428128a" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/428128a</a> - in which “a grandmother has a decidedly beneficial effect on the reproductive success of her children and the survival of her grandchildren.” Gramma dies of cancer, no gramma effect. I imagine this was especially important during a time when women frequently died in childbirth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Reproductive age” has historically been much lower. As soon as a young woman has her period she can have children. As soon a a young man is able to ejaculate he can have children. So really, all you gotta do is make sure your kid makes it to teenage years, and by then they’ve probably learned all you have to teach about hunting and surviving. No need to live much past 40. </p></div>		</li>
