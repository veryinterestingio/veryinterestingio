			<div class="markdown"><p>So your saying soaking in an epsom bath is no more helpful than soaking in warm water? Is it just placebo effect that it has always seemed to work better for me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnesium from Epsom salt baths is absorbed through the skin. If you have a magnesium deficiency you may have muscle cramps. I get them when doing water fasting. Either a bath or oral magnesium citrate supplements fixes the issue. If someone's muscles are in spasm constantly, especially related to back pain, magnesium can definitely help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in high school we were taught a theory that lactic acid, which causes muscles to be sore, can be absorbed out of the muscles by soaking in warm water. I think that theory has been proven false, but it could lend to the idea that adding salt to the warm water would help pull out the lactic acid.</p></div>		</li>
