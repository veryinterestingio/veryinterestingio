<p>Most notably, if a given nuclide can only decay via electron capture, if you remove all of its electrons, it can't decay.</p>

<p>This would only be in total isolation though, right? As I understand, even ionic bonds aren't a 100% transfer of one electron to another atom, and in solution ions are constantly interacting with other nearby ions.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what a realistic example of an element that can be totally ionized in a chemical reaction and decays by electron capture would be (if it even exists), but such an atom would still have a half-life, wouldn't it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, to completely eliminate electron capture you need isolated ions, you don't get that condition in chemical reactions.</p>
<p>Chemical reactions generally affect the outermost shell only while electron capture prefers the innermost electrons, so normally the effect is very small. Beryllium-7 is the lightest nuclide that can only decay via electron capture, even there you have two inner electrons and two electrons in the second shell. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/news040913-24" target="_blank">Increasing its half life by 1%</a> was an extraordinary large effect.</p></div>		</li>
