			<div class="markdown"><p>I have it as well, and do the exact same thing if I have a sneeze that just won't come out. </p>
<p>My boyfriend was perplexed the first time he saw me purposefully look at a bright light and then sneeze right after. Now he knows to prepare for a sneezing fit if I do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is you tense your shoulder muscles when you sneeze, either just a simple &quot;that's just how I always did it&quot; kinda thing, or perhaps some sort of crosstalk between the nerves or something like that.</p></div>		</li>
