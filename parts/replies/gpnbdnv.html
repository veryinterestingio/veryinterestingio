<p><a href="https://www.carowinds.com/play/rides-coasters" target="_blank">Carowinds</a> in NC/SC has all outdoor coasters. They still use a flash, but it's certainly not the primarily light source (being outside?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It still is the primary source. Even though it's bright to you, if a camera has a super fast shutter speed (and probably a relatively narrow aperture so people aren't out of focus), then not much light is getting to the camera sensor. The flash may not be as bright as it would need to be at night, but it still is the primary source of the light getting into the camera.  </p>
<p>Edit: it is also functioning as a &quot;fill&quot; flash. If you need to see faces that might be in shadow, you aim a flash directly at them. This way you don't have to increase exposure to where the background is a washed out mess in order to see the faces if just natural light was used</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not hard to use flashes as the primary light source outdoors.  You just need a bigger flash and a smaller aperture.  There are whole genres of photography that under expose the daytime sky while lighting the subject with a very strong flash to get the right exposure, search for &quot;overpower the sun&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
