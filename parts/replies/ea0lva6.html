			<div class="markdown"><p>Small single engine aircraft might have an electrically heated propeller and a &quot;weeping wing&quot; that drips out TKS through very tiny holes. Multi engine propeller and turboprops will often have pneumatically expanding boots on the leading edge of the wing. Turbojet airliners will have a hot leading edge wing where bleed air from the engines can be used to melt ice off.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different aircraft have different 'anti-icing' methods.
From heated surfaces, hot air holes, liquids covering them, some even have inflatable bags(bag inflates cracks ice, ice blows away.... or a combination of all of the above. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The aircraft I work on is fairly simple in its de-icing and anti-icing capabilities. As others have said, on the leading edge of our wing is an expandable “boot” where nitrogen pumps in to expand the edge and thus break apart the ice, and our rotors have a fairly straight forward electrical connection that heats the surfaces up considerably and melts any ice off. That being said we can’t use most of those systems as they are not reliable on our aircraft however I have heard that other aircraft do have reliable systems that won’t burst into flames when tested. Also I think another reply covered, there is a system in place in the engine that will re-route hot air back into the compression section to prevent any ice from messing with the combustion process. </p></div>		</li>

<p>this is one of the reasons why you're not supposed to take a light sports aircraft (LSA) through a cloud</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are there instruments that help pilots avoid turbulence-prone areas? Or do they basically have to guess based on how the clouds look and what the terrain/water below is like?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly it's weather forecasts and reports from the last person to fly through a given airspace.  A lot of flights follow the same general path and altitude when they fly through a given area and they are constantly communicating with various air traffic and ground stations.  Those reports are often more informative than the weather predictions.</p>
<p>As always though, sometimes planes wind up going through unexpected turbulence which is why they tell everyone to keep their seat belt on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radar helps. But no, there's no foolproof method of detecting turbulence in real time other than flying into it. It's possible to predict likely areas of turbulence and calm, but sometimes those predictions are wrong. Weather reports attempt to forecast areas and altitudes where it's likely but again, it's not guaranteed to be accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an airline pilot. We don't avoid flying through clouds, necessarily. Not all clouds are the same. Not being able to see isn't really much of a concern unless we are trying to take off or land. Any other time seeing outside, while it's nice for our enjoyment, is not necessary for any other reason, really. Relying on triple-redundant instruments isn't a scary thought at all, once you're an experienced instrument pilot.</p>
<p>Icing can be a concern, depending on the airplane. Piston and turboprop powered airplanes have more of a problem with it than jets, as they can't really climb above it the way a jet can. In jets, generally speaking we don't go out of our way much to avoid icing, as it only really happens at altitudes we are climbing through or descending through anyway. Once the outside temperature is cold enough, all of the &quot;water&quot; in the atmosphere is in the form of ice crystals anyway, and it won't adhere to the aircraft flying through it.</p>
<p>The one type of cloud we absolutely avoid flying through is cumulonimbus. The vertical movement of the air in these clouds can be so extreme that it's almost certain you will damage the airplane flying through them. Luckily for us, these don't happen without a lot of precipitation, so our onboard weather radar is a very effective tool to avoid it, even if we can't see it with our eyeballs.</p>
<p>We do generally try to avoid towering cumulus clouds, as well. While these won't likely damage the airplane, they can certainly damage the passengers and crew in the airplane if they aren't strapped down. These don't always have precipitation associated with them, so if we can't see them, we can't really avoid them. If you've ever been on a flight where you hit really nasty turbulence, this is one of the more likely culprits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The subject always reminds me of the Farside comic where two pilots in an airliner are seemingly in the clouds as one pilot says to the other, &quot;Hey, what's that mountain goat doing way up here in the clouds?&quot;</p>
<p>Flying in clouds sounds amazing yet terrifying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a flight instruction elective in school. Clouds are problematic because.</p>
<p>You can't see which makes keeping the aircraft flying straight very tricky. Because it's easy to enter an increasingly tight turn which results in a stall while thinking you're flying straight. You cannot fly through clouds for any length of time without instruments.</p>
<p>Clouds are often turbulent which is unpleasant to fly through and increases pilot fatigue. Thunder storms are actually deadly. Teacher said if you fly into the bottom of a thunder storm the turbulence will rip your wings off, then you fall to the ground and die. If you fly into the middle the wind shear will rip your wings off and then carry you up to 50,000 feet, and then you ride the down draft to the ground.</p>
<p>Icing can be a terrifying problem when flying in clouds made of super cooled water droplets. Those hit your wings and control surfaces and freeze. Ice wrecks the aerodynamics of the wings and you stall.</p>
<p>And as you said mountains love hiding in and behind clouds. Look up lenticular clouds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember flying back from Europe to D.C. and there was this huge July thunderstorm forming over Boston, NY and the greater New England area. Our pilot came on the intercom and said we were going to be slightly delayed because we had to hitch our route way out to sea to avoid the massive storm. They were massive cumulonimbus clouds reaching from what seemed the ground all the way to space. It's amazing how much power storms can generate.</p></div>		</li>
