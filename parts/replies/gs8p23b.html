			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a third year dental student. I like your explanation. The bacteria defense system makes them group up and turn hard. So then it can’t just be solved chemically (mouth wash) it has to be addressed mechanically (brushing/flossing). Mouth wash is not a rip off, it’s just more supplemental.  Everyone on here saying mouth wash has different purposes is also correct. For the average person, probably fluoride mouth wash is best unless your dentist says otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Involves crystallization from a nidus (usually bacteria) within the plaque. Pyrophosphates are molecules that stop the growth of these crystals, so are an added ingredient in anti-calculus toothpastes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I won't give you an in depth explanation, but I'll give you a simple explanation. </p>
<p>There's calcium in your saliva. When the soft plaque undergoes calcification from the calcium in the saliva it gets hard and turns into calculus (tartar). Bone and tooth hardness is also the result of calcification, but in both cases these are much harder than tartar because the crystalline networks in teeth and bone are more neatly arranged while in tartar it is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes to this! Getting your teeth cleaned 2x/ year will save you thousands and thousands of dollars down the road. It's never &quot;to late&quot; to go to the dentist, people are embarrassed to come in when it's been a 'long time' since they're last cleaning, don't be -- you're not alone. Some people come in that haven't been to a dentist for 30 + years so your 5 year hiatus is nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So.. this might sound gross but, I'm always sort of cleaning my teeth with my tongue and stuff. If I feel anything kind of slimy I... Get red of it. Sorry I know that's gross. It's just habit. I try not to do it when other people are around.</p>
<p>Is that actually maybe a good behavior? Would it be able to break up the biofilm so not as much accumulates throughout the day?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know what's more gross is leaving food in between your teeth to rot and for everyone else to smell. It's a good habit I don't know how more people don't do it. I see people every day that are oblivious there's huge chunks of food in between their teeth.</p></div>		</li>
