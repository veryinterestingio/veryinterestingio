			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the regulatory processes and standards are based around our current uranium reactors so all regulations and standardizations would have to be thoroughly tested and rewritten. We would also have to build all new nuclear reactors and simultaneously decommission the old uranium plants which makes it very cost prohibitive. Basically we’ve put all our chips into uranium reactors and it’s too late to change our bet now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That has almost nothing to do with the thorium. There are advanced reactor designs that can use low pressure coolants. You can use flibe-cooled uranium fueled reactors, liquid metal plutonium designs, or uranium or thorium molten salt fluid fuel designs. All are low pressure and have inherent safety. None of that safety depends on thorium. </p>
<p>It's like having a really safe new kind of car with airbags and talking about gasoline vs diesel fuel. The diesel is unrelated to the airbags.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true there are solutions for existing reactors or alternative reactors that remove the pressure risk, but it discount the potential advantages of thorium reactors being inherently self-regulating, as well as the potential to user them to dispose of existing nuclear waste.</p>
<p>These things alone should weigh them higher on the development front than linear developments of existing designs that all have the same drawbacks, or alternative reactors at the same stage or further behind thorium in the research and development cycle.</p></div>		</li>
