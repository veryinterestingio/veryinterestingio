			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering if being in water lessens the effects of the fall in some way. Is there a certain height that will kill someone without being in water compared with being in water? </p>
<p>Landing in water does seem to help compared with landing on concrete from the same height. Seems like there's a happy medium somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Landing is different, landing in water lets you displace it fast enough while providing drag so that you can stop. Concrete doesn't really displace so your movement suddenly stops and your body breaks.</p>
<p>The thing with the falling water bubble is it falls with about the same speed as you would have and when it impacts ground, it creates a huge pressure inside the fluid which then gets splashed in all directions since it can't continue its downward journey. If you're inside it crushes you, if you somehow get the outer layers during the impact, it would probably very violently catapult you away. I'll let you decide if that potentially helps.</p>
<p>From lower hights it could potentially help if the resulting pressure is not so bad and the water can potentially slow down the fall in the last moments (the water already hit the ground but you still haven't - it would induce more drag than air). I'm not sure if it would actually help unless you had enormous ball of water and what is the speed with which the pressure would kill you before impact, but there might be some sweet spot where it actually helped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hitting water at high speeds is about the same as hitting concrete.  The water can't move out of the way fast enough and you stop too suddenly to survive.  Otherwise we'd see extreme free diving from airplanes a lot more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Enough to keep the water together in free fall, but when it impacts, the water can go wherever</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of those water molecules are traveling downwards then suddenly they can't travel downwards any longer. The molecules behind them stop, then the ones behind those stop, sending a pressure wave backwards through the water bubble. You might think that the water spreading out will save you, but the water doesn't spread out until after the pressure wave has already traveled through it at 1480m/s.</p>
<p>You're essentially creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_hammer" target="_blank">water hammer</a> and anything stuck inside the water is going to have a rough time. The pressure wave is strong enough to split metal pipes and and tanks so the human body doesn't have much of a chance.</p>

<p>Exactly, was about to mention this, it's not going to be a fun time being in a water hammer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about what happens to the water in that big bag/balloon when it impacts. It flattens and spreads out in all directions. Some will even splash upwards. The exact same (to a lesser extent) would happen to the water in a human body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You and the water are still falling separately because your mass is consolidated in hit body and still ways to stay in motion once it is in motion.  This is how you get whip lash in car accidents. You strap your body to the car (seat belt) but your neck and limbs aren't lashed to the car,  so when there's a sudden stop, it gets bad fast</p></div>		</li>
