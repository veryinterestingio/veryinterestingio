<p>Quantum field theory suggests all subparticles are just disturbances of their own fields, and the whole universe is essentially vibrations on a complex grid</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Few local vibrations in specific fields create a nice note, or an atom let's say. Stack a few together and you get a chord, and more complexity. Keep building up and you find natural harmonies and resonances and repeating patterns.</p>
<p>Universe is a cosmic orchestra singing to us. It's the only way I've ever managed to wrap my head around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fields aren't necessarily <em>made out of</em> anything. It is also very hard to describe <em>what</em> they are, as it borders on philosophy.</p>
<p>Metaphysics is the part of philosophy that deals with the questions in the vein of &quot;what actually is <em>stuff</em>&quot;. For example with regular matter, like air, you can go to detail about molecules, atoms, the particles inside them, etc. But eventually you hit a point where you just can't describe <em>stuff</em> with more detail. Like &quot;what <em>is</em> an electron?&quot; There are many explanations that describe the properties of electrons (like charge, mass...), but those are also not exactly the answet to what you are asking here.</p>
<p>Or you can go the &quot;natural philosophy&quot; route, and say that the electromagnetic field is an <em>abstract concept that allows us to predict the behavior of the world around us, using mathematics and observation</em>, and is not fundamentally a <em>thing</em>.</p>
<p>I did say that it is complicated, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are electro...magnetic. They propagate themselves. The electrical field transmits through the magnetic, and the magnetic through the electrical. They are one and the same, but at right angles to each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. A change in magnetic field corresponds to an equal change in the electric field, hence &quot;electromagnetic&quot;. The light is represented by perpendicular waves. One electric and one magnetic. They push each other through space</p></div>		</li>
