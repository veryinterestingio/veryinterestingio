<p>Hi, this is a great question! What’s rippling is the “electromagnetic field”. A lot of modern physics is based on the idea of field theory. These physical fields exist at all points in space (though they can just be 0). A nice easy example of this is the temperature field. This isn’t a fundamental physical field, but we’re used to thinking about there being a temperature at every point in space. If the value of the temperature fluctuates over time, it makes sense to talk about a “temperature wave” passing through. similarly, at every point in space, there is an electric field and a magnetic field. These fields “naturally” sit at 0, but we can make them wiggle up and down, so in certain regions the electric and magnetic field are non-zero and are varying. This is an electromagnetic wave, and depending on the frequency we get different types of wave (radio, microwave, visible light, x ray etc). What’s special about the electromagnetic waves compared to say, sound waves, is that the fields that they travel through (the electric and magnetic fields) exist everywhere, even in a vacuum, while air (which sound waves need to travel) obviously doesn’t. Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! That's a fantastic answer. I have one more question. Can we interact with the electromagnetic field otherwise than by emitting and receiving waves? Can we sample the field? Detect it when it's at zero?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Yes we absolutely can. Permanent magnets for example have a static magnetic field that we can interact with, and we can create static electric fields too, for example rubbing a balloon on your hair separates positive and negative electric charges and you can see the electric force at work. In general to measure the electric or magnetic field, you put something bag that interacts with those fields in the area you’re interested in and see what happens. To see if there’s a magnetic field you can place a small magnet and an area and move it around, and measure how it reacts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In vacuums like space there are still atoms. In the (very limited) things I've heard about from physics, electrons work more like fields. Is it possible that electromagnetic waves travel through the fields of atoms present? I don't know how you would even test for that. Maybe try find a place devoid of atoms and electrons and try to send EM waves through it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! There are a couple of good thoughts here. While it’s true that space isn’t totally devoid of atoms, in between galaxies the density of atoms is sufficiently low that we know that the EM waves can travel even in “true vacuum” (we also know this theoretically from Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism). EM waves can certainly travel in areas with atoms in them too, the sun’s light has to travel through the air on Earth to get to us (but note that different materials are only transparent to certain frequencies of EM radiation, which is why the atmosphere protects us from UV light and xrays for example). </p>
<p>At a quantum level, it’s true that all the particles are really waves, so the electrons and protons in atoms are really very localised wavelets in the matter fields that fill the universe. So, like there’s an electromagnetic field, there’s also an electron field that fills all of space, and excitation in the electron field are what we see as electrons. This field is called Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and is very mathematically difficult, but also the most precise science we have to date. The interactions of light and matter in QFT are more complicated than the picture I’ve outlined here, but the classical picture above is useful for most applications, and is the easiest way to think about what’s going on.</p></div>		</li>
