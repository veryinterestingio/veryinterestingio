			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, most dod ufo sightings are easily explainable.  </p>
<p>Top secret dod projects, be them drones, missiles, advanced missile countermeasures or even manned vehicles are constantly being developed and tested. At some point during testing, military pilots will deliberately be put in the path of these experimental vehicles, if just to see how veteran pilots react to them.  The pilots are not told about the classified project,  as they do not need to know; as far as the pilots are concerned, they've encountered something they've never seen before and can't fully explain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to David Fravor in Lex Fridman podcast thats very very very unlikely. Possible yes, but very unlikely. The equipment is goddamn expensive and it just doesn't make any sense to put pilots into unnecessary danger during training missions.  In the 2015 case one of the &quot;cube&quot; objects almost hit the plane.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Did</em> the &quot;cube object&quot; nearly hit the plane? Or were the cube operators fully in control the entire time?  I don't think you could answer that without knowing what they were.  So in that light, I'm not sure we could say for certain if anyone was in danger at any point - I mean sure, they <em>could</em> have been.</p>
<p>But I think even with potential risk, there's a strong argument for it being a military test.  Let's say for example, that you have some new vehicle fully functional (as far as you know), and basically ready to go into active use.  When it does go into use, its small size and radar defeating properties should allow it to go unnoticed in hostile territory, however these stealth properties still haven't been tested in the real world.  At this point you have three options: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use it first in front of a friendly pilot </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use it first in front of a foreign pilot</p>
</li>
<li>Assume it works and go ahead with deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the last options are functionally the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s entirely untrue. Feel free to provide a source for your false claims, rather than just talking authoritatively about things you know nothing about.</p>
<p>Multiple pilots have stated that after encountering top secret projects, they would be debriefed on them afterwards and told not to talk about them. See <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/12/tic-tac-ufo-video-q-and-a-with-navy-pilot-chad-underwood.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Multiple military officials have <em>also</em> stated that the US does <strong>not</strong> test experimental technology against our pilots. That’s not how we do business.</p>
<p>But sure, please continue to spout your uneducated, baseless opinion as fact in order to dismiss and belittle the growing evidence of the phenomenon that many credible witnesses have encountered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you. Louis Elizondo even said that US, China or Russia don't have anything like this in their inventory. Also after seeing and studying the data in AATIP he publicly told that we may not be alone.</p></div>		</li>
