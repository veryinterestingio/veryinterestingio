			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't seem to find that statistic. Anecdotally, checking my own packages for the last year out of 22 UPS &amp; Fedex packages, none were late for being bumped and one was temporarily misrouted, which paying guaranteed delivery would <em>not</em> have prevented. The year before it looks like I had one package that was bumped for not only one but two days. I imagine it varies wildly by where you are located, where the shipper is located, and how many stops the package must make, as well as time of year, rural/city, and how many houses/businesses your local carrier typically gets on his route.</p>
<p>Mostly I'd guess it's just a way to squeeze a couple extra bucks out of customers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usps, driver here. Amazon, priority and express mail/packages all must go out the day we receive it. We (speaking about myself only) try to get it all out the day it comes but we're understaffed at our station and they put curfews where we can't be out past 7pm.  I'm currently trying to get 200+ parcels out (3 mins per parcel 20 per hour) plus I have a combo route so I have to drop the mail off for carriers( mean i have to go back to pick up relays/ wait on carriers to finish packing what they'll leave me to drop off in relay boxes)...it's a mess.  Basically for Usps, unless it's express  we try but if the volume is too much we stager it till the next day and take it out asap next morning 6-8am. That's only for the holidays. Outside the holiday times of it comes in, it goes out. I'm guessing your question is Amazon related, don't worry Amazon is working on getting it's own carrier fleet...and man do I pity those drivers..Amazon volume is just crazy now a days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a UPS hub most of what u/magicanon is saying is true however paying more doesn't mean your package gets special treatment. There is no way for us hub workers to know what you paid to ship your stuff. All we know is what service you selected (air, 3 day, surepost, ground etc). The only difference is how it moves through the building. For example 2 day or next day air will only ever be in one truck trailer, one air cargo container and one delivery truck. We can guarantee your package will arrive on time because we defer over flow to other services like Ontrac or USPS to make the actual drop off. If you go ground you roll the dice. Those packages move around allot. Most of our drivers dont go cross country just to the next biggest hub ove, so ground will have a few stops youll see it in your tracking. Things get unloaded scanned, sorted an reloaded with different packages going the same way. Stuff gets lost stuff sits in the work areas until the end of the shift if the tape breaks. Stuff has to be repacked if something leaks on it. Stuff gets crushed by bulk or manhandled. This is why ground will never be guaranteed. If you are buying or shipping anything of significant value or that can break. Go air to limit its time in the system and limit the amount of hands that touch it. UPS hub 2 1/2 years</p></div>		</li>

All through the hub
There's packages everywhere-
While supervisors stare-
Saying &quot;What. The. Fuck.&quot;</p>
<p>Sorry this just pops in my head nearly every peak season. It kinda sums up the hub imo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its going to depend on the time of the year and where the shipment is going. If there is severe weather there may be delays. During holidays there are vastly more packages being sent so that risk is going to increase. 3 Day Select is basically an insurance surcharge against your package to guarantee it will get there in 3 days. So if for some reason you have to ship and you have some holy hand grenade BS going on there is little reason for 3 Day for consumers at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything /r/magicanon said is true but I want to add some insight.</p>
<p>Former UPS Store employee (whose family member owned a store as well). Ground is only not guaranteed during the holiday season. It is guaranteed all other times of the year (mostly, there are specific shipping scenarios to remote locations and such that may differ, but at least at the UPS Store, their system says so. A little asterisk in CMS).</p>
<p>The store generally will try and sell you on UPS 3 Day Select or UPS Air services saying those are guaranteed. This is a false and is only to sell shipping services with a higher profit margin.</p>
<p>PS. the UPS Store 'claims' to say shipping is the same price in store as online or at the UPS Hub. This is technically true but not really. The UPS Store automatically charges a small (usually $0.25-$0.50) to process your package. (Not technically the shipping rate) You can see this on the Shipping Receipt (this is the receipt that is on label paper at the UPS Store, not register paper). Though $0.25-$0.50 isn't much, the real difference comes in with shipping insurance. The first $100 is always covered by UPS but the store sets their rates after that meaning even if your insurance would be $0.50 for every $100 above the first, the store can charge you $1.00 or $2.00 which can add up for higher value packages. Sometimes they will mandate you add insurance for high value packages, which I agree is recommended, but is not required.</p>
<p>The only time I recommend shipping at the UPS Store is if you need their pack and ship guarantee meaning if they pack it, the insurance claim if damaged is guaranteed to be approved. Great if the item is super fragile.</p>
<p>TLDR: Best option, create shipping label at UPS.com and drop it off at the store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent addition. Perhaps it was inaccurate to say the Ground was never guaranteed. We warn our customers that Ground isn't guaranteed (even if it technically is) because it has the lowest shipping priority of all the services. The result of this is that most of our shipping is Ground anyway because the majority of customers aren't worried about a day or two of lateness, and the people that want to make certain that a package arrives at a certain date pay for the quicker services that have higher priority. And, since we originated the shipment, even if the shipment is a Ground shipment, we have an obligation to find out what is happening with your package if anything goes wrong with it.  </p>
<p>EDIT: I would like to say something about high value packages, though. The point about extra charges past $100 in value is completely true. However, how I understand it, if you have a $2000 item, and you don't declare the value at $2000 (and pay the extra charges) if the item is lost or damaged, the most UPS will pay for it is $100. So, as a (respectful) counterpoint, I would encourage anyone sending something expensive to pay the extra in declaring a higher value. Just my thoughts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that they should declare the value but my point is that it's not mandatory. (Though if someone was going to declare a 15k package, it's going to be a lot cheaper at the insurance rate of the hub or website than the store.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add up with IT these days it's pretty easy for them to prioritize packages. My staff handles a lot of online orders and I'm always baffled when I sit next to one of them and look up various packages to see how they &quot;hop&quot; from location to location at various speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting thing as far as UPS goes is we are very focused on how long it takes a package to get from the closest shipping hub to the final destination. This leads to some strange situations. My store is in Texas and, there are some situations where it is both faster and less expensive to send to an address in Oklahoma than it is to send to some addresses in West Texas. Just because of how the hubs are situated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it's often faster and cheaper going to a hub than node to node. Analogy wise, it'd be like flying from Houston to Dallas to San Antonio instead of straight from Houston to San Antonio. Even though it is further it might be significantly cheater and take less time if there is only a flight a week from Houston to San Antonio</p></div>		</li>
