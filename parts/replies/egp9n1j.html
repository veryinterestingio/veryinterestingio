			<div class="markdown"><p>When you take a drink of alcohol, your body recognizes it as a poison (which it is) and immediately takes action to try to get the poison out of the body. This includes actions that are tough on the body like, calling up the body's water reserves and over using the kidneys to flush it out. The liver takes the worst hit, trying to break down the poison and if you drink too much for too long, your liver becomes scarred just like your knee would be if you fell off your bike everyday for ten years. If your liver doesn't get a chance to filter out the booze, it can cause bile to build up in your abdomen, and if the bad blood reaches your brain, it can literally make you go crazy.  It also causes many forms of cancer, auto and domestic deaths and other problems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also calling out that your liver will process toxins first; if you excessively consume alcohol you diminish the ability of your liver to do its job, so eventually it will struggle to process the nutrients in normal food - leaving you malnourished and emaciated.</p>
<p>To continue the rant, alcohol destroys everything in your body. The liver specifically takes an enormous beating - your liver is one of the most resilient organs in the body, so the ability of excessive alcohol consumption to destroy the liver should tell you just how terrible alcohol is for you.</p>
<p>Context: my dad just died of alcoholism last month. He was 62. I've been searching for a lot of answers and trying to understand the disease more. Your comment helped. Thank you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad is 50. He has been sober the longest in 20 years. 4 months. He relapsed on valentine's day. He would be drunk 200 days out of each year. He had a stroke, aneurysm, 5 seizures from withdrawals.</p>
<p>They coiled the aneurysm by leading wires from his hip.</p>
<p>His frontal lobe got fried but the non dominant region.</p>
<p>German neurosurgeon at UC Davis shit his pants and all he could saw was 'wow' with a stern face that he is not retarded, dead, or a potato.</p>
<p>My dad is completely fine he just really needs to quit for himself. He used to be a pastor but got excommunicated for drinking and assaulting all of us constantly.</p></div>		</li>

He’s an alcoholic and he’s a good person but I really don’t want to lose him, I love my dad. He just turned 60 yesterday. This entire thread hits very close to home for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>how long would a complete detox of the liver take, lets say 'my friend' is a bartender and has been drinking minimum 7 drinks roughly every other day for 3 years, would say taking a month off allow an appropriate amount of time for the liver to thoroughly cleanse itself</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you've damaged it permanently, in which case you'll need surgery, the very ballpark figure I heard was 90 days for your liver to recover completely. That's why those 1-month dry-spell de-toxes don't work as well, in that time you'll flush everything out, but get very little actual healing time - that starts around week 6. I usually do 60-90 days at the start of each year to allow it to jump back and to break bad habits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The earlier you quit the better, how fast you can recover is affected by your age. 'Cirrhosis' is liver scarring, that has permanent consequences as it cannot be healed from.</p></div>		</li>
