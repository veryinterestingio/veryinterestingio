			<div class="markdown"><p>Come to think about it, it’s quite possible it’s 120Hz/100Hz  and harmonics, as the first stage rectifier would double the frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just did a quick test, using my phone as a crappy recorder. Here's the spectrogram --&gt; <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/lah08g275qxe13r/microwave_spectrogram.png" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>Not much going on at 60Hz, but 120, 240 &amp; 360 are strong. Lot's at 2,000 Hz also.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What is the rectifier doing in a Microwave?  Converting to DC?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>60hz is a basically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqwFimG3X3w" target="_blank">sub bass</a>, the higher octaves (120hz/240hz) and some harmonics are definitely more audible from a normal kitchen microwave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, 60Hz generated by a microwave would be extremely soft, too, and would be covered up by every other sound. The energy required to make sub frequencies louder (relative to high-frequency sounds) is immense.</p>
<p>If a microwave generated 60Hz at the volume of a consumer-grade subwoofer, there’d be plenty of rumble. Nuking food would be way more fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those that read music, 60Hz lies between Bb and B natural two ledger lines below the bass clef staff.  It can annoyingly vex people with perfect pitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s usually the step up transformer. Rewinding microwave oven transformers (often called “MOTs”) to a lower voltage and higher current capacity is a common DIY practice to make your own welder. I’ve done it and they still make that 60Hz growl when under load.</p></div>		</li>
