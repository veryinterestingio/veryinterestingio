			<div class="markdown"><p>Codeine is metabolized into morphine, making it essentially an opiate medication. It has abuse potential and is, therefor, a scheduled medication.</p>
<p>It's also not as benign as it was treated before. A small percentage of people have altered metabolism and end up very easily overdosing on codeine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking for Ireland, a <em>lot</em> of people are addicted to codeine. It's likely that it may become prescription-only at some point, which is a shame as it really is excellent for headaches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia codeine/paracetamol mixed pills were available over the counter up until February last year. For us the law apparently changed because of people abusing them &amp; also being able to buy multiple boxes from separate chemists. It sucks really as they were the only thing that helped me and others i know, get on with our busy day when we were either sick or had the odd headache. Now doctors here won't even prescribe it incase of addiction, which for the majority of people doesn't happen i don't think, though i can understand how for some rare people it would become a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Midol works wonders for my migraines. Was given it by a female friend who takes it for her migraines as well and has since become my go-to whenever my migraines flair up. Doesn't happen often, but when it does, Midol kills it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever since I started a new birth control pill, I get a migraine on and off for a solid week (or longer) around my time of the month. I used to just get one the day before it arrived, which was annoying but tolerable. This new arrangement is awful and tylenol or Naproxen isn't doing shit.</p>
<p>Regardless of where I am in my cycle, I should pick up some Midol for my migraines. I'm waiting to see my doc to get on new meds, but until then ugh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI, Midol is a brand name for loads of different OTC painkiller formulations by Bayer.</p>
<p>Half of them are just paracetamol, ibuprofen or naproxen with coffeine and antihistamines.</p>
<p>So it's highly unlikely to be helping much better than naproxen or paracetamol on its own which you already tried.</p></div>		</li>
