			<div class="markdown"><p>pumping fast vs pumping hard are two different things. fast heartbeats (from coffee etc) can actually result in the heart pumping less blood/not getting a full contraction in before the next starts. at least thatâ€™s my understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bet the more helpful answer isn't as ELI5, but stimulating your heart to beat faster isn't the same thing as getting it to beat harder while all your muscle are stimulated and contracting, and your lungs are working, sending oxygen to the blood to power muscles. Our bodies are an interconnected set of systems. Just increasing heart rate thru chemicals/stimulants that tell your brain to send certain signals isnt building up the whole system. A brisk 30 minute walk has the whole body and organs doing work together and getting stronger together.</p></div>		</li>
