			<div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with something called residence time. The soil in Argentina is mostly sandy soils underlayed by limestone. The water in your aquifer moves relatively quickly, enough so that the soil doesn’t have time to do its thing and purify it. </p>
<p>You get the same problem anywhere else this soil type occurs. Middle East, Florida, lots of tropical islands, the list goes on. Interestingly you can also get this in other areas if they’re water starved enough. If the ground is SUPER depleted like in North India, you can see this happening on some levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the soil wasn't exactly sandy, but it sure was depleted. In any case, that's most interesting, I never knew that. Love learning something new every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Sandy” is kind of a nebulous term. In soil sciences, there’s only three types of soil. Sand, clay, and silt. All soil profiles are made up of a combination of these three. This is combined into something called the soil triangle, but other methods like the USCS and AASHTO specs exist too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually the problem with well water in Argentina is that many wells were not deep enough, going only into the first or second water table, which is more than likely to be contaminated in some way or form. Those tables used to be clean and safe to drink, but lack of proper maintenance and separation from pit latrines, septic tanks and industrial wastage caused them to become contaminated and unsafe.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem isn’t so much with how deep the well is as compared to the soil profile. Having shallow wells don’t automatically make the water unsafe to use. For all intents and purposes, sand and silt can have water move through them, but clay and rock cannot. In the aquifer setup in tropical regions you have something called perched and free-flowing aquifers. Perched aquifers are very common, for example, roughly 1/3 of the state of Florida is underlayed by a perched aquifer called the Biscayne Aquifer. These systems are HIGHLY reactive to pollution because things get stuck in them and never filtered out. </p>
<p>One solution, like you said, is to take it from a deeper aquifer. Not all places have layered aquifers, that’s mostly a tropics thing. Another solution is what Florida does, take from whichever aquifer is the easiest to get to and use a deep injection well to send the refuse material down to bedrock. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Naive question: could you just dig some tunnels and pack em with other kinds of stuff (e.g. different kinds of dirt, or just some mesh to slow down water velocity)?</p>
<p>I mean it sounds very expensive, just curious if there's a way to &quot;remediate&quot; this problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. You could also just replace the material with something else like clay to slow it down (this is essentially what dikes and retaining walls are). </p>
<p>You’re right though, that probably wouldn’t be cost effective. You’re much better off diluting the pollution or sending it elsewhere to where it won’t be a problem in your aquifer.</p>
<p>Edit: missed the “tunnel” part of that question. Water will move towards the path of least resistance in soil. If you have a tunnel of, clay for example, the water will just go around it. If you make a sheet of clay, like how dumps are contained, the water will pool above until it completely saturates then will quickly drain into the layers below.</p></div>		</li>
