<p>Having tiered pricing structures for different amounts of data (data caps) is (I think) done very arbitrarily and there is no real reason to charge more based on total amount of data.</p>

<p>It is not arbitrary.</p>
<p>In your neighborhood, the ISP has a connection to each individual customer - this is usually referred to as the last mile.  Then there's a local distribution node which needs to carry that neighborhood's traffic back to a switching center somewhere, and from there bigger links to connect to data centers or Internet carriers.</p>
<p>Say you pay for 100 Mbps service, they upgrade your &quot;last mile&quot; link and device to 100 Mbps and call it a day.  Straightforward so far, no reason to charge for &quot;data usage&quot;.</p>
<p>But there's 100 customers in your neighborhood, the link from that local distro back to a switching center has to carry everyone's traffic.  How much money should they spend on that?  If they leave it at 100 Mbps, then technically they've given you the 100 Mbps link you paid for, but you'll constantly be fighting for that bw with your neighbors and complain about your service being slow.  This is called &quot;over-subscription&quot; - 100x customers with 100 Mbps links sharing a single 100 Mbps uplink is 100x over-subscription.</p>
<p>&quot;So just make the uplink 100 customers x 100 Mbps, so there's never any over-subscription or congestion!&quot; you might say.  This is insanely expensive.  If providers built their networks with literally zero over-subscription, first you'd have to wait for them to invent 100 Terabit Ethernet links to carry their million customers to the Internet, then you'd have to pay monthly fees large enough for them to buy and install and maintain all that equipment.</p>
<p>Every service provider uses some amount of over-subscription, just as basically every business (and non-businesses) in existence do.  There's not enough tellers at the DMV to service every citizen simultaneously.  You assume that people will show up at different times and try to build enough capacity to handle the typical amount showing up at once.</p>
<p>So how <em>much</em> over-subscription is okay?  To figure that out, you monitor usage.  If you build a 1 Gig uplink for those 100x 100Mbps customers, now you watch it.  If it's frequently used heavily, causing congestion and slow service, you upgrade it to TenGig so your customers don't have shitty service.  But that costs money.</p>
<p>So if you have a neighborhood of customers who just browse their email a few times a day, their links don't require upgrades very often and you save money on those customers.  If you have another neighborhood full of tech nerds who seed bittorrent all the time, constantly using their max bandwidth, they're going to crush that uplink and it will require constant upgrades to avoid choking the bandwidth of the other customers in their neighborhood.</p>
<p>Setting &quot;data caps&quot; is a clumsy way to solve this problem, but heavy data users actually do cost the provider more, and there's not many better ways to charge for that readily available.  Users mostly just expect that infrastructure is cheap and if they paid for 100 Mbps link then they've paid for enough infrastructure to use that 100 Mbps constantly all the time.  Which is dramatically untrue.</p></div>		</li>
