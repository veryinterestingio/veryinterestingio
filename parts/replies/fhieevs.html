<p>the golden ratio is a lot more than just architecture. Its basically the most irrational number you can have. And nature uses it all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way of saying it is 'least well approximated by an integer ration'. 22/7 is an approximation of Pi. 21/13 is an approximation of the golden ration (Phi). But the approximation of Pi is closer to the actual value of Pi than the approximation for Phi is to the actual value for Phi. You can get better and better approximations by using ratios between larger integers, but the approximation for Pi at any given point will be better than the approximation for Phi. You can say it is the 'most irrational' number since it is the number that is furthest away from any ratio using numbers of a given magnitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of how its calculated. its a continued fractal expansion. If you zoom into any portion of the calcuation, its the same no matter how big or small you get.</p>
<p>&quot;This is because of the Continued Fraction Expansion of the golden ratio. Looking at the Continued Fraction Expansion of an irrational number can give us an approximation for how irrational it is, based on this measure: The smaller the entries are, the more irrational it is. This is because if you plug in small numbers into the denominator, you end up with bigger numbers in the end. The continued fraction for the golden ratio is nothing but 1s, the smallest possible value at every single entry. So it is the most irrational number.&quot;</p>
<p>Literally just watch the video i linked. Youll understand the golden ratio perfectly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a ratio of two integers. Like how pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter of the circle. At least one of those numbers is a noninteger value, regardless of which measurement unit you use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like exactly? Or is there a lot of....meeeehhhhhh I can kind of see it GOLDENRATIO</p>
<p>I know it appears in nature all the time, but almost all life? Not just a large portion, or even a large majority, but almost all of it?</p></div>		</li>
