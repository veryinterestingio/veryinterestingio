			<div class="markdown"><p>Printers are one of the worst examples of a device that is inherently complicated, but which few people understand the complexity of.  This means that most consumers, not understanding how much a printer actually needs to do, will always choose the cheapest one.  So, manufacturers of consumer printers don't try to compete on actual quality, they just try to make the device as cheaply as possible, and hide as much of the complexity of it as they can from the end user.  So, not only are they poorly designed and tested, they also can't give you proper error messages, because the designers don't want them to appear as complicated as they actually are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one half of the story, yes. Then there's the fact most manufacturers make the printers more complicated than necessary, vastly increasing the number of points that could fail. Or that manufacturers deliberately price rapidly failing parts so high that the consumer basically has no choice other than buy a new printer, and make them harder to replace with every new generation of devices.</p>
<p>Not all consumer printers are cheap, but all of them are garbage in my experience.</p></div>		</li>
