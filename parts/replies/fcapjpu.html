			<div class="markdown"><p>Person who lived his entire life on Maui and Oahu here, can confirm.</p>
<p>And yes, it is really a problem.</p>
<p>As far as I know, only O'ahu has a trash-to-power incinerator (Covanta located in Campbell Industrial), with the Big Island having considered it but it got shot down by idiot protestors who couldn't picture an incinerator as being anything other than a smoke belching abomination.  The sugar cane plantations that used to cover Maui sometimes had their own power plants that ran off of the dried biomass that was left over from the agricultural harvests such as the squeezed-dry sugarcane stalks (called 'bagasse') but number one they're all closed and number two that's still not municipal trash, so they don't count.</p>
<p>Landfills are a real pain because yes, land space is limited, and yes, runoff from the mountainsides causes particular leaching challenges.  Take Oahu, for example.  Their main current landfills, Waimanalo Gulch and PVT Land Company, are both located on the drier west side of the island.  Waimanalo Gulch was supposed to have been closed down years ago due to being over capacity, but the committee in charge of finding a new site was unable:  the people who already live on the west side raised holy hell about ANOTHER dump being placed near them, and of course, putting it on the rainy east side was a logistical nightmare.  Covanta is also located on the west side.</p>
<p>For some materials, there is no choice:  some regulated hazardous materials MUST be sent for disposal at a Federally licensed Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility (TSDF), all of which are located on the mainland.  Likewise, all recycling must be shipped:  there is no steel-melting blast furnace in Hawaii, so we have scrapyards that must sort, shred, and ship recyclable metals out of state.</p></div>		</li>

The chute is right next to a grassy hill with a bunch of goats chilling there. That's where the pit used to be.</p></div>		</li>
