			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m one of those people who dislike Fortnite, and I’ve spent some time thinking about “why” I dislike it. </p>
<p>In the beginning it was fine, just another game with the battle royale genre. But then came all the “extra” stuff in the game that detracts from the genre, be the last person alive. </p>
<p>Cosmetics are fine, but when there’s a shopping cart with the sole purpose of “make a ramp and ride said shopping cart down the ramp,” that’s when things get too extra. Or trying to build a stadium around a soccer/football field. If you want to build something, go to a game that’s meant for building stuff. </p>
<p>Minecraft is similar in “a lot of stuff to do” but the difference is that’s not the point of the game. Fortnite encourage dancing in front of an enemy, which again detracts from the purpose of the genre. I’m in a “every man for himself” game mode but I’ll just dance in front of an enemy?  </p>
<p>Then there’s the overexposure. I see clips of it in my social media feed and the same thing over and over again (congrats you got a kill riding a rocket). Some of the people who stream it aren’t always the best people, and I know from experience that fans want to emulate their favorite streamer. </p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: I’m gonna add that this is all just my opinion.  There’s nothing wrong with people liking fortnite, it’s just not my cup of tea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn't you prove exactly his point by saying that though? Building a football field or a ramp to ride a shopping cart down isn't really related in any substantial way to &quot;building things to protect yourself from people shooting you&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
