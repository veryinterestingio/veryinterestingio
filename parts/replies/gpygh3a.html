<p>The most common expression most would know for this is “tone deaf.” The inability to repeat the same tone, often without even realizing it. In fact distinguishing very similar pitches can be impossible. Rapid changes in pitch during a melody can be imperceptible to a person with amusia. </p>
<p>One novel aspect is that they aren’t sensitive to dissonant chords. That is to say that when someone plays multiple tones at the same time, many combinations are “dissonant” or sound jarring, and tend to be uncomfortable to listen to. Someone with amusia does not find this jarring or uncomfortable. </p>
<p>It’s notable that this often <em>only</em> applies to music. They’re usually fully competent at detecting the proper tonality of human speech. Which is to say that they do not lack the ability to detect minute changes in the way a person speaks, and correctly identify the moods and implications that comes with.</p></div>		</li>
