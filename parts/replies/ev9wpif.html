			<div class="markdown"><p>One much more visible and &quot;cool&quot; aspect is SpaceX's higher tolerance for risk.</p>
<p>NASA doesn't want to look like they're wasting taxpayer money, so they will approach their designs with a very conservative, conventional and safety-conscious method, often triple-checking things and having several review and testing phases before ever going to full scale use.</p>
<p>SpaceX does similar, but with a higher acceptable risk level, they're willing to do more ballsy things like landing on a barge, and propulsive crew capsule landings. These things might make Congressmen nervous, but seem exciting for venture capitalists (and everyone else).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that it's exciting.  It's the old economic principle, &quot;the greater the risk, the greater the reward.&quot; NASA has nothing to gain from using greater risks to leap forward in technology a bit faster.  Private companies do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NASA had much greater tolerance for risk back in the 1960s. Because they had great motivation, people in the air and on the ground with the <em>right stuff</em> and good luck, they did some incredible things. Without the luck, it could have come out differently and we might have lost the space race.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer, I was not using the word &quot;conservative&quot; to refer to anything political. Only that NASA has preferred things which are risk-averse in the years following events like Challenger and the Columbia disasters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another big advantage I'd throw in there is that most of what SpaceX designs and builds is done completely in house. They build their rockets in a single factory in California. NASA will contract out building a rocket to a company (i.e. Boeing), and that company will contract out all the different parts of the rocket, and those subcontractors will often have subcontractors of their own. So it ends up being a lot more bureaucratic and inefficient process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ford built all their cars from iron ore loaded onto their docks. That iron ore could be turned into a <a href="https://globalminingobserver.com/henry-ford-coal-mining-194" target="_blank">car in 28 hours</a>. No company builds cars that way any more. They take advantage of suppliers specializing in specific parts/systems</p>
<p>NASA contracted out to SpaceX and was vital in SpaceX surviving.</p>
<p>The reason why SpaceX went in house was that they found the established aerospace contractors could not meet their development specifications at the cost and time they needed; but SpaceX was able to do meet that in house (or actually get closer)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually NASA never has built production rockets.  Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed Martin, etc. built the rockets.</p>
<p>NASA contracts with vendors.  Some of their contractors, like Boeing, are pretty famous for getting big paydays while missing schedule pretty regularly.  I do think it is fair to say that SpaceX is a lot more motivated to get efficient launch costs than the Boeing's of the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And don't forget that these companies are some of the largest employers so its pretty much a entitlement program for the state and local area.  Like when the army didn't want anymore tanks they still bought more to keep the program open just in case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the big contractors have already greased the palms of the right congressmen, and subbed out the components to the districts of the other right congressmen, and those congressmen have no incentive to see employment drop in their districts.</p></div>		</li>
