			<div class="markdown"><p>Also imagine the earth where you are driving on is spinning around it’s axis at about a 1000 miles per hour. Which it actually does.</p>
<p>There is this great flat earth idea that if the earth was spinning so fast and you would jump up and down on a train, you would land on the track behind the train!</p>
<p>Except they fail to realize that you inherit the earths or in this case the Trains speed. If you jump up in a train you would land at the same spot. </p>
<p>Jumping on top of a train however might make you land behind the train. But this is due to air friction, a tunnel or a despicable placed tree with thick branches.</p>
<p>Edit: oh wow my first award ever! Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT - Ok ok I get it, there's no such thing as stationary in space so I'm gonna go and hide in my stationary space station...

stationary relative to earth anyways..... lol...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Take helicopter. Fly up. Wait an hour. Land in destination 1000 miles away. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your response made me think of a fairly common &quot;proof&quot; that the earth is flat. According to flat earthers, if the earth truly is round and rotates at 1000mph, then it'd be impossible to fly west. A 747's max speed is roughly 600 mph. If a 747 tried to fly west, it'd end up going east because a 747 can't fly fast enough to outpace the earth, so it'd slowly travel east as it tried to keep up with the earth. The fact that it CAN fly west proves the earth isn't spinning and is therefore flat.</p>
<p>When I started researching flat earther's proof of a flat earth a few years ago, I saw that one <em>all the time</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even then, due to the distance, size and such of earth, it'd still seem relatively slow. They're going really fast, but they've got further to go etc. It's still ludicrous, but it's like looking down at the ground from a plane at cruising altitude. You don't seem to be going too fast until you're much closer (near landing for example). Also, less details makes it harder to judge; weather patterns camouflage land mass and oceans making it harder to see. Again, back to the example of the plane flying high and low. (There's maybe also a bit of &quot;holy shit we're really low to be going this fast&quot; kinda panic, the same way if you're used to being the driver of a car but then ride passenger, everything seems a little bit faster when you're not in control.)</p></div>		</li>
