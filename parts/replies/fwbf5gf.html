			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of this, hotel chains have an incentive of being recognizable, so if someone went to a Hilton hotel in Paris and had a nice experience, if years later wanted to go to Cairo there will be a higher probability of booking a room in a Hilton hotel. That doesn't happen in the housing industry, or it happen so rarely that it doesn't worth the effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also business travel. It’s common that a company works with a travel agency and when you have to travel you can only stay in “approved” chains (I.e., ones they’ve worked out a deal with).  I had one where I almost always stayed at holiday inn’s. Sometimes I didn’t if one wasn’t available, but it would take special approval.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact, quite the opposite. If I had to rent from even one more Greystar managed apartment complex.....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the chains are often franchises - independently owned and operated, but branded and advertised together nationally or internationally.</p>
<p>Meanwhile all the apartments in an area are often under one owner, with the low-budget ones under one company name and the luxury ones under another company name.  Getting evicted or otherwise blacklisted by your landlord in that circumstance is harsh.  And many that aren't owned by that one landlord are likely owned by big conglomerate companies, so if you had trouble with one of those, wherever you go, you're likely to be dealing with them again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm... I work for one of those large international chains in IT. Out of ~6000 hotels worldwide, I think about 10 are company owned. </p>
<p>We essentially just provide branding, group negotiations  for materials, marketing, and IT infrastructure (web site, mobile app, et cetera, only outside the hotel but communicates with their property management system inside the hotel). All the employees &amp; such at the property are employees of the owner(s).</p></div>		</li>
