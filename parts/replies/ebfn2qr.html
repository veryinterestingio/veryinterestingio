			<div class="markdown"><p>Internationalization is the correct term. And it's not just for safety! I can recall when Chevy updated the TrailBlazer interior to be internationalized, so for example instead of saying BACK ONLY on the heated seat controls, you had two pictograms one of which just had wavy lines through the back of the picture, and so on.</p>
<p>And the reason they did this is that it's cheaper overall to stock one button style with a pictogram than several with various languages as they were selling in at least 3 different language-markets if not more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Working in aviation where English is standard, it's interesting to see the difference in interface relative to something like a car. With aviation you can pretty much assume that the operator is fluent in English and is very familiar with all of the controls, so a panel will likely be a hundred different toggle switches and knobs with written labels. Whereas you sit in a car and pretty much everything just has pictogram and tends to be wide flat ergonomic buttons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well luckily pilots have a much higher standard than driving a car. I think it gets to a cost/benefit of time. I’d imagine there’s a lot of things in an airplane that aren’t easily illustrated by a simple picture, so it’s easier and quicker for a pilot to know what that button does if it’s just written, especially if all pilots are required to know English, especially English necessary for flying. But in a car a lot of the buttons are for simple things like “seat warmer”, “4 wheel drive”, etc. and there aren’t that many of them. Plus they’re not really essential to the function and safety of driving. In that case it’s safer and quicker for a simple picture that gives the general idea of what it does so it only takes a quick glance, rather than looking at the word, reading it, trying to remember/translate what that word means, and then pushing the button. </p>
<p>That being said I’d hope that where less trained workers (as in English isn’t mandatory for their employment and certification) are vital to the operation and maintenance of airplanes they go back to the non-language communication. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some cases the English words used are barely more than &quot;language pictograms&quot; to the pilots.  Many pilots, especially in Asian countries where English instruction is sparse, will know the proper phrases as memorized sound patterns attached to specific actions, requests, and approvals, without necessarily know the grammar structure and individual word definitions behind them.  The fact that they do happen to be English phrases is based on international agreement, cemented in some horrific accidents where miscommunication was deemed a factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>isn't English the lingua franca of aviation? like, required to know how to speak/read it because that's what language ATC uses?</p>
<p>not an aviator, just remember reading this on reddit somewhere, please correct me if i'm wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate this. Not because I'm against making it easier for everyone, but because there doesn't seem to be an overall standard now that there are so many more gadgets in cars. Things like the defroster are pretty standard, but other things I'm just wondering wtf the symbol means.</p>
<p>As touch screens become more prevalent, this will be less of an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting, as there is actually an <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/54513.html" target="_blank">ISO Standard</a> for the symbols. I guess it just doesn't move fast enough to have symbols for everything. Either that, or the one you saw was indeed one of the 350 official symbols, just one you'd not seen before!</p></div>		</li>

<p>There has been a trend for quite some time (decades) to internationalize safety symbols</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, when it comes to road signals you can date it back to 1931 Geneva Convention on Road Signals, or likely even earlier. The unification and standardization isn't new trend, it's just that USA is as always late to the party. In areas like Europe where wihin couple hundred kiliometers you can go through multiple countries speaking completely different languages and govern by completely different people (with different views and standards) it always was seen as necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great city on neutral ground, but also cultural and political crossroads. Easily one of the most international cities in Europe and in many ways world. It has been center for international communication for over hundred of years and you can literally feel it walking the streets.</p>
<p>Same with Vienna. It has the old European “fuck you” feeling to it, and i personally appreciate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is happening in aviation as well. New aircraft are being delivered with the international symbol for exit (green sign, stick figure heading for a box) rather than “exit” signs because everyone recognizes the picture, not everyone speaks English and in something like a plane crash a few seconds trying to figure out what a sign is telling you can be the difference between living and dying </p></div>		</li>
