			<div class="markdown"><p>My roommates dog is very well behaved.  She won't get on my bed without permission.  We're at a point now where she walks in halfway through my door and looks at me.  I raise eyebrows and look over at the bed from my desk.  She either goes over there or wants to pee or fight or something instead.</p>
<p>It's scary how well she communicates with me.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://imgur.com/RMATTCz" target="_blank">Here's a pic of her waiting for permission</a> as described.  I apologize for taking so long on the dog tax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there are some really simple experiments they've done with children to test &quot;theory of mind,&quot; or the ability to accurately consider what other individuals (including animals) are thinking. </p>
<p>They have two kids, kid 1 remaining in the room the whole time where two boxes and one toy are always kept. At one point, kid 2 comes in and sees that the toy is in box 1, then leaves the room. An adult (or maybe kid 1; what's most important is that kid 1 sees the toy get moved to its new location, and knows where it's at) then moves the toy to the other box after kid 2 is no longer present (or watching). </p>
<p>An adult then asks kid 1 where kid 2 will look for the toy. Before a certain age, essentially all kids 1 say &quot;box 2,&quot; where the toy actually is at that moment, whereas after a certain age, nearly all say &quot;box 1.&quot; I don't recall numbers here but what's important is that there's a really dramatic difference!</p>
<p>Basically kids suck at understanding things from others' perspectives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting topic but can be easily misunderstood, mainly around that word “innate” (also in the somewhat artificial distinction between physical characteristics and behaviour).</p>
<p>Although “innate” is sometimes literally defined as “inborn”, it doesn’t just refer to things we exhibit as newborn babies.</p>
<p>The following are all traits that are innate to human beings, but which babies lack:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First set of teeth falling out during childhood, growing a second set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquiring language </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walking upright</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correctly answering the question “Does your brother/sister have any brothers or sisters?” starting from the age of about 3-4 (younger infants usually say “no”, unable to see themselves as the brother/sister from another’s perspective).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexual characteristics and reproductive capacity that develop during teens</p>
</li>
<li>Other big hormonal changes scheduled for later in life (eg. menopause)</li>
</ul>
<p>Many innate traits are acquired by learning, and yet we have an evolved tendency to learn them - we don’t entirely invent the ability from scratch. Babies can’t speak English, but they are laser-focused on the sounds adults make to them, and their brains are totally wired up to acquire the local language rules by distilling patterns from the sounds they hear, in a way that even our closest surviving related species simply can’t do.</p>
<p>Learning to walk is similar: we inherit some brain structures that make us good at learning to walk, rather than being immediately capable of walking. The partial information missing from our genetic code can be “read” from the environment anyway, so our genes are able to “travel light” (you don’t need to pack everything for a journey if you have some money.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often I find it isn't that the abstract thinking is so hard in itself, it's remembering to do it. Try to build a habit, when you are thinking about a problem/topic, to try to step back. Ask yourself if there are more general concepts involved, rather than focusing on the specifics. Often, interesting things pop up quickly that you would have never though to look for otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can backfire on casual conversation... Speaking from experience.</p>
<p>I've been practicing abstract reasoning since I learned to program, and it's taken over my ability to just have a normal conversation about something... </p>
<hr />
<p>Sure, you say your hot water hear is more efficient if you max the heat out, but is it really? How do you use your hot water? How well insulated is the old heater? Are your pipes insulated? Do you take hotter showers now? Did you actually measure it before and after? Did your habits change?...etc</p>
<p>There always seems to be hidden depth to everything now </p>
<p>Even if you don't voice it, it's like having 5 of &quot;you&quot;, in your head, all having a fragmented &quot;conversation&quot; about all the other variables not solved, for a few seconds. But you can only consider &quot;their&quot; opinions one at a time, and often have to get it repeated.</p>
<p>Which for me, kills down my ability to talk without pauses more often than I'd like. </p>
<p>It also leads to strong, split-second, intuitions on familiar subjects. However, it takes much more time to flesh out and explain what caused the intuition as you juggle everything around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here are my best guesses at what works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Abstract reasoning is sometimes about finding the ways where two things are similar or different (the difference between 'a rock, specifically' and 'any hard thing' for instance). Reading a lot of narrative fiction lets you see more situations from more peoples' points of view. Invaluable data, because sometimes it's just ones own experiences that keep them from seeing why a given difference might matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/A_Human%27s_Guide_to_Words" target="_blank">I personally consider this sequence of blog posts some of the most important words written down in the English language</a>. It's all about the most fundamental abstraction: words are pointers to things, not the things themselves. Which is like, really obvious when you say it like that, but people hear it, say it's obvious, and then go on living their lives as if, eg, &quot;chair&quot; was some kind of essence that lives inside wooden things we sit on. (You don't need a single sip of any LessWrong Kool-Aid for this to be valuable.)</p>
</li>
<li>Doing logic puzzles. I specifically recommend Raymond Smullyan's books. I think they teach your intuition to be quiet sometimes. See, in the real world everybody talks in a complex melange of truth (as they see it) and fiction and spin and framing. And in that world your instincts get you what you need. But on the island of knights and knaves, peoples make precise statements with an exact truth value (always true if they're a knight, always false if they're a knave), and only thinking about it rigorously gets you the info you need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a small example of the simplest failure: two people, one a knight and one a knave (you don't know which is which), stand before two doors. You know that behind one door is a great treasure you can keep, and behind the other is a manticore that will kill you instantly if you let it out. Both the people know which door is which, but you don't. You get to ask exactly one question of one of them. So, <strong>so</strong> many people answer something like: &quot;I ask one what color the sky is, if he says blue, I know he's the knight!&quot; Here's the failure of abstraction: some intuitive part assumed that knowing which person is the knight says something about which door hides the treasure, they failed to abstract these apart. (Admittedly, there's another failure option: their brain started to work on the problem piecemeal and as soon as it gave them a partial answer they started talking, failing to attend to—slightly different from forgetting—the fact that they can only ask one question.)</p>
<p>(And if you don't have any idea how to actually go about solving that question, don't worry, the books build you up to it with simpler problems that give you more tools to solve harder ones.)</p>
<ul>
<li>I also second math. I hate that so often a math teacher, asked what a child needs to know this for, sputters about balancing a budget. And while an intuitive understanding of quantities is good, algebra is more important for teaching the abstract idea of 'x', a quantity you don't know yet, but can, via rule following. Calculus is scary, but also really good for giving you a solid, intuitive understanding of the difference between a level, a rate of change, and acceleration (rate of change in rate of change), an abstraction that serves very well in finding and understanding other abstractions.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t it also work, when I ask one what color the sky is. Then I would know who the liar is and could just ask the other one where the manticore is. And with my knowledge, of he being the liar or not in mind I would know where the treasure is, too?</p>
<p>Could this work? And if not could you (or someone else) maybe explain why not? I’m legit curious.</p></div>		</li>
