			<div class="markdown"><p>A different take on the answer:</p>
<p>The body can do something we struggle to manufacture, by creating perfect gradients from soft to hard materials. Nails are an example of this. These gradients are incredibly strong, because there is no mechanically distinct partition between structures, thus avoiding stress concentrations and the age old problem of fasteners being the weakest link in a structure.</p>
<p>Think of it like trying to glue some polished metal to a soft rubber, compared to if the rubber simply slowly transitions into the metal, with no distinct boundary. Very different strength profiles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes....this. Wasn't sure how to explain strength gradients from fleshy cells to hard Keratin. Well put!  </p>
<p>Edit: for anybody that doesn't know: Keratin is what nails and hair are made from (for the most part)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Work is always being done on producing mechanical gradients like this, their existence would be an unbelievable boon for prosthetics and implants as well as a variety of other fields I am sure. The way our bodies and animals in general do it would be ideal, but reprogramming cells to create structures like that is no small task and I haven't seen it done yet.</p></div>		</li>
