			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! Short answer; yup. Multiple studies have reared insects in oxygen-enriched environments - notably dragonflies and fruit flies - and have observed up to 15% increases in body size. Granted, there's still an obstacle course of physiological and developmental constraints in the way of us growing bird-sized dragonflies in the lab - there's plenty for evolution to overcome in that regard - but as far as normal day-to-day developmental plasticity is concerned, there's a fair amount of leeway in how large (or small, in oxygen-deprived environments) you can rear modern creepy crawlies with respect to atmospheric composition.</p>

After we have found out how to grow them to a suitable size we just need to attach an active breathing apparatus to thier own passive one and then we will finaly have Cyber-bug-horses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a genetic trait. Even in an oxygen-rich environment getting bigger isn't just a matter of scaling everything up, there are all sorts of structural adjustments that have to be made. In the Carboniferous there would have been plenty of insects with sizes similar today; the large-bodied ones were just offshoots of these groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true but there's one other component: competition from vertebrates and specifically birds.  Oxygen level places a limit on insect size, and up until birds start to become common flying insect size tracks oxygen concentration closely.  But after that point, insects decrease in size and stop tracking oxygen levels...they can't get big even when the atmosphere would allow it because they can't compete/deal with birds in those size ranges.</p>
<p>You can still see this phenomenon in some islands (eg, New Zealand), where lack of vertebrate competition and predation (in this case terrestrial) allows insects to fill some larger niches (but not get as big as they could if oxygen levels were higher).   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for this. Im a biologist and my evolutionary ecology professor used to say this. In fact, most insects today could likely be much larger than they are, it really is the competition from animals today that stops that. There were no birds, bats etc. in the air back when the gigantic dragonflies reigned. Even though they were inefficient back then, they had no competition. Today that has changed. Increase the oxygyn today, and youll like not get much larger insects in a natural environment.
Ofcourse oxygyn plays are role, but its to a much lesser extend than we've made it out to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall scientific studies that sampled air bubbles trapped in amber indicating oxygen levels as high as 35%; and at the time critics claiming these were unreasonably high. It was suggested with a 35% oxygen level, forest fires would expand into explosive firestorms that would burn continental sized swatches of land down to the bedrock. It was suggested the amber matrix would preferentially allow other gases to diffuse out while retaining oxygen in the bubble. Certainly it appears there were higher concentrations of oxygen in the atmoshphere in previous eras than exists today, but the maximum level is still subject to some debate. The wikipedia article on the history of oxygen concentration in the atmosphere contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_oxygen#/media/File:Oxygenation-atm-2.svg" target="_blank">this graph</a> suggesting low estimates put the oxygen concentration in the carboniferous era at no higher than it is today (with high end estimates at the 35% you cite). Other sources I've seen suggest the maximum concentration topped at ~ 28%,</p></div>		</li>
