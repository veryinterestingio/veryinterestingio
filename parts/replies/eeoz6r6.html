			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, that is how it's SUPPOSED to work. Too often, the parent is put in the oversight position of the child's trust fund and they use that money to splurge on luxuries. The ink on the paper was barely dry when, according to her biography, Shirley Temple became an adult and discovered that her dad pretty much had blown it all. It's not as isolated as you might think, even in more modern times. <a href="https://people.com/crime/child-stars-who-have-sued-their-parents/" target="_blank">Here's a few such incidents over the last few decades</a>. </p>
<p>As bad as that sounds, a lot has to do with the morals of the parents. Johnny Whitaker, Jodie from Family Affair, was surprised when he turned 18 that his trust fund wasn't in the millions, but his dad showed him the paper work. I don't recall how much he received, I want to say around the $100K area, but all of the expenses from his earnings were justified. As his dad told him, they didn't squander the money: &quot;You don't see us living in a mansion and driving expensive luxury cars, do you?&quot; Mary Kate and Ashley fall also fall into that area, but I think their parents handled their cash better, so that, upon their adulthood, they were able to start their own businesses.</p>
<p>Much depends on the moral compass of the parents/guardians that are handling the cash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many child actors lack that family support: too often, they're seen as a quick paycheck. After they hit puberty until they're around 16 to 18, they are unmarketable. If they land a part in such a show that takes them through those &quot;lean&quot; years, they often go on and remain in the industry. Since that doesn't happen often, there is an organization called A Minor Consideration to help those former child actors. It was started by Paul Peterson (Jeff Stone on the Donna Reed Show and was a Mousketeer on The Mickey Mouse Club) after another former child actor, Rusty Hamer from Make Room For Daddy, committed suicide. </p>
<p>I remember reading an interview with the cast of Family Affair in TV guide back when the show was still in production. While Whitaker and Cathy Garver didn't have what seemed as an unusual family life, I was struck by Anissa Jones' family life. It seemed less than ideal. Her parents were in a long custody battle for her, which ended with her dad getting custody. He passed away shortly after. However, she was in that age bracket that made it difficult for her to find work. With the tumultuous home life, it was no wonder that, at the age of 18, she was found dead by an accidental drug overdose. </p>
<p>Perhaps SAG-AFTRA should look into adding family counseling to their child actor rules. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Further research shows me that no this is not a thing outside California. How wild. </p>
<p>Edit 2: More further research shows that it is a thing outside California, but it’s called a “blocked trust account”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One parent/guardian must be on the set during the child's working day, and, IIRC, the studio pays them a wage to be there. Live theater, OTOH, has what they call a child wrangler that has multiple duties, including keeping the kids out of trouble and tutoring their lessons.</p>
<p>Appropriate fees allowed for taking care of a child actor include publicity shots, management agency fees, travel expenses, accountant services and union dues. Every year, that accountant should be able to go over the income/outgo of the child's earnings. Most kids haven't a clue as to how much they have in their trust funds, but the smart parent goes over these financial docs with them and lets them know what they are worth. The Howard family comes to mind, as Ron and Clint both talk about how their parents, both actors as well, &quot;dragged&quot; them into these boring meetings to go over those finances when they were kids. They'd have rather played baseball than go through that. Well, they're still very active in the entertainment business and the parents lived of their own earnings. Beverly Hills home? Nah, just a middle class house in a middle class neighborhood, although how much that house is worth today compared to when they bought it... </p>
<p>There is always a parent out there that is more than willing to take advantage of their child's success. Too often, they believe the money will never stop. The few movies Shirley Temple did as an adult was to make some quick cash (as opposed to being a clerk in a department store) and may be another reason why she married so young.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's also the reason why often times you'll have 16 year olds playing like 12 year olds. It's way less of a headache to deal with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also seen a surprising number of twentysomethings playing high schoolers. I'm watching a show and thinking I'm a complete pervert for thinking the actress is attractive, look up on IMDB and find out she's 24. Then I watch a show with a real 16 year old and they're so immature and annoying most of the time. Night and day difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were a lot of shows I couldn’t stand to watch in my early 20s because I just couldn’t enjoy trying to pretend that someone who was clearly older than me was actually younger than me. Didn’t have that problem when I was younger than the character, and now that I’m getting to the point where I’m usually as old or older than the actor it’s become less of an issue again.</p></div>		</li>
