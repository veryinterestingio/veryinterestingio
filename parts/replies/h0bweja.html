			<div class="markdown"><p>How is the debt payment order determined? If the estate doesn't have enough money to pay everyone back, can the next of kin specify to repay debts with co-signers first, leaving them in a better position overall? Is that determined by a judge? Are they just paid proportionally to the debt?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The exact order of payment for insolvent estates is based on state law. However, generally speaking, debts that are owed to the government (for example, unpaid taxes) get highest claim. Medical bills are sometimes given priority. Any loan that is secured by a lien on property, like a mortgage or a car loan, still has that property interest at death, so whoever would nominally inherit the asset has to either commit to paying the loan or allow it to be seized by the creditor. Unsecured debts, like credit card debt or personal loans, are all generally given the same priority. If the estate doesn't have enough money to pay all of those creditors after accounting for and liquidating assets as appropriate/necessary, everybody takes a pro rata amount of what money there is. So if you have $10,000 in credit card debt on your American Express, $5,000 on a Visa, and $5,000 on a MasterCard and die with only $10,000 in assets in your state after satisfying all the higher priority creditors, American Express would get $5,000, Visa would get $2,500, and MasterCard would get $2,500.</p>
<p>Cosigners are generally jointly responsible for the debt and always were. The death of one of the parties doesn't mean the other party can escape the loan or try to finagle things so that the estate pays those loans off first contrary to state law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the informative response! Followup question: if someone was near death, knew they had more debt than assets and had some financial liquidity, it would make sense for them to pay down co-signed loans as a favor to their co-signers, correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the cosigner situation, but to me at least if there's an asset in question at least it gives the person a chance to take over the loan and thus the property. Student loans are complete bullshit and it should die with the student regardless of cosigner; there is no tangible asset, they are just paying a random debt. It might as well be credit card debt, and it makes sense that that's paid through the estate or let go. If I die in a random accident, my parents will be bankrupted and have nothing to show for it...its robbery IMHO.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's some bullshit right there, if I died then you didn't do a good job now did you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other response, debts to the estate lawyer (for handling the estate) and the funeral parlor generally come first.  Because otherwise you’d have to prove that they were going to get paid and poor people wouldn’t be able to find someone to bury them/ provide estate services.</p>
<p>Also generally life insurance benefits don’t count towards the estate.</p>
<p>Found this out dealing when I was 25 and dealing with my FIL’s estate when he died at 55 or a heart attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A simpler response than others here - accounts go into a process called &quot;probate&quot; where all of this is figured out by the courts. All the priorities and rankings listed in other responses are contingent on the state and situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Filial responsibility laws aren't really a thing - there have been a few highly published cases about them but the media reporting on them is terrible.</p>
<p>State filial responsibility laws are all pre-empted by Medicaid, which does not allow a medical provider (such as a nursing home) to bill third parties - even if those third parties are family members.</p>
<p>The rare cases in which a nursing home has successfully pursued a filial responsibility claim all fall into the same category - the nursing home patient refused to apply for Medicaid and the family member against whom enforcement is sought also refused to supply the information necessary for the nursing home to file for Medicaid.  The assumption in these cases is that the family member is hiding assets for the patient.  </p>
<p>In other words, the family member is helping to hide assets so the patient can claim they're indigent and get out of having to pay the nursing home.  At the same time, they're not filing for Medicaid - which pays for the care of indigent people - because they aren't <em>actually</em> indigent and Medicaid is a lot better at locating assets than a state level court.  </p>
<p>Were the family member not helping to hide the assets, then the patient themselves would be able to pay out of pocket for the care.  The reason the family member is helping to hide the assets is that they're trying to increase the size of their inheritance, which would otherwise be depleted if the non-indigent patient had to use said assets to pay for their own care.</p></div>		</li>
