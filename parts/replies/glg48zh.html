<p>Home chicken keepers sometimes feed old eggshells back to their chickens.</p>

<p>Yes, but you have to be careful to mash up the eggshells small enough so that the chickens don't recognize them as eggshells, or else they'll start to eat their own eggs after they lay them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the recycle rate on eggshell consumption, I wonder? Like, it must take a lot of calcium to make the shell in the first place, but how much would they get back just by eating eggshells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Always gave them all egg shells, never crushed them, and never had that happen. Only a few chickens at a time, but over years and years. Of course that's not a great evidence, but not hearing about it from people who had chickens for decades is weirder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of superstitions out there about chickens eating their own eggs.</p>
<p>One thing I think a lot of people aren't aware of is that hens will tend to test the integrity of their eggs by giving them a bit of a peck and a nudge.  If they break, well yeah, they're going to eat them, but it also means they're probably lacking in calcium and the shells aren't strong enough.</p>
<p>A lot of the people who are feeding back the shells may not also be supplementing with enough oyster shell. Obviously there are diminishing returns on just feeding back the same shells over and over so not surprising some of those hens end up with more fragile eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chickens do not care.  I have had ones that waited for a hen to finish laying so they could help themselves to her eggs.  I have also seen a group of them gang up on and rip off the wing of one of the other chickens in their flock and eat it.  If they recognize old eggshells from their eggs, they don't give a cluck.</p></div>		</li>
