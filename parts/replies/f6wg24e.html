<p>Unless all the planets in the OPs video have the exact same resampling / compression then you really can't compare any of them to each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but it might also be the only way to get any useful/interesting results.  </p>
<p>They likely needed to be 'tuned' separately simply to produce audible sounds. At that point you may as well take some artistic license.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. And I get that if you were in space you wouldn't even hear these sounds. But imagine if you did... How absolutely terrifying it would be when approaching Saturn. </p>
<p>Also, as to why it's &quot;eerie&quot;... It literally sounds like screams.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha, my dad works on the instruments that provide the source for these sounds... I feel obligated to have some input. </p>
<p>Basically, these instruments are measuring radio waves produced by the van allen belt equivalent of other planets. The magnetic fields of planetsâ€™ funnels charged particles from the sun somewhat similar to a fluorescent bulb (think aurora). </p>
<p>Bit of a side note: Jupiter and Saturn in particular have <em>much</em> stronger magnetic fields than earth. So much so that in order to give Juno (orbiting Jupiter) a decent lifespan, they had to put it in a elliptical orbit that keeps it very close to Jupiter only a small fraction of the time; the radiation created by the magnetic field would otherwise fairly quickly dry the electronics.</p></div>		</li>
