			<div class="markdown"><p>Low frequencies vibrate less, so it makes sense that you can still generate those, but not the ones that require greater vibration frequency. </p>
<p>I had a similar experience after talking a lot at a trade show recently. By day three, I was talking in a lower register than I usually do, and my voice didn’t return to its full range for over a week. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a soprano vocalist and I don't even need to yell for my highest whistle notes to go bye-bye, just talking a bit too loudly for a short period of time is enough. The higher the note, the more fragile it is (temporarily - losing them permanently would require e.g. scarring). I love my voice, it's my instrument and all that, but sometimes it's a fickle beast to keep happy lol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>FYI whispering is no good when you’ve lost your voice so just.shut.up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Cords&quot; is a misnomer. We don't have little vertical cables in our necks that somehow are able to produce sound. They are called vocal folds and are located within the cartilage of the larynx situated over the &quot;wind-pipe&quot;. They are horizontal and V-shaped. When you blow air past them, they vibrate. Laryngitis is what causes you to lose your voice. When inflamed or overused, the vocal folds can lose their ability to vibrate, thus no sound can be produced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for the terminology, english is my third language. Thank you for pointing it out.<br />
I thought you could use Vocal cords as well as vocal folds, the same way you can use Voice box for Larynx. I used the latin names in my further explanation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, vocal cords is an accepted term. However, I try to correct it when I see it, especially when it leads to an incorrect understanding of the anatomy of the voice box (also accepted) :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Cords” is an appropriate term though. People use “folds” synonymously and there are a few technical differences. But “vocal cords” is definitely fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You piqued my interest so I google image searched &quot;vocal folds&quot;. At first I thought my SafeSearch setting had failed me. Then I realized the internet had ruined me.  Then I learned a whole bunch about the mechanism that makes it possible to speak and sing. </p>
