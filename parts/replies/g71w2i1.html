			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! We’d recommend starting with the tips from the First Draft Verification Guide: <a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/long-form-article/verifying-online-information/" target="_blank"><a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/long-form-article/verifying-online-information/" target="_blank">https://firstdraftnews.org/long-form-article/verifying-online-information/</a></a></p>
<p>Whether you’re looking at a video, meme, account or article, there are five basic checks you should run:</p>
<p><strong>Provenance</strong> (are you looking at the original?)</p>
<p><strong>Source</strong> (who created it?)</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong> (when?)</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong> (where was the account established, or the content created?)</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong> (why was it established or created?)</p>
<p>The more info you have for each of these questions, the stronger the verification.</p>
<p>For images, always use reverse image search to identify where else the image has  been posted, and when — this will help you figure out if the content has been miscontextualized or doctored.</p>
<p>For source credibility, I recommend Mike Caulfield’s advice to read laterally. Check what other sites and resources are saying about the source at which you’re looking. <a href="https://webliteracy.pressbooks.com/chapter/what-reading-laterally-means/" target="_blank"><a href="https://webliteracy.pressbooks.com/chapter/what-reading-laterally-means/" target="_blank">https://webliteracy.pressbooks.com/chapter/what-reading-laterally-means/</a></a></p></div>		</li>
