			<div class="markdown"><p>You would feel nothing at all. Just make sure to avoid anything metal or conductive when messing with battery terminals. It is always suggested to not wear any rings when you are touching the terminals. It is not because of the shock through you though. It is because if the metal creates a path from the positive to chassis ground, said metal will heat up a lot. Heat is caused from power dissipation, since metal effectively creates a short that metal is dissipating, in this case 12v*veryhighcurrent (P=IV). You should be careful when removing the leads, but in general touching a car battery is relatively safe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually. It's best if you dont fuck around with batteries, especially car ones.</p>
<p>While 12v is generally safe, car battery can deliver lethal currents given the right conditions. So while it's generally safe, if something out of the ordinary happens the results might be unpleasant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your touch both nothing will happen. However if you connect both with metal it would be bad as car batteries can put out a massive amount of current.</p></div>		</li>
