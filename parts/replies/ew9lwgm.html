			<div class="markdown"><p>Why go to the anthropic principal so readily? It's clear we don't understand 95% of the universe, as we have no clue what dark energy and matter really are. As such, it would be naive to assume that QFT is a complete theory and that its VEV prediction is correct, no? I could definitely be missing something nuanced as I dropped out of grad school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am completely on board with looking for non-anthropic explanations. (As I mentioned in my post, I've spent a good deal of time doing just that.) But none of those explanations we've come up with so far is particularly convincing. The solution is pretty straightforward: keep searching for non-anthropic (and ideally testable) alternatives, but also recognize that the anthropic explanation is probably the most plausible one we have so far, and has a decent amount of (indirect) support.</p></div>		</li>
