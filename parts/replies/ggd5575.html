<p>I assume that whenever the laptop is even slightly charged, or always when it's plugged in, some part of it is always on &quot;a little bit&quot; to detect pressing the power key?</p>

<p>Yes, that's correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The necessary power demands to check for a button press are actually 0; the button press completes a circuit just as throwing a switch does.</p>
<p>That said, a laptop does take some power when “off” (also sometimes they look off but are sleeping), but it shouldn’t be much at all; on a well-designed laptop not configured to “power nap” (turn itself back on to check for email, etc), the power loss from the battery’s normal rate of internal discharge would surely be greater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually not. Pressing the power button goes to a special subsystem (on a Mac this is the SMC, System Management Controller) which handles power related functions. It’ll have firmware on it that gets ran by the power button press and then checks a few things before powering on the rest of the logic board. Things like the dead battery symbol are written directly to these chips and sent directly to the display if the battery is under a certain charge level without ever running Mac OS. So no, it isn’t a little bit on. It’s off and the power button press completes a circuit on a very small subsystem, which will in turn power on the rest of the computer. </p>
<p>Now, when it’s plugged in, that SMC will periodically wake up to do things. It’ll wake up to check battery health and cut the charge circuit to the battery for instance or check for software updates, though that probably requires partially booting.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Pedantic but essentially the same thing that was already said. And yes, this chip and the PSU have power to it so it can do work. The circuit that is completed is an IC not the mains power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and fun fact - the same part is used to keep the computer's clock ticking, so that you see the correct time when you next start it up. Some computers also have an option to schedule a start-up, so if you turn it off, it turns on again on its own at the time you tell it to. That uses the same clock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motherboards have a little watch battery installed in them called the CMOS battery for low level system functions like keeping system time and retaining BIOS settings, etc. In that sense, the computer is never truly off even when you unplug it or take the main battery out.</p></div>		</li>
