			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say, there’s some very complex classical music. A lot of the classical music I enjoy would probably be considered simple, but I love a lot of the more complex pieces too. I also love metal, some more “simple” bands but also a lot of progressive/math metal. It’s an interesting theory though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst complicated in a musical sense it is still based on musical patterns and normal musical theories. It is these patterns which make it compressible.</p>
<p>Think of hitting keys within a chord all being harmonious whereas hitting one outside contains dissonance. The pattern of the notes in the chord is the important bit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing wrong with repetitive music. It's much better for dancing. Different types of music have different goals. You just have to learn how to listen to it to appreciate it.</p></div>		</li>
