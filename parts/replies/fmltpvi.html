			<div class="markdown"><p>Vi Hart (a mathematician) talked about a specific instance of this <a href="https://youtu.be/ahXIMUkSXX0" target="_blank">in her fibanacci videos</a>, about why it seems like the fibanacci sequence turns up all over the place (it takes a while for her to get there, but she does).  </p>
<p>It's interesting because it's not just genetics and hormones, but also the concentration of hormones and how hormones get used up.  It will be very pattern based.  It's a kind of cool intersection of math and biology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard for me to see how you can separate biology and math. The number of things, the number of things and how they interact with one another, the availability of interactions, the strength of interactions, and the time interactions take pretty much sums up all of biology and our understanding of it amounts to a big complicated mathematical model (with huge gaping holes in it at present, but still remarkably useful).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, thigmomorphogenesis is really driven by genetics and the environment- and the hormones are just the mechanism. I'd like to know the fundamental reason for crown gnarliness</p></div>		</li>
