<p>Evolution has also done some horrible things. For instance, being raped by a psychopath successfully creates offspring. As far as evolution is concerned, let‚Äôs just reinforce that sucker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to be careful with these kinds of things though. Just because it sounds intuitive doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right. We have a very manufactured view of what people were like ‚Äúback then‚Äù and so these kinds of explanations are really affirming the images as shown to us through pop culture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still not sure how we managed to evolve this far without baking a tendency to rape into our dna. Now that I think of it, it's probably that whatever groups our ancestors formed simply viewed it as unacceptable and the pyschos simply never reached the critical mass required to change that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ancestors viewing it as unacceptable is probably the biggest reason. It‚Äôs counter-social behaviour in a species whose biggest strength is being social. Anything that makes the group fail or not want to help you is bad for your survival and the survival of your DNA.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some people's clocks are set to a slightly different time.</p></div>		</li>
