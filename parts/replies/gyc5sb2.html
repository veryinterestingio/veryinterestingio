			<div class="markdown"><p>Just don’t. </p>
<p>The problem is when you sit in the office all day, you come home tired and exhausted and order pizza and beer. </p>
<p>If you have the mental strength, at least skip breakfast and do some exercise. Since you’ll be tired and exhausted all the time from your job you need some way to force you. Commuting by foot or bicycle is a great way, if possible. Going to the gym with friends or colleagues on a regular schedule is great as well. A regular Sunday bicycle ride with friends is also a great addition.</p></div>		</li>
