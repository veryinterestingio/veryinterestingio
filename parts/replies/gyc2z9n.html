			<div class="markdown"><p>Nicely explained! Excuse my ignorance, but if the damage is mostly caused by the immune system trying to get rid of the virus, then how does a person with low immunity have worse symptoms than a person with a more efficient immunity? In my head it sort of makes sense that no immunity = no immune response = no symptoms.</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed response!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the immune response is low, that's when the virus can actually run rampant and cause damage itself. Even though our own immune response damages our tissues, it's there for a reason. Additionally, those peoples' defense mechanisms are further weakened by the infection, which can then predispose them to other, even more severe infections with bacteria or fungi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For an analogous explanation: think of &quot;immunity&quot; as shutting down foreign invaders just as they cross the border into your land <em>because the border patrol has been trained to recognize the enemy</em>. Without that recognition by the border patrol force the invaders are able to march on in. As they begin wreaking havoc along the way we eventually come to the decision enough is enough. Time to organize the militia. Once you finally are able to mobilize the troops and train them on enemy recognition, you've still got to fight them off from wherever they've managed to infiltrate/capture. This may result in your own fighters causing infrastructural damage simply due to the destructive nature of war.</p></div>		</li>
