			<div class="markdown"><p>The notion of &quot;humans&quot; still existing on a timescale like billions of years is pretty amusing. For scale, keep in mind that that the very earliest dinosaurs were a little over 200 million years ago—T+2By Earth will have our current era and earliest life all lumped together into &quot;start of the planet's biosphere&quot; territory.</p>
<p>Best case scenario, using a very anthropocentric lens, is that a biological or (much more likely) technological descendent of humanity still exists somewhere (Earth or otherwise). There'd be absolutely no observable remnant of what our current species has done or will do within a fraction of that time, however (barring something like an incredibly lucky and very planned time capsule), so the relevance of &quot;humans&quot; outside of a historical footnote kind of like the one we have for proto-lifeforms now is dubious.</p>
<p>Much more likely is that we're gone with no continuation much earlier than that. Even discounting the whole Great Filter hypothesis (or arrogantly assuming we're beyond self-annihilation), there's a whole host of catastrophic natural events that would at the very least put our species to the brink each time—and eventually, sooner or later, it's bad enough that humans don't bounce back. These kind of events all seem incomprehensibly rare on a time scale as short as human civilization, but on something spanning millions (let alone billions!) of years, it's pretty much certain that there are going to be a great many of them.</p>
<p>That seems depressing, but it doesn't need to be. The whole universe is on a one-way ride, and any notion of &quot;permanent legacy&quot; on a cosmological scale was impossible from the get-go. We derive our personal meanings from the time we live (even if we try to couch it in philosophical veils to the contrary) and so too will our or any other species as a collective. We can and should &quot;be excellent to one another&quot; not for the sake of naively trying to perpetuate ourselves into an absent infinity, but because the relative present is what we can and should do something about. That's actually inspiring rather than depressing, if you ask me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually considered this as a fourth possibility.  But I feel as though relocating might be a more feasible option.  But who knows what innovations humans will make if our species makes it that far.</p></div>		</li>
