			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, a single horn thrust directly in a straight line thrust into a body has better force distribution than two horns ( which are frequently angled outwards )thrust into a body. There is less chance of actually breaking a single straight horn, thrust straight into the enemy than there is of breaking  one of a pair of horns ( usually set at an angle to the motion of the thrust). Similarly, straight horns would be better suited to actually impairing enemies than curves or branching horns. On a curved horn the tip off the horn is not actually in line with the source of the thrusting force ( you see this when competing curved swords to straight swords ).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your analysis makes more sense saying one horn would be better for them than two. Only two horn advantage that made sense to me was saying that females preferred them over one horn males (though I don't know why that would be).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do actually think it has much more to do with bilateral symmetry than anything else. I’d also say that, in a great many cases, horns evolved as a mating display; starting out small with no real value in a fight. Things like deer use them to duel over breeding rights but, even that usage is kind of ritualized. I don’t think the horns on most land animals took their bilateral form because it was better for combat. </p>
<p>Even studies of dinosaur fossils have indicated that triceratops horns were probably for sexual display purposes rather then combat because directly impaling a big carnivorous theropod with them would have caused them to break.</p></div>		</li>
