<p>I hope this format is okay! Just getting used to it!  </p>
<p>To be honest not much of it surprised us just because as you say, most people who grew up with video games are very much in tune with the realities I think. Though we were surprised about how many non-criminologists who we spoke to in passing that had noticed the same thing. I think at times because we naturally pay a bit more attention to ‘criminal behaviour’ due to our jobs, we thought that perhaps we were going off the deep end and people would think we had talked ourselves in circles. I think the moment we knew it wasn’t just us sat as an echo chamber was when we were discussing in in an Uber on the way to the pub as we left work one night and the driver joined in with gusto!</p>
<p>I think the one thing that was most unexpected was the fraud though. We were aware of instance of fraud happening in games such as World of War Craft and EVE Online, but whilst writing the National Crime Agency (the British version of the FBI) made a statement about how many cyber criminals they are detecting who started this way. The fact The Big Bang had already touched on this gave us a chuckle!</p>
