<p>I wanted to tag along a link to Reaction Engines and their Sabre engine which combines elements of a rocket and an air breathing engine. The core of the idea is an air cooling system that lowers the temperature of intake air by over 1000 degrees centigrade so that air can effectively be used to burn fuel for thrust. When the intake air is at 1000 degrees centigrade the additional heat from the oxidation of fuel is not a large enough relative change in temperature to produce thrust. </p>
<p>The ability to use the oxygen from the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds allows for a large reduction in the lift penalty caused by carrying both oxidizer and fuel to run a rocket engine. So this space plane could lift off with 4/5ths of its fuel weight budget as methane and 1/5 as oxygen. This allows for a much larger weight budget for cargo and passengers. </p>
<p>In all current rocket engines the need to lift all the oxidizer all the way orbit means 90% of the weight budget is fuel and 5% is structure leaving only 5% for passengers and supplies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the late 1950's they theorized a <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930085302.pdf" target="_blank">hypersonic atomic oxygen recombination powered engine</a>  for use above 300,000 feet (91km) &amp; 7940m/s. The energy was to be derived from the recombination of UV dissociated oxygen from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I am often amazed at how many schemes for air and spacecraft propulsion people dreamed up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This report presents a preliminary study of a ramjet that would use
the chemical energy of dissociated molecules in the ionosphere for propulsion.
A review of the physical properties and chemical composition
of the upper atmosphere shows that the available energy is not sufficient
for flight requiring aerodynamic lift. Above 300,000 feet, dissociation
energy might be useful for satellite-sustaining. Comparison of maximum
thrust and external drag for an orbiting ramjet from 300,000 to 700,000
feet shows that a positive net-thrust margin might be obtained over the
entire region for the engine sizes considered. However, the region
between 325,000 and 400,000 feet is the most favorable, because
high gas densities produce high recombination rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That region between 325,000 and 400,000 feet is most useful for reconnaissance satellites, but has high drag. Meaning they would have to carry a lot of conventional fuels to sustain it. That low altitude allows better resolution looks at the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to see a real batshit insane idea, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayaks" target="_blank">Soviet Ayaks program.</a> Everything about his god damn &quot;plane&quot; is novel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ayaks was projected to employ a novel engine that uses an MHD generator to collect and slow down highly ionized and rarefied air upstream airbreathing jet engines</p>
<p>The air is mixed with fuel into the mixture that burns in the combustor, while the electricity produced by the inlet MHD generator feeds the MHD accelerator located behind the jet engine near the single expansion ramp nozzle to provide additional thrust and specific impulse. The plasma funnel developed over the air inlet from the Lorentz forces greatly increases the ability of the engine to collect air, increasing the effective diameter of the air inlet up to hundreds of meters. It also extends the Mach regime and altitude the aircraft can cruise to. Thus, it is theorized that the Ayaks' engine can use atmospheric oxygen, even at heights above 35 kilometres </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is like using a star trek force field to increase the size of your air inlet a hundred fold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ayaks uses thermochemical reactors (TCRs): the heating energy from air friction is used to increase the heat capacity of the fuel, by cracking the fuel with a catalytic chemical reaction. The aircraft has double shielding between which water and ordinary, cheap kerosene circulates in hot parts of the airframe. The energy of surface heating is absorbed through heat exchangers to trigger a series of chemical reactions in presence of a nickel catalyzer, called hydrocarbon steam reforming. Kerosene and water spits into a new fuel reformate: methane (70–80% in volume) and carbon dioxide (20–30%) in a first stage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's fuel is it's coolant and it uses the heat generated from how fast it's going to turn a dense fuel into a much lighter and more efficient fuel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As altitude increases, the electrical resistance of air decreases according to Paschen's law. The air at the nose of Ayaks is ionized. Besides e-beams and HF pulse discharges, a high voltage is produced by the Hall effect in the MHD generator that allows a planar glow discharge to be emitted from the sharp nose of the aircraft and the thin leading edges of its wings, by a St. Elmo's fire effect. Such a plasma cushion in front and around the aircraft offers several advantages</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't even know how to make sense of this. This plane is like something you read on a wiki page for a sci-fi ship where the author just knew about a bunch of vague scientific concepts and mashed them all together in an attempt to sound smart.</p>
<p>Except this is real.</p>
<p>Edit: OH AND I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT IT'S ALSO A WAVERIDER. MOST OF IT'S LIFT COMES FROM THE COMPRESSION OF THE TAILING SUPERSONIC AIR PRESSURE INSTEAD OF ACTUAL WINGS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 50's were a heady time. We were trying out everything. Aviation was not perceived to be a stable field like it is today. Supersonic flight was a high priority goal because of the concept of an interceptor aircraft that could destroy enemy aircraft well outside of the US borders. We had no idea how fast we could really go. The math dominated the ideas because of the atomic bomb. If the math said an idea looked good, then why not pursue it. We didn't know what the limitations were.</p>
<p>Now we have databases of material properties that are available instantly to anyone on the internet. Now we have computers. I mean just consider the fact that the SR-71, the fastest maned aircraft ever at mach 3-4, was accomplished with paper drawings and slide rules. </p>
<p>Thinking through a problem has gotten faster and more accurate, but not much different from the 50's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've got a precooler, an extremely good precooler, which solves the problem of hypersonic compression heating. It's one of the holy grails of hypersonic flight, and  came out of  the British HOTOL project in the 1980s.</p>
<p>An assumption made (when putting Sabre into Skylon) is that all other rockets are disposable and expensive. If 90% of everyone else's weight budget is fuel, the implication is  that because rockets are so expensive, they can't be big enough for substantial payloads.</p>
<p>Skylon, the vehicle proposed to use Sabre, is... 90% fuel. Not only that, but it gets all its own mass into orbit, which cuts down on the mass it of payload it can put there. All Skylon's own mass is pretty much wasted, that's coming back down again.</p>
<p>This is  the problem with SSTO or part-SSTO designs, their own mass directly eats into payload mass. 1 kg more craft mass is 1 kg less payload mass (and something like 40 kg more fuel mass). You're unavoidably orbiting mass you don't actually want in orbit. This is why a more recent Skylon design gets suborbital and then a second stage pops out of it to do the orbital burn. So... it's a really complex and expensive version of a Falcon 9.</p>
<p>Going back to the assumption that all other rockets are disposable and expensive, the economics of an SSTO start to look extremely bad if you can start recovering and reusing your rockets. Skylon's cost to LEO will be similar to Falcon 9 (part-reusable, but very cheaply built) and Starship (wholly reusable).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regards to economics, the turn around time and airframe lifetime is crucial to high utilisation levels, and so good return on vehicle cost.</p>
<p>I believe Skylon is proposed to not need any refurbishment after each mission (like ablative heat shield, or refurbing engines) </p>
<p>iirc Falcon 9’s that have been recovered do need a fair bit of TLC to turn them around again, and their overall number of missions per airframe isn’t massive.</p>
<p>A falcon 9 is obviously cheaper per mission than a regular rocket, but I wouldn’t discount the skylon as potentially cheaper again.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This misses the point, I think. Rockets are expensive. Fuel cost is almost a side note relative to total launch cost. Rockets can also only take off and land from very specific points, which makes getting to certain orbits more expensive.</p>
<p>In theory, Skylon can be price competitive with F9 but get 5-10x the number of flights. It should also hypothetically be able to have a faster turnaround time with less infrastructure, as no stacking is required. It can take off from long runways, meaning greater access to space from different parts of the world.</p>
<p><em>If</em> Starship hits the multiple flights per day cadence that Elon dreams of, Skylon will probably be superfluous. BUT, if it falls short of that cadence, Skylon could be a very promising vehicle to build a permanent presence in LEO. As commercial stations get built, having a shuttle/ferry that can move cargo and people back and forth with regularity and potentially greater comfort than a typical rocket is a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So we have chlorine trifluoride, which can decompose and fluorinate oxides (e.g. silica), and then we have atomic oxygen, which can oxidise fluorides. Neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow: “Sulfur compounds defeated him, because the thermodynamics were just too titanic. Hydrogen sulfide, for example, reacts with four molecules of FOOF to give sulfur hexafluoride, 2 molecules of HF and four oxygens. . .and 433 kcal, which is the kind of every-man-for-himself exotherm that you want to avoid at all cost. The sulfur chemistry of FOOF remains unexplored, so if you feel like whipping up a batch of Satan’s kimchi, go right ahead.
Update: note that this is 433 kcal per mole, not per molecule (which would be impossible for even nuclear fission and fusion reaction (see here for the figures). Chemists almost always think in energetics in terms of moles, thus the confusion. It’s still a ridiculous amount of energy to shed, and you don’t want to be around when it happens.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/02/26/sand_wont_save_you_this_time" target="_blank">Chlorine trifluoride</a> is a <em>very</em> nasty chemical, because it combines two halogen elements into one compound. Atoms are generally chemically non-reactive when their outer or valence electron shells are full (as is the case with the very unreactive noble gases such as neon, argon and xenon). However, the <em>most</em> reactive elements tend to be those which just need to gain or lose one electron to reach the sweet nirvana of a full valence shell. Halogen elements exist in the state of needing one electron to fill its valence shell, and here you have four of them packaged into one rather unstable molecule. Chlorine trifluoride has been known to react with things such as sand (silicon dioxide), which is a compound that ordinarily <em>shouldn't</em> burn because it's so stable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, once chlorine and fluorine have combined with another element and filled their valence shell, they generally form some very stable compounds (think of table salt - sodium chloride - or teflon - polytetrafluoroethylene). However, as /u/Hattix mentioned, at hypersonic speeds the air gets so hot around the vehicle that the oxygen molecules (generally reactive enough on their own at high temperatures) break apart to give atomic oxygen. Oxygen in its molecular form is reactive because it has one electron space to fill in the valence shell per atom; atomic oxygen has two electron spaces to fill per atom and is so reactive that it's been known to break apart the normally-very-stable fluoride compounds.</p></div>		</li>
