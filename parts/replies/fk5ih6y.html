			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason I have difficulty getting into watching a live DJ is that I pretty much have to take their word for it that they're doing something.  Obviously there's some production done in the recording of the original music.  And then there is production going on live.  I can't necessarily distinguish the two while listening so I just wind up not interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve never gotten much out of watching DJs who just use electronic syncopation, e.g. MPC or Ableton setups matched with CD and a laptop.  I get there’s a lot going on but it’s all under the hood.  Turning knobs for a pass filter or triggering flange, stutters, panning...it’s all cool, but not fun to watch.  I miss watching the actual disc jockeys spinning and scratching.  That was always wizardry to me.</p>
<p>Not hating on how it’s evolved or gatekeeping in any way, I promise.  The new way makes total sense, but spinning, mixing, and scratching is an enigma to me, and that’s what makes it fun to watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to think this but when you go and see a DJ set where you recognise most of the tunes, you can fully appreciate the mixing and blending that goes on.</p>
<p>Not to mention the skill it takes to double drop and keep a mix in key with various melodies and vocals.</p>
<p>Having said that, my genre of choice is dnb which is often considered to be one of the best for technical DJing - not that I've ever got into mixing myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the DJ.  Wedding djs are notorious for not doing much except making sure the right song is playing at the right time ie first dance.  No transitions between songs because no one cares or notices or they can just use the auto mix option in the software and its mostly standing around looking busy or sitting down in front of the computer and pretending to do stuff.  Though some just outright play on their phones.</p></div>		</li>
