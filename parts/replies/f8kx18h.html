			<div class="markdown"><p>What if, leading up to the liposuction, you drained a few pints from the patient?  Like they get their own blood back while having it sucked out.   </p>
<p>Also I thought this is what plasma was for but honestly I'm not really up to speed on how any of this works.</p>
<p>Edit:  thank you for the responses.  I was expecting some half-assed responses but got more than that.   A lot of new things to read about and learn!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Transfusions are reserved for cases where they are necessary. There is never enough blood available (or the correct type, at the right place, at the right time) so I seriously doubt anyone could justify the ethics of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can opt for self transfusions and blood recycling machines.</p>
<p>But that's not the problem, they are not only losing blood but also part of the circulating space, if you transfuse you can saturate the body hemodynamics</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again false, putting you at 0/3 so far.  You don’t give blood transfusions during liposuctions because you don’t need to unless something has gone horribly wrong. This is because the blood loss associated with a well performed tumescent liposuction procedure should be minimal. Wait until you’re out of school (if you make it out) before showing off you medical knowledge to the interwebs. Plenty of cosmetic and reconstructive surgeries have been performed and required perioperative blood transfusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plastic surgeon here. Close but not exactly true. At least in the United States it's not a pound limit of liposuction but rather volume. With the advent of tumescent fluid you are essentially flooding the fat prior to suction with epinephrine and lidocaine which greatly limits blood loss. Instead the volume limit sits at around 5L because the fluid shifts in which blood shifts out of vessels and back into the interstitium and extracellular space after removal of the fat and fluid can be dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So u/cum_on_doorknob mentioned that the more fat cells that a person has requires more blood for cellular metabolism. Would it not stand to reason that removing those cells would lessen the need for the excess blood supply in the body since it no longer has to maintain those fat cells that were removed?  I probably butchered what he was trying to say with my paraphrasing, but hopefully you get what I mean.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick search suggests that adipose tissue is about 90-95% the density of water. So 5l of it would be very close to 10lbs.</p>
<p>The expert above did mention flooding the tissue before it was removed, so it's possible that some of the 5l taken out is made up of that tumescent fluid, but I expect it does come out pretty much the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day people would actually die from toxicity of local anesthetic via tumescent lidocaine. The addition of epinephrine to lidocaine constricts blood vessels, decreases blood loss, and (for a time) allowed for nearly limitless liquidation and extraction of adipocytes....until people started to die from cardiovascular collapse from all the lidocaine. </p>
