			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanna expand a bit that while sex started out as something to simply reproduce in many species it evolved to be more than that.</p>
<p>It isn't like modern humans all of the sudden started cheating the system with birth control.</p>
<p>Non-reproductive sex is part of the system. </p>
<p>Like with bonobos who have non-reproductive sex for various different reasons: &quot;BBC - Earth - Do bonobos really spend all their time having sex?&quot; <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160317-do-bonobos-really-spend-all-their-time-having-sex" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160317-do-bonobos-really-spend-all-their-time-having-sex</a></p>
<p>It is a bit hard to talk about these issues without simplifying it so much it becomes nonsense, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>But sex and the hormones released can build trust, it builds intimacy and care.</p>
<p>It can help relax and focus and other things as well.</p>
<p>A group with more trust and stronger bonds are more likely to succeed in passing their genetic offspring on than a group with worse.</p>
<p>Also worth noting that it isn't only your own kids that carry your genes, your siblings children and even your cousins children carry a significant part of your genes as well. So it is evolutionary worthwhile to keep them alive.</p>
<p>(The gay uncle theory of biological homosexuality uses this for example)</p>
<p>I would recommend the book sex at dawn for anyone interested, not because it is THE TRUTH (because it really isn't, there is a lot of pure speculation and parts that goes against research.) but because it certainly brings a much needed wider perspective from the limited and narrowminded view of sex and relationships we are being told by the culture we live in.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scientific debate I have seen regarding the book is a lot more nuanced than that. One can read the reception part on Wikipedia to get a glimpse of that.</p>
<p>And I made sure to say that it isn't the truth because a lot of it is unsubstantiated speculation at best.</p>
<p>But the general social understanding and our perceptions about sex are not based in scientific research but in a culture that is very limited and likes to present the cultural status quo as a biological fact and that book brings a much needed perspective imo.</p></div>		</li>
