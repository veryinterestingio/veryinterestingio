			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the scar,  cat scratch scar on my hand has faded a lot,  (had it now 30yrs) the scar from my surgery for my broken arm,  still quite prominent after 34yrs. So I wonder if the deeper the wound resulting in the scar,  the longer it stays?</p>
<p>I've had scars disappear over time,  (I was accident prone)  but rock in forehead scar,  still there,  swing accident scar on hairline still there,  but the ones from cuts,  gone</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably depends on where your scar is too. Your hands in general will see a lot more wear than the rest of your body so it makes sense a scar would fade.</p>
<p>I have a large burn scar on my upper arm that is pretty much the same now as it was 20 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depth would describe the difference between cuts,  but those last few sound like more damaging injuries. Ie, a rock fucks up your skin more than a clean cut at the same depth- takes longer to heal and even longer to fade, if it ever does</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scars aren't really made of cells.  They're made of the scaffolding material between cells that hold your cells together (mostly collagen), and it doesn't get broken up and replaced really unless it's damaged or missing.  </p>
<p>Scarring is the quick and dirty, low-cost patch job that lets us get back to functional and sealed up against the environment faster than a proper regeneration would, especially for animals as large as us.  It's kind of an evolutionary superpower, as much as we don't like it. However, since the incentives in evolution are all about survival and reproduction, fixing the fix job later isn't really on the agenda.</p></div>		</li>
