			<div class="markdown"><p>This. The Ethernet spec only goes up to 10G for copper cable where as HDMI starts around that and goes up from there.
Sata is 3 or 6G, USB is now 5G.</p>
<p>It's also worth considering how many of these standards started. When USB was born twisted pair ethernet was just starting to get to 100Mbps. To keep things backward compatible newer versions of USB still don't use twisted pair- hence the distance limitation.</p>
<p>Edit: this answer is all within the context of what most ELI5 users think of as 'ethernet cable': CAT 5e,6.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>USB-C is not a data transfer standard. It is just a physical connector standard. A USB-C cable can be thunderbolt 3, USB 3.2 gen 1, 2, or ,2 2x2, USB 2, hell it could even be USB 1. The connector on the end doesn't indicate the data transfer speed at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So correct me if I'm wrong, my understanding is as you said, that ethernet was not a flexible product or adequate at the time, so many other types of cables/connections/protocols were developed for specific often very purposes -- however, as we've grown technologically, twisted pair we've realized is actually fucking fantastic, and we probably should have just made better twisted pair connections from the start instead of making all sorts of specialty connectors and protocols like HDMI, USB, and Firewire.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Twisted pair is used in HDMI.  The primary color signals and the timing signal all are dedicated twisted pairs.</p>
<p>Twisted Pair is good for EFI.  However bandwidth limits are being reached.  The reference design for HDMI 2.1 was actually bonded coax for each channel.</p>
<p>There are actually a lot of considerations that go into cable design.  No one solution fits all.  So different standards design to their use case needs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cat5 cables were plenty flexible.  <em>Too</em> flexible.  You could use them for power, analog audio to speakers, plain-old-telephone, etc.  Unless you knew how to read the different colored cables you could barely see in the connector, you wouldn't know if it was a &quot;normal&quot; cable, a &quot;crossover&quot; cable where some of the inner wires are switched, or some custom monstrosity someone was using to carry multiple telephone lines in one Cat5 cable without following a standard of any kind.  <em>All</em> of those different kinds of cables fit in <em>all</em> ethernet ports.</p>
<p>A similar problem existed with parallel ports and such.  The connector was a standard, but they're just pins connected to wires and people used the same connector for different purposes.</p>
<p>A large factor in USB's adoption was the <em>Universal</em> part.  You plug a USB cable into a USB port and it just works. You plug the end that fits in your computer's USB ports into the computer, and you plug the end that fits into the smaller port on your printer into the printer, and you're good to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RJ45 based ethernet is usually slower and only had now achieved 10Gb/s speed (and is extremely rare for home use at has slightly higher latency than 1gbps ethernet, though it's trivial for home usage). I.e. When 10mbps ethernet was popular, usb can do 12mbps, when 100mbps ethernet was popular, usb 2.0 can do 480mbps and when 1gbps is polular, usb gradually transitioned to 5gbps. </p>
<p>Twisted pair is good because it lowerd cross talk. Ethernet cable and usb cable both use it. However, there are more reason to using other connectors not just pure bandwidth, i.e.  protocol used, ability to carry power, ability to be daisy chained ...etc</p></div>		</li>

<p>100G is relatively common and easy to get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question. Why don't we just use the &quot;mini&quot; versions of connectors for everything? USB I kind of get because the mini/micro/C came way after the standard connector. But HDMI and DisplayPort mini have been around for years but only get used when there's not enough space for a full size port.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak for mini DP (try googling that at work) but mini HDMI can burn in hell for eternity. Both sides of the port are fragile, and they don't stay in to save their own lives. It's barely better than not having it at all.</p>
<p>You basically have to carry around a mini-to-full-size dongle to be able to use it, and at that point you might as well carry a TypeC-to-HDMI adapter instead. If you were thinking &quot;oh I'll just get mini-to-full-size cables&quot;, then that's not so much better than just leaving an adapter on the cable</p>
<p>I feel like they're mostly a marketing bullet point, and personally I would much rather have another Type C port than a mini-anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a lot of that is because of the misconception of ethernet being a cable at all. It’s not, it’s a protocol. Fiber is an Ethernet standard and is obviously capable of high bandwidth. It’s the copper variants (Cat-5/Cat-6) that have limited range and bandwidth capabilities.</p></div>		</li>
