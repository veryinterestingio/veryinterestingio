			<div class="markdown"><p>All explosives (except thermobaric explosives that function differently) have built in oxygen. Otherwise they couldn't function as explosives. Compare it to a fire? A fire sucks in quite a lot of oxygen over time, but since an explosion happens really fast how are they going to do that if they didn't have built in oxygen (not enough time to suck in oxygen from the air)?</p>
<p>Thermobaric weapons (fuel-air explosives) function differently. They create enough oxygen for the explosion by spreading the explosive over a large area and then igniting it. If you for example had a small explosive charge that scattered gasoline so that it became a cloud of small gasoline drops over a very large area. Then every gasoline drop would have a lot of oxygen around it, so that when a second ignition charge sets the gasoline on fire they have a lot of oxygen to use and it will ignite all at once.</p></div>		</li>
