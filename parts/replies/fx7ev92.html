			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good explanation.</p>
<p>Genuinely! </p>
<p>I have a question though, regarding the entire premise. In the sense of literary definition would this not simply be the case of semantics?</p>
<p>It seems to me to be an argument not on how well you can reason but on how well the semantic meaning can be conveyed/understood. </p>
<p>Apologies if this is a moot point and or stupid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they're actually arguing semantics, I would say it isn't &quot;No True Scotsman,&quot; but arguments about semantics are usually pretty useless in the first place; if two people can't reach a common definition of a term, they should just adopt different terminology for what they're saying.</p>
<p>I'll elaborate using the &quot;pacifist&quot; example.</p>
<p>Let's say &quot;Alex&quot; defines &quot;pacifist&quot; as &quot;someone who is completely unwilling to use violence under any circumstance.&quot;  Alex wouldn't want to include people who are willing to kill as a last resort as &quot;pacifists,&quot; because they obviously lack a sufficient commitment to the ideal of pacifism. Alex is caught in a circular reasoning fallacy, using the conclusion (&quot;if someone is a killer, they're not a pacifist&quot;) to prove one of the premises that the conclusion is based upon (&quot;pacifists don't kill&quot;).</p>
<p>On the other hand, &quot;Blake&quot; doesn't believe that people exist that match Alex's concept of pacifism, instead believing that anyone can find themselves in circumstances where they'd be willing to kill.  As such people don't exist, Blake feels that Alex's definition of &quot;pacifism&quot; is useless, describing no one, and that the word &quot;pacifism&quot; should instead be used to describe who explore every other option to solve problems, before employing violence as an absolute last resort.  Blake is caught in a Nirvana fallacy, refusing to accept a definition because there can't be a 100% guarantee of its accuracy.</p>
<p>If they try to discuss pacifism, the two will probably get hopelessly tangled in arguing the semantics of the word, with neither having much hope of convincing the other of the rightness of <em>their</em> definition of the term due to the fallacies ensnaring them, and they'll never be able to agree on anything useful.  It'd be easier for them to adopt new terminology, e.g. &quot;violence-as-a-last-resort (VLR) pacifists&quot; and &quot;no-violence-under-any-circumstances (NVUAC) pacifists.&quot;  Once you step back from the contentious term, both would probably agree that a VLR pacifist might have stabbed someone to death, but a NVUAC pacifist couldn't have (or, at least, had forfeited any claim to the term by doing so).</p>
<p>Generally, though, accusations of &quot;No True Scotsman&quot; aren't levied against people using circular reasoning to argue semantics; instead, those people are just accused of, well, arguing semantics.  NTS is more often used as a &quot;moving the goalposts&quot; fallacy.  For an example, the political term &quot;RINO&quot; (&quot;Republican In Name Only&quot;), or its less-used sibling &quot;DINO.&quot;  Obviously, the definition of &quot;Republican&quot; or &quot;Democrat&quot; can only be defined through membership in, or support of, their political party, so using terms like RINO and DINO allows people to move the goalposts to change the definition of what being a <em>real</em> part of that party entails to mean, well, whatever they want it to mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for taking the time to answer my humble wee comment in such a clear and thorough manner. </p>
<p>Very much appreciated! </p>
<p>A good delineation between the two concepts. I think I begin to understand it now. It's also good to know you might be able to argue over a contentious semantic point, without ever incurring the wrath of some fallacy or another!</p>
<p>Cheers friend</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While not the point of your post, membership in a party doesn’t require support of the party, and vice versa. Someone can register as a republican without believing in any of the party platform (and I've heard of people explicitly registering for parties they oppose so they can vote in primaries for candidates they think won't win general elections), and unlike membership (which is binary), one can agree with some parts of the platform and disagree with others. If you find yourself at odds with the majority of your political party on the majority of the issues upon which the party has an official position, then there is legitimate argument that you are not a true member.  Every politician who switched political parties had, for a time, a period when they belonged to their party in name only. That is why they switched. Political beliefs form a multidimensional spectrum, and attempting to classify them as belonging to 2 or 3 parties is woefully inadequate. </p>
<p>Of course, RINO is often used to mean “that person’s view on one particular issue is not as extreme as mine, although it is on the same side of center.” It is a way to to dismiss engaging with someone else’s ideas instead of accepting that political parties have people who may agree on a lot but not in everything. </p>
<p>There are plenty of things for which there is no single acceptable definition, and where many competing definitions agree in the majority of cases. Political parties are one of those things, and denying the inherent vagueness in what it means to be a Democrat or republican is to invite absurdities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation is great but No True Scotsman is definitely a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman" target="_blank">logical fallacy</a>.  Deleting your first sentence would probably be a great help to people who are just learning this because if they start saying its not a logical fallacy, that's going to make them seem like they don't know what they're talking about.</p>
<p>Informal fallacies and formal fallacies are the two categories of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy" target="_blank">logical fallacies</a>.</p></div>		</li>
