			<div class="markdown"><p>My buddy and I got into his Toyota Corolla (it was a mid 1990s model) when we were in college. Started the car, drove away. </p>
<p>I looked down in the cup holder and was like &quot;Bruh, why the fuck do you have so much lipstick in your cupholder?&quot; </p>
<p>We pulled over, looked the car over, and realized it was not his car. Same color, same interior, same year, not same car. We drove it back to the parking lot, locked it up, and wandered around until we found his actual car and headed home.</p></div>		</li>
