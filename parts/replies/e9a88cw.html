			<div class="markdown"><p>How do partial opioid agonists and antagonists work with kratom? I've heard the antagonists reduce the effects of the partial agonists so that taking more isn't always as effective as a lower dose but I dont really understand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the pharmacology behind it, but I do know that Kratom works very well even if you're on Suboxone. Suboxone blocks pretty much every other opiate completely due to the presence of naloxone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's a common misconception; suboxone blocks other opiates/knocks them off the receptors because it's a competitive partial agonist. the naloxone is in too small of a dose to do anything compared to the buprenorphine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacy student and pharmacy technician here. The main reason naloxone is in suboxone is to prevent people from abusing it. For example snorting it. Naloxone isn't absorned into your body when taken orally so it doesn't block opiates, but if you snort it or something else it will block the buprenorphine from working. Then buprenorphine is a partial agonist of opiate receptors and thus competes with other opiates for the receptor and it decreases the likelihood that you'll get high from taking a different opiate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A molecule that is naturally produced in your body that is usually the ligand for that receptor. Example: acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, is an endogenous ligand for some ligand-gated ion channels in your neurons, the thyroid hormones are endogenous ligands for your thyroid receptors in your nucleus, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A ligand is a chemical species that binds to another molecule, and endogenous means it's made (-genous) inside (endo-) the body. So it's a chemical used by the body to signal something that binds to a receptor to work.</p></div>		</li>
