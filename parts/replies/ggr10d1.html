			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of when I was really on top of my fitness and diet my piss would always look too clear so they wouldn’t even accept it and I’d have to basically avoid drinking water for a day so I could become less hydrated and come back the next day and take the piss test when my piss wasn’t so clear</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took lots of niacin for a while as it is supposed to help with ldl hdl ratios (cholesterol). I always thought it felt like someone cracking an ostrich sized hot egg right on the top of my head that slowly worked its way down my body. I think it is called niacin flush (as in red cheeks embarrassed).</p></div>		</li>
