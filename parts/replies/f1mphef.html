			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of journals out there which are &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but not actually. I don't know any names off the top of my head, but I do remember hearing about how someone got &quot;take me off your fucking mailing list&quot; published from one of these journals. There's a whole grey industry in publishing anything (for a fee) because there are enough people who will do pretty much what they can to say &quot;I've had X papers published in the last Y years&quot; when making their case for a permanent position.</p>
<p>I get emails all the time inviting me to send papers to these sorts of journals, mostly they get caught by the spam filter, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was at a convention where a guy told us about how he got a paper published in a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; that detailed the episode of Star Trek Voyager where Tom Paris mutated after going to Warp 10. Just to prove it was a bullshit journal. </p>
<p>I can't find a link to the actual paper easily, but there's LOTS of news stories about it if you Google.</p></div>		</li>
