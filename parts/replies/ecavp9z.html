			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends. In this case the president is threatening to shut down the government if money for a border wall is not put in the budget.  </p>
<p>If he vetoes the budget then you need a majority of congress to overturn the veto and since its December congress is not at work right now so thats not gonna happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trump is hostaging the USA to make Congress do what he wants.  He is gambling that if he hurts America badly enough that Congress will give in to his demands.  </p>
<p>In this case he is demanding funding so the USA can pay  for a boarder wall that he promised Mexico would pay for. Plus the security experts think the money would be more effective if spent on other kinds of security measures like drones and cameras instead.</p>
<p>Basically we elected an stubborn ignorant toddler who refuses to keep his own promises or listen to the people who know more than him.  And he is now throwing a temper tantrum designed to hurt America until he gets his way. </p></div>		</li>
