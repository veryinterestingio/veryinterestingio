			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several other factors that effect conductivity other than electron concentration and crystal defects. Things like mean free path (how far an electron needs to go before it runs into another) will also effect it (in EE classes we sum all these up into an empirically measured 'electron mobility' term). It's a bit misleading otherwise, for example Iron has a higher free electron concentration than copper, but even in their pure form copper is still a better conductor because of the other factors that contribute to it's higher electron mobility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it the crystal defects and the phonons that determine the mean free path and thus the mobility?  I think you're right, I should have mentioned phonons, since clearly the temperature-dependence of the conductivity of metals indicates that's important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be just those, I'm not 100% on all the factors. In our semiconductor physics class we lump them all into the mobility term since that works for the calculations we need to do.</p>
<p>I was just worried someone could read that and think that uranium was a better conductor than copper because it has a higher atomic number (more electrons).</p></div>		</li>
