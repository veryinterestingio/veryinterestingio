			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to this, which is true but not the entire truth.</p>
<p>Your manufacturer will also have programmed in a delay to enable a smooth viewing experience you'd know of as buffering. So there will be a forced few seconds of delay whilst the buffer fills to make sure you can actually watch a few seconds just in case (older sets didn't have this and consumers complained about it being glitchy)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, you may also have to wait for a key frame to be sent and this may depend of the quality and encoding of the transmission. </p>
<p>Modern video encoding doesn’t encode the entire image for every frame (like a series of jpgs) but instead encodes full ‘key’ frames and then a only encodes the difference between the current and last frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This accounts for something between .5 and 2 seconds of delay, depending on where you're located and what the relevant standards are (ATSC, DVB/ETSI, ARIB, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Although something like twitch enforces a 2 frame key-frame TV doesn't have this as they're looking to minimise the bitrate and the higher the keyframe frequencey the higher the transmision data is required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just over a second is still quite a long time - changing channels used to be (and can still be) nearly instantaneous</p>
<p>The real &quot;issue&quot; (except that, by definition, it isn't one) is that most people don't care about a delay of a second - we don't tend to &quot;flick&quot; channels like we used to before we had on screen &quot;What's On&quot; guides and automatic recording of live TV, so there's no reason to pay more money for a faster TV when we only change the channel every half hour or so.</p>
<p>And if we won't pay more money for it because we don't care, then the companies making the TV aren't going to care either</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus most manufacturers, particularly for cheaper and mid-priced TVs, use the cheapest processors that will do the job. Essentially your TV is being run by the same processor you'd get in a $40 cheapo Android tablet</p>
<p>They <em>could</em> make it much faster.</p>
<p>For example when I use a DVB-T (Digital TV) or DVB-S (Satellite TV) capture card on my PC, I can change channels almost instantly without the bugginess - but my satellite box and TV are much slower</p>
<p>At the end of the day, most people don't care much about a short delay when changing channels, so they don't look for TVs that are faster, so there's no incentive for manufacturers to actually improve the hardware (why spend more money if your customers won't spend the extra money to buy it?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why not put in two computers -- one for the channel the person is watching, and another for the *next* channel? This way when they flip to the next channel, it's ready... and the next-next channel is already buffering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't this require the TV knowing which channel is next?  If it assumed up one or down one, it might be correct once in awhile at best.  If it waited for a next channel input and remained on the current channel until the next was ready to display, people would still think it was slow and they would be watching the channel they no longer wanted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would. So instead how about pick X 'favorite' channels. The processors can work on all of those favorites so if you swapped to one of those, it would be fast.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how they do this though without doubling or tripling data being sent, all to save a second or two when swapping channels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that is gonna cost way way more than people are going to be willing to pay, and it's not that big an advantage, not everyone really goes through their channels one at a time (rather than skipping directly to their target), while a second video and signal decoder is not going to be cheap.</p></div>		</li>
