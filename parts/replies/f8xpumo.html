			<div class="markdown"><p>The theological answer implies that causality isn't necessarily relevant to the question. In that case, understanding how everything came into being could potentially be impossible for us, and in that case would be just be a matter (hah) of faith.</p>
<p>I think OP's question suggests they were looking for a scientific answer though. As others have said, we don't know. It could be that there is no scientific answer available to us - it may just not be possible to make the necessary tests or observations.</p>
<p>These are two very different (and not necessarily mutually exclusive) things though, and the same arguments don't really apply.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The fact that we might never know/understand is irrelevant though. Science is still the better approach imho because while we may not get the answers we are looking for, we certainly accumulate more knowledge about everything else in the process.</p>
<p>Religion simply postulates an entity that is responsible for everything and provides magical answers for all questions, ultimately slowing down the accumulation of knowledge and thus progress.</p>
<p>Religion is for the lazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a physicist or anything, just a dude fascinated by space and things like this, but isn't one of the potential ends of the universe the big crunch? Where everything basically just gets sucked back into it's self? I'm sure I'm wrong but I wonder if it's possible that before the CURRENT big bang was just another universe pre-crunch. So when we crunch, we immediately explode back out because all that stuff can't be contained like that, and that is the start of a new universe.</p>
<p>Just a random dude speculating here.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just searched it up and it looks like that is exactly what wikipedia says that could happen lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Big Crunch is one theory but not the popular one. The one most scientists agree on is the ultimate heat death of the universe, we see little evidence that inflation will decrease or ever reverse, and with inflation increasing gravity will never be able to overcome it (it already can't) so things will just get further and further apart until no more reactions take place, increasing entropy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it were the other way around and the universe was accelerating towards a singularity, would we have come to the conclusion that the ultimate fate of the universe is a dense singularity where nothing can escape for all eternity?</p>
<p>Equally as depressing as heat death if you ask me. Both are scenarios where matter and energy are equally distributed across the universe. In one scenario the universe is entirely contained in the singularity, the other it is infinitely spread out equally in all directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Hindus nailed this exact explanation thousands of years ago without science. Brahma takes a breath in and the universe collapses, out breath and it expands. And Brahma just goes on breathing for ever. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how it makes sense in my mind. It is definitely like a breath. If you think how a breath is like an exponential curve (in or out) you start slowly and then the breath reaches it's peak, and then slows down, to start the opposite breath (in or out) </p>
<p>The universe's expansion is apparently accelerating, and eventually it's predicted that this expansion will stop and result in stasis (heat death), which is like the moment where you've breathed out as much as you possibly can, you're in stasis for a moment, then you take a breath in. And the cycle starts again.</p></div>		</li>
