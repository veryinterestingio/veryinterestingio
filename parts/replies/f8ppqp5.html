			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a joke, but that is also a way to get rid of heat. Due to the vacuum of space, it would cause the air inside the station to expand- thus cooling it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason a gas expanding causes it to cool is because expanding generally takes work. Because the net potential energy of the system doesn't change, the first law of thermodynamics says the energy to do that work must come from heat.</p>
<p>A gas expanding into a vacuum takes no work, as there's nothing resisting it, so no cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any atom will ''leak'' radiation and the wavelenght will depend on the temperature. An oven heating element will be a dark red, a fire will be white at the hottest par, then go to yellow, orange and finally red as you get further from the source where the temperature is low. For most everyday object the temperature mean that they will radiate in infrared and that is what radiator in space do. </p>
<p>You basically circulate fluid to bring heat from the inside to the radiator, this will heat up the radiator, which will radiate their heat away. The spacecraft as a whole could do that, but radiator are just really good at it. They are flat surface, relatively thin so that they can be heated at higher temperature, which make them more efficient at radiating their heat away. For the shuttle they were made of two layers. A reflective layer so that they don't absorb too much visible light from the sun and a teflon layer which is opaque to infrared, which make it more efficient to radiate infrared. On the ISS the radiator can rotate so they are not directly exposed to Sunlight.</p></div>		</li>
