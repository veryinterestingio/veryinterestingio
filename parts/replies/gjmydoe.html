			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yeah. Contrast it with tape drives or punched cards where you canâ€™t pick out a given piece of information out of the middle of the reel or deck without first going through the rest in order. Those are sometimes referred to as sequential access memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ironically if you consider things like page faults and cpu cache, it's actually a lot more efficient to access memory sequentially than randomly on any modern OS. But that's not the RAMs fault.</p>
<p>Computers are just extremely optimized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it makes much more sense if you know that the term was coined in times where storing things on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_track_tape" target="_blank">tape drives</a> was common and the computer actually had to rewind the tape on the right place when you wanted to read a certain file. </p>
<p>In this respect, RAM was &quot;random&quot; so there was no winding or waiting necessary to reach any piece of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it makes much less sense now with SSDs used as permanent storage. Couple years back when HDDs were common on desktop it still made more sense.</p>
<p>In my native language RAM is called &quot;operational memory&quot; which aged a bit better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Memory access patterns are subject to spatial and temporal locality. For any given address in memory that is accessed at some time, there is a high likelihood that the address will be accessed again in the short term, and a high likelihood that nearby addresses will be accessed in the short term as well. This is due to the fact that program code and data is logically contiguous and memory management has limited granularity.</p>
<p>Memory access patterns aren't random, in fact they are highly predictable. Microprocessors rely on this predictability to operate efficiently.</p>
<p>The term <em>random access</em> means that for a given type of memory, the time taken to read from or write to an arbitrary memory address is the same as any other arbitrary memory address. Some argue that the time should also be deterministic and/or bounded.</p>
<p>The poster above's analogy to a tape is an apt one. If the tape is fully rewound, the time needed to access a sector near the beginning is much less than the time needed to access a sector near the end.</p>
<p>Few forms of memory truly have constant read/write times for all memory addresses. SRAM (Static RAM), EEPROMs, embedded ROMs, NOR Flash, and simple NAND Flash all meet this requirement. The benefit of deterministic random access is that it allows for a very simple memory controller that does not require any configuration.</p>
<p>SDRAM  (Synchronous Dynamic RAM) doesn't meet this requirement for all memory locations. SDRAM chips are organized into banks, rows, and columns. Each chip has a number of independent memory banks, each bank has a number of rows, and each row stores one bit per column.
Each bank can have one row open at a time; which means that the column values for that open row can be read/written randomly in constant time. If the address needed is in another row, the open row has to be closed and the target row opened, this takes a deterministic amount of time. Modern SDRAM controllers reorder read and write commands to minimize the number of operations and minimize the amount of time that is wasted opening and closing rows of data. Ergo, when a microprocessor tries to read memory through a modern SDRAM controller, the response is probabilistic but not deterministic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense, there is something random in that the user do some number of arbitrary reads of memory and and whatever they choose, it's as fast as any other. So, the user can choose <em>randomly</em> what memory they want to access, and no  matter their choice the speed should be about the same!</p></div>		</li>
