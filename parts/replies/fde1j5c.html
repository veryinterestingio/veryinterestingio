			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I'm missing something about how light is focused to allow clear vision - you can adjust for interpupillary distance and adjust the lens distance but why can't you simply adjust the focus to compensate for any refractive errors in someone's eyes?</p></div>		</li>
