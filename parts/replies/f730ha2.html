			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure, I know that the shell grows with age, but I'm not sure if it grows to compensate for their weight as it is technically a skeleton, and like in other animals changes with age not life factors. If they loose weight I think that not much happens, but you may notice that they will return to being able to get back into their shell more often.</p></div>		</li>
