			<div class="markdown"><p>If they &quot;collided&quot; then all of the star would get sucked into the black hole. I feel like &quot;collided&quot; isn't exactly the right term to use with a black hole, but that term indicates to me that the star was traveling directly toward the black hole and would therefore fall inside the black hole's event horizon. Anything within this area is trapped and can't escape the black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the event horizon is just the boundary inside which literally <em>nothing</em> can escape, even light. It's likely that even very far from the event horizon, regular matter would still be captured by its gravity and fall into the black hole.</p>
<p>However, given a star large enough and moving fast enough and a black hole small enough (I'm assuming there are practical limits to how large a star can get, how fast it can move, and how small a black hole can be, but I don't know these), then I suppose matter at the edges of the star could maybe escape the pull of the black hole while the central portions are sucked in. I don't think they'd receive any sort of extra gravitational assist and go speeding off though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conjecture, but I imagine once the black hole absorbs the core, there wont be anything providing outward pressure to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium so the matter would fall to the center under the gravity of the black hole and the star</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By nature a black hole has far more mass than any star.  The star loses.  In effect, the star is always &quot;smaller&quot;.</p>
<p>If it were &quot;larger&quot; than the black hole, it would become one itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think that's exactly true. A black hole formed from a collapsed star would have the same mass as the star prior to collapse. It would have the same pull on an object a given distance away from it. I think by definition the event horizon would have to be smaller than the radius of the pre-collapsed star. Matter and light at the edge of the star was able to escape pre-collapse, so matter at that same distance away from the center of the post-collapse black hole should also be able to escape</p>
<p>So even if you imagine two regular stars colliding -- where an event horizon doesn't even come into the equation -- I'd imagine the vast majority of the matter of the two stars would end up together simply by their &quot;regular&quot; gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Note: This is all just my understanding. I'm by no means an expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius#Parameters" target="_blank">reading this correctly</a>, our own sun, if compressed tightly enough into a black hole, would have an event horizon radius of 3km. So yeah, stars' event horizons are much smaller than their former size. But again, they'll exert the same pull on other objects further out from their event horizons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there's high speed then there's black hole high speed. It's a whole other kind of fast. When a black hole merges with something the process takes literally nanoseconds.</p>
<p>In short, the star would get owned if it got too close. There's radio telescope footage of a star grazing a black hole and the star didn't make it, it got shattered and splattered, and that was just a close orbit... A bit closer and it would have gotten swallowed.</p>
