			<div class="markdown"><p>As in where is the image perceived to be? For me at least, it's a separate &quot;viewing area&quot; altogether. You have the image fed in by your eyes, then just another one (or even multiple ones, so that you're holding entirely separate non interacting images in your mind - though too much of that is a good way for me to get a headache). </p>
<p>Mixing mental images with what you actually see is kind of possible, but at least for me it's only kind of mixed and often is more like trying to hold one physical photo in front of another and pretending they're the same picture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so if you think of an apple, you actually conjure up an apple that you &quot;see&quot; as clearly as you would see a real apple, except it exists somewhere in your headspace, and even then you can sorta project that image onto reality?  The only time I've had that happen was during sleep paralysis where my dreams overlaid with reality. So maybe your ability to do this is like utilizing the same part of your brain that creates your dreams?   </p>
<p>I visualize everything I'm saying, writing, or talking about, but I don't get a mental image that's anything like the image I get when actually seeing it in my hands. It exists in some headspace viewing area but it's like a memory. I can &quot;see&quot; it but not in front of my eyes.  There's nothing tangible about it. Reading through the other comments, I was sure I don't have aphantasia because I can absolutely &quot;see&quot; landscapes described in books, etc. But your comment has me thinking that my &quot;literally see it in my mind&quot; is different than everyone else's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for everyone, some people imaginary headspace, is a separate &quot;place&quot;, some have it mixed, some it's the same than when dreaming or remembering, sometimes each is different, check some of the comments in this thread, or even check the sub /r/Aphantasia or related ones (hyperphantasia, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are things people suggest to try to help with visualizing but I’ve not heard of anyone being successful if they are completely aphant. I’ve only heard it helps if you how low visualizing already. It’s called image streaming. If you were not born with aphantasia I’ve heard of it coming back after some time. Some people lose the ability to visualize after injury/surgery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge it’s permanent, as I’ve dealt with it my whole life. However, I do hold very strongly onto hope (even if it’s false hope) that it will one day be, for lack of a better term, curable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not because throughout my life I've gone through phases of being able to imagine with great vitality to having a dead minds eye. Right now I absolutely hate having difficulty imaging anything because it makes reading feel like pulling teeth. I lose concentration because I can't conceptualize at all when I'm reading. </p>
<p>During times that my concentration has been hyper-focused in the past, I could clearly see images created by my mind eyes and would even viscerally feel the emotions and actions  in the story immediately, without needing time to process what im reading.  The action in thrillers would make my heart race. However when I'm aphantasia everything about a story is stale and unmoving.. no pictures in my head and no feelings resonate.. like reading a textbook.</p></div>		</li>
