			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this.</p>
<p>Tape is made of an adhesive that gets stronger after force is applied. If you stick the tape down, and then apply some force to it to &quot;stick it down harder&quot; this actually activates the adhesive bond and it becomes MUCH more sticky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently no. I think there's a 'How It's Made' that shows the process and it isn't very..physical? Also we know the back side of tape is made to not be very stickable.</p>
<p>You need to really push the tape down into whatever you're trying to adhere it to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also consider that pressing on the tape allows for more of the sticky stuff to come in contact with the surface you're taping to. What looks flat with your eyes looks very not flat under a microscope. Depending on the material, just a magnifying glass might be enough.</p></div>		</li>
