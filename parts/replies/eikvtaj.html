			<div class="markdown"><p>To really drive the point about how many digite of Pi are useful,  NASA only uses 15 for calculating interplanetary travel.  At 40 digits, you could calculate the circumference of a circle the size of the visible universe with an accuracy that would be off by less than the diameter of a single hydrogen atom.</p>
<p>E: since this really blew up, I had recalled reading it from <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2016/3/16/how-many-decimals-of-pi-do-we-really-need/" target="_blank">this NASA page.</a></p>
<p>E2:  A great majority of the replies have basically been &quot;so figuring out Pi to (large number of digits) is useless?&quot;  As several others have pointed out, the method of making those calculations probably has more value than actually knowing the 3 trillionth digit of Pi.  Other than that, I'm no mathematician and don't have any answers about planck length or time.    As I noted above, I just had this interesting bit of information that I had recalled reading before, and wanted to share.  The response has been way bigger than I expected, and I'm happy to have spread it around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is kind of weird that it's really intuitive that an <em>increase</em> of something by a factor of ten has a rather large impact, especially if you have several of these increases (like mm to m to km for example).</p>
<p>On the other hand, every digit of pi that you take into account reduces the error you make in your calculation by the same amount, relatively. The circumference of the visible universe is only about 40 orders of magnitude more than the size of a hydrogen atom, which is the mindblowing fact underlying the tidbit from above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>meanwhile, turbonerds (i say that lovingly) take great pains to memorize pi to 100 digits or more, while that particular knowledge is clearly only useful in the event that you need to calculate a precise circle a few million times bigger than the observable universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably fine by just memorising it to 3 digits, since you'll almost definitely be using a device pre-programmed with pi for any calculations over about 2 sig fig.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with scientific calculations for a living and I've never memorized past 3.14159.  (only then because it was part of a <a href="https://archives.rpi.edu/blog/2008/01/04/nerdy-cheer/" target="_blank">nerdy cheer</a> at my alma mater.). That's enough so that you can recognize 'pi' when you see it.</p>
<p>Nobody trusts their memory when doing important calculations.  All the necessarily digits of pi are usually hardcoded as part of the programming language.  If not, you can calculate the digits with a function call.  pi = 4.0 * arctan(1.0). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>15 digits is the default when computers store non-integer (floating point) numbers.  It corresponds to 8 bytes (64 bits) of computer memory.  NASA is saying they don't need to do anything special to be more precise than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If their opcodes are 16 bits then it would save 2-3 bytes depending on whether the memory had to be word aligned.  Of course at 32 bits and above no space would be saved.</p>
<p>It wouldn't really slow anything down.  Compute 355/113, store it in memory.  Use it for Pi. (profit?)</p>
