<p>Or &quot;consciousness ignored.&quot; He explains the <em>contents</em> of consciousness without answering the question most of us really want answered: why there is <em>the sheer fact of experience at all</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like the physicist Lawrence Krauss's book &quot;A Universe from Nothing.&quot; He defines Nothing as something (quantum fields) and then is perplexed when people accuse him of ignoring the real question.</p>
<p>I think when you become an expert in your field, you lose sight of the Really Big Questions that may have inspired your search in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He does explain it, although he also says that people often don't like his explanation (you included, apparently).</p>
<p>His explanation is that what we call the &quot;fact of experience&quot; is just a bunch of little tricks the brain uses. There's no grand concept underlying it. People <em>want</em> there to be a grand fundamental concept (which is why they don't like this explanation), but there just isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of Dennett's and Hofstadter's books are thrown around in the thread. I'll just chip in that I've read most of their popular books and some of their academic publications, and I think the best introduction is &quot;<strong>The Mind's I</strong>&quot;. </p>
<p>Since it's an essay collection, it'll endow the reader with a broad take on what a mind might be, without bogging you down with the intricacies of the incompatible positions within philosophy of mind. </p>
<p>On the neuropsychology front, some very accessible authors are David Eagleman and Oliver Sacks. </p>
<p>If you're into online lectures, Steve Joordens of Toronto University did a coursera course of psychology. It's about as pleasant an introduction to psychology as you'll get anywhere else and It'll put you in a much better position to understand the philosophical positions. </p>
<p>I should warn you, or anyone new to the subject, that I initially dipped my toes in this question and ended up being obsessed with it for 5 years. Messing around with it can honestly be as anxiety provoking as it can be exciting, but the benefit - I've found - is that after throwing curveballs at the self, it just makes you super comfortable in your own skin. </p>
<p>(This isn't intended at you specifically, Gned11, you just happened to incite a lot of recommendations so I thought I'd chunk it in here)</p></div>		</li>
