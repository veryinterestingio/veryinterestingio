			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't there other mechanisms that can protect a cell from an intruder like having specific binding sites that only allow other cells with specific structures to interface? This could be seen as a type of biological firewall blocking communication from specific 'ports', or only allowing traffic from a specific users/sites. </p>
<p>Similarly, those cells are weak to attacks that are able to forge or partially forge the structure that the binding site accepts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the reasons covid is so severe. The binding sites it binds to are common in the lungs, but genetics carries a ton between people. And some people have those binging sites all over, including in the heart. And some people have very few sites at all. </p>
<p>This is what causes the loss of taste and smell if I remember right. But it also causes varying degrees of lost lung and organ function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exclusionary systems usually work the other way around; i.e. by using proteins or DNA sequences unique to pathogens as markers for those pathogens. As you suggested, a lock-and-key protection mechanism is vulnerable to &quot;forged&quot; keys, and the likelihood of pathogens developing such forgeries is pretty high given the rate of microbial evolution.</p>
<p>Responding to pathogen-specific markers is more robust (though by no means unbreakable - pathogen resistance is described ad nauseam as an &quot;evolutionary arms race&quot;), as it is presumably much harder for a pathogen to forsake an essential part of its physiology than it is for it to develop a new protein that matches the host cell's &quot;lock&quot;. For example, the first line of pathogen defense in plants are proteins which detect so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) like flagella and bacterial cell walls. The evolutionary barrier to completely restructuring one's mode of propulsion or cell wall architecture is very high, so plant pathogens have instead evolved ways to disable to initial plant disease response. And accordingly, plants have developed responses to these attempts, and so on and so forth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah a fellow plant immunologist. I would like to add on (because I so rarely get to talk about this) that half of the damn immune system turns off the other half. And because of this, microbes, both commensal and pathogenic, have evolved to target receptors that activate one arm, and in turn inactivate the arm that can deal with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just an add on, the TIR domain is found in both Toll-like receptors in vertebrates and R-proteins in plants. Both of these receptor groups function as PAMP receptors.</p>
<p>The most relevant receptors in regards to the original post are TLR9 (primarily detects unmethylated CpGs), and TLR3/7/8 (foreign RNA).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans do have protective mechanism against bacterial DNA. Human DNA sequences of CpG are generally methylated and occurrences of CpG that are un-methylated are very low. Bacteria have numerous CpG sequences, and we have receptors that detect un-methylated CpG and activate an immune response. Bacteria can't methylate those sequences, it would mess up their own gene regulation, and there are too many to mutate them all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is <del>complete bollocks</del> quite an oversimplification, just FYI. CpG methylation levels are highly regulated during development and vary considerably over the genome. Where did you learn this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yup. Also, some phages build protein &quot;nuclei&quot; around their DNA that might be a form of protection against crispr or similar defense mechanisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually the super-cool thing about CRISPR. It's an entirely other system of antiviral defense in bacteria and the characterization of it is, once again, revolutionizing molecular biology. I won't get into details about the similarities and differences, but in short, many bacteria have more than one defense system in place.  </p>
<p>Restriction enzymes won a Nobel prize in 1978 and (along with PCR) ushered in a revolution in molecular biology. </p>
<p>CRISPR won a Nobel prize in 2020 and is currently ushering in a new revolution.</p>
<p>Pretty cool to see that working on a somewhat obscure problem can pay dividends in the field at large. This is the main reason why basic research with no immediate application can be so important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is CRISPR is a tool to use a set of guide RNAs. Bacteria can then incorporate the RNA from viruses they have encounter to add them to their CRISPR toolkit.</p>
<p>The restriction enzyme system is a way of marking their own DNA as self, and chopping up anything else that isn't self.</p>
<p>So one is &quot;innate&quot; and one is &quot;adaptive&quot;. Some viruses will methylate their own DNA to get around the restriction enzymes, while evading the CRISPR will be an evolutionary back and forth as the target sequences changes and then gets re-incorporated into the bacterial genome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You still need to differentiate self vs. non-self for CRISPR adaptation, which a virus can evolve to escape. In the canonical case, chi site rich viruses will be selected for.</p>
<p>Also, anti-CRISPR proteins exist (&gt;50 Acr proteins last time I checked).</p></div>		</li>
