			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to your as usual excellent write-up: the flood control coming with damming rivers often reduces the spring flooding of adjacent vegetation. While that is of course a desired effect from a civil engineering perspective, many fish species use those flood zones for reproduction and are badly affected by the dam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will add that these impacts go beyond fish using flood zones to a whole variety of cascading effects. Example: spring floods create sandbars that are a specialized environment for both plant and animal species. Some tree species only sprout on the newly exposed post-flood bars. When the floods are eliminated these bars don't form. The establishment of these new groves stabilizes the newly created bar, inducing flow changes in the rivers path. Without these new bars and vegetation patterns, the river become increasingly channelized with high banks, eliminating still other microenviroments that other species depend on for their habitats</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seasonal flooding is also a crucial source of fresh silt and other soil sediments in many river deltas. My soil science prof said the Nile Delta was the last truly sustainable agricultural land in terms of soil erosion, but dams are threatening that. Here's something from NatGeo about it:</p>
<p>&quot;However, the silt and sediment that used to flow north, enriching the soil and building the delta, is now building up behind the dam instead. Instead of growing in size through the soil deposits, the delta is now shrinking due to erosion along the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, routine annual flooding no longer occurs along parts of the Nile. These floods were necessary to flush and clean the water of human and agricultural waste. As a result, the water is becoming more polluted.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with everything u/CrustalTrudger said about dams in rivers, but one thing that is not being mentioned is turbine farms without dams. The environmental effects are significantly lower with these types of farms than with traditional dams, but their site selection is far more limited (generally this type of hydroelectric plant (hydrokinetic) will have to be near the mouth of a river with rather strong tides, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148105003289" target="_blank">Brooks, 2006</a>). The turbines will be directly in the water column and will create energy from the kinetic energy of the water rushing around the blades. There are a few different methods of securing the turbines in place, the most common being an anchor and buoy system or by securing them directly to the ocean floor. <a href="https://tethys.pnnl.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Tidal%20Energy%20Workshop%20Proceedings%202011.pdf" target="_blank">Polayge et al., 2011</a> review these impacts at great length and provide some useful figures on pages 126 &amp;127 (explanation for the figures is back on page 25). One main issue they mention is the lack of data we have available to determine the impacts as this is a relatively new method of harvesting renewable energy. One of the largest potential impacts from a hydrokinetic plant is the deployment of the turbines, you would not only disturb the substrate placing the anchoring system for the turbines but would also have to run a cable from the turbines to the shore (usually buried). The risk of a turbine harming a fish is rather minimal, the blades are; typically not moving fast enough, rounded, or designed to dissuade fish from entering them. There are other potential impacts such as acoustic disruption of mammal's communication but without any long term studies of hydrokinetic farms the extent of the impacts is largely based on hypothesizes and models.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The abstract on the first paper I linked mentions it could operate in deeper currents with a velocity of only 2m/s and if memory serves me correct a current of at least 2.5m/s was recommended for standard river flows to produce a viable amount of energy. I'm sure you could generate energy with slower flows but the cost (monetary and environmental impact) may not be worth the price. Harvesting this energy still removes some from the environment too so if the current is too slow to start you could severely limit the ability of the ecosystem to flush out hazards (excessive nutrients, harmful algal blooms, naturally occurring toxins, etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure I'm buried here, but I want to give my two cents on this answer. I think its important to point out that while what u/CrustalTrudger says regarding water chemistry and temperature ARE problems with hydro plants, there ARE solutions to address these problems. My job happens to be designing and maintaining systems that solve and then monitor these traits to ensure a healthy eco-system in what we call the tailwater of these hydro plants.</p>
<p>For example, one of the effects of the stratifications mentioned is that the colder water at the bottom of the reservoirs has low dissolved oxygen (DO) content, which is harmful to wildlife in the tailwater when this cold water is passed through the plant to generate. There are several systems that can be used to increase the DO content of dam releases, including turbine venting, surface water mixers, aerating weirs, and oxygen injection systems. More information on these systems can be found here: <a href="https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Water-Quality/Boosting-Oxygen-in-the-Tennessee-Valley-Tailwaters" target="_blank">https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Water-Quality/Boosting-Oxygen-in-the-Tennessee-Valley-Tailwaters</a>
If that reading is not enough, feel free to PM me with any additional questions.</p>
<p>In addition, the chemical properties of the water, mostly DO content and temperature, but also other properties (pH, turbidity, etc) can be monitored in real time. If the temperature, DO, pH, whatever is not within limits defined by people smarter than me, often plants are shut down and different plants have to be used to make up for the lost power. Alternatively, generating seasons can be limited to certain times of the year to ensure a healthy eco-system is maintained around the dam. An example of this would be Tims Ford Dam in Middle Tennessee. More information on Tims Ford can be found here: <a href="https://www.tva.gov/Energy/Our-Power-System/Hydroelectric/Tims-Ford-Reservoir" target="_blank">https://www.tva.gov/Energy/Our-Power-System/Hydroelectric/Tims-Ford-Reservoir</a></p>
<p>In no way am  I saying that the post by u/CrustalTrudger is incorrect, but that there are solutions to the problems that he pointed out. It is indeed very possible to run hydro plants responsibly, and maintain the ecosystems around the hydro plants while using them to generate clean energy. It simply comes with a cost, and requires the expertise of many different people working together to be done correctly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really you are talking about mitigating damage here I believe. All eco systems are highly complex, and the efforts we can make to reduce damage is limited by our knowledge.  </p>
<p>That said, thanks for doing that job! I believe it to be valuable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question that is a bit offtopic, although connected to your response. In Thailand, there is a much publicized device purported to be invented by the late king Rama IX (an otherwise genuinely enlightened and interesting character), which basically is a wastewater aerator for reservoirs. Of course in the official lore, it's a miracle of engineering and innovation that had a deep impact on Thai agriculture and ecology and all that. It even has a golden-colored <a href="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/monument-chaipattana-low-speed-surface-aerator-model-rx-des-designed-suanluang-rama-ix-public-park-bangkok-thailand-47897376.jpg" target="_blank">monument</a> to it in the capital. And I realize that the King's modernizing projects had impact beyond their usefulness in promoting rational and scientific solutions, sustainability etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to ask you, what do you think it is, how similar it is to other solutions in other countries, and could it be relevant and have significant impact for Thai water systems. <a href="https://www.chaipat.or.th/eng/our-work/environmental-quality-improvement.html" target="_blank">Here's a short summary on the thing</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense, yes! The key idea to solving dissolved oxygen deficiency is simply to add more oxygen to the water. Now, this gets more difficult the deeper the water is, but basically disturbing the water surface can be very effective in shallow reservoirs/ponds/waterways. </p>
<p>To me, it looks like that aerator works the same way as an aerating weir. It basically disturbs the water surface and creates additional surface area for the water and air to mix. The problem with constructing a weir is often cost: you need to build a coffer dam to divert flow around the area that you are building in, and then create this big civil structure. In addition, you often get weird hydraulic flow patterns that can trap people underwater just downstream of the weir. This can be eliminated with careful design and testing, but requires specialized expertise.</p>
<p>The machine that you linked looks like an excellent alternative to constructing aerating weir dams given a shallow reservoir and low cost.</p>
<p>PS, if you want to see a really cool weir dam, check out the South Holston Labyrinth Weir: <a href="http://watershed-project.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Holston-Weir-Dam.jpg" target="_blank">http://watershed-project.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Holston-Weir-Dam.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual question what do you mean by least efficient? Once the capital is in, the generation is very cheap is it not?</p>
<p>What large scale power generation would be preferred? I’ve always heard hydro is the best steady state power generation for the environment out there except maybe nuclear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What problems in particular? And in what way are they inefficient? Yes, they often can run at 80-90% efficient, which isn't great relatively speaking, but there's nothing lost by not running at 100% efficiency. The water is there already, its not like burning coal or natural gas with a waste product at the end.</p>
<p>Edit: also, hydro power is far from useless, regardless of what that documentary says. Every system needs a baseload, which is often nuclear or fossil, but then hydro can be used to meet demand very quickly. The time to get a hydro plant on and off-line is very quick.</p></div>		</li>
