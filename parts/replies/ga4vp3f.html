			<div class="markdown"><p>That excludes sites with the word chegg, which will probably work. But the more reliable syntax is this: </p>
<pre><code>-site:chegg.com</code></pre>
<p>It excludes the website specifically.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Fixed formatting with a code block...I hope?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second using another search engine. After months of googling for a certain link, I finally decided to use duckduckgo.com for a change, and what I was looking for was the first result. (also Bing for anything NSFW is good also)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! In addition, consider ditching google all around and using a separate search engine. Youâ€™ll get different results at the very least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google is getting disastrously bad anyway, its long since been time to bail.</p>
<p>I see you searched for &quot;first manned flight&quot; but we though you must've meant &quot;flight man by George ezra&quot; so we changed your search to that instead, please enjoy our page of 90% Google own widgets instead of search results, and then we've kindly prioritised only results from yahoo answers and wiki how for the next five pages. You're welcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I google &quot;first manned flight,&quot; the top of the page is a Google widget linking to NASA, followed by some suggested related searches.  After that I get Wikipedia, an aeronautical museum, a site called Live Science, a personal website reprinting a letter about flight published in Nature, and the Smithsonian.</p>
<p>In fact, everything on the first five pages is about the first of some kind of manned flight or other, and it looks like it's primarily reliable results.  (At that point I gave up, but I imagine the next five pages are fine as well.)</p>
<p>I don't see anything about &quot;flight man by george ezra.&quot;  In fact, I don't think there even is such a thing; if I Google &quot;flight man&quot; &quot;george ezra&quot; I don't find any such thing.</p>
<p>And I don't see a single link to Wikihow or Yahoo! answers in the first several pages of results.</p></div>		</li>
