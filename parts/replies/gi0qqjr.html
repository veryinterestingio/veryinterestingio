			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's a cool phenomenon! Another way I like to think of it is that a pure tone with no unique timbre is a sine tone. It is actually a physically smooth waveform. But, in the real world, we rarely ever have perfectly shaped waveforms. They are jagged and complex due to the changing presence of harmonics. It's also why a synthesizer sounds recognizably artificial to our ears (not to say that's a bad thing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can anybody sing well given proper training and continued practice? Or do physical limitations hinder somebody from having a good singing voice.</p>
<p>Not gonna lie, I sound like a combo of Ray romano and Kermit the frog and have never had a good singing voice despite all the careoke and shower singing I do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My coach said it's both. </p>
<p>Some people have an innate ability that needs fine tuning, others need to be tuned in totality and most can do this with time, patience and understanding it's not going to happen overnight. It's very very possible to learn to sing, it's a skill and skills can be taught with determination. </p>
<p>Tho.. if your say tone deaf or have hearing issues I'm not sure about that. I never really asked about it as I just had the thought of is singing a skill (can be learnt) or is it innate. </p>
<p>High and low notes not so much. There's a limit to how high and low people can go, while again that can be worked with, not everyone is going to hit Mariah Carey or Ariana's extreme highs. That's also something they would of been trained extensively in, to ensure they do it right and don't damage their chords. </p>
<p>Ariana actually had to stop doing impersonations of others like MC and Brittany Spears for the real fear she could harm herself forcing her vocal chords to do things they aren't naturally inclined to do. </p>
<p>If you have a singer who's object to vocal training etc.. chances are they aren't going anywhere fast. Even the best singers in the world have vocal coaches and have to practise and maintain their abilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had always heard the broadest pitch range was a toss up between Mariah Carey and Axle Rose, but I remember a Spin article from a few years ago that said Mike Patton from Faith No More (and Mr. Bungle, if you please) has a six octave range. </p>
<p>Just to lend perspective to how insanely incredible that is, an 88 key piano cover 7 octaves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my original career plans was being an opera singer so I saw the same singing coach for many, many years. She had all sorts of students from all over the talent range and my experience is that if someone is truly tone deaf, they will never be able to sing properly. </p>
<p>There was a rich dude there who genuinely enjoyed singing and hey, my coach needed students so whatever, it's all good, but... man. That guy. He spent literal <em>years</em> trying to pick up relatively easy songs that were clearly in his vocal range (his voice wasn't even bad!) but he <em>just didn't hear</em> when he was off-key or got a note wrong. I don't understand how, it was painfully obvious to everyone else in the room. I eventually realised that this wasn't the right career path for me so I stopped seeing my coach but I heard the guy sing for years and he just... never improved beyond the very basics. It's really odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight correction, it is called vocal cords, not chords. Chords are when multiple notes are played at the same time, but cords is the flesh in your throat that produces sound. Great post tho!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A vocal coach I worked with many years ago explained it to me this way: anyone can master the techniques of how to sing correctly, given enough time and effort, but some people are still going to have more, or less, objectively pleasant voices to listen to.</p>
<p>That coach also told me however, that it's also very important to recognize which songs and types of music your voice is best suited for. Like one of the other women working with my coach had a naturally very thin, youthful sounding voice, so she mostly sang more bouncy, cute kinds of songs. Whereas my own voice is kind of low for a woman and has a fuller sound, so the coach frequently encouraged me to go with more bluesy, crooning songs instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told that too, but I don't particularly like the types of music my voice is best suited for.  My voice is kind of sweet and girlish, and all my favorite songs are some variation of angry, raspy, tortured, and/or belting anthems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took singing lessons for 10 years and was a competitive barbershop quartet singer for 6 years at the international level (yes its a thing). In my opinion anyone can learn to sing well provided theres nothing physically wrong with your vocal tract or brain. People will have different starting points and different rates of improvement but anyone without a medical issue can do it with enough commitment and healthy technique.</p>
<p>Singing is not always intuitive because a lot of the muscles involved have a low amount of nerve endings, so you can't really feel them, and there are also more elements contributing to your vocal tract than most people realize, so you might need a teacher to help you understand how to achieve what ever it is you want to do with your voice</p></div>		</li>
