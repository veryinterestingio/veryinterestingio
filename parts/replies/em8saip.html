			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want your job title to be &quot;astrophysicist&quot; you will most likely need a PhD. A bachelor's in astrophysics will open you up to plenty of job opportunities, but probably not many that would have you on the forefront of astrophysical/cosmological research. With an undergraduate degree you could be a lab tech, a staff scientist/engineer at a variety of companies, a teacher, a data analyst, etc. If you aren't looking to get a graduate degree, the best thing you can do for your career is get experience either on campus doing research or off campus as an internship/part-time job in a field you're interested in. Those experiences will develop your skills not only to be attractive to employers but also to help you find out what you like and where you want to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on your skill set and what you're willing to do, there is a great number of job opportunities. Are you good with coding and data analysis? There are a LOT of industry jobs that want people who know how to handle large data sets. </p>
<p>Even with just a bachelor's degree, there is a lot you can do. If you want to stick closer to physics/astrophysics, I would look at places like NIST or government based outreach groups. I have quite a few physicist friends with just B.S. who work for either companies or government organizations. </p>
<p>In terms of location, I know the Silicon Valley area is great for data analysis. DC is where most of my friends are, since there's a lot of opportunities with both the government and the local tech companies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a bachelors in Astrophysics.  Went on to get my Ph.D.  I now work for a non-profit laboratory on really cool stuff.  Not what I studied in college, but once you learn how to learn you can do anything.</p></div>		</li>
