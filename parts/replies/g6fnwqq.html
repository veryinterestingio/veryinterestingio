			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like playing the piano. </p>
<p>Some songs I could not tell you what note comes next or write the sheet music down, because it's purely muscle memory. Especially if it's an old piece I haven't played in a long time...the more I try to remember what note comes next, the more I mess up. I just have to let my fingers do their thing without thinking about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting medical story about this, and how the musical memory process doesn’t really touch the event memory process.</p>
<p>British musician Clive Wearing suffered significant brain damage in 1985 that completely disabled his working memory - he is unable to recall past events or remember new ones.  Doesn’t know his name, his family, nothing.</p>
<p>He could still play the piano at an expert level and read sheet music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You remind me when I had to write down my password on paper for my wife to access my Gmail. And I freaked out because I couldn't remember it and I even double freaked out when I had to go and retype the wrong password (what I thought the correct password) which I wrote on the paper. </p>
<p>I even triple freaked out trying to go through the password reset process of gmail and I was not able to complete it.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. Closed my eyes. And my hands typed the password on the keyboard correctly.</p>
<p>I was close to shit myself that day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice explanation. Some random, related, facts:</p>
<p>1) The spinal cord can trigger muscle motions! These are reflexes, like letting go of hot things. The spinal cord says to let go before the brain can process what's going on. This isn't really memory per se but it's an adaption from evolution.</p>
<p>2) Muscles don't have memory: the central nervous system has the memories. However, muscles do &quot;remember&quot; in two ways: 1) Their neurons can learn to fire muscle fibers all at the same time. This neural adaption helps people become stronger without necessarily gaining more muscle (three people pushing a car all at the same time is stronger than 3 people pushing a car out of sync.) 2) Muscles seem to &quot;remember&quot; when they used to be  bigger. So, if you gain mass in a particular place, then lose that muscle mass, you can gain it back more quickly. In this way, your muscles &quot;remember&quot; they used to be bigger and can get bigger faster the next time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard that from people who work in the kitchen that they can override their reflexes. So maybe they do have some kind of &quot;memory&quot; or ability to override the withdrawal reflex.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, funny part of muscle memory while typing on keyboard is when you misplace one hand slightly during start - and let's say - type &quot;i&quot; instead od &quot;o&quot; - if you're typing fast enough, before you'll realize the mistake, the whole word you've just typed will have all letters typed by this hand moved by one place. happened to me dozen of times - if I start to type with hand moved too left or too right and don't watch either keyboard or screen, everything's shifted. like I'm typing in some rot-13 type of code ;D</p></div>		</li>
