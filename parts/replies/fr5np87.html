			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a nice answer, but isn't it also so, that the color large pigments get &quot;stuck&quot; inside the macrophages, which then die and get swallowed by another macrophage, which also gets stuck and so on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine those macrophages as the garbage collectors of our immune system(they are just cells tho, not living organisms). One of their jobs is to bring away old, dead cells and other unwanted particles.
The colour that gets into our skin from a tattoo gets marked as unwanted particles -&gt; &quot;trash&quot;.
Some of the smaller trashparticles get carried away by our trash collectors. But a lot of those particles are too heavy to lift and walk away with. They try it anways. Now the trash collector stands there, with this heavy color particle in his hands, but he can't walk because it's too heavy/big. But he's not giving up, which some day leads to his death by old age.(1-3 months) Then another trash collector tries the same with the color particle, just so fail as well.
This happens in huge numbers at the same.</p>
<p>I hope this explanation was ok, also I wanna mention I am not biologist or physiologist, that's basically how I've heard it from different sources over time. It fits to my knowledge about immune system and macrophages tho, which I learned quite a bit about in physiology classes.</p></div>		</li>
