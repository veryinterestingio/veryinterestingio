<p><em>Never</em> feeling that way is how we end up with the Dunning-Kruger effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that means that from inside the cockpit you don't even know you broke the sound barrier. </p>
<p>Is that specific fact (&quot;I just crossed the sound barrier&quot;) important in and of itself, though?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mach 1 does matter a bit, but what truly matters is when the flow over the wings goes supersonic because that causes shocks which can seriously affect the aerodynamic properties of the wing if not designed properly. This occurs when the aircraft Mach number is a bit less than one and depends on the aircraft. Swept wings delay this a fair bit. Look at 707s - they have a lot more sweep than 737s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That touches on why I specified &quot;in and of itself&quot; because in your response when you talk about the Mach number, you're essentially using a shorthand to talk about speed, right? </p>
<p>Even when you say that going supersonic can cause shocks, that's not related to sound, but just the speed you'd need to attain to get there, right? </p>
<p>Genuinely curious, since sound is vibration and this might have something to do with resonance or something, like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.</p></div>		</li>
