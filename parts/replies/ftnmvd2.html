			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is a horrible conductor.  Salt water is a great conductor.  Honestly water is a fairly good conductor when contaminated with just about anything.  Lots of folks have been killed when a car/boat battery has fallen in a lake near to them.  And their friends got killed when trying to pull them out.  Letâ€™s not phrase things such that folks start running toasters by their jacuzzis.  </p>
<p>But your point that the electricity will spread out over the surface is fairly accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water being a good conductor would <em>prevent</em> that from happening.  People get shocked when current goes through them.  But if a battery is in water, the current can just conduct through the water to get between the terminals.  The issue with getting shocked is more when you have positive and negative terminals far apart and you are between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I'm assuming the people hanging out in the electrified water were breaking the surface, where the electricity was spreading. I wonder if they were completely submerged if it would have affected them, and to what degree?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm skeptical that 12V would be enough to kill someone. I'm aware that it only takes a few milliamps to actually stop a human heart, but even wet skin still has a fair bit of resistance to it.</p>
<p>Now, someone being shocked, reacting by gasping in water, and subsequently drowning... That, I can see happening.</p></div>		</li>
