			<div class="markdown"><p>Just observationally, it gets windier at night in the desert. It'll be maybe 10-20 mph during the day then kick up to 25-30 mph overnight. Is it an opposite effect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this affect the waves, though? Wouldn't that just cause the wind to increase on land?</p>
<p>I'm SO close to understanding this question I have never even thought about but now need the answer to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>imagine you have a large sheet of wood on a table.</p>
<p>If you life up that sheet of wood, youre creating a bigger space between the table and the sheet. The air for that needs to come from somwhere, so it rushes in from the sides. That horizontal airflow is the wind.</p>
<p>It happens pretty much the same on earth. The day heats up the ground, air gets warmer and rises. (in this case, the warm air is the sheet of wood)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an oceanographer, but avid surfer and like oceanography and meteorology so here is my stab at it. </p>
<p>Waves are created by the friction of wind on the surface of the water (wind wave). When the wind blows over water for a long distance (called a fetch) the many small wind waves converge and get sorted into larger and more spread out waves (longer period of time between each wave, called the wave period). These waves created do not dissipate when they leave the area of wind, but rather consolidate more into distinct waves and continue to spread out (increase in wave period), these are swell waves. Swells can travel for thousands of miles with little energy loss in deep water, before they encounter shallow water and then break on a coastline. </p>
<p>Swell waves generally have wave periods of 13-20+ seconds, whereas wind waves have periods less than 8 seconds. Wave energy/power is proportional to wave height and wave period. On the beach, swells generally will have significantly more power than other waves, and will be present when the surface of the ocean is calm/smooth/glassy appearing, irrespective of what the wind is doing. Wind waves will only be present when the surface of the ocean in bumpy/choppy/rough appearing and when the wind is blowing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Swell waves are generated by strong winds too, however these winds happen further away, create the wave and then that wave travels a long distance before crashing somewhere.</p>
<p>Swell waves can appear on perfectly calm/otherwise flat days. Wind waves will only be generated if strong winds are present.</p></div>		</li>
