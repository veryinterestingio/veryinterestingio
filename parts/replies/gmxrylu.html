So I'm not optimistic about eradication of SARS-CoV-2 for a lot of reasons, including those you note. But long-term control of the virus and prevention of its most severe outcomes would still be a tremendous success, and one much more within our reach.</p>
<p>As for the rollout strategy, it's definitely been designed to prioritize the most vulnerable--particularly those groups at greatest risk of death from the disease. That's the principal justification for prioritizing 65+ individuals, as this great op-ed from Ruth Faden and Saad Omer explains - <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/08/best-vaccination-strategy-is-simple-focus-americans-65-older/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/08/best-vaccination-strategy-is-simple-focus-americans-65-older/" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/08/best-vaccination-strategy-is-simple-focus-americans-65-older/</a></a></p>
<p>I think that the rollout pace in the US is very likely to surge well above 2 million doses/day by April, and I'm more concerned about ensuring there's adequate _demand_ among the public for COVID vaccines as we move further into vaccination and have provided doses to the current groups eager to get them as soon as they can. That stage--where vaccine hesitancy, not supply or delivery capacity--is our greatest constraint will create a new set of challenges that we're right to start thinking about and addressing already.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I took a class (college student) in 2018 called “Great Diseases of the World.” Fantastic class, and fascinating stuff. One of the challenges we talked about with eradication was whether the disease had easily identifiable characteristic symptoms (like smallpox!), which would also be a challenge with SARS-CoV-2. But you’re right - even with relatively few diseases actually eradicated, vaccines have saved millions of lives. There’s so much benefit to be gained beyond eradication alone. (Plus: mRNA vaccines successful in humans! Super exciting for the future of vaccine development!)</p>
<p>You also make a really good point about vaccine hesitancy rapidly becoming the biggest challenge to vaccine rollout. It’s been really interesting to engage with and watch how the conversation around vaccines has shifted throughout the pandemic. In some ways I think having this new type of vaccine has started more conversations than there were before, at least in some circles. Obviously there are so many factors at play given everything that has happened in the past year and a half, but open conversations are a start. </p>
<p>Thanks for doing the AMA!</p></div>		</li>
