<p>To my knowledge, autistic people have a much flatter IQ curve, so they are disproportionately found at both ends of the IQ spectrum</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a negative correlation between IQ and schizophrenia (the most common psychotic disorder), but it's unclear if this is a symptom of the disorder or a risk factor that precedes the disorder. The answer is probably both.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5743746/" target="_blank">this study</a>, patients had normal pre-morbid IQ, but it declined after onset. In 30% of patients, IQ declined less than 10 points. In 70% of patients, IQ declined 10-30 points.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26984150/" target="_blank">this study</a> argues that IQ deficits precede the onset of the disease:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not likely that the IQ scores deteriorate during the prodromal phase or first psychotic episode; they are already present before the onset of the prodromal phase and have been detected in childhood.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is hard to measure premorbid IQ with the onset of frank psychosis, but there's <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.07081242" target="_blank">evidence that those who go on to be Dx'd with psychosis have significantly lower IQ.</a></p>
<p>EDIT - also a comment to think about the systemic issues that are at play here.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4274585/" target="_blank">We know that people of Color are routinely diagnosed with psychosis/SMI more than White individuals</a>. And we know that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence" target="_blank">issues arising with race and IQ that doesn't stem from the measure itself*</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT 2 to update for Anidel93's pertinent comments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that the APA did not find an issue with the measure of IQ as it relates to race. They do not know why the group difference exists (there are proposed reasons) but it is not due to the measure itself. This can be seen in their response to the IQ and Bell Curve frenzy in 90s.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of course, the difficulties arise because schizophrenia is notable for how often you'd find a prodrome lasting years before frank psychosis. However, in this study they did manage to find a lot of data from childhood, which should be long before any prodrome/self-disturbance development. So even though we still need a bit of conjecture, I think this seems like pretty decent evidence.</p></div>		</li>
