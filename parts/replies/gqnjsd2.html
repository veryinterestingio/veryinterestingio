			<div class="markdown"><p>So if a photon doesn't experience time, does it experience motion?</p>
<p>Or is it itself just an instantaneous connection between two different objects?</p>
<p>I mean how does everything work out of there is no time ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say a photon is send out by the sun and hits your eye:</p>
<p>From a classical perspective it takes approximately 8 minutes for the photon to be created, travel to the earth and be absorbed by a molecule in your eye. </p>
<p>For the photon its creation and absorption happen simultaneously. Motion is distance per time, and since for the photon there is no time, it also can't have motion. Also the photon isn't actually a &quot;particle&quot; due to wave-particle duality which makes this even more confusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but from the perspective of the photon, what is it?</p>
<p>For us it's something moving through space but for the photon?</p>
<p>Why does it oscillat when it's can't in its frame of reference no time passed?</p>
<p>AFAIK it's just that everything with energy is osculating but dude that's an old memory</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But wave experiences time then how do I picture photon having duality? Can a particle and its wave be fundamentally different?</p></div>		</li>
