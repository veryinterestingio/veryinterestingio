<p>That's not right. We usually don't have spontaneous re-emission except for in some special materials that fluoresce. Fluorescence has little to do with everyday transmission and reflection in the visible spectrum.</p>
<p>Absorbed light instead is internally converted to heat in the material. The reflected light you see is the natural result of classical wave mechanics, not electronic emission. Diffuse reflections happen because real materials aren't homogeneous isotropic single crystals.</p></div>		</li>
