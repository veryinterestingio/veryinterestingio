			<div class="markdown"><p>Sedimentary is the type of rock. It's the consolidation of sediments that can form over a carcass (or sometimes living animal!) like dirt or sand quickly and preserve it. Example are like the sand dunes of the Mongolian desert where velociraptor lived. If a fight took place under a sand dune and caused it to collapse, engulfing the dinosaur and would be preserved. This animal would be preserved in sandstone once time and pressure forced the sand in density of sandstone. Or an animal falling into a river and drowning in its mouth,  or the base of a waterfall also see a large deposit of sediment carried by the water and are protected from terrestrial bacteria and scavengers, allowing it to be protected. Information about stone types and previous geography. Can also help them know where to dig. If you wan where for time they can date the rock by depth and carbon dating</p></div>		</li>
