			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad I could be of help! As with many things, there isn't a clear cut answer to most questions. People tend to focus on facts a lot, which is great, but lacks the nuance of such questions. This is why I highlighted the &quot;assumption&quot; component more than the rest. To get the most correct answer, you have to ask the most encompassing question. Answers are great, but the question makes the answer!</p></div>		</li>

<p>A rigid object hitting the floor will be more damaging than a limp object hitting the floor. Think of this like punching a wall vs. a big pile of jello. The wall is rigid and will accumulate the impact in the spot where you hit it. The jello will diffuse the impact by allowing the shock to spread. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is actually one of the reasons why a drunk driver will more often survive a crash than their victims or a sober person in a similar crash. An inebriated person literally takes the path of least resistance and usually has fewer injuries than expected in impact cases. </p>
<p>Children not only don't have the fears that adults do and thus don't tense up the same, but their joints and bones are more resilient than adults' joints and bones. Children are factually more resilient than adults in this aspect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good example! This is also why we are teached to drive with our body close to the steering wheel as well. If you cannot fully lock your joints, the impact won't be all on the joints, but diffused.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Source? The worst ‚Äúbracing‚Äù against an impact can do is breaking your wrists or arms. Which is better than suffering a head or spine injury.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Reminds me of that American Dad episode where they repeatedly claimed getting piss ass drunk before crashes will magically keep you unharmed.</p></div>		</li>
