			<div class="markdown"><p>I have mild misophonia and it’s very weird! Randomly chewing triggers my fight or flight instinct, and always has done. It’s quite intermittent for me though luckily, for some it can be really hard to handle. Half way through dinner and you’re all jittery and nervous for no good reason. It really annoys the poor people (mostly my wife!) who trigger it, and rightly so, as on the outside it just looks like I’m being very rude about someone else’s eating habits. Weirdly also, mimicking the speed they’re chewing really helps to alleviate the nervousness.</p></div>		</li>
