			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess.  But eating healthy seems counterproductive(for the competition, not health) imo, considering that you will have a lesser appetite/won't be used to eating so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There well might be. Competitive eating to that level, and Youtube channels where people consume thousands of calories in a sitting, are relatively new, so I wouldn't think many, if any, long term studies have been done on the effects on the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two main ways. </p>
<p>1) Lubrication. Water is the key, and you drink it quite liberally to help food compact/coagulate more readily, and to get it down faster. </p>
<p>2) Physiology. The peristaltic mechanism of the throat can—with practice that’s usually not worth the invested time unless you’re kobayashi or better—be “beefed up,” as it were, by bobbing one’s head in sync with one’s swallowing. By doing this, you also give the food the largest possible passageway at all points from teeth to trachea.</p></div>		</li>
