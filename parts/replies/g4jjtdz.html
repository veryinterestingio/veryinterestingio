			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. If a person sneezes and if the breeze brings it to your face standing 10 feet away is bad. But note that you need to be standing directly downwind of that person. In general, a vigorous breeze will not only move the ejected puff of air downwind but will also tend to mix it and thereby dilute it. This dilution is good since every breath we take will have a far less chance of breathing in a bug.</p></div>		</li>
