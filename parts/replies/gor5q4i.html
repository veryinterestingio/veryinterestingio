			<div class="markdown"><p>Helmholtz resonance is actually super common and important in a lot of technology. It's how whistles work - you blow air past a hole just like the car window and it makes a repeating pulse of air. This is also how blowing over a bottle makes noise, and basically how most woodwind instruments work.</p>
<p>There's even a similar effect in electromagnetism where passing a current over metal cavities produces electromagnetic waves. The device is called a 'cavity magnetron' and it's how microwaves generate their... microwaves.  </p>
<p>*Edit* just realized, when you're in a car that's 'thumping' like that you're basically inside of a giant whistle blowing such a low-frequency note that you feel it instead of hearing it! Never thought of it this way, pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: as our car designs get more aerodynamic, the Helmholtz resonance gets stronger. (More non disrupted air is passing by our windows)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generically fluid dynamics, meaning these effects could happen even in water not just air. WRT cars from what I've seen it's more repeatable than random. It's random as to which car, which window, how much to roll down. Every car I've ever had does this to some extent. Example, I have a 2006 Ford Expedition for about 2 years. It's a giant resonator. I always open the right side rear window to make cross breeze for AC. (OPening no other windows.) I open it 1-2&quot;, there's some noise. Open 4-5&quot; the noise gets HUGE, overpowering and extremely annoying. It's repeatable in that it happens every time I do it. (Which is usually by accident because I know it's going to happen.) It starts to happen at low speed 15-20mph. The 'repeatability' (scientific method) question is, does the same happen for other people with the same car/window/amount/speed. It probably does to a pretty close tolerance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh it’s definitely repeatable between cars in the same conditions. Complaining customers will every once in a while come in and drive 3 more cars just like the one they bought so they can “show” people who actually know what’s happening what’s wrong and then end up leaving usually more confused</p></div>		</li>
