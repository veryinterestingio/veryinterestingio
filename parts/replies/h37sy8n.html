<p>It bears mentioning that mediums wave but wave-particle duality describes particles unambiguously as opposed to any medium. </p>
<p>The reason matter gets a “wavelength” is mathematical and analogizes lumps with waves which they are not. It’s analogy / model/ math tools, as opposed to realistic description of stuff. The key to something’s wavelength (as opposed to some medium’s) is the introduction of uncertainty in the measurement of its state. Quantum systems are extremely minute, easy to destroy, and once set up evolve probabilistically and counterintuitively as if their state carries a periodic phase shift - the phase occurs only in such special cases where uncertainty of state is present, it is the reason for “wave-particle duality”, it defines the wavelength, and so forth.</p>
<p>To explain uncertainty I can say that we take for granted light resolves what we see, but when what we want to look at is as small as light itself, there’s no gaurantee that when the light touched it it didnt change it. That’s an introduction of uncertainty.</p>
<p>One reason why light is not an electromagnetic wave is the photoelectric effect (experimental result). Einstein first rose to fame by stating light’s energy was related to its colour not its intensity to resolve this result. If light were a wave of a medium, its energy would be related to its intensity. Using precursors of cathode ray tubes (just like an old tv, old radar, or old oscilloscope) it was show not to be so. Einsteins quantum light, the photon, predates special relativity and puts to rest light as a literal wave.</p>
<p>The modelling of interference patterns of light, refraction, and other wave phenomena to do with light are recovered through quantum theory and giving light uncertainty, as well as a periodic pattern to its propagation as defined by its energy. The wavelength of light is not its literal wavelength but by definition it’s energy divided by a constant. Depending on the energy of light it can be exclude from certain states or greatly increase likelihood of other states. This is not unusual, its quite natural for example that a roller coaster left alone is most likely in a well not on a peak. It’s just with uncertain stuff that specific pattern of likeliness and unlikeliness for whatever absurd reason looks wavy mathematically/ descriptively but obviously not literally since there’s no medium waving</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this! Extremely interesting and well explained. I read that Tesla did look into the luminiferous ether theory but I might be wrong.</p></div>		</li>
