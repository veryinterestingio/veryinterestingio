			<div class="markdown"><p>When a massage therapist focuses on trigger points and uses an elbow or whatever on the neck muscles and it suddenly relaxes and you get a warm endorphin rush .. is that a muscle releasing?
I am a mess of knots ... Just pressing on the knots they are numb and tingly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sure is!  The part of the muscle that is most tense is called a knot, or a trigger point. It feels like a little soft marble under the skin. Applying and holding deep pressure is my favorite way to release these points.  Initially the pressure is met with resistance, but after holding it for a while the knot remembers to relax, and just melts... it’s a really beautiful thing.  I sometimes call it, ‘enforced relaxation’ :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just reading that was so satisfying. I get terrible knots around my shoulder blades. I love my massage therapist so much. If she ever leaves my city I may actually die a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trigger points are sometimes things called Golgi tendon organs. They're basically little structures in the muscle that detect the tension in the muscle (actually in the tendons). When they are pressed on the Golgi tendon organ detects what it thinks is a large amount of tension and releases chemicals that cause the muscle to relax as a way to protect the muscle from being damaged. A good one you can do to yourself is the trapezius muscle on the back of your neck. It's the big one that comes from the side of your neck to the top of your shoulder. If you squeeze it pretty hard until it hurts and then let go you'll feel a massive release in tension after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you,that was interesting.  I have experienced emotional release from a massage.  Also, I had one massage therapist who sent me into a meditative state for the entire massage, almost as soon as she started massaging.  I miss her, that was heaven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, I love those types of massages. I like to take the über driver’s rule when giving massage- let silence happen if the client wants it.  Often I get a meditative buzz myself!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!  I think learning how to talk about massage is one of the most important and most challenging aspects of becoming a LMT.  Glad to see a fellow bodyworker here! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm starting to really realize that. Second year into private practice and my not great phone skills and atrocious sales skills and general fear about performing an elevator speech have been really rough challenges for me. I saved your comment to go back and keep trying to learn this side of the massage business. I've been told great things about my bodywork itself but seriously wish me luck on staying in the game ??</p></div>		</li>
