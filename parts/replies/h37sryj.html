			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no particular need to &quot;kill all the germs.&quot; For one thing it not possible but more importantly if you wash them down the drain into the sanitary sewer there's no one down there the they are going to harm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regular soap is also quite good at killing germs because the soap dissolves the outer membrane of many bacteria/viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that the soap somehow breaks apart the cell wall of the bacteria, killing it <em>and</em> washing it off of your hands. </p>
<p>Whereas hand sanitizer simply kills the bacteria and leaves it on your hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in a somewhat similar way that soap can be an insecticide, in both cases by breaking down the protective outer coating of the creature.</p>
<p>If you get aphids or scale bugs on your lemon tree, you can use a (biodegradable) soap-water mix to wash off the tree, the suds will kill any aphids or scale it soaps up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes soap does both. From wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In hand washing, as a surfactant, when lathered with a little water, soap kills microorganisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins. It also emulsifies oils, enabling them to be carried away by running water.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the same initially but then I thought about how hand sanitizer stinks so much of alcohol and it made sense that it would kill bacteria but if soap could kill bacteria why wouldn’t sanitizer be made in a similar way so it smells much nicer and it isn’t as rough on your skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>depends on the composition.</p>
<p>generally yes that's all that it does but killing bacteria is often a sideffect as the process of bonding with water and oils means it also interferes with the exchanges going thru the cell walls of some of these bacteria, killing them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes and no. Being the salt of a fatty acid, soap has a polar structure. This is what makes it a great surfactant that lets it bond to both fat and water. </p>
<p>What this means is that it is very effective at killing viruses and bacteria that have a phospholipid bilayer cell membrane, which is just a layer of polar fatty molecules. The polar structure of soap molecules disrupts the fatty cell wall and allows water to flush in and burst the cell. </p>
<p>Soap is not effective at actually killing bacteria with a hard capsid cell membrane though, but it is extremely effective at washing them off you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope to your nope. Soaps also kill (most) microorganisms. We add soap to bacterial cultures in the lab to rapidly decontaminate them. I don’t know why this is getting upvoted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may kill them in the drain, but the whole point of soap is to remove the microorganism from our skin, not kill it.</p></div>		</li>
