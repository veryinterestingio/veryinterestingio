<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Things like conditioner are only cosmetic, they do not change the structure of the hair.  They do however change the <em>feel</em> of the hair.  Generally, they leave a deposit of ingredients behind that will slick down the hair follicles that the shampoo just opened up.  They might also have UV inhibitors to protect hair dye.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Deep conditioners usually have a higher viscosity and more film-forming agents to keep the magic pixie ingredients stuck to your hair after you rinse it off.  Some work better than others, likely because they put more material in, and less water.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So if you want a deep conditioner without buying the marketing hype? Just try a little conditioner in your hand after you get out of the shower and rub it in your hair that way.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever consider doing an /r/AMA? I bet it would be really popular.</p>
<p>Edit to add a question- I sometimes use a very tiny amount of either baby oil or coconut oil instead of conditioner, especially in winter. I work it into my hair only, and then rinse with warm water. The oil doesn’t rinse away, the warm water seems to help distribute it more evenly. Is the oil doing the same job as the conditioner would do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: you know the cool foaming dish soap that comes in pump bottles? The kind that turns a few drops of soap into a handful of foam, so you use less, but it's super expensive and the bottles all say &quot;refill ONLY with our special foaming dish soap?&quot;</p>
<p>That's bullshit. Refill it with 1 part regular dish soap to 5-10 parts tap water, and shake well. Works perfectly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Won't refilling with tap water just provide an environment for bacteria to grow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also a chemist though i deal more with soaps than lotions. </p>
<p>some stuff is slightly different purely based on how it feels to use. for us the difference in viscosity (how thick or flowing something is) doesn't make much difference in the efficacy of the product, but it can change the way people perceive its effectiveness.  I'm pretty certain that a lot of the lotions (at least that my company makes) have pretty similar ingredient lists with only slight variations based on the targeted application site/method. the biggest difference is what was already mentioned, the actives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a very specific question that you may or may not be able to answer.</p>
<p>I have an allergy to tocopheryl acetate. Tocopherol is fine (it's just vitamin E), but mixed with acetic acid (literally vinegar), my body flips out. Migraines, swelling and redness, acne, etc... I've been reading lots of labels. That stuff is everywhere!</p>
<p>I've noticed that if a product is creamy, there's a much higher chance it's preserved with tocopheryl acetate than if it's an ointment, spray, or otherwise oil based product. This seems to be true across most types of products: diaper rash treatments, hydrocortisone, moisturizers, sunscreen, the list goes on. (Lipsticks and glosses seem to be opposite, go figure.)</p>
<p>Do you know why? It's not that important. I'm mostly just curious why it seems better suited for creams.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VitE is a anti oxidant. Added to stop fatty products from going off. The VitE ‘grabs’ the oxygen and prevents oxidative rancidity. Creamier/ thicker products can contain more fats, which you need to stop from going rancid when exposed to air/oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats an interesting one. as far as i can tell it just has to do with shelf life of the product. having that form of Vitamin E helps it be more stable in the warehouse/on the shelf</p></div>		</li>
