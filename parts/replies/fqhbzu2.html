			<div class="markdown"><p>It would get more noticeable the higher up you went, right? So if we had a space elevator reaching out into space, would the platform at the top be doing most of the job of keeping the entire thing upright rather than the actual structure of the elevator? Hopefully that makes sense, wasn't really sure how to word it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has covered earth's surface,  but relative to this discussion, the higher you build a structure (like a space elevator) the more difference you would see.  At the height of a geostationary orbit you can drive up your space elevator, step out,  and just float there.  Or you could make the elevator so tall (skipping over the physics of rigidity and fluid dynamics) that its center of mass was at that height and you'd have a fixed structure that had no apparent weight. </p>
<p>Cool stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My physics professor adamantly insisted that there is no such thing as centrifugal force.  I was confused, and asked my old-school engineer dad to explain it to me so I could understand.  That was a semester of absolute hell while my Dad preached &quot;centrifugal force is real, your professor is an idiot!&quot; while my professor (also the guy who graded my exams) insisted my Dad was clinging to an outmoded idea and that centripetal force was real, not centrifugal.  I am certain that I would have left that class with a much clearer understanding of every topic if I had never asked Dad for help.    </p>

<p>When I was a kid, the school playground had one of those horizontal spinny wheels. When it spun faster, it pulled you out towards the rim. When you crossed the center, you had this odd feeling of force shifting</p>

<p>Right. Since centrifugal force doesn't exist in an inertial frame, it's not a real force, it's an apparent force.</p>
<p>If you're learning mechanics, it helps to not learn apparent forces or non-inertial frames, since they work ... differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The force, whatever you call it, arises from the fact that the object in question is constrained to move along a curved trajectory, when it &quot;wants&quot; to remain straight. From the non-rotating frame this force points outward in the direction from the center of rotation to the object. From the rotating reference frame it points in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The force is &quot;real&quot; in the sense that an acceleration is experienced as a result of constrained motion, and there must be a constraint force to ensure a curved trajectory is followed, but it is &quot;not real&quot; in the sense that it is not emergent from a field such as gravity, electromagnetism, heat, etc. </p>
<p>Source: I have a M.S. with a focus on dynamics and controls. For a living I develop math models for engineering systems such as aircraft, cars, etc. You would also find this discussed in a field called &quot;non-holonomic mechanics&quot; or &quot;geometric mechanics&quot;, which is the study of constrained dynamical systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was that centrifugal force is a misnomer because it's actually two forces, centripetal force of whatever is pushing towards the center, and the force of the object trying to travel in a straight line from being &quot;thrown&quot; (or spun). It's &quot;not real&quot; because the object isn't being forced away from the center towards the circumference, it's being forced away from its location on an adjacent vector of the circumference. </p>
<p>Not a physicist, just really enjoyed my Newtonian classes in college and that was how I wrapped my head around it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a rocket accelerating up. In the reference frame of the rocket, the Earth is accelerating down. What makes the Earth accelerate down? Is it a real force - is something pushing the Earth down - or is it just the fact that you're in an accelerating reference frame?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I should have touched on this first but orbital mechanics is entirely about velocity, meaning speed and a direction. Essentially being in orbit just means you're going fast enough and in the right direction (speed doesn't help if you're heading straight down lol) that you miss as you fall to the Earth. Since there's not enough air or anything else to slow a satellite downs it keeps flying around the Earth fast enough to keep &quot;missing.&quot;</p>
<p>This is not the real reason. The equator is the only place it is possible to keep something in geostationary orbit (meaning it stays above the same spot on Earth at all times.) Anything orbiting with an inclination (angle relative to the equator, anything more or less than 0 means it's not perfectly around the equator) that brings it north and south of the equator will move north and south relative to the ground. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit" target="_blank">This wikipedia page does a good job of explaining the difference.</a></p>
<p>For a space elevator to work it needs to be anchored to something orbiting the Earth or it won't have enough strength not to collapse under its own weight. This is why orbits are important. A space elevator that is anchored to an asteroid or station in orbit will have to bend and move north and south to keep things in a straight line unless its on the equator. True geostationary orbits are only over the equator, while all others are in geo<em>synchronous</em> orbits. Basically all geostationary orbits are also geosynchronous but the reverse isn't true. </p>
<p>If anyone's curious, objects in geostationary/synchronous orbit stay over the same point (or north/south line) relative to the Earth orbit the Earth once every in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Edit: Forgot to mention, an object tethered to the north pole would have no orbital velocity and would just fall straight down. Also forgot to mention what orbital velocity even is lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the big thing you are missing is that you are starting with the assumption that a space elevator is built by attaching to an orbiting object, as opposed to being just a really tall conventional tower. I think a lot of the confusion comes from people who don't understand why this assumption is being made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how much room for error do we have here? Let's say there's an error in determining where the exact equator is, and it's built like 100 feet off the dead center... would it fail? Or would it kind of lean towards the true equator, but the relative lean vs. the length of the elevator it would still mostly be straight and would stay intact?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would come down to what the elevator is built out of. Right now we don't have anything that's strong enough to support its own weight up to geostationary orbit, it's pretty high up. I would imagine there would need to be at least some flex, that's how modern buildings are built today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any conventional (or hypothetical) rigid material can pretty easily absorb 100ft of flex over the span of \~30k miles. Materials that might actually be space elevator candidates would most likely be much more flexible. It may be an issue at some point, but until then I wager it'd just sway slightly as the earth rotates.</p></div>		</li>
