			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres only so many journalists in each field.</p>
<p>Heres an example; theres probably only like 5 journalists that cover Washington Redskins team. One from each of the popular sports networks.</p>
<p>So the owner Dan Snyder, GM, head coach, players will all know those people. If word gets out one of them cant keep their trap shut, boom, blacklisted. They won't ever get the breaking news type tidbits again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a hard one but journalism is a small world that inherently relies on people having an ear to the ground, and that includes on your own industry.</p>
<p>Something like an off the record agreement being broken is something that goes straight to your editor in chief if not higher. And it's in the interest of your editor in chief (or higher) to be ruthless in demonstrating that they don't stand for that (otherwise they risk jeopardizing having sources for any of their other stories / reporters).</p>
<p>Most of the process of finding sources is also based on networking basically. You know people who know people who know people who know people. If you've ever had the chance to be near a press pool, you'll see the weirdest tense friendships ever. Communications staffers and reporters who talk and act like they're best friends but both sides know that they're both triple checking every single word they say to each other.</p></div>		</li>
