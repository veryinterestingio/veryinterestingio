			<div class="markdown"><p>When I lived in Oregon I remember reading something about how, eventually, all the forests will shift from predominantly Douglas Fir to predominantly Western Hemlock because the latter is shade tolerant. The hemlock will happily grow in the shadows of the larger Doug Firs until they are larger or the Firs die for whatever natural reason. Then the Fir seedlings won't be able to thrive and after a few thousand years of this you've got a flipped forest.</p></div>		</li>
