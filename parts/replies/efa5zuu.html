			<div class="markdown"><p>BT includes the torrent file which includes information about the download and thus it can check that the file is the same and in fact not corrupted.</p>
<p>Direct downloads do not include this information and I'd say it is likely that continuing saving on similarly named files which may or may not be complete would just lead to more issues than having to redo the download.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Range support has been a thing for a long time now... like at least 20 years</p>
<p>I think the other part of this equation is that to properly resume a download, browsers need to have an idea which parts might be corrupted to redownload. Without a hash this is not a definite thing, so out of caution I think a lot of times browsers just redownload the whole file. </p></div>		</li>
