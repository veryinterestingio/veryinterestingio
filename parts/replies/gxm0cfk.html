			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to emphasize that there is a very low correlation between suffering from schizophrenia and engaging in acts of violence. While there is some evidence that people with schizophrenia are slightly more likely to be violent than the general population, other studies have shown that this is almost always associated with drug abuse and schizophrenia that has gone untreated for a long time. Statistically, people with schizophrenia are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. </p>
<p>The reason I want to emphasize this is that the perception that people with schizophrenia are violent, ironically, makes them more likely to be violent. The common perception that people with schizophrenia are “crazy” and “violent” can make sufferers afraid to get treatment. Often, that means they attempt to self-medicate with drugs, and try to hide their condition. </p>
<p>When you consider the fact that the greatest chance for a person with schizophrenia to become violent happens when that person is using drugs and avoiding treatment, you can see where the problem is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely this.</p>
<p>My dad has paranoid schizophrenia and even in his darkest moments has never hurt anyone. He is much more likely to end up being hurt by his delusions than hurt someone else. The suicide rate for schizophrenia is sadly very high. He is well medicated and has a routine to keep things in control. I've never felt under threat from him in my life and I think that's way more common than violent episodes. I think he's a pretty typical case study from what I've heard. Easily managed in the community with therapy and antipsychotics. Non violent. Very intelligent and creative. Very low lows and really scary delusions that can lead him to feeling very scared. </p>
<p>Statistically people who suffer from schizophrenia are more likely to be the victims of crime than to commit crime.</p>
<p>It took my dad a long time to come to a really effective and not too invasive medication regime but now that that is well established and settled he really doesn't suffer much at all. His delusions are gone and his hallucinations are very mild. Things like mini crocodiles crawling over his page whilst he's trying to write - that sort of thing. Very manageable. So OP please encourage your friend to follow through and keep going with professional support.</p>
<p>Also be aware that a fair chunk of the advice in here will be biased towards arm chair psychologists who read a bit about some scary high profile cases as teenagers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for explaining this. I was reading a lot of forums online from my research about schizophrenia. And there was one titled &quot;Would you date a person with schizophrenia?&quot; The majority of the people answered negatively. Most said they wouldn't since they do not know how to handle episodes. They associated them with serial murderers and a lot of negative connotations. It was sad and got me panicked. </p>
<p>I remember my friend telling me, he had episodes where he heard demons telling him to die, and he has to be sent to a mental hospital for that. Thinking about that, makes me cry. I can't recall if he takes medications but whenever I talk to him, he's very calm and charming.</p>
<p>I love him so much, I couldn't afford to lose him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can tell that you care very much about this person and so much of advice you’re getting is very solid, but I would like to caution you to remember that no matter how deeply you care for or love him you cannot fix him. It may not seem like it now but there is very likely a day in your future with him where you wonder why you aren’t helping more or if you’re doing enough and it will be vital that you remember that while you may provide comfort and compassion you are not providing treatment and that’s totally okay. He’ll have doctors treating him, you don’t need to, but they can’t necessarily provide comfort and love the way you can so the help you are able to give will be incredibly important, but it probably won’t look the way you expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to take care of people you care about, but you absolutely should keep doing research on this and not dive into a relationship with the person. That might sound unfair, but getting into a relationship with a person with diagnosed emotional/psychological problems is going to be a huge commitment and something you should only enter armed with all the information possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a huge commitment. I want to deep-dive in his life and know him first. I know he has delusional thoughts. If we might not end up being together. I will always wish him to be safe and happy. I want him to live a normal life.</p></div>		</li>
