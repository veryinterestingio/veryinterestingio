			<div class="markdown"><p>More of a “let me finish out my years” job for people with a CDL. School bus drivers are typically part time, and it’s too easy to find full time work with a CDL to drive a bunch of rowdy kids around for a 25 hour paycheck. There’s a reason the majority of school bus drivers are old. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's mostly retirees, or older women who were stay at home moms until their kids grew up. I guy I used to work for retired and got his CDL just to drive a bus when he got tired of retirement. The pay isn't great, but it's just a few hours a day, and it gives him something to do. </p>
<p>Abd he let me drunk drive the bus around his farm before they put cameras on all of them.</p></div>		</li>

<ol>
<li>Half of new hires sign on knowing full well they will take their paid training, get their license, and work somehere else</li>
<li>Most of the rest are not cut out for the job, your heart has to be in it to deal with the little turds these days, especially 5th and 6th graders.</li>
</ol>
<p>Plus drivers are pretty well underpaid for a profession as important to a functioning school system as they are</p></div>		</li>
