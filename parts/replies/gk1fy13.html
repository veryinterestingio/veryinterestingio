			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a learned response - because you are taught about all the good things you can feel pride about when you are taught about the anthem. I can barely sing mine as I get too choked up every time. And as an adult I am well aware of all the things we should be ashamed of - but it doesn't erase the learned response. The music itself def isn't good enough on its own, nor are the lyrics.</p></div>		</li>
