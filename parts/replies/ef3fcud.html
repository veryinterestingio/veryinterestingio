<p>Though the events leading up to it's creation are a chain reaction, once the conditions are met the distortion of spacetime which renders a black hole is immediate.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder. Is it actually immediate, or is it just our perception due to a result of the extreme instability of space-time around the creation of a black hole.  </p>
<p>I guess this is primarily a semantic question, but I was thinking about this in terms of time dilation. From the outside it looks instant but maybe from an &quot;inside&quot; perspective it's not? Sort of how like a group of people traveling at light speed would perceive everything happening slower compared to those at rest?</p></div>		</li>

<p>From the moment we have the appropriate conditions I imagine it would take a Planck to communicate that state... if we were to attempt to observe the process. For all intents &amp; purposes it is considered immediate.</p>

<p>We can't say what happens on the inside. We can't even hypothesize as the maths produce infinities. But we can guess. Some things we can exclude are concepts such as causal relationships between Alice inside the black hole, and Bob observing safely in a distant galaxy. We can go so far as to challenge whether perspectives are a rational concept, or if Alice even exists as Alice. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, only at the singularity they do. In the right coordinate system, math works fine inside the event horizon. That doesn’t mean the theory is correct there, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the sake of a argument, even if the process was taking a substantial time, where would the matter evaporating from the surface of the forming black hole go? into the star, from which it would be drawn back by other collapsing matter. So even then there is no obstacle to creation of black hole</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's the case with Hawking radiation anyway. One of the virtual particle pairs falls back in, so you're losing the other half of the vp pair as Hawking radiation. If it does take substantial time, then we could expect the bh to lose mass pretty quickly. </p></div>		</li>
