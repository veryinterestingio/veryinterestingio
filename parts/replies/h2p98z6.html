			<div class="markdown"><p>If you dont mind me asking, how often would a &quot;normal' inuk use a igluvigaq? Like, since youve said the idea is to use them as temporal shelters, id guess most people in a family wouldnt go hunting and therefore wouldnt make one that often? Also, do you usually keep to the area after constructing one? Id guess with the work it must take its not a one-night deal</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have witnessed an Inuk building an Igluvigaq as part of training, they are masters of the snow. Yes, 2 man can totally build a shelter in a few hours. To the untrained, it took us, 4 men, 6 to 8 hrs... for a &quot;liveable&quot; shelter. Our final &quot;shape&quot; (dome) was too high and you lose the heat rising to an unusable area, walls were also sketchy... Our teachers built the Poogloo in under 30 minutes for the demo.</p></div>		</li>
