<p>Just wanted to add the other <em>other</em> meteorite clue â€” pallasites! Those super rare ones that have a metal matrix of the same alloy like iron-nickel meteorites, but with crystals of olivine embedded in them. They are thought to be core-mantle boundaries, so we even have snapshots of the bit where a planetary core blends into the rest of the planet(oid)!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Clue 1. Earth formation! The Earth is believed to have formed through collision of many smaller bits called planetesimals. When the energy of these collisions were modelled, it was found that it was easily enough to fully melt the earth. If that happened the densest material, ie iron would sink.</p>

<p>Do we know how massive the planetesimals (great word) were, on average?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That average changed over time. As small bits collided, they formed bigger bits. Most of this happened quite quickly, say in about 10-50 million years (short on the geological time scale). So you'd have to point to a specific time. And even then, it'd be a best guess if statistical distribution. A great deal of interesting computer simulation goes on here.</p>
<p>What's kind of interesting is that there's a snowball effect. When a planetesimal gets large enough, it starts to increase something called its capture cross section. This is where its gravity starts to curve small objects towards it that would normally narrowly miss. So the first things to get big are the most probable things to get bigger. Eventually, the process runs away and most of the small objects have either collided with something bigger (usually the sun, often Jupiter), or been dynamically ejected from the solar system.</p>
<p>Finally, these remaining objects may move about some, due to orbital resonance effects. Planets could, in theory, migrate around the solar system while this process is going on, due to changes in momentum (during collisions), or just due to resonances. Jupiter, being king of the planetary jungle, can nudge all sorts of things into place just by forcing things to resonate.</p></div>		</li>
