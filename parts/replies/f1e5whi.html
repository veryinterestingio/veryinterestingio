			<div class="markdown"><p>Sperm cells, themselves, are not basic, rather seminal fluid in which the sperm cells travel is slightly basic (a pH somewhere between 7 and 8). The pH of the vagina is indeed quite acidic (pH of ~4) which is quite caustic to unprotected cells, the pH of the vagina helping to protect against infection (and also possibly to protect against sperm themselves to reduce the rate of pregnancy thereby permitting women to be more selective in choosing prospective mates and becoming pregnant). The pH of the semen is actually beneficial to the survival of the sperm cells as it helps to increase the pH of the vagina and protect the sperm, i.e. sperm don't die because they're basic, rather any sperm cells that survive do so because they're protected by basic fluids.</p></div>		</li>
