The joke in the fusion community is that fusion energy is 40 years away and always will be.  This highlights the risk of making timeline predictions about technologies as complex as fusion.</p>
<p>That said, there has been tremendous progress in fusion technologies over the past decade.  While anybody that knows what they're talking about will tell you that the timeline to economically viable, large-scale fusion energy is still measured in decades, it is absolutely within reach.  The reason I believe this is twofold:</p>
<p>First, for the first time ever, there is serious private money being invested in fusion technologies.  There have been billions of dollars in private investment in fusion companies within just the last few years.  While support from governments is absolutely a necessary piece of the puzzle, private support is a great indication of the market demand and the increasing maturity of the technology.</p>
<p>Second, there have been some major advances in magnet technologies.  One of the reasons it's so hard to generate fusion energy is that you need really strong and complex magnetic fields to confine the plasma for sustained time periods.  There have been significant recent advances in the performance of superconducting magnet technology, that will go a long way in meeting this challenge.</p>
<p>That said, it is important to remember that there is still a lot of risk in developing fusion technologies for energy production.  This is why Phoenix has taken the approach of going after diverse markets other than energy that can benefit from fusion technology today in a profitable way.  This will not only generate revenue that can be reinvested to advance the state of the art in technology, but it will also prove to the private investment community that you can make money now on fusion technologies on the road to a much larger return once fusion energy becomes viable.</p></div>		</li>
