			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that is actually a really good comparison :) Women's breast wont grow any larger either if they take estrogen, but men will grow breast if they do. Obviously this is also because women's breast grow during puberty and men's don't.</p>
<p>Really good point! :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Two of my exes gained a cup size or two after going on the pill. It's absolutely a common side effect, since it effectively simulates pregnancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately I don't think so. Basically testosterone is just a transcription factor, its not signalling your body to be or grow a certain amount, its just binding to your DNA and telling your body which genes should be transcribed. You penis size is determined by genes, testosterone cant make your penis grow more than what you're genetically meant to, at some point it will just stop growing :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this question may sound silly, but why doesn't the clitoris grow to the size of a penis? If male level hormones are artificially added, why isn't a male level expression achieved? </p>
<p>Is it a limitation set by the amount of tissue the hormones have to work with, or is it some sort of chromosomal restriction? I think I remember seeing a documentary of intersex children, in one case a girl was developing a clitoris over 7 cm, so I'm a bit confused as to what sets the limit because most adult transmen on testosterone report growth up to 5 cm or less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the genes themselves are not there for typical sexed humans. XX or XY.</p>
<p>People can experience a wide range of being genetically different from the norm. Including XXY females can appear physically masculine, XXY males can appear physically feminine, XXXX females, XXYY males can appear both feminine and masculine, XXXXX females, XXXXY males can appear feminine, and several other abnormalities. Intersex isn't the medical term anymore. It's now &quot;Diorders of sex development&quot; due to the blurring of the line of what sex is.</p>
