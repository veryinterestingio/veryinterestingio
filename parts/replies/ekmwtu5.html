The actual mass of the black hole may be infinitesimally small, but there are alternative hypotheses.</p>
<p>To bring it back to the math, an event horizon's diameter is defined purely by the gravitational force, while the diameter of a planet is defined by the balance between gravitational force and the compressive strength of the planet, which can vary due to many factors. A planet with identical composition to Earth that is 8 times the mass would be less than 2 times the diameter, because the material is compressed more. And then different compositions will have different densities, and temperature can have an effect, and once you get to stars you also have to start considering the outward pressure of fusion or degeneracy pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally as rocky objects get larger, they get more smushed in their interior and the density increases with mass, so they increase in radius at a weaker-than-cubic scaling. We're learning a lot more about this with exoplanet data. There are other mass-radius relations out there, for example white dwarves and neutron stars actually have a smaller radius if they have a larger mass.</p>
<p>I think we don't have answers to your first question, we basically treat it as a point mass.</p></div>		</li>
