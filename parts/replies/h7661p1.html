			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, funny story about conditioning. My sister is terrified of spiders. She can't even kill them because she's so scared of them. When she started having kids, she taught them to also be scared of spiders, mostly through demonstration. It worked on all but her youngest, the fourth child. He has no qualms about spiders. Absolutely zero. For instance, my sister and her husband were going out of town for almost a week, so my parents were watching the kids at their place. One day a spider showed up. All the kids started screaming and hollering, except the youngest. While my mom ran to grab a shoe with which to squish the spider (worth noting that my mom is also scared of spiders), this two year old mad lad proceeded to walk calmly to the spider, grab it, and squish it bare handed. He then had to show my dad what was left of his kill, as he was quite pround of himself. Not quite the experience I thought I'd be getting as an uncle, but there's few things that make me prouder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My little sister did exact same thing when she was very young (about the same age as the youngest you tallef about) and she was our designated spider killer lol.</p>
<p>Now she is the one that is the most scared of spiders in the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid I didn't have any qualms with letting insects or spiders walk on my hand.</p>
<p>But as an adult I find the idea disgusting. It's 100% a learnt fear for myself. But I'm slowly overcoming it so there's hope.</p>
<p>I was inspired by a friend who grew up on a farm and still lives there. She sends me snaps of her interacting with various insects sitting on her hands. She has no fear whatsoever so why can't I? I've had all sorts of fears that I've been able to overcome so why not this one too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you aren’t scared of spiders, you DON’T kill them. Because why would you?
A person who kills them is still scared of them, even if they don’t engage in theatrics about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. If your family is screaming, you'd kill them. Or perhaps transport them outside if you felt so inclined. But killing them doesn't mean you're afraid of them necessarily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not afraid of flies but if there’s a fly in the house I kill it. Some people just don’t like bugs crawling around their house. I leave the spiders in the garage and basement pretty much completely alone but if one is on my counter it’s going to Valhalla</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hadn't heard of this study before. Really curious as it doesn't reflect my (super limited and anecdotal) experience of arachnophobes tending to be the only one in the family. Which often makes it worse, as what can be more fun than pretending a spider is crawling up the neck of your little brother who is ultra afraid of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh. Shit. I think you may be onto something. My dad is hilariously afraid of spiders and we used to watch Arachnophobia together when I was a kid. Dammit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a VHS of Arachnophobia that I watched over and over again as a kid. Used to keep jumping spiders when I was younger as well. I just find spiders really intriguing.</p></div>		</li>
