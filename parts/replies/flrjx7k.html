<p>Children on the autism spectrum can also be nonverbal, however this is more rooted in language delay and not speech.</p>

<p>Adults on the spectrum too, and there is also a thing in autism where autistic people (kids or adults) can't speak under specific (usually stressful) circumstances. It's called selective mutism. My autistic gf has it. She is otherwise quite wellspoken but when she is overwhelmed the words can't find their way to her mouth anymore. She will usually still be able to type or use basic signing. If the overwhelm is real bad all means of communication stop working, but she'll still understand what you say. If it gets real, real bad (and I haven't seen this happen in the 6 years I know her), she'll also not understand what others are saying. But she told me she only experienced that a few times in her life and I'm glad it isn't more often because she says it is <em>terrifying</em> to feel that way. It is also always accompanied by a panic attack and a fight/flight reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, i'm an adult woman on the spectrum and i'm the same way. if i'm overstimulated, frustrated, or a particular kind of upset, i just completely lose the ability to speak. i can string words together in my head, and understand what i <em>want</em> to say, but i just cannot will my mouth into making speech sounds anymore. i usually retain the ability to type, unless i'm in a severe meltdown or panic attack, and i don't think i've ever lost basic gesturing, signing, or understanding, that i can recall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your verbiage. Mute suggest an inability to speak. &quot;This person cannot speak, they are mute.&quot; I dont understand the point of a word that suggests no sound being used for a person who's just not speaking while they have the ability to speak. Non verbal and partially non verbal are much better terms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you're saying but I think it's a bit disingenuous to say &quot;a person who's just not speaking while they have the ability to speak.&quot; In most of these disorders, the person might have the physical ability to speak but that does not mean they actually have the ability to speak. Take something like selective mutism-- the child might be a chatterbox at home but as soon as they are aware of their anxiety trigger, the anxiety makes them unable to speak, it makes them mute. In that moment, they <em>do</em> have an &quot;inability to speak.&quot; The reason I argue these semantics is because some people disregard the struggles of others with these issues as something they should just &quot;grow up and get over&quot; instead of with the care and scientific approach they deserve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we're on the same side. Whether it's temporary or permanent, an inability to speak should count as mute. You even said selective mutism. That perfectly describes what's going on. I just don't like the idea of people using the term mute on people who are just choosing not to speak. Like a person who has taken a vow of silence. They are not mute.</p>
<p>Edit. And non-verbal is a great way to describe someone who is capable of speech, but not willing to, or has a very difficult time with speaking.</p></div>		</li>
