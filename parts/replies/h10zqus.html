			<div class="markdown"><p>I have used something similar to explain it to my students before. And it makes total sense when they understand distance/time/velocity and all that. </p>
<p>But when you step back and think...having twins. And sending one twin into space and one stays on earth. When the twin in space comes back it will have aged differently than the one on earth. That just messes with your brain, and it is near impossible to accept that fact. like really, this kind of stuff makes perfect sense, but it also makes absolutely no sense at all.</p></div>		</li>
