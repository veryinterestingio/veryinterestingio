			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, it is important to note nuclear waste from most power plants CAN be recycled, they do it in France. However, the US has banned recycling the waste as a the recycling process turns the waste into plutonium, which could be used for weapons if it fell into the wrong hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To complement this, basically what France does is removing the plutonium and uranium from the waste, which are both reused as fuel in nuclear plants.</p>
<p>And this is the bulk of the spent fuel. What is left are fission products and minor actinides that are highly radioactive. They represent 4% of the waste: basically the whole waste of this kind that France generated since the beginning of the nuclear program would fit in a (Olympic) swimming pool. They are also dangerous for a shorter time: after roughly 300 years their radioactivity reaches levels where the impact on humans is too low to be isolated in health studies (but still 10 times the average natural radioactivity).</p>
<p>Edit: clarified what I meant by whole waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say &quot; the whole waste from France since the beginning of the nuclear program would fit in a (Olympic) swimming pool&quot;- but I think that's misleading- According to France's own inventory the total volume of waste from the nuclear power programme was 792000 cubic metres in 2010, or 320 times as much. At a guess the &quot;olympic swimming pool full&quot; that you mentioned is just the high level waste, not the &quot;whole waste&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maintenance won’t be a priority, maintenance should be 0. If the country it’s in, or even civilisation as a whole, collapses it should still be safe.</p>
<p>I know they’re building a long term storage in Finland. The waste will be put into concrete caskets, which will then be buried in the storage location 1km underground and then back filled. Once every storage spot is full you fill the whole thing up all the way to the surface and then never touch it again.</p>
<p>The tough bit is that if civilisation collapses and reforms, that the new civilisation doesn’t dig in that location. You can’t use language or symbols because they can change and lose meaning, so the best course of action might just be to make the area so uninteresting that there is absolutely no reason to dig down there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm fairly sure their spent nuclear fuel goes into copper cannisters, acting as the primary barrier. Then you have some secondary ones around, concete is one of them.</p>
<p>Concrete degrades slowly over time due to leaching and erosion. Copper is fully thermodynamically stable in anaerobic conditions that prevail at those depths, so in principle does not degrade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally.  Another concern I'll highlight here is that because of the long half-lives you mentioned, there is the very real concern of labeling the site in such a way that it's clear to anyone both now and in the future what and where it is.  There is no perfect solution to this.  Will signage stay legible for the next couple hundred years?  What languages will exist then?  Will our current symbols still make sense?  Imagine if the Egyptian pyramids were nuclear waste sites-- we'd have probably killed ourselves off in the 1800s or so because saying we were not terribly careful with our archeology back then is a gross understatement.  We seem to have a pattern of this behaviour, and I suspect we always will to at least some degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People barely care about warning signs today, I have no idea why people think the language barrier is the issue when the issue is that people will try to break in no matter what, if they don't know what's inside</p>
