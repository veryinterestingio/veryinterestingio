			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think simple temperature and Brownian motion is the biggest contributor to this. If wind was required the air indoors or in caves would become stratified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those play role on the small-scale, but not so much on the larger scale where organized systems of air currents tend to form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brownian motion is completely random. If gravity weren't present, it would mix gases, but gravity provides a constant bias force downwards, acting strongest on the heaviest molecules. The net result would be slower stratification, but it would still occur.</p>
<p>You also have to realize how prevalent &quot;wind&quot; is. Air in a cave with a wet side and a dry side will set up a circular current, for instance. A one-degree difference is more than enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't convection and the jet streams provide a more immediate effect on stratification? </p>
<p>The Coriolis force is a constant at any given coordinate and so its effect on the position of gasses in the air column should be stable.</p>
<p>Compare to something like thermal convection which is inconsistent and changing depending on other, intra-atmospheric phenomena like cloud cover and surface composition and which creates a thermal inversion at the tropopause. I don't know for sure but I'm guessing the separation of gasses is somehow affected by the thermal inversion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true, but the Coriolis effect and solar heating are the two primary sources for the energy that ultimately ends up fueling the jet stream.</p></div>		</li>
