I was terrified when I first started, and even more terrified when I first began working directly with CJD material, but after some time you become normalized to it and the protocols you need to follow to be safe with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like you explanation, but I will clarify a few points further that you mentioned:</p>
<p>when you say for &quot;normal CJD&quot;, FFI, and GSS is hereditary, &quot;normal&quot; CJD would actually be sporadic CJD, as it accounts for ~85-90% of all cases of CJD per year. As the name implies, its a sporadic misfolding of the normal prion protein. The genetic or familial CJD only accounts for ~10-15% of cases worldwide. The last type (acquired) accounts for &gt;1% of cases <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Disease-Fact-Sheet" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>The reason there are different types of prion disease is the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2017.00187/full" target="_blank">3D structure and biochemical properties of PrPSc</a>. For example, when run on a western blot, GSS, vCJD, and FFI have different banding patterns. Additionally, they will have different denaturing profiles and usually slightly different tertiary structure.</p>
<p>Yes, the disease is rare, and the lab requirements are strict, but the chances of death aren't as high as you might think (as long as you adhere to safety protocols).</p>
<p>Edit: cited some of my claims</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume not so much. It's a relatively new diagnosis as far as I can tell? I maybe read too much about it thinking I was dying about 2yrs ago. Sudden onset of insomnia, to the point I was awake for 5-6 days, with maybe a two hour nap. Still worked full time. Turns out kidney disease isn't so great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a random mutation that will causes this (hence the &quot;sporadic&quot; portion of the name). However, this mutation is so uncommon, I'm only aware of it ever been described in medical literature in <a href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/fatal-familial-insomnia/" target="_blank">~two dozen or so people</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SFI is also a prion disease, almost identical to fatal familial insomnia. But unlike FFI, SFI doesn't seem to have the same hereditary gene mutation, so why it happens is not well understood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because it's sFI is sporadic, which literally means it occurs randomly, whereas FFI is familial, which indicates genetic inheritance</p></div>		</li>
