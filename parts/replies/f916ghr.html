			<div class="markdown"><p>It can happen during long laparoscopic surgereries as well. This has been the main cause of subcutaneous emphysema that I've personally seen. And I'm not talking about just a bit. This goes from the forehead to the chest. The entire face and neck can be inflated, squishy, and crinkly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This trapped air will just sit there and not do any damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To clarify, this trapped air can actually cause quite a bit of discomfort and pain after surgery, which can be difficult to manage with pain medication. The good news is that early mobility and frequent ambulation can help the trapped air to be absorbed quicker and help with pain relief too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had gallbladder surgery early this year. It was my first surgery. After the anesthesia was wearing off, I only remember waking up screaming from a nightmare and then it settling in that I was in horrific pain. It was 'just gas'... they gave me more pain meds, and the only way that even helped me was because it made me tired/loopy.</p>
<p>A month or so after my surgery, my fiance said when I got back to my room I was just crying and complaining of the pain from the gas, but I really only remember bits and pieces. I was so doped up, but the bits I remember were definitely terrible.</p>
<p>Side note: I'm obese, and I was convinced that they just didn't get all of the gas out because my belly is big and they thought they got it all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm now almost 22 and I've had a pocket of air trapped in my hand since then. It's harmless unless I grab something wrong, in which case it can hurt pretty bad.</p>
