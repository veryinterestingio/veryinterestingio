			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get this baaaaad after lunch. Take lunch at 1pm, and I’m unable to keep myself awake by 2pm. Only thing I can think of that changed for me was 1) eating more fruit (I may have been hypoglycemic slightly), and keeping a fairly consistent sleep schedule. (Sleep within 30ish mins every day, wake up within 30ish min every day). </p>
<p>Hope this helps. I absolutely hated that sleepiness. It’s great if you’re able to nap, but if not, it’s miserable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sleep schedule thing is something that has become abundantly clear over the years. On the rare weekend that I stick to my 10:30-7:30 schedule, the following week goes so much smoother.</p>
<p>Usually what happens though is: stay up late Friday night binging Netflix, sleep in late on Saturday, stay up even later Sat night, sleep in even later Sunday morning, lay in bed staring at the ceiling from 10:30 to sometimes as late as 3 am Monday morning, then have an absolutely miserable Monday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Napping is considered humans natural state! </p>
<p>From various things I’ve read and documentaries that have blended in my head over time; up until the invention of the electric light and factory work schedule, most people would have a small-sleep, big-sleep pattern - usually either sleeping the early afternoon/hottest part of the day in warmer climate, or sleeping earlier and waking in the middle of the night and having a few productive hours in less equatorial regions, especially during the longer winter nights. </p>
<p>It’s no wonder most of us hit a wall in the middle of our (evolutionarily) new 8-10 hour blocks of forced productivity!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a moment when you are fighting hard against sleepiness, but, soon after, at least with me, that sleepiness goes away totally. For me its like after 24h awake, its the max sleepiness I have, then, 1h after that, no more. But, doing a long blink maybe will make me sleep right away for some minutes at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, that's because of adrenaline. At some point the body decides it must be awake for an important reason, and gives us a boost of adrenaline to get away from danger or whatever our monkey-brains think is happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That only lasts so long.</p>
<p>Back in college I pulled some double all-nighters, and that 2nd sleepness night is kinda fun in a way, cause it’s way easier than trying to stay up the 1st night, and gives you a feeling of invincibility of sorts.</p>
<p>But then one of time I said fuck it and stayed up for 3 days straight, and that’s where your body starts taking over and shutting you down lol.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when I finally laid down to go to sleep after 3 full days awake, it STILL took me around 20 minutes to fall asleep even though I was DEAD tired.</p>
<p>I envy people who can quickly fall asleep SOOOO much! Usually it takes me an hour or so and it’s gotten to the point now where I don’t even try to fall asleep until hours later if I feel like it’s gonna be a more difficult night to fall asleep. Insomnia fuckin sucks :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After 3 days, the walls started crawling, and I kept hallucinating my name being called. Ironically, it took me longer than it usually does to fall asleep after that. I'm normally out in 15 minutes, no problem. It took me a good half hour to get my brain unstuck, I guess?</p></div>		</li>
