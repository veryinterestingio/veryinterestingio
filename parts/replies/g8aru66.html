			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I the only guy who ate orange peels? It's just a bigger fucking kumquat, although not as bitter unfortunately.</p>
<p>For clarification, I mean eat an orange like you would an apple or a kiwi.</p>

<p>Corn is - believe it or not - a grass. Just like what’s in your front lawn. We just spent 12,000 breeding it until it was what we wanted</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that, while probably a bit unpalatable, both are totally edible.</p>
<p>You can eat oranges with their skin or you can use it candied.</p>
<p>Banana peel is the ingredient for some dishes in India AFAIK and it has something like 5 times the potassium of the fruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once froze a bushel of ripe bananas with the skin on. Peeling them became a chore, and I quickly found out that eating them with the skin wasn't all too bad. The ripened and frozen skins break down somewhat, so while still fibrous and grassy tasting,  they no longer had that awful dry sensation that a fresh banana peel gives.</p>
<p>And my BM's were glorious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also nutritious. Banana peel has lots of fibre and other goodly stuff. Some cultures also make delicious dishes from banana peel.
Nutritionally, Orange peel is great for skin (used externally) and flavor wise, it is quite popular in several dishes as garnishing or  cocktails and mocktails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, that's kind of a good point but at the same time milk, eggs, honey and a few others are &quot;foods that are made to be eaten.&quot; I mean, only a few foods are produced to be consumed and mostly by The producers offspring.</p>
<p>At the same time you have a good point. Domestic cows are a very successful species and they have a pretty good deal going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like cotton. Helps the seed to disperse and then gives it a nice medium that holds water well and decomposes to provide nutrients to the young seed root shoots. Which is also why cotton gets stinky so fast compared to fibers from hair (ie wool) or plants (ie hemp or flax linen) and laundry soap works much better on cotton when it is scented because it covers up the decomposing bacterial odors.</p></div>		</li>
