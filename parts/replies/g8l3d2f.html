</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it is important to understand that HIV doesn't kill you directly, it is AIDS that kills you. Secondary infections that result from HIV absolutely tanking the number of immune cells you have. This process can take years.</p>
<p>CoV-2 and COVID-19 can cause damage to multiple organ systems, sometimes fatally. But survivors don't have the same <strong>relative degree</strong> of damage that accumulates from HIV and AIDS.</p>
<p>This isn't to downplay to the damage from CoV-2, but HIV can destroy upwards of <strong>90%</strong> of your immune cells!! If CoV-2 infection lasted years and destroyed 90% of your cardiomyocytes or pulmonary cells, then you would see much higher levels of death down the road.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s kind of apples and oranges. I say kind of because both HIV and CoV-2 cause inflammation, but there are huge differences. </p>
<p>COV-2 triggers your immune system to go into overdrive. The hyperactive immune response ends up destroying cells and tissues in the lungs, which causes the shortness of breath symptoms people experience. This also explains why COVID patients on ventilators still have a high mortality: your pushing the oxygen into the lungs but there just is not enough healthy tissue to effectively conduct the gas exchange on a cellular level. </p>
<p>Advanced HIV disease destroys your immune system and opens the flood gates for all sorts of rare infections and cancers that a healthy immune system would routinely or easily clean up/eradicate. </p>
<p>We do know that people who live with HIV—even well controlled/virally suppressed HIV—experience elevated chronic inflammation, which causes damage to circulatory and nervous tissue. But this occurs over a long period of time and is exacerbated by the natural aging process. This is why people who live with HIV for decades are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, etc. However, HIV and aging is a relatively new area of research because it wasn’t until recently that a large enough number of HIV+ people were able to live into old age due to the development of increasingly effective drugs to manage/control the HIV.</p>
<p>Edit: i should note that everyone, regardless of HIV status, should work to mitigate inflammation with proper stress management, diet, exercise, and sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is jumping out of the pan into the fire. First, there's no way to control the AIDS response. Second, the current treatments of dexamethasone has a much better control over just he overstimulation of the immune response. Third, there are many parts of the immune response: antibodies, T cells, fever, inflammation, etc. The ones COVID-19 affects are not the same that HIV attacks. So if  COVID-19 is a bee on your arm about to sting you, then AIDS would be a hammer to your head in an attempt to kill the bee.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have led with the third point but I'm too lazy to edit.</p>
<p>I'm a scientist, but not that kind of scientist, so others with more knowledge may be able to add a better answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting note: The reason that bats can harbor a ton of the deadliest viruses without being dying is because they can modulate their immune response. To them, Ebola and Nipah are like common colds. </p>
<p>Right now, millions of dollars are being poured in to research bats to see if antivirals or mechanisms to combat viruses can be found.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It isn't really even the virus itself which seems to kill people, but the immune response</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really not a dismissal of the virus's danger. Lots of respiratory infections are only ever fatal because of the associated immune response, which varies widely from common cold through SARS. The difference between 5 people dying overnight and 10,000 people dying over months is ironically tied to how strong an immune response the pathogen provokes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the point was to dismiss the danger of it. Rather, it is arguing that since the damage is in large part caused by the immune response there is little risk of late effects after the acute infection and symtoms have cleared (since other corona viruses don't tend to cause latent infections). </p>
<p>That doesn't dismiss the possibility that the lung damage can be long-lasting or even permanent, but it does speak against the disease developing like HIV does. HIV is a rather special virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This entire thread seems to be running off the assumption that the primary damage is from the immune response...</p>
<p>Which seems inaccurate given that a significant amount of damage from covid19 is caused by the attack on your endothelial system. Which has lasting effects, patients continue to have symptoms months after their infection has ended. Which directly contrasts against your claim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh don't get me wrong. I'm not dismissing the dangers of the virus. It is part of the equation.</p>
<p>But to say it is literally the virus that kills is incorrect. It is a greater and complex system which kills, and it involves a lot of things. This isn't uncommon either. We got many diseases which don't kill directly, but cause conditions which can lead to fatal complications.  Staphylococcal infection being very common thing. A disease weakens you, but Staph. is the one that kills you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So are COVID down-players correct that SARS-CoV-2 doesn't kill, but rather it's the underlying diabetes or CVD that does?</p>
<p>Or is this more akin to shooting a person, but it wasn't the bullet that killed him, rather it was the blood loss and organ failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though the question was asking if SARS-CoV2 would kill late, just like HIV does.  Which would suggest that knock-on effects count too, in the context of the question, since HIV doesn't kill either (it creates an opportunity for other pathogens).</p>
<p>So it sounds like actually, COVID-19 <em>may</em> kill ten years down the road (according to the same definition that says HIV does) --- it just depends whether the damage done to you by your immune system leaves you more vulnerable to other conditions later in life.</p></div>		</li>
