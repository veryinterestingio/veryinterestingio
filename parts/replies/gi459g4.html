<p>that would require the game to be recompiled completely, which takes a lot of time to do</p>

<p>I don’t think build time would be a major factor. Builds rarely take longer than a couple hours with the compilers and processing power we have today, even for large and complex projects. Also, large and complex projects are typical modular anyway and can be built separately as needed (unless you’re updating a core library).</p></div>		</li>
