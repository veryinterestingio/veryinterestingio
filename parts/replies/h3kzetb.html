Was it just a probabilistic miracle or something that could be an inherent property or some fact of science that I might not know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your intuition on what is likely or not is causing issues. Since there are only 91 different 'stable' elements and about 10 to the power of 50 atoms that make up earth (1 with 50 zeros) the chances of NOT finding one of the 91 is so small as to be negligible. Technetium would be an exception if it wasn't part of a decay chain since it's most stable form only has a half life of 4 million years</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ok I gotcha. Well, it depends on what you mean by probability then. You're asking why, rather than how? Probabilities are low for a lot of events, but there's the idea that intelligent life such as us would most likely spring up where probabilities, regardless of how low, lined up in such a way so as to create the right environment for it. This won't happen (as far as we understand life) in the middle of a star, a black hole, in the middle of space, on planets with too high or too low gravity, on planets whose elements are too destructive, or even too orderly (think planets made most of carbon with high gravity, diamond planets, which are theorized to exist). Then for the places with the right mix of material, there can't be too many life-ending events, like being too close to an active galactic nucleus, or have too many asteroid impacts, etc. The reason we have what we do is because we are most likely to evolve in a place that has what ours has in it. There's a name for the theory that this falls under, and I finally found it! Had forgotten what it was</p>

<p>Say what now? Other way around. </p>
<p>Atoms are just hydrogen atoms stuck together, which they are preferenced to doing via the fundamental forces of nature. As long as they stay stuck together (stable elements), why wouldn't you expect to have all the ones that stick around?</p>
<p>Let me put in like this. If you gave a bunch of kids a lot of time and 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 individual 2x4 lego bricks, wouldn't you expect them to make at least a few of each of the sub-100 different possible stacks? Hell, you could probably remove the kids from this metaphor and get at least a few of each of the stacks just from dropping that many 2x4 lego bricks into the same place.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's very much still the most accurate model humanity has ever created. The Muon <em>g</em>–2 experiment showed it to be off (sigma 4.2; still waiting for 5-sigma) by a tiny fraction of a percent, which could imply new physics, but the model is still overwhelmingly successful.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't – that's a problem left to a theory of everything, when/if ever that comes about – but it doesn't have to to be useful here. The force of gravity compared to the other three forces is unfathomably weak at small scales. Except for cases like black holes and the Big Bang where a lot of matter is packed into an infinitesimal region of space, gravity is negligible at or below the scales mentioned above.</p></div>		</li>
