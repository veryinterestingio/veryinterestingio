			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to that: actual reality (where perfect anything doesn't exist) you'd mount your round-ish thing in a measuring lab and depending on required precision use a computerised 4-point probing cycle (tells you basic things like size down to a couple hundrets of a millimeter, and if you actually made an oval or not) to more thorough methods like running a micrometer along the circumference of the round-ish thing, noting down the deviation on polar coordinates, and then using integrals or something to calculate the area your silly not-round shape has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further, in actual reality, extremely high precision is not all that important for most engineering applications. If I know that I need something to remain above or below a certain limit, using π = 3 or π = 4 is probably close enough, depending on whether you need to round up or down.</p>
<p>This is why they teach significant figures in Science classes. If I establish my tool with the worst precision is only good to three &quot;significant figures&quot; (e.g., roughly the precision of using a yardstick or ruler, or anywhere I can say &quot;two and a quarter inches&quot;, or &quot;a cup and three-quarters&quot;), I can use 22/7 or 3.14 for π, which was more than sufficient precision for human-scale applications, such as bridges or aqueducts. Tooling like /u/romgab describes will give you closer to 9 significant figures, which is plenty good enough for millimeter-scale precision, and plenty of people have memorized π to 9 digits, but at this point, you're using digital tools and computers anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, my stuff is probably only truly existant in either ultra high performance unique application sets (like space stuff) or for statistically based quality assurance, where people pick out like 5 parts out of a couple thousand and if they aren't to extreme specs the entire batch is nuked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Abstract - a perfect circle of radius 2, say, has an area of exactly 4pi. That is an exact area, and a perfectly good number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Equally abstract example: A circle with radius 1/(π^0.5 ) has area 1. So if OP's idea of an &quot;exact number&quot; is a number that can be expressed finitely, then just set the radius to something obscure that divides well with pi.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you are allowed to know the exact radius, you could just as easily have a circle where you know the exact area. No calculations are needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair, I read the question to be &quot;given a radius, can you know an area&quot; - but in abstract land your can absolutely just start with a given area (in which case you also know the exact radius by basically the same thing as above).</p></div>		</li>
