			<div class="markdown"><p>After several adult decades of late eating due to my night jobs, I always thought not eating after 8 would be tough. In September I started on IF with a midnight cutoff but I found 4 pm to be too long a wait even I usually sleep 4am-12pm. Though I didn't crave breakfast in the past, now I did.</p>
<p>I changed that cutoff over time &amp; actually stop at 8pm now which allows me to eat close to wake up. It's actually not difficult. I tend to consume 1000 calories near the cutoff so I'm good to go for the rest of my night work.</p>
<p>Also I'm definitely in an age group where my body isn't trying as hard (or able) to generate new cells &amp; keep me youthful &amp; peppy anymore. It was definitely easier to burn those bad calories without feeling it 15 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When working late night jobs, it is super important to eat closer to your wake up time and avoid eating too close to bed. Here's some tips for how to calculate what times to eat when working weird shifts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always try to eat at the same time, even if your work times are unpredictable. Same with sleep. It can be tough, but you HAVE to try to wake up and eat at the exact same time each day, even on weekends! It is absolutely important to have a &quot;reset&quot; time that doesn't vary each day, otherwise your circadian rhythm will get out of whack, and so will your body's attempts at metabolizing energy from food.</li>
<li>Once you've disciplined yourself into waking up at the same time each day, it is VERY important to eat within half an hour to 45 mins after waking up. High quality protein foods are recommended. Avoid sugars and breads in the morning. Eggs are the best for beginners because they're chock full of brain vitamins.</li>
<li>Try to eat lunch within 6 hours after waking up. Don't wait too long! Feel free to have small snacks like nuts and jerky to help you last till lunch. Once you start eating right, you'll start feeling healthy, regular, ferocious bouts of hunger that remind you exactly when to eat. It takes about 2 weeks of self discipline to notice a difference, but eventually your body will start to have &quot;healthy&quot; feeling hunger pains that are way way different than the &quot;I keep skipping breakfast, and now I'm feeling nauseous from self induced diabetes&quot; feelings that a lot of us just chalk up to being old.</li>
<li>Don't eat any food at all about 2 hours before bed. In fact, your lunch should be your biggest meal. Snacking and dinner are allowed, but if you keep it light and cut your food off 2-3 hours before bed time- *even if you work late at night*! It is important to fast starting 2-3 hours before bed time, and not eat anything until 30-45 minutes after waking up from your 8 hours of sleep. That's almost half your day without food. Doesn't matter which part of the day you choose to fast, so long as your'e CONSISTENT with your waking/breakfast times *regardless* of overnight/late night shifts.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Small snacks before are okay once in a while, but should be saved as an occasional treat so long as you avoid things like chocolate bars, candies, sodas, and junk food. Cheese sticks, hummus, fruit, avocado, nuts- all of these are okay midnight snacks for when you're allowing yourself to be bad.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But eating 3 - 5 meals a day, means food never gets scarce, so fat continues to build/stay the same. Even if you cut calories with this method, you still are giving your body an easy energy source to pull from first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is fundamentally untrue if you are involved in a strenuous exercise regimen that necessitates a consistent intake of (healthy) energy, especially if that diet is high in protein and low in carbs and other sugars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm explaining it to a 5 year old.So I didn't want to go into all sorts of other details not directly tied to the answer for their question </p>
<p>Also, it's not &quot;fundamentally untrue&quot; if there are several different explanations. with the average American being overweight(60%ish), I would say they eat enough at each meal that their body doesn't have time to catch up.</p>
<p>You are correct though, working out and eating a healthy diet will help you lose/maintain weight.</p></div>		</li>
