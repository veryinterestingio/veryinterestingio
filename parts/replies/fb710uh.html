			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree- the question is assuming someone doesn’t take their HIV medication. The majority of people with HIV (in places where medication is available such as U.S.) take the medication, never get AIDS and never have a compromised immune system (some studies have shown it to be slightly more likely to be compromised than someone without HIV, but that’s a conversation for another day)</p>
<p>I just don’t want people to read the question and assume people with HIV automatically will get sick. Most don’t besides where medication is not readily available.  The question would be better worded beginning with “in those that don’t take medication...”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that was my fear too. I have a friend with HIV and he's said on multiple occasions that the stigma is way worse than the disease itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, I thought that this was more clear as a pure hypothetical thing about this, hope I didn't somehow offend anyone </p>
<p>I am aware of the advancements in medicine with HIV</p></div>		</li>
