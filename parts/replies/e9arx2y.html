			<div class="markdown"><p>But as your client devices are now MIMO compatible those other channels could be used to serve the clients. Every year people add more and more wireless devices, your neighbors add more, they start to add multiple wireless access points etc etc.</p>
<p>Like your neighbors new wifi garage door opener could be freaking out and not adhering to collision standards now you've lost a whole channel, the other neighbours kid utorrents constantly on another channel, your three mesh devices are now stuck on a single channel.</p>
<p>Then what you use 5ghz for backhaul, its crap getting through walls but use the 2.4ghz for backhaul and backhaul capacity is lower than the 5ghz your phone is connected to.</p>
<p>People see these mesh networks as some kind of silver bullet and their wifi will be rock solid, but I think it's just a temporary fix while yours and your neighbours wireless devices increase year on year. Just do the right thing and run CAT6A around your house for sweet 10G throughout your house! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of using one walkie talkie and switching channels to talk to both sides, it has two or more walkie talkies, and can chat on them all at once, on different channels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is pretty much a perfect analogy, and one that I often use. </p>
<p>Imagine you have some walkie-talkies and all of them are on channel 10. Alice is holding walkie-talkie one and she is the homebase where all the messages need to go back and forth from. We then have two other people out in the field, Bob and Steve who also have walkie talkies. </p>
<p>It Is important to understand that only one person can be talking on channel 10 at one time. So if Bob wants to get a message to Alice he waits until no one else is talking and then transmits his message. We call a system like this “half-duplex” because it only allows for one party to transmit at one time. </p>
<p>Let’s say Bob needs to be further away from Alice and the signal is now too weak and they can’t understand each other. What can we do?</p>
<p>Well so now they get another walkie talkie which is also on channel 10 and give it to Jim. Jim stands in between Alice and Bob and When Bob wants to say something to Alice, He talks and Jim hears it, then once Bob is done talking he repeats exactly what Bob said to Alice.</p>
<p>As you can see, every conversation between Bob and Alice will now take twice as long, because the original speaker has to talk and then Jim has to say it again. This is Jim in Repeater mode and this is exactly how WDS works. </p>
<p>What if you want to speed this up? What can we do? </p>
<p>Well let’s get one more walkie talkie and put it next to Jim’s walkie.  We are going to put this walkie on channel eleven and we will also move Bob to channel 11. </p>
<p>Then we setup the two walkie talkies in the middle so they automatically send anything they hear back and forth between the two channels. </p>
<p>Now when Bob talks, the transmission goes directly to Alice and does not have to be repeated. </p>
<p>This is a very simplified version of the principal of mesh networking. In reality adding a second AP is kind of like adding a second dispatch center (Alice) and creating a connection between the two dispatch centers on a separate channel and then allowing each dispatch to talk to their clients on their own channel. </p>
<p>TLDR: only one person can talk at one time, so more walkie talkies.</p></div>		</li>
