			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely this. I worked at a restaurant pre-corona that did exactly that. You could order any of their dressings on their website, but we made our dressings in-house and stored them in big cambros in the walk-in. The bottled kind was honestly pretty close in flavor but the stabilizers and whatever they put in there always made the consistency of the bottled ones odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also if one chef happens to make the dressing better than another chef simply because they’re in a good mood that day, etc. The dressing will be better, hahaha</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also EVOO...on <em>EVERYTHING</em>... Olive oil has a fresh grassy note that compliments almost every component in a meal. Also makes everything on your plate look prettier too. Taste is only one part of enjoying a meal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also depends on the original consistency of both the croutons and dressing. A thin dressing with light croutons will make them soggy very quickly, whereas a thick dressing and heavy duty crunchy croutons will sog out just the right amount with a few minutes of sitting in dressing and still be crunchy inside.</p></div>		</li>
