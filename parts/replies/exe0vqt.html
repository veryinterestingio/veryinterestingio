<p>Depends on the kind of cheese. Texture varies considerably across different cheese varieties. Not all become crumbly the longer they're aged. Also, for some cooking applications, younger, smoother cheese is preferred.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe <em>you</em> don't, but <em>I</em> love some crumbly feta cheese on <em>my</em> pizza. The sharp flavor mixes with the creamy mozzarella and makes the whole pizza much more interesting.</p></div>		</li>
