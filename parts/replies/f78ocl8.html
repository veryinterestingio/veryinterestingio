<p>I really like that model, if you have a few hours to sit there it shows the solar system to the scale of &quot;if the moon were 1 pixel&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's another reason why mostly of our communication worldwide runs on submarine optical cables instead of satellites. </p>
<p>Sending a signal up to the satellites and back to earth takes time. Much faster just to use optical cables connecting us around the globe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why we use optical fibers is because the total capacity available is much higher. A satellite carries about 1 gigabits per second, which is way below the capacity of a fiber. And that capacity is for the whole area the satellite covers, optical fibers operate independently of each other, while satellites share the same spectrum among themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not entirely true, light actually travel slower in fibre optics that not would in vacuum. The reason we don’t use satellites (yet) its because it’s not cost effective compared to fibre</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tack on, any alien life that might exist probably doesn't know we exist. They'd almost certainly be &gt;1,000 years away, and wouldn't see our modern signs of civilization, much less anything from &gt;1,000 years ago. This also applies to us and our search for extraterrestrial life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it that easy though? Cause as I understand, universe is expanding, so it might create a distortion at some point and it wouldn’t be less than 130M years ago cause of the expansion ? </p>
<p>Am I wrong ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that's right. But the difference at that diatance is very small. If the distance where exactly 130 Mly then the 'lookback time' is 129 Myr.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing can travel faster than light. No distortion can make light travel faster than it's maximum speed. A distortion can slow down the light, meaning we see something even older than it's light distance, but we will never see anything faster than it's light distance (at least not with our current understanding of physics).</p></div>		</li>

<p>That'd probably be one of the biggest scientific discoveries. So many possibilities as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I truly believe we will have a profound breakthrough sometime in the future with our physics. There are still thing we dont know like what dark matter is and what's inside of a black hole along with other things. How are things able to effect each other across the universe?  Spooky action at a distance as Einstein described it. People have always called others crazy for expressing ideas that go against what is proven, but I think it is ignorant to believe that we know everything about how physics work or the secrets of the universe.</p></div>		</li>
