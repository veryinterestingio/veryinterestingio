			<div class="markdown"><p>The radiation put off by nuclear decay consists of alpha, beta, and gamma. Gamma radiation is the only one I can think <em>might</em> be possible to use for energy, but it's not much. That's without somehow converting that gamma radiation into useable energy. Gamma rays are notorious for passing through matter without stopping. You need thick slabs of dense material, like lead, to stop them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reprocessing has been dismissed long ago as viable way to reduce nuclear waste. It's just cheaper and easier to make new fuel. And reprocessing creates its own waste stream. The other actinides have no real practical use and some are extremely dangerous as they are a heavy metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The half life of Uranium is on the order of a few billion. Nuclear reactors drastically speed up the reaction rate so that a significant fraction of that energy is released in just a few years. Using spent fuel as a power source would be extremely dangerous because it would require massive quantities of radioactive material in one place to generate any meaningful amount of power.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In particular the idea is to bypass the limitations of thermodynamic cycles and harness energy directly. Its all theoretical right now though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's called a nuclear battery. We use it to power the Mars rovers, and even some pacemakers. A type of them called a betavoltaic cell which is exactly what you are describing, an analog to the photovoltaic cell, commonly know as the solar panel. You're just swapping photons for beta particles hitting your semiconductor junction (the voltaic cell part). </p>
<p>A few problems. It doesn't make much energy per mass or time so takes large amounts for meaningful power, and is incredibly dangerous for a human to be near and a constant concern for contamination. A pacemaker takes almost no power to run so needs a tiny amount of radioactive material, in addition to being a critical scenario where some cancer risk can be traded off for the fact your heart would stop without it. We also have better chemical batteries now to replace them. The Mars rover is on Mars, away from any human or life form, and even then only makes a tiny amount of power. To run a power plant on a mass of radioactive material (that isn't undergoing a fission or fusion chain reaction) would be dangerous, ineffective, and uneconomical. It's really limited to only applications where you need a small amount of power for a really long time and don't see concerns with a radioactive material being there in that quantity.</p></div>		</li>
