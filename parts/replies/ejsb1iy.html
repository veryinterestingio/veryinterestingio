			<div class="markdown"><p>It is! I don't know much about it besides what you just said, but maybe someone else who knows more can weigh in on what sorts of research being able to make superfluids allows you to do or what sorts of phenomena it lets you examine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Helium-4 actually becomes superfluidic at around 2K, which is a relatively easy to achieve temperature (basically just requires pumping on liquid helium to reduce the pressure and make it evaporate).
Lower temperatures are probably needed for most everything else (Helium-3 which is a fermion rather than a boson like Helium-4, only becomes superfluidic at 0.0025K)</p>
<p>As with a lot of these low temp quantum effects, the purpose is mainly just to confirm theory and things like that, nothing that cold is going to be practical outside of research and I don't know of any use for superfluids anyway, they do cool shit though <a href="https://youtu.be/2Z6UJbwxBZI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/2Z6UJbwxBZI</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Superfluidity of helium-4 is around 2.2 Kelvin, which is kinda chilly for a walk in the park but relatively hot for cold temperature physics.</p>
<p>Dilution cryostat can routinely reach under 10 mK and stay like that for months.</p>
<p>On the flip side, superconductivity, which is basically the superfluidity of electrons (simplified), can happen up to 90 K at least in some materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to something called the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spins (fermions) are <em>anti-symmetric under the exchange of the wavefunction.</em> This means that if you had two identical, indistinguishable fermions and you wrote down the generic wavefunction of the system, it turns out that when you demand both fermions to be in the same quantum state, the wavefunction vanishes. The wavefunction represents the <em>probability</em> of finding said quantum system in a particular state, so if it vanishes (goes to 0), it means there is 0 chance of finding the system in such a state. In other words, it is physically impossible to find two fermions in the same quantum state. This is basically the Pauli exclusion principle that we learn in elementary chemistry.</p>
<p>On the other hand, particles with integer spins (bosons) are <em>symmetric under exchange of the wavefunction -</em> the wavefunction does not vanish when you demand two bosons to occupy the same quantum state. Thus it is possible for multiple bosons to occupy the same quantum state. In fact, as what the original comment was saying, if you cool a boson gas to low enough temperatures, the bosons will all occupy the same ground state and form a Bose-Einstein condensation.</p>
<p>It is this fundamental difference between fermions and bosons that dictate their unique behaviors.</p>
