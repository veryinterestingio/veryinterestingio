<p>And I'm not trying to argue whether you're right either, because I'm not an expert on this subject, but your explaination seems different from the other upvoted answers here. People seem to explain jitter as being the variation time between trips, not a ping average time.
If you're right and others are generally wrong, have you made a root comment to the post with the correct explaination? If not, I think you should. </p>
<p>But I certainly did not expect to get downvoted for thanking someone of making an actual explainlikeimFIVE explaination. People should generally be better at that imo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Jitter is actually a measure of the deviation, not an average of the RTT.</p></div>		</li>
