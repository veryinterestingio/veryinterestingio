			<div class="markdown"><p>Babies have not become more robust with time. Fact is that infant mortality used to be much higher than it is currently; I also suspect a lot of people suffered lifelong debilitating effects from the untreated hypoxia. Lack of oxygen at crucial times leads to traumatic brain injuries just as critical as the kind that result from babies being dropped on their head or impacted in motor vehicle accidents. There are probably an appreciable amount of serial killers that came to be in this way who, had they not been oxygen starved, would have not developed aberrant behaviors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was born and raised along the coast of Texas and currently I'm on vacation just outside Denver, CO. I've found myself needing to catch my breath for things that wouldn't affect me as such in Texas. So it led me to this question concerning newborns. While this doesn't entirely answer my question, it does give me a better idea of this whole... thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read ages ago that babies born in high altitude grow up at those heights with a thicker part of their hearts. I can't remember if that's a stronger muscle (heart gainz, bruh) or a thickening that implies less effective pumping. But altitude definitely changes the heart over time.</p>
<p>If you've been in Denver less than two weeks, altitude sickness is normal. Your body will adapt over time, and then you'll feel like a performance athlete when you get back to sea level. That's why Kenyan marathoners train in the mountains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didnâ€™t want to reply at the top level since I am not qualified to answer and just have anecdotes. </p>
<p>We live in Albuquerque, NM at the same elevation as Denver. When we were taking birthing classes they told us that at Altitude, always expect a worse APGAR score and often bluer babies but that generally babies do just fine. I suspect that there is some average increase in issues but not enough to worry about specifically from the parental side.</p></div>		</li>
