			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, the h is silent in a lot of words like &quot;when&quot; and &quot;where&quot;, but some people pronounce it as though it were spelt &quot;hwen&quot; and &quot;hwere&quot;. Well, they actually used to be spelt &quot;hwen&quot; and &quot;hwere&quot;. Evidently long ago it started a non latin letter, then  became &quot;hw&quot; then just &quot;wh&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your fun fact, those words have very old etymological origins going back to proto-Indo-European (PIE). We don’t have any actual writing in PIE, but based on all the languages that came from it (nearly all European languages), linguists can extrapolate what it probably sounded like. The PIE word for “what” was probably something like “kwod”. In Latin, this became “quid”, which then turned into “quoi” in French and “que” in Spanish. The languages descended from Latin generally kept the “k” sound. </p>
<p>On the other hand, in proto-Germanic, the “k” sound turned into a “h” sound. Old English kept it and it was “hw” for awhile before turning into “wh” and eventually dropping the “h” sound entirely. In German, they also dropped the “h” and it turned into “was”.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We use a lot of NATO phonetics, which would be Zulu, but sometimes being that's just a bit too cumbersome, so a lot of hams will use zed to make it clear which letter they're saying without having to go full Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.</p>

The three were French, Spanish and German, although I forget which parts came from what (I think French supplied the syntax) and the trench coat was Flemish, which is responsible for things like the K in 'knife'. </p>

<p>can you explain? I'm so confused by that. I'm familiar with the NATO phonetic alphabet where H=Hotel, I can't wrap my brain around how H becomes eagle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Someone from India&quot; was a caller to the helpdesk I was working at at the time. The five of us there at the time couldn't figure it out either, but he was very insistent that eagle was spelled with an H. </p>
<p>We ended up putting together an entire Evil Alphabet, with things like &quot;E as in Eye&quot;, &quot;K as in Knife&quot;, and so on...only to find out someone else had done it decades ago.</p>
