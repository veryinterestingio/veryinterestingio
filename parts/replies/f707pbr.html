<p>Isn't Pata Negra the only one that's fed on acorns? Jamon Iberico is more of a generical term for any ham that's Spanish</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, a deer will taste different depending on how fast it is killed. If you shoot it and it drops or dies in a few seconds, it will be good. If you shoot it and it’s able to sprint away for a while the muscles and meat will be tense and tougher when it’s cooked. </p>
<p>Source: I’ve hunted for years. Killed lots of deer and I eat most of the ones I kill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The adrenaline and other chemicals released when they are distressed are a major part of the off taste. It’s another reason hunters go for humane kills like heart, double lung, or head shots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, this is why some people claim that halal meat is tastier. Because the animal is supposedly less stressed than those who get killed in slaughterhouses and watch all of the other animals. </p>
<p>I personally don't taste the difference, I think halal meat tastes exactly identical to any other meat (I live in a neighborhood where most butchers are halal).</p>
<p>But the logic makes sense, stress and adrenaline tense up your muscles so of course that would make meat tougher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah to me it’s not the taste as much as it is texture of the meat. It’s usually tougher and almost kinda stringier when the animal has gone through extreme stress before death. As far as taste it’s almost more gamey I guess and not as sweet to me but there isn’t a huge difference there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had milk that I'm guessing was  from cows fed on that.  It tasted like candy corn...kind of a sickly sweet flavor with a hint of fake vanilla and Karo syrup. The only other reason I could think of was maybe the milk was given soon after calving...but I've never tasted cow colustrum, so.</p></div>		</li>
