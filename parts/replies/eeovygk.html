			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't describe the science behind it, no qualified, but my own research into sleep paralysis has taught me that during the process of falling asleep your brain switches off your motor control. Probably to avoid acting out your dreams.</p>
<p>A couple mysteries surrounding this are sleep paralysis, where motor control is shutoff while still conscious, and sleep walking. Some interesting things to look into. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there an explanation for why sometimes I will start dreaming before I'm even fully asleep? This usually only happens when I lie down completely exhausted.  </p>
<p>2nd question is, sometimes right as I'm falling asleep, any slight sound will cause me to see an explosion of light in my closed eyes, almost as if my auditory and visual senses are connected at that point of sleep. If it's later in the sleep cycle, I can sleep through nearly anything: I once slept through a tornado that passed about a half mile from where I slept. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For question one - these are called hypnagogic hallucinations. You see them more if you have narcolepsy or you are sleep deprived. Basically you cycle into rem extremely quickly. (I work in sleep medicine)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This happens to me all the time. I don't think I'm sleep deprived, and I don't think I'm narcoleptic. I also sometimes can't differentiate between a dream and real life. I'll have a scary dream and I'll wake up. I'll then spend 5-10 minutes convincing myself to remove my hands from my covers to lock my bedroom door. But the next day, I often have to confirm with my roommate that no one broke into our house, and no one was twisting my door knob in the middle of the night. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: 2nd question - I don't know for sure why it happens, but it happens to me too - good to know I'm not the only one! In my case, the flash of light sometimes comes as a result of a real sound, but just as often it's with (what I assume is) an auditory hallucination. For me it sounds like someone slamming their hand onto piano keys.</p>
<p>My guess is that the brain hears (or hallucinates) a sound and then makes up a visual component (flash of 'light') to go with it because it remembers that sounds normally have a visible source. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also happens to me! It’s more of a flash of bright kaleidoscopic or gridlike pattern (no colour) though. The pattern differs depending on the sound. I assumed it was some very low level synesthesia type thing </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it has worked if I set the alarm near a expected end of a 90 minutes cycle. With normal alarm I've needed to use loud alarms and a lot of backup alarms in case I don't wake up. With that app I can use something like whales singing as a alarm sound and still wake up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A Fitbit (an activity tracker) tracks your sleep along with other things such a steps, bpm, exercise, etc. I love to check how much sleep I have gotten every morning and the time spent in each stage. I’ve noticed I feel more refreshed when I had a lot of ‘deep sleep’ and remember my dreams more when I had a lot of REM. </p></div>		</li>
