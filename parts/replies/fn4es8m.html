			<div class="markdown"><p>In my hydro setup the weed can burn easily, it’s the uv light itself that I think the thc is protecting against. The sticky resin also is for grabbing pollen off the wind, I believe. My tomato plants can handle a hotter tent than my weed, but they can’t get as close to a blurple LED (cold but lots of uv) without the leaves burning.</p></div>		</li>
