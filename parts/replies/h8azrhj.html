			<div class="markdown"><p>What you described is actually a different phenomenon called &quot;original antigenic sin&quot;, which occurs when antibodies produced against the original strain of pathogen bind a strain with modified antigens, but weakly, such that they are relatively ineffective at inhibiting reproduction, but they <em>are</em> effective at inhibiting naive B cells from being exposed to the antigens and producing better antibodies. In this case, the antibodies are not actively helping the pathogen reproduce, but they are inhibiting a better immune response from being generated.</p>
<p>Antibody-dependent enhancement happens when, similarly, weak antibodies are produced. But in this case, the mechanism by which it facilitates disease is different. Rather than merely inhibiting the production of more effective antibodies, in the case of antibody-dependent enhancement, the antibodies actively facilitate disease. This is generally because the antibody-pathogen complex has an easier time entering or otherwise interacting with host cells as part of its reproductive cycle. In this way, it's not just that the natural immune response is degraded, but that the antibodies are actually actively facilitating the spread of the pathogen.</p>
<p>This recent paper provides an overview of viral antibody dependent enhancement, specifically in the SARS-COV-2 context, which is what I presume spurred this question as it has many other questions over the last year and a half or so.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly, the case for dengue is that it uses immune cells as host cells. So the the other end of the antibody, called the Fc region, has a receptor on immune cells to help them 'grab' an antibody- bound pathogen. Except in this case, these 'weak' antibodies that don't inactivate the virus are actually facilitating it's infection of cells. This is why there are unique issues in generating a dengue vaccine versus many other viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where the differences in strains and variants come in. DENV has 4 strains or different serotypes which has much larger genomic and phenotypic differences in them compared to variants which has certain genomic differences. For SARS CoV-2, we have had only variants till now - that is why WHO also calls it variants of concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty scary stuff. I'm a veterinarian and had never heard of antibody-dependent enhancement. Maybe I slept through that lecture in vet school.  So of course I immediately searched the literature for any diseases in dogs and cats that could have this type of enhancement. I found as journal article describing it in F.I.P., a disease that is always fatal in cats. (Well, maybe not for long. There are a couple of experimental drugs out of China that are being bought on the black market and might actually show some promise.) The scary part is that F.I.P. is caused by a feline coronavirus. Yes, it's a rare mutation of this normally innocuous virus. But if one coronavirus can do it.... Ugh! I don't even want to think about it.</p></div>		</li>

Basically the initial infection with the feline coronavirus causes next to no symptoms. When a new infection occurs with a slightly different strain it sometimes (10% chance) infects the cats' white bloodcells causing the condition FIPV, which is always fatal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADE is very unusual, but extremely well known among virologists and immunologists. It's one of the first thing they look for in antibody responses. There was some evidence for ADE in <em>very specific</em> conditions with MERS coronavirus, and vaccine developers identified a way to overcome it in their MERS vaccine. Since MERS CoV is extremely closely related to SARS-CoV-2, the same approach has been taken to many of the COVID vaccines, but it turns out to have been unnecessary -- in spite of scientists watching very carefully for it, there's been no evidence of ADE ever occurring with SARS-CoV-2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading the paper /u/Coomb linked, I have 2 questions. </p>
<p>What about dengue specifically makes it so likely to cause ADE? It sounds like a huge factor is having 4 strains which are alike enough and different enough to fit into some sort of anti-goldilocks zone for the human immune system, but is there something special about the envelope (etc) on a molecular level that causes antibodies to form the right kind of weak affinity for other strains that isn't present in other common human viruses with multiple strains?</p>
<p>The other is whether or not we would know if low levels of ADE were present in a given disease if they had some influence the course of a disease without having a large enough effect to cause two markedly different presentations like with dengue. From what I can tell, all the examples of ADE listed in the paper were found either because of a very strong ADE effect, the virus being closely related to other viruses that were known to cause ADE, the virus being heavily researched (as in the case of HIV and SARS-CoV) or a mixture of these factors. Could ADE actually be a fairly common part of viruses evading immune response?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In view of the clarification by /u/Coomb in another thread that what was described in the first response is better called &quot;original antigenic sin&quot; than ADE: do you know if the same thing that's true of COVID with regard to ADE is also true with regard to antigenic sin? I.e. that there were worries about COVID demonstrating original antigenic sin, but it hasn't up to this point?</p>
<p>(Sorry if I used any terminology wrong!)</p></div>		</li>
