			<div class="markdown"><p>Isnt the center of mass always in the nucleus on the sheer basis that electrons have so little mass they barely have any influence?</p>
<p>Most planet/moon orbits are centered inside the planet even ours and we have a fairly large moon relative to our planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But, it is known that the larger orbital body wobbles. The sun moves significantly around the baricenter of the system, for eg. So, yes, minimal, and from what others are saying, you can usually approximate it as such, but perhaps there are times where the quantum &quot;wobble&quot; matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t have my textbooks to do the math, but remember that the center of mass cares about the mass of the particle times the distance of the particle from the center of mass. The CoM will no doubt be close to the nucleus, but the electrons are very far away compared to the diameter of the nucleus, meaning the nucleons will have high mass <em> low distance, and the electrons will have low mass </em> high distance.</p>
<p>Now imagine an atom in free space with only full orbitals, the electrons are all paired and (in general if not in every instance) they offset each other in CoM calculations. If you apply and external electric field, the atom is neutral so there’s no net force on the CoM isn’t going to move, but the nucleus will be pulled one way and the electrons are pulled the opposite way. That could pull the nucleus away from the CoM (depending on the radius of the nucleus and the ionization energy).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. We physicists usually take the &quot;center of mass&quot; as the true center of a system. The center of mass is, in principle, the &quot;average&quot; of all mass points of a system.</p>
<p>In a system like an atom, it's usually good enough to approximate equality between the center of the core and the center of mass.</p>
<p>As a result, the sun's center also isn't quite at the center of mass of our solar system - this is what you use in one of the methods to find Extrasolar planets, by the way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right that's what I assumed but isn't the nucleus considerably most of the mass? In average what percentage of an atom does the nucleus make? Is it less than 95%?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the ratio is very close to 100% but you still get effects which are comparable to movement of the core around the center of mass.</p>
<p>Hence, for example, the need for the Rydberg constant (where you either simply set the core's mass to infinity or take the simplest of all atoms, hydrogen)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the analogy, but how does that apply to electrons in practical terms? Since their location is probablistic, what can lead us to assume an uneven distribution about the nucleus? Would the value of this come in examining electron particle interactions, where the incoming particle would be coming from a known source and direction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are small center of mass corrections that you apply to calculations if you want them to be very precise, due to the fact that the center of mass is not exactly at the same position as the nucleus.</p></div>		</li>
