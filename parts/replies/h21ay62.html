			<div class="markdown"><p>Neuromuscular connections also play a big role here. If you've been training consistently, your body adapts not only the muscle itself but also increases the efficiency of the motor neuron signaling that activates the muscles.</p>
<p>Lifting heavier and building peak strength involves recruiting the maximum number of muscle fibers in conjunction to provide the power when needed. People who haven't worked out are quite inefficient at this because routine daily activity doesn't require activating most/all of your muscle fibers at once. Lifting does, especially as you increase resistance.</p>
<p>These neuromuscular connections can fade but do so very slowly. Your body remembers how to activate all these muscle fibers when you start working out again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I had gotten so weak during covid that a 135 deadlift felt &quot;hard&quot;. This was a wakeup call, because 135 should be a joke.</p>
<p>4 days later I repped out 265 without much struggle, <em>4 days</em>.</p>
<p>It took me weeks as a beginner to even lift 200 one time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Was benching 110lbs plus bar before Covid.  Gym was shut periodically for a year.  Went back the first time, and 90 plus bar was heavy as shit.  Within a week I was back at 110 plus bar.  The second time it took 3 days to get back to 110 plus bar.  The human body is amazing.  Keep
Pushing !</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I'm coming back to this soon, getting vaccinated in a couple of months probably, then my gf will let me go to the gym again.</p>
<p>I'm pretty gifted when it comes to strength gains, but I have been treating myself like shit for a year and a half. Will be interesting to see how quickly I can progress now. (It was already rocket speed to 500lbs deadlift before, will be really cool to see how fast it'll be now)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also quite important but not for the direct question being asked here. Blood supply is most relevant for endurance (used here meaning more than a few reps). High intensity weightlifting largely relies on anaerobic energy generation driven by glycogen stored locally within the muscles.</p>
<p>Better blood supply allows more rapid resupply of nutrients (i.e. less rest needed between sets, pump sets in after more reps at same load, etc.). It doesn’t directly correlate to rapid recovery of strength after a break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no universal baseline. Everyone will be different based on their daily activity levels. A guy who digs ditches will maintain more muscle mass than a guy who is in an inactivity study for NASA. </p>
<p>Muscle atrophy begins around 3 weeks after you cease exercising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer.  This exact thing happened to me.  I took most of covid off from the gym and lost some gains, but it came back so fast - I was shocked.  I figured it was me just being a stud, eating right and supplements - nope, but still nice to be back close to where I was before.  I certainly wish all gains were that fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has given me false expectations in the past when I've managed to get off my ass and put the work in. You feel so strong so fast, doing in 2 weeks what it feels like you used to spend a year doing. </p>
<p>Then it gets tough, and you don't get the reinforcement of looking/feeling as good for the amount of work you're putting in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be careful going back too fast though. Your connective tissue will take longer to regain its strength and capacity for work than your muscles will. It's really easy to injure something new coming back too quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn this is motivating. I too had to stop going to the gym because of covid. Now I'm all vaxxed and would be going back except I moved to a new house 30 minutes one way to the nearest gym, and I just don't have 2+ hours of extra time to dedicate to the gym on any given day.</p>
<p>I have some crappy weights I made when covid started because weights are expensive, but I haven't used them much because I like the gym better and I thought I would have to start from scratch again.</p>
<p>I might just bust them out and maybe slowly buy some better ones if I get to see explosive growth back to where I was before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I built a home gym during the pandemic. It was expensive and exhausting but totally worth it. You had to stalk companies to see when things would be in stock. </p>
<p>I'm still on a lot of their lists and stock is starting to normalize. I'm even seeing some of them putting stuff on sale. </p>
<p>I also predict a lot of people will start selling stuff the bought when they go back to the gym. Lots of great places to get inspiration for building an amazing home gym.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you considered investing in some kettlebells? The $200 I spent on a set of 24 kg kettlebells has lasted me months and my joints don’t ache like they did when I was going to the gym. I’m not as big, but feel just as good if not better. </p>
<p>Also just a me thing, but I still go to a gym every once in a while to test things out and I haven’t lost any max strength.</p></div>		</li>
