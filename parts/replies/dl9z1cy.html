			<div class="markdown"><p>So true. Many of the Chefs I've known continually add more salt to their dishes. I believe restaurant food often tastes so good to us simply because it has more salt than we would ever dare use when cooking at home. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt and sugar yes; sugar is an important cheat ingredient also. But those two probably account for much of the difference in taste between a frozen supermarket tikka masala (or one you cook at home) and one from your favourite curry house. Of course many people do not use optimal cooking techniques which can have a fairly high knock on effect on the taste of the food as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the example I was just going to comment on. I've always liked watermelon. But just recently I've added a bit of kosher salt before I eat it. It adds a whole new dimension of flavor! Absolutely delicious.</p>
<p>Same with fresh sliced cucumber, tomato, zucchini, etc. A small pinch of kosher salt really brings out the flavor. I understand it's a bit strange to some, but I wouldn't want to go back to not using salt in this way.</p></div>		</li>
