<p>With that you use it for forging and smelting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We made a small aluminium foundry with coals a computer fan and refractive bricks. Reached 700*C at least because we melted aluminium. Judging on the tin can color we probably reached between 1000-1200°C.</p>
<p>With proper ventilation (stronger fan), better isolation and a ceramic crucible, we could theoretically melt steel too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting and counter-intuitive, and also that's a very hot wood fire! From memory I think 500C is pushing the limits of what you can get out of wood without forced air. </p>
<p>In theory the charcoal can yield a higher temperature, so you must be hitting a bottleneck somewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As u/awesomefacepalm said, maybe you're not getting enough oxygen in-flow, but that seems off: I'd guess you'd get roughly the same temperature if that was the limiting factor.</p>
</li>
<li>Is it just an amount of fuel thing? You can get more heat out of a given weight of charcoal than of wood, but charcoal is much lighter. so the same weight takes up a lot more space. Perhaps you just use more oak, or build your fire differently with wood.</li>
