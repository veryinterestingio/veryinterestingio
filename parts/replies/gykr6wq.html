			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, from 1939?!     Thank you for the paper. I'll read through.</p>
<p>I always wonder about biomimicry applications. It's fun to think if it would be at all possible to create a flexible protein fabric, then spray with something similar to the ortho-dihydroxyphenol. You could essentially have an environmentally friendly outcome similar to fiberglass/epoxy. Obviously those materials and chemicals aren't exactly available at home depot! But interesting to consider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's questionable how environmentally friendly it would be. </p>
<p>Natural != environmentally friendly, especially not when you take a specific reaction in a specific species and scale it up into an industrial process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>True, but as I responded to another, mimicking natural processes, which are often done at room temperature with non-hazardous materials, can often mean the end product could have less embodied energy, less negative environmental impact, and can be recycled/composted more easily because it does not have large molecular/polymer chains such as petroleum products (as an example).</p>

<p>I learned a bit today. Very cool.</p></div>		</li>
