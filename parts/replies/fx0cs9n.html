<p>To answer the question its all about the cables bandwidth being higher. Hdmi 2.0 only supports 4k at 60hz, while display port 1.4 supports 4k at 120hz and 8k at 60hz.</p>
<p>Many higher resolution monitors will allow you to connect with hdmi, but as a result they will not be able to meet both their max refresh and resolution at the same time. </p>
<p>A 1440p 21:9 ultrawide is a 5Mp (megapixel) display, close enough to 4Ks 8Mp that it benefits from the extra bandwidth of display port.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In practice, most 4K monitors will only run at 30hz when plugged in via HDMI vs 60hz or above using DisplayPort/USB-C. Even when paired with recent, powerful graphics cards.</p>
<p>Source: just fixed a heap of ‘my computer is slow’ issues by changing the cables at work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but often this is due to monitors not fully supporting the hdmi 2.0 spec. What you mention was true for the mast majority of hdmi1.4 monitors. Also due to some monitors supporting a wide color space for profesional design work, and require more bandwidth to support this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the high end monitors offer dual hdmi or if they're very bleeding edge, dual dp input. I believe the 1st gen 5k used double inputs.</p></div>		</li>
