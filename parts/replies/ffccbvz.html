			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all of us. I could not fall asleep 12 hours after waking up. It never worked. I would be awake until 18 hours after waking, just in time to work another 6.  Then youâ€™ve been up 24, you crash straight 8 or all 12 if they let you, until time to wake up and repeat. </p>
<p>Of course drills and field days interfered. It was not uncommon to end up awake for 42 hour stretches.  Wake, work, 12 off, work, 6 hours of drills, and a 6 hour cleanup, followed by 6 hours of work again.   Happened often.</p></div>		</li>

This was roughly 2015-2016 if I remember correctly.</p></div>		</li>
