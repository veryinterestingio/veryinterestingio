			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you get  a beef tapeworm? Eating undercooked contaminated meat. Their life cycle requires both humans and pigs/cows to survive because livestock get them from infected waste, migrates to their muscles, we eat the muscle, it attaches in our intestine where it will eventually begin releasing eggs to start the cycle over again. </p>
