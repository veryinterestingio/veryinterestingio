			<div class="markdown"><p>Fungi also include yeast. Similarly to mushrooms, some yeast are good and tasty (brewer's yeast and baker's yeast give us beer and bread) and others are very much not (e.g. yeast infections).</p>
<p>Fun fact about fungi: we share a more recent common ancestor with all fungi than we do with plants. This means that we are more closely related to a mushroom than to a tulip (for example), but also that a mushroom is more closely related to us than to that tulip as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So simply put, is a Mushroom to a Fungus as, say, an Apple (fruit) is to a Tree?</p>
<p>I understand that Fungus are a separate branch of life from plants and animals. But what makes them separate? How exactly are they different? It seems like mushrooms grow very similarly to plants, so why aren't they plants?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just 'cause something is shaped like a plant and is slow like a plant doesn't mean it's a plant! Corals are sendentary and very plant-lile, but they're animals.</p>
<p>Most of the differences are in very basic cell function stuff that you can't easily see, since they split from plants (and then animals) really early in life's history, when basic internal structure was still being &quot;figured out&quot;, so to speak:</p>
<p>• Fungi don't have chloroplasts that photosynthesize, they get their energy and nutrients from digesting other things, like animals do.</p>
<p>• Fungi have cell walls made rigid with chitin, rather than cellulose as in plants. </p>
<p>• Their cells usually have half of a full set of DNA - in plants <em>and</em> animals, each cell has a full set and only eggs/sperm have half sets. </p>
<p>• Fungi grow a unique type of structure called <em>hyphae</em>, which are long, thin, and thread-like. These <em>hyphae</em> have multiple nuclei and grow very long, whereas algae and other plants grow by repeated division of cells that each stay a stable size. This is how molds/mushrooms can pop up incredibly fast when the conditions are right.</p>
<p>• Fungi lack any efficient way to transport water and nutrients, unlike plants' xylem and phloem.</p>
<p>• They produce a lot of similar (or identical) molecules as plants, as part of their daily metabolism, but the steps they take to make these are usually different from plants, suggesting separate origins and convergent evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s almost right. There isn’t really a perfect analogy if I remember correctly, since fungi are asexual, so they kind of just squirt out babies without needing pollination or sex. </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>Apparently I didn’t remember correctly. This part is incorrect. Read u/silvanuyx‘s comment below for more info</em></p>
<p>The mushroom is the part of the fungus that sticks out of the ground to let the mushroom babies fly off into the distance to land somewhere else. </p>
<p>Fungi are actually more closely related to animals than plants! You know how sea sponges are animals that just kind of sit there, and sort of seem like plants? Fungi are similar. They sit there and eat other creatures, while plants use sunlight to make their own food. </p>
<p>There are a ton of other differences that make them separate from animals and plants, like how fungi have cell walls, unlike animals (so they’re less flexible) and their cell walls are made of chitin, unlike plants, who have cellulose. </p>
<p>One thing to remember though, is that all of these categories are arbitrary. Humans just came along and decided “hey, these creatures are different in these specific ways, so we’re going to put them in different categories”. </p>
<p>These categories are justified because all fungi are all more closely related to each other than to animals, and vice versa, but we could just as well have decided to put animals AND fungi in one bigger category called “eaters” or something, and just said that they’re separate subsections of the same kingdom, in the same way that mollusks and mammals are considered different subsections of animals. </p>
<p>So, in summary, there are differences between fungi, animals, and plants, but kingdoms are just categories invented by humans, so don’t take them as a fundamental law or anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fungi can reproduce asexually, but many of them also have sexual reproduction as well. Mushrooms are the sexual fruiting bodies of certain fungi. Sexual recombination happens in the gills of the mushrooms, and the spores are released from there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plants make their own food through photosynthesis. Fungi “eat” dead, decomposing plants and/or animals.</p></div>		</li>
