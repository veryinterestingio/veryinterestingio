			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the windows were irreplaceable, they, like the ISS as a whole, have a design lifespan. If you want to keep the station operational for more than a few decades, at some point you'll have to start retiring modules and/or replacing them with new ones. The Cupola module as a whole could be closed or replaced if there was a good enough reason. After all, it was one of the last components to be installed to the station which had already had a permanent crew for ten years at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The link you included says the windows are designed to be replaceable. There are pressure covers that can seal them off so window pane can be replaced from inside.  This was done at least once in 2017.</p></div>		</li>
