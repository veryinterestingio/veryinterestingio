			<div class="markdown"><p>We chose the asteroid because it is a primitive and carbon-rich asteroid that can offer insight into our solar system's origins and other science questions... but it also needed to meet other criteria. For instance, it had to be a certain size and can't be rotating too fast. These are important for sampling. It also needed to be close enough to Earth, making it easier to get to and to get a sample back from. - Mike D.</p></div>		</li>
