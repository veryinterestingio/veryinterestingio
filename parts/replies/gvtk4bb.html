			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! very nice summary you got there! I got a question about the link between parasitic infections and IgE antibody. Since most of the IgE we have is bound to mast cells, how do they respond to parasites in mucosal tissues where thereâ€™s usually an epithelial barrier? Does the parasite need to break the barrier to come in contact with parasitic defenses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure. I think for some single cell parasites like Giardia or Isospora there are IgA antibodies. </p>
<p>For others, like helminths I guess it probably depends. Acantocephala is a genus (or family or both) of nematodes that have like serrated teeth on their heads, that cause a lot damage on the epitelium and the tissue behind, and there is some bleeding for example, meanwhile, the trematode <em>Dicrocelium dendriticum</em>, or some tapeworms like Dyphilobotrium latum who have &quot;suction cups&quot; that shouldn't really cause damage to the epithelium, some swelling can be found, but not much else. (if memory serves correctly)</p>
<p>Also, in several cases, the worm may travel through the body and then come back to the digestive tract (or respiratory or wherever). It is the case of Ascaris suum for example.  So it may cause some damage when entering perhaps, I'm not too sure about that. (life cycle of ascaris suum, showing it's migration through the body) <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Celia-Holland/publication/47383730/figure/fig1/AS:341507597979648@1458433164206/A-schematic-representation-of-the-life-cycle-of-A-suum-in-the-pig-illustration-by.png" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Celia-Holland/publication/47383730/figure/fig1/AS:341507597979648@1458433164206/A-schematic-representation-of-the-life-cycle-of-A-suum-in-the-pig-illustration-by.png" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Celia-Holland/publication/47383730/figure/fig1/AS:341507597979648@1458433164206/A-schematic-representation-of-the-life-cycle-of-A-suum-in-the-pig-illustration-by.png</a></a></p></div>		</li>
