			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course it's been practiced; I wasn't born knowing how to spell modern English words, clearly. I was merely giving it as an example of something that I would have expected to take place at the conscious level that, in my case at least, not only observably (to me, if not to anyone else) happens below it, but usually happens way better that way.</p></div>		</li>

The theory behind the appendix is that it stores good bacteria for the digestive system. Maybe it’s useless but probably contributed to our evolution at some point over the millions of years or why would it have been passed on</p></div>		</li>
