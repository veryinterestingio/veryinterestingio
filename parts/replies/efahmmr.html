			<div class="markdown"><p>So, how exactly those download managers with download resume support work? They obviously create a temp file containing the info of how much you already downloaded, so they just ask for the server the file as normal and try to complete what has already been downloaded? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could you 'Force start' to download in order. I'm not sure, if that guarantees the order, but it downloads sequentially. Helpful for streaming while downloading.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I‚Äôm wrong. Still, I don‚Äôt think Steam uses strictly ordered downloading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good way to visualize this if you've ever played a 3DS is to imagine the torrent you're downloading is one of those puzzle swap pictures.  If you encounter people who have a piece that you don't you can request that piece</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, you don't need a temp file or local storage if you're going from start to finish.</p>
<p>You can tell how much you've downloaded, because that's how big the file is (as long as you don't pre-allocate, which you obviously shouldn't if you want to use this method).</p>
<p>You have to download the headers, find out how big the file is, and if the file you have is smaller than it should be, start at what you have, then continue from there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In one case you have the instructions and decide to get the pieces from different places, it can sometimes take longer but if you get interrupted you still have the instructions and can continue building from where you left off.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little different. </p>
<p>Real example, I decided to try building a LEGO model from online instructions without having the proper kit.  Somehow over 5 Classic kits, I don't have any 3x2 full bricks.  A different instruction, I just had to make it in blue instead of purple and a little bit of creative working around the lack of 1x1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is the order. The analogy above sort of implies that if you were to build the lego model several times, you'd follow the same sequence to build it each time.</p>
<p>With a torrent, the order that fragments of the file are grabbed would not be the same time after time. I think that's what /u/kelekona is trying to say. </p></div>		</li>
