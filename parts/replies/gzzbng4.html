			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a fun fact:  those chemicals responsible for the heat in Wasabi are created by a biological reaction when the root or w/e is mechanically disturbed such as bitten or chopped.  It's also transient and unstable and is why Wasabi will lose its heat.  Also probably why a lot of &quot;wasabi&quot; is just horseradish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, genuine wasabi is apparently very difficult to grow, and so much is consumed in Japan that they can't really meet any kind of export demand. I've had some stuff that was grown in Oregon, pretty decent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is fine. But it is really strange how we allow companies to sell &quot;Wasabi&quot; that contain no actual Wasabi.</p>
<p>It is just weird how we all accept that packaging can clearly say &quot;Wasabi&quot; and the only ingredients are horseradish and food dye.  Or that I can ask for &quot;Wasabi&quot; and a restaurant can give me something completely different no problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, the allyl isothiocyanate is the same in both plants, it doesn't make sense that wasabi would lose potency faster than horseradish. It might lose other flavours though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I also notice the difference in heat quality.</p>
<p>With wasabi and dijon mustard for example, I interpret it more as a sensation of &quot;pain&quot; than &quot;heat&quot;, and too much gets up in my nose. </p>
<p>It's like the hot peppers affect my mouth surfaces, but the others affect the whole volume of my mouth (or nose if I breathe it in).</p></div>		</li>
