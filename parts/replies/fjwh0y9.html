			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll over simplify. Instead of doing a big printing press, let's print on a printer at home (or use your office's laser printer) Let's just make a 4 page &quot;signature&quot;... Say you were printing a book by printing on a normal letter size piece of paper, That's a bit big for a book, so what you do is you set up the text and the printer to print 2 pages on each side of the paper. This makes the printing go quicker and doesn't waste paper. So you lay out the pages so that when you fold each sheet in half and sew (or since we're going DIY, maybe we staple them into the book). But that means we're always going to have a number of pages divisible by 4. If you need to make a book that is 61 pages, you need to have 64 total because the last signature only has one printed page and 3 blank pages.</p>
<p>Higher production printing will actually be even more complex and have 8 or 16 page signatures where they cut and fold so you end up with 2 or 4 folded sheets within eachother, and each folded sheet has 4 pages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I.e. The machinery takes one large sheet that fits a clump of papers on it and poops out a single clump, a single book is made of lots of clumps, so if the total pages of a book doesn‚Äôt cleanly divide into the total pages per clump, you get a few empty pages in the last clump.</p>
<p>I.e.  there‚Äôs no reason behind it, it‚Äôs a result of the bookmaking process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine several pages being printed in a big grid on a giant sheet of paper‚Äîyou‚Äôd then have a series of 8-16 pages laid out so that that giant sheet could just be folded strategically, and then have its edges trimmed, to form a part of a book.</p>
<p>Then each of those parts is sown/glued together to form a book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They print 8 pages on a big sheet of paper then cut them down to book size. If the number of pages of text isn't a multiple of 8,you get a few blank pages. It's easier to just leave them there than to remove them. </p>
<p>If it was all done by hand, they'd leave them out but it's done by machine so you'd need extra bits of machine to remove those specific few pages.</p></div>		</li>
