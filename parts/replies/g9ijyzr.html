			<div class="markdown"><p>What is happening is the salt is soaking up the moisture in the steak and bleeding into it, salt specifically is very good at deawing out moisture of veg and meat. Would recommend some salt flakes to season with after cooking and once rested, this will help draw out the natural flavour of the meat and also give you some contrasting flavour.</p>
<p>Garlic salt where you mince/zest garlic cloves and combine it with salt then leave in a oven at a really low temp to dry back out then blitz ut up in a food processor  is one hell of a way to get some good meat seasoning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically it's closer to brining (called a dry brine, since I don't add extra water).  Marinades generally have an acid like wine, vinegar, or citrus juice, along with flavor components from herbs and/or spices.  The acid helps tenderize the meat, the herbs and spices add additional flavors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>see <a href="https://youtu.be/Rz1X0RP3Mfw" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Rz1X0RP3Mfw</a></p>
<p>Which is mainly about marinades, but goes into the difference between marinating/brining.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You either do that (which is probably the best way) or you salt it just before cooking it. In between and the salt will dry out the meat, but it won't have enough time to reabsorb the juices and it will be worse than doing it just before.</p></div>		</li>
