As one pop site <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/why-noble-gases-are-called-noble-608603" target="_blank">puts it</a>: &quot;The ability to avoid reacting when provoked—to turn up one's nose and ignore lesser human foibles—is largely considered a noble trait in humans.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nobel&quot; is the spelling of the surname of Alfred Nobel, who of course is also strongly associated with chemistry. It's worth noting to avoid confusion that the element named after him -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobelium" target="_blank">Nobelium</a> -- is not a noble gas; it's an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinide" target="_blank">actinide</a> usually represented at the bottom of the table near the middle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out that Electronegativity applies to electrons in a covalent bond, and First Electron Affinity applies to electrons being gained to form a -1 ion.</p>
<p>While there are some patterns that are similar, you also get some huge differences, like Nitrogen having a much lower First Electron Affinity but a much higher Electronegativity than Carbon. N actually has a lower First Affinity than all Group 1 metals.</p>
<p>Conceptual, a lot of the same ideas apply - nuclear charge, radius, shielding, but electron affinity also has to work with electron repulsion between the electrons added and the existing ones, and applies Atomic Orbital theory which isn't relevant to a bonded electrons.</p></div>		</li>
