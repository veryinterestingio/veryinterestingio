			<div class="markdown"><p>GORD and hiatus hernia is more common with the doctors I have seen, but I have seen GERD and hiatal hernia used. It's more interchangeable I think.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I am not a doctor, I was a medic's assistant in tent hospitals during the &quot;hearts minds&quot; campaign in Helmand and in the siege of Kobane so I am no expert. I can dress a wound, apply a cast, dispense topical antibiotics and anti-fungal agents etc. along with giving pain relief until a doctor can see them, but I am not formally trained, more out of I volunteered to be an orderly on my own time and kind of became an 'apprentice'.</p>
<p>However in Kobane when the food was very scarce we were using antacid liquids a lot to stop people throwing up or feeling like their sternum was being pulled apart from the inside. The above is the 30 second lesson I was given by the doctor supervising the &quot;volunteers with little training&quot; as he had bullets to remove so dispensing antacid liquid was low on his priority...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh ok didn't know that thanks! I was curious and smiled at how similar it was to what I knew the acronym was and what the hernia was is all. Thanks again.</p></div>		</li>
