			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. The amount we dont know about how the human body responds to individual infections is enormous. There are hypothesis that suggest a myriad of chronic diseases may have their origins with viral or bacterial infections. We get so many over such a long period of time, it would be terribly difficult to find linkages. Beta hemolytic streptococcus may be related to heart disease for example. We dont really know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question, and a great honest answer.
The secrets are all locked in the immune system and how it responds to the viral invasion, plus the unique genetic environment of the human, plus any comorbidities present, plus environmental factors... So many variables! It's truly fascinating as a scientist, bewildering and scary for the general public.
There are viruses that cause cancer, viruses that integrate into our chromosomes, viruses that don't infect our species at all, viruses that mutate by the time they leave our body.</p>
<p>And the dam things aren't even &quot;alive&quot; in the biological definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just about what the virus directly attacks either, some of these responses can result from the immune system attacking other tissues as a side effect of its response to eliminate the virus.</p></div>		</li>
