			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add, even the smallest of injuries to a knee/ankle/toe etc... will cause someone to compensate when they walk as well and its easy for that to stay with you once you heal. </p>
<p>So even absolutely identical clones would (could) walk differently due to circumstance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a push a while back (I haven't heard about it for several years, so I assume it's dead) to use AI to identify (or track) people through their gait. The biggest problem they faced was that wearing flip flops would completely mask your normal gait.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The book &quot;Little Brother&quot; by Cory Doctorow has this concept in it. Essentially we all have unique gaits so the AI tries to put all gaits in similar categories and matches us to a similar gait! It's pretty cool, but can be thwarted by rocks in your shoes or a sprained ankle, apparently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have bad eyes but hate glasses and contacts. I just cant read or see detail at distance, but I know all my friends by how they walk. I don't actively look for it either, I just see a few steps and know instantly if it's one of my buddies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People would say this to my mom and I and I would just side eye the fuck out of them because my mom is a strong, sturdy, athletic woman and I've walked with a limp since childhood and have a skeleton that looks like a fuckup. </p>
<p>Also I have never once seen or heard my mother be able to sneak up on anyone, and I do it a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I managed to develop plantar fasciitis about eight years ago (that went away after a few months) that caused my left foot hurt pretty bad for an hour or two when I got up in the AM.</p>
<p>To this day, if I'm in the kitchen making breakfast or any other meal, I'll subconsciously stand on my right leg. Maybe a few times a month. So strange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer and thank you. I never thought about why until I saw the question. So I guess that's why people in the same profession have similar gaits. Like you can tell a person is a cowboy, or a boxer, or whatever by the way they carry themselves. Granted not all professions do that it seems to be the more physically demanding ones.</p></div>		</li>
