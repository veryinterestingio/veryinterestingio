			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. Expired just means its original quality is not guaranteed by the company that made it.</p>
<p>Some foods are tastier after expiration, like cheese. Some food just change color or consistency, like chocolate or honey. </p>
<p>So for drugs/poison, it could be less lethal, or more lethal, or have a taste when it should not have, or have a weird color, or it could be the same. But the issuing company is not guaranteeing anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just get some pamprin or midol, works better cause it also has caffeine (pamprin has tylenol which is acetaminophen, model is ibuprofen) but with the caffeine it also helps with bloating and headaches!</p></div>		</li>
