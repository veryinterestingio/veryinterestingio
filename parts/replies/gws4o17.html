			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah. I've forgotten this memory for over 30 years. But, in high school, I figured out that if the back legs of my desk were against the pipes lining the back wall, and if I didn't have any books in the metal basket hanging beneath my desk, I could wet my finger and rub it along the metal edge of the hanging basket, and I could get it to resonate at a frequency that could be heard throughout that entire section of the building along all three floors. </p>
<p>No one ever discovered it was me. Jeez. I'd forgotten all about that, and that might have been one of my favorite pranks ever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds propagate in interesting ways.</p>
<p>Here's an example.</p>
<p>On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens erupted in southern Washington State.</p>
<p>That morning, the explosion was heard loudly in my home town of Vancouver, British Columbia - Over 400 kms north of the volcano. </p>
<p>Those of us that heard it describe it as a loud &quot;WHAM!&quot; slamming down on the city that shook our homes and everything in them.</p>
<p>Yet 80 kms south of the volcano, in Portland, Oregon, they didn't hear the eruption.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a lens that can occur that can reflect distant sound down from the atmosphere to a ground listener, depending on temperature gradients: <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Sound/refrac.html" target="_blank">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Sound/refrac.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question for those who are smart. I live just north of Tampa and always watch the launches from my backyard. At night, it’s nearly silent but I never hear the rocket. One night, I watched a silent launch, but then a few minutes later, I heard a really deep rumbling—louder and deeper than an airplane. It was the only time I heard it. </p>
<p>Was it possible that it was the rocket and the conditions were just different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s thought that this effect came into play for Krakatoa’s superloud eruption, but with Mt St Helens it was a landslide on the north face of the bulging volcano that then released enough pressure for that whole side to get blown out by a full eruption, causing a lateral blast which was aimed north. It’s why some scientists were killed instantly, those ones happened to be watching from the wrong direction and had the full force of a highly explosive eruption aimed straight at them, a couple of kilometres distance won’t help in that scenario.</p></div>		</li>
