			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the type/mechanism of the anti-inflammatory drug, then yes they could diminish the cellular response. Aspirin doesn’t affect WBCs, but does affect the wound healing process by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase in platelets and stopping clotting. </p>
<p>Inflammation recruits WBCs to the area and works to clear out the damaged tissues. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some evidence to suggest that NSAIDs (things like ibuprofen, naproxen) can delay wound healing as they can inhibit angiogenesis (the formation of blood vessels to the injury area) and angiogenesis is needed to allow for the white blood cells to get to the area quicker. It’s also got an inhibitory effect on the proliferation stage where the cells needed to fix the injury stop replicating. </p>
<p>Better to take paracetamol instead </p></div>		</li>
