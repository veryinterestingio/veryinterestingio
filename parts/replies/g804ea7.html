			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: the way this data is processed into ratings has also determined when stations play commercials each hour, and is the reason why it seems like about half of the radio stations you listen to all go to commercial breaks at the same time.</p>
<p>There are four rating segments each hour of the day, divided at each quarter-hour. To count as a listener for a quarter-hour segment, a PPM user must listen for at least 5 consecutive minutes within that quarter hour.</p>
<p>For example, if you listen for 5 minutes from 3:04 to 3:09, you'll be registered as a listener for the 3:00-3:15 segment. <em>But</em>, if you listen for 7 minutes from 3:11 to 3:18, you don't count as a listener at all. Even though you listened for longer, you had less than 5 minutes of listening time in each segment, so it doesn't count.</p>
<p>As a result, most stations time their ad breaks to straddle those quarter-hour marks, because they know commercials are when people tend to tune out. That way, they can wrangle their listeners' attention into the hour parts that count for ratings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/e632MMDPWKk" target="_blank">Not radio, but a great sketch based on this principle</a></p>
<p>I also imagined this was why TBS used to start their broadcasts at 5 minutes past the hour/half hr. It throws off the rhythm of channel flopping enough that you're either locked into their shows, or you're unable to follow another show because you're missing crucial scenes or dialogue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not imagined. That's exactly why they did it. Keep viewers on their station.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TBS also increases the speed of the shows playing. It’s hardly noticeable but as a musician I noticed that the theme song to family guy sounded different than it does on Fox or Adult Swim. Then I came across an article a couple years later confirming my thoughts. They do it to squeeze in more commercials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Internet radio software offers the ability to know how many ppl are “listening” to the stream. I’m a IR DJ and use SAM Broadcaster which, if you are streaming, will show how many are connected to your encoders. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What u/LaboratoryManiac is true but there is more to it. I worked for the now out of business &quot;CBS Radio&quot; in the Los Angeles area in advertisement / marketing / promotion. We owned half of the radio stations in the FM market and a couple in the AM [KNX / KFWB] markets. While the strategy put forth of timed segments is true, the reason you hear ads when flipping through half the station IS because they are owned by one company, and the reason for this isn't because we want you to to listen to ads everywhere, it's because we sell commercial spots across our networks at certain intervals to simplify our sales and billing. When you own multiple stations it is much easier to have a blanket advert time slot offer that covers all of your stations, rather than a unique or constantly changing one that spans individual stations. All of our stations went on commercial around the same time because that is how we sold our advertisements, to simplify our billing offers. Not to force ads down listeners throats based on arbitrary numbers. We all recognized the inaccuracy of Arbitron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is exactly why satellite radio was able to get a hold in the market.<br />
I would rather pay $120/year than spend 30% of my commute trying to find a radio station actually playing music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is spot on. There might be a hand-rubbing scrouge at the top, but on the station level, it's all just business efficiency. As a veteran of the paper log days, my job was so much easier when stations consolidated their avails into the same dayparts.</p></div>		</li>
