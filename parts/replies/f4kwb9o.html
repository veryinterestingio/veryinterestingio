			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a refractive index thing. Because the way the light you’re seeing is being bent differently above the heat source (density is affected due to the excitement of molecules) as opposed to all the light passing through air that is not being heated which has a different refractive index. Refractive index is a property that is due to density and composition as someone else mentioned.</p></div>		</li>
