			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive noticed that the chairs do get closer at the top but then farther apart at the bottom so it almost negates the drift. The ski lift i work at automatically (mechanically) separates by an equal distance by a latch of some kind that grabs the chair at a certain point of travel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked on doppelmayer lifts.  The system knows the rope speed and measures the distance from the last outgoing chair.  They'll clutch (hold) outgoing chairs if they're too close.</p></div>		</li>
