			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a fucking study done recently that said that patient outcomes are better if we dont hand over care to the next doctor. Problem is, I get in my car after a 36 hour shift and T bone someone. Also, I am incentivized to lie on my hours report, to under report the amount of hours I am actually working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife recently had a stroke. Her condition got worse and nearly cost her life, something I attribute almost entirely to a shift change. </p>
<p>Her condition began to get worse at the end of a doctor's shift. New doctor thought worst condition was normal condition and didn't react until I pulled him aside. </p>
<p>The doctors were great and saved her life, but the little misunderstanding could have been tragic. So I can understand the value of long shifts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a balance between long hours vs continuity of care. If doctors changed shifts every 8 hours, then there will be 3 doctors seeing a patient in a day. That's 3 times someone new has to learn about the patient and their condition. Something could get lost in the transfer each of those times, and often does. Information lost/mixed up during  shift changes is one of the most common causes of medical errors.</p>
<p>Now, does that justify 24+ hour shifts? Maybe, maybe not. But that's the discussion going on with physician hours now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you have a good understanding of how hard it is until you're doing it.  When you're 22 year old med student you think you're invincible. You may not have kids yet or a spouse who would like to remember you existed.  Doing these shifts &gt;30 years old, with the pull of family, free time, mental health gets harder.  And, in my experience, everyone really does want to help people, as cliche as it sounds. But then you work grueling hours, spend most of your time glued to a computer.  But you're 200k in debt, 8 years of schooling in, there's not really a good escape. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Austria University is free and most students never enter debt. Doctors still work long hours. With the shortage of doctors, couldn't you just negotiate for a different contract? I'm an engineer with a 30 hour/week contract because there is just no reason for me to work more than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Debt is a huge part of it.  Once you’re in deep enough to have these kinds of shifts you’re facing 400k+ in loans and you likely have zero other job skills that approach the kind of salary needed to repay that debt because you’ve dedicated your life to this one craft.</p>
<p>If you protest or strike, you’re the enemy because you’re letting people die by not caring for them.  People who say it’s better than it was ... I don’t know how that’s possible.  My wife spends 40 hours running the icu solo at some points, no sleep, constant problems, highly emotionally charged work, all for just under minimum wage.  They’re salary, there’s no overtime, once you do the math it’s like being shot in the gut.</p>
<p>Even after you leave residency its years to pay off the debt then you’re finally starting life but now you’re in your 30s and you spent the best years of your life sacrificing so much just to be disrespected every day from all fronts.  It is not a fantastic career from a lot of perspectives, but for the right people, it’s the only career possible for them to be happy.</p>
<p>She’s in the worst of it now and yes some days are hard, but I know she wouldn’t change a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding (sister explained it to me, she is an internal-med and pediatrics hospitalist), the reason they do this in in-patient settings is to be able to have a singular individual monitoring the progression of the patient over time with rolling shifts to be able to transfer care from one doctor to another without losing a base-line. This can be covered with documentation, but that only helps so much.</p>
<p>This doesn’t need to happen out patient as things move slower, but it’s also why people have a “family doc” because it helps when the doctor has an established base-line.</p></div>		</li>
