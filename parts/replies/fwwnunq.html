			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, seals have the opposite problem.  Their eyes have spherical lenses instead of the more flattened, oval-shaped lenses that human eyes have.  This shape lets them see perfectly well in water because it bends the light more which makes up for the fact that light doesn't bend as much going from water into your eye.  This means that in air, however, seals end up a bit near-sighted.  They would need goggles filled with water to see clearly in the air just like we need goggles filled with air to see clearly underwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually gets even a bit more complicated than that.  It's dark underwater so seal pupils get huge to help them see, and as you say, their eyes are shaped to focus properly.  On land during the day, it's bright so their pupils get small.  This helps counteract the natural nearsightedness from being in the air, similar to how squinting and pinhole cameras work.  </p>
<p>But on land at night, their pupils get larger because light levels are lower.  And they can't see well at all because they can't focus.  I heard a marine mammal researcher talk about all this and he said you could walk through a seal colony at night and they would look around like something spooky was going on because they sensed you were out there somewhere, but couldn't actually see more than a vague blur.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So would it be fair to say that their eyes become large and the light that we shine can be seen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are totally right!  In fact, elephant seals have one of the largest differences in size between their fully dilated and fully contracted pupil diameter.  The difference is about 400 times between the two.   That is 25 times more than the difference in dilated/contracted pupil size for humans.  This is because they are the deepest diving seals (500-1700m depths!) and still hunt for prey at least partially by sight, so they need to let as much light as possible in at very dark depths.  That is problem in the bright light of day, so, just like you said, their eyes contract down to just a pinpoint hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have remarkable hearing/vibration sensing and smell.   You can sneak up on sleeping seals only from downwind in a kayak or canoe paddled very quietly, with a chop hiding your sounds.  Birds will likely alert the seals even before they sense you, but once one seal knows you are there, the entire colony reacts in a wave that seems almost instant.  Seals in isolated places will come to 'trust' humans after observing them for several minutes. Moms will take their young into the sea first and hide them or aggressively defend them.  If you approach a small resting island, you may think that all of the seals are back on it at once after they see you are not a threat, but there are always a few larger adult males swimming as if they are patrolling. Seals are very interesting to observe, super curious, and each colony has a unique set of social rules in tune with their specific home and hunting area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I'm nearsighted. I've noticed, mostly in freshwater that there are times where being under water gives me clear vision compared to landwalking without glasses.</p>
<p>I wonder how that works. Never been able to figure it out, but it's certainly pretty great when it happens.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the focusing power of the eye comes from the differences between your cornea and the air.  When you go underwater this difference no longer exists so you lose a ton of focusing power.</p>
<p>In a nearsighted eye think of your eye as too strong.  Your glasses/contacts are designed to weaken your optical system to balance it out   When you're underwater the amount of power that is lost must be close to the amount of overaction of your focusing system, so you can see clearly.</p></div>		</li>
