			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational waves from black hole mergers can in fact be directed. In such cases, the resulting black hole is &quot;kicked&quot; in the direction opposite of the average momentum carried by the gravitational waves, sometimes with velocities a few percent of the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s kind of terrifying to think that there are black holes whizzing randomly through space. I know space is big (like really, really big) and the chances of the gravity well of a passing black hole capturing earth are probably as close to zero as statistically possible. Would there really be any way to detect one if it were heading towards us? Other than happening to look at an area of space where there was a star and not seeing it there or seeing it displaced due to gravitational lensing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GW occur when a mass accelerates. It’s not due to gravity radiating away which is a misconception that a lot of people have. So a star just doing star stuff doesn’t emit GW. On the other hand two black holes orbiting each other at a fraction of the speed of light do emit GW.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that mass needs to accelerate. If you spin a uniform sphere then it is accelerating, but won't radiate gravitationally. Broadly what you need is for the mass quadrupole moment of the object to be accelerating (i.e. it needs to not only to be changing with time, but also that the rate at which it changes needs to change with time also).</p>
<p>Broadly this means that spherically symmetric systems tend not to emit GWs, but systems which are less symmetric might.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm honestly not certain how condensed matter would respond to being <em>very</em> close to a gravitational wave source, but I'd definitely take my chances close to a black hole merger vs being next to a supernova. </p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation is much happier to deposit energy in solid matter than gravitational radiation. You might notice you can't usually see through brick walls, and even in the gamma range where the average photon can get through a huge amount of matter, enough of them would interact with you that you'd quickly die of radiation poisoning if you weren't close enough to just be incinerated. </p>
<p>On the other hand, gravitational waves are attenuated so little by matter than we have seen observable delays between the GW and gamma signals from at least one neutron star merger. They more or less treat matter as if it's not there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I mean, supernovas are so extreme that if you're in the same star system as a supernova you could die due to the energy exclusively deposited into you by <em>neutrinos,</em> though I do wonder what the tidal forces from those gravitational waves would be like</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While /u/karantza's comment is mostly correct, it's worth noting that (in most cases) there is an important distinction: you can extract energy (i.e. you can generate radiation) from the electric dipole moment of a charged system, but not from the mass dipole moment of a gravitational system. </p>
<p>The key difference here is that the mass dipole is intrinsically related to the centre of mass, which for a closed system cannot change due to conservation of momentum, and this conservation prevents the extraction of energy. On the other hand, there's no law that prevents you from moving the &quot;centre of charge&quot; of a closed system, so you can happily get EM dipole based radiation from charges. </p>
<p>This is why generally the important term for gravitational wave is the higher order quadrupole moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is! Gravity propagates at the speed of light, just like EM waves, so you get the same effects of accelerating gravity sources as you do accelerating electric charges. </p>
<p>(There are other similarities, such as gravitomagnetism, which is the gravitational analog of regular magnetism, caused by the same effects of special relativity.)</p></div>		</li>
