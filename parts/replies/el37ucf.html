			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont get the dopler shift. I understand the waves and color but &quot;more blue&quot; relative to what?  What if that star's light is already blue? How do we know the starting color?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. The starting colour is determined by examining the light coming from the star, and identifying characteristics of it that indicate the composition of the star. There are various characteristics that can do this, including absorption lines and emission lines. Once you know the composition of the star, you can compare it to known light emissions from the same elements/compounds as tested on Earth - and thereby get a calculation of the original colour prior to redshift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The things we used (the light we receive) to analyze that star to find out what is made of and its type, is already shifted towards red or blue by unknown amount! How do we get any usefull info from it? </p>
<p>Somebody answered that we anchor helium and hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;shift&quot; is very subtle.
The overall colour of the object won't change unless the object is moving at extraordinary speed. Like, a decent fraction of the speed of light.</p>
<p>It shifts the reds towards orange, things like that.</p>
<p>Read about it here: <a href="https://www.astronomynotes.com/light/s10.htm" target="_blank">https://www.astronomynotes.com/light/s10.htm</a></p>
<p>Basically, there's only certain colours generated in stars based on their temperature. The temperature is a factor of their size, the materials in them etc. By observing how much these colours are different from what they should be (because of the materials in the star) the doppler shift is a microsopic change which identifies the relative speed the star is moving towards or away from us.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: the colours shift only slightly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know what color it should be? How do we know what materials it consist if we only have color received which is shifted towards red or blue by unknown amount?</p>
<p>I know materials emit specific color when get hot but in order to know what material it is we should know what wavelenght it ACTUALLY emits, And we dont have that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We mostly use red shift and blue shift as terms because in the region of visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum, red light is on the edge of the longer wavelength part of it, and blue light is on the shorter wavelength part of it. If you &quot;blue shift&quot; (compressed) blue light enough it'll become ultra violet light, and red light will become infra red if it's &quot;red shifted&quot; (stretched out).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know those, but what i dont get it when you receive a light lets say 420nm, how do you deduce if its redshifted or blueshifted? You need to know original color which is wr dont know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pick your astronomical catalogue. </p>
<p>You probably noticed the whole black hole photo thing. That's M87*. Which is named for it's galaxy M87. </p>
<p>Which is short for Messier 87</p>
<p>Because it was the 87th object that Charles Messier listed in his catalogue of &quot;stuff that is not comets but someone who's looking for comets might mistake for one&quot; (&quot;Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters&quot; is the actual English name).</p>
<p>most &quot;names&quot; for stuff are actually just catalog indexes, and a lot of stuff will even have multiple designations. </p>
<p>NGC 3603-A1 is a double binary system located in the NGC 3603 star cluster, which is the 3603 object listed in the &quot;New General Catalogue &quot; </p>
<p>R136c is a star in the R136 cluster, which was the 136 object in the  Radcliffe Observatory Magellanic Clouds catalogue</p>
<p>etc</p></div>		</li>
