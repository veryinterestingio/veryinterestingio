<p>Unless air flow or run times are seriously messed with, running an AC will extract (condense) moisture in the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but the air leaving the AC is still at 100% humidity. </p>
<p>Say it takes in air of 30°c and 70% relative humidity, and output said air at 15°c. </p>
<p>As you can read in a <a href="https://mushroommatter.com/media/k2/items/cache/3bd6583af5a14653b7b54db2c9fe7f3e_XL.jpg" target="_blank">mollier diagram</a> the incoming air contains almost 19g of water per kg of air. Once you cool to 15°, the max humidity is 11g/kg. So all of a sudden you have a &quot;surplus&quot; of 8g of water, that will end up in the condenser. </p>
<p>Then the cold air mixes with ambient air and warms up to say 25°, but still has 11g/kg of water. As the temperature is now higher, the relative humidity is around 55%, so the relative humidity in the room drops even though the cold air from the AC is at 100%</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why do you think AC needs to have a tube to let out water then?</p></div>		</li>
