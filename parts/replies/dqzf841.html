			<div class="markdown"><p>A falsification test for the hypothesis that it is about the boiling point of water inside the egg would be to boil an egg in highly saline water. The egg should explode because the boiling point outside exceeded the boiling point inside. There should be a threshold value for the salinity outside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would probably  it work. If you just cook an egg without making a hole in it the shell will already crack. It might work by setting the salt water to boil first.</p>
<p>Better test would be do simply use frying oil and heat it up first and then drop the egg in. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I thought of that while writing my first post.  Turns out that some Youtubers have thrown eggs in a deep fryer!</p>

<p>The egg ruptures violently, but not what I'd call an explosion: probably the mass of the oil contains the blast.</p>
<p>I didn't mention it in my original post because if the egg does blow up, especially in shallow oil, it could throw hot oil in someone's face and burn them.  <strong>PLEASE DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so theoretically could you put a boiled egg in an empty pot on a stove (with a lid) and explode it that way? ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing yes, though you might not get fast enough heat transfer from the pot to the egg to make it work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yea if you've ever say...</p>
<p>Put an egg on to boil on the fire and gone to say... take a shower and come back to see exploded egg over the kitchen, then yes you COULD do that</p></div>		</li>
