<p>Could you elaborate that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if “morally” was confusing. It’s used somewhat commonly in this context to denote when a statement captures the spirit of the problem and is true in essence but might not be pedantically correct or complete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, that was clear. I don't understand why it's not meaningful to say their setup slows down light. Wasn't it exactly what they did?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he means is that light will slow down from a certain point of view.  Sort of like saying your car gets you to your destination slower if you keep stopping for dinner or breaks, but it isn't actually moving any slower between two stopping points.  Light always moves the speed of light, but if the photons keep being absorbed and re-emitted, it takes those actual photons longer to get to their ultimate destination and thus have a lower average speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, in this case the light forms massive quasiparticles in the material, so ot's not exactly light in the material. Normally though, light, as an electromagnetic wave, will be influenced by the electric permissivity and magnetic permeability of a material, slowing down the wave itself. If it was absorbed and re-emitted, it would be re-emitted in a random direction, so no material that slows down light would be optically clear, but both water and glass have a refractive index bigger than 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah okay, so it’s not technically slowed down, but the results made it seem as though it did. Does morally have a different meaning in physics, or is the meaning kind of extrapolated for lack of a better word? I’ve only taken physics 1&amp;2 so I’m likely missing some terms lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common misconception, it fit were true then we would see light travel into a medium and then exit in all directions randomly. In fact, simply put, the interaction between photons and the medium result in a composite em wave that moves slower than a photon in a vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a fundamental reason. You can not contrive such a medium due to the properties that govern the speed of light and those that govern the speed of sound.</p>
<p>If you formulate sound speed at a more fundamental level than the common sqrt(c_ij / density), you'll find it has dependencies on the same properties that are being manipulated to slow light. </p>
<p>That sound is longitudinal and viewed as a mechanical wave while light is transverse and an EM wave is immaterial. It functions within a hierarchy that ultimately depends on EM properties even though sound waves themselves are not EM waves.</p>
<p>In the case of opaque solids, we see a blocking effect. Changing the material infinitesimally until light can propagate results in a material where light speed dominates sound speed. There's no magic variable to tweak, and even in extreme circumstances (BECs, extreme gravitational pull) light will beat sound.</p></div>		</li>
