			<div class="markdown"><p>Crop insurance is extremely important. A lot of people don't ever think about it, but farming is extremely expensive and risky. We don't farm ourselves, but rent out a good amount of land to local small farmers. Costs them each about three quarters of a million dollars to plant every year, and last year after a series of bad hail storms, they all lost the majority of their crop.</p>
<p>Without crop insurance, practically all of them would've gone bankrupt, but with insurance, they recouped their losses and were hardly the worse for wear this season. It's really nice to see, since so many local farms have been bought up by big corporate farms. It's nice to have some small farmers still around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Farming is crazy expensive.</p>
<p>They don't have the money sitting around. They take out a big bank loan every year, use it for planting, buying new equipment, etc. After selling their harvest, they pay it back and keep the fairly paltry leftovers.</p>
<p>When the crop fails, their crop insurance pays enough to clear off the loans. They don't earn much money that year, but they aren't a million in debt, either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It varies from place to place and year to year. If a section of land has higher yield, you'll get more, etc., and then it also depends on the local market, local/state taxes, etc.</p>
<p>My family owns a bit of land scattered around a few states, so it's hard to give an exact number. The stuff closest to where my family lives (I've moved away for now), it goes for just south of $200/acre/year. That land, specifically, we rent out a ways below market, since we've been renting it to the same couple family farms since my grandparents stopped farming it themselves, so we like to give them a good deal.</p>
<p>Land is pretty high right now, so it's not a wonderful time to buy land. When prices go down, it can be a pretty good deal though. The farmer renting it knows more than you, so they'll let you know what improvements should be made to the land, and they'll usually be very happy to split the cost of the improvements and often do the work too, as long as you have a good relationship with them.</p>
<p>It's a nice low effort way of having a passive income, and if you're willing to take a relatively insignificant hit, you can give a family farm a good deal on it instead of renting to be big corporation, and feel good at the end of the day that you're helping the little guys.</p>
<p>Don't just do farm land though. Diversifying your types of real estate is just as important as diversifying your stock portfolio. I'd love to get in on renting out office space because it can be a money fountain, but office buildings are, obviously, expensive as hell. In most situations, you already need to be pretty rich to get into that game, but we can all dream. </p></div>		</li>
