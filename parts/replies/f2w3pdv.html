			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question.  Yes, the process for methane pyrolysis does require energy, being an  endothermic  reaction.  But, in short, we note that methane steam reforming is also endothermic, and this process produces 95% of our H2 today (in the US).  Carbon separation issues, in addition to energy requirements, have been challenges associated with this technology.  Given (government) incentives to mitigate CO2 production should aid in the development and potential deployment of this technology.  Here we provide a link to  a report that we co-authored with Argonne National Laboratory and this does provide some more analysis:</p>
