<p>Even the compression/expansion of the body during an accident can fatigue wiring and it may not be apparent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, way back in 2014, my mom's Astra got T-boned at low speeds on a parking lot, bent the door in but no other damage. Got it unbent, painted, looked brand new.</p>
<p>Few months later, it turns out the impact bent the metal inwards in such a way that the slightest sharp edge broke the insulation on some wiring, and eventually during a rainy day, water managed to get in and ran along the entirety of that cable. Killed the entire A/C, somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hit a deep pot hole once and even though I didn’t hit it at a high speed (basically parking lot speed) it was enough to fuck up both my passenger side tires. I bought new tires and had the rims checked and thought that was it. Nope. Turned out I had also bent a radius rod in the front suspension. It bent in such a way that it rested against the transmission and basically ground through the bell housing over the period of about a year. With every little bump the suspension absorbed it just rubbed metal on metal until there was a hole big enough for the transmission fluid to start leaking. Thank fuck for JB weld.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Currently drive a Yaris. Rear-ended (at like, 20km/h <em>max</em>, was breaking between then and hittin em) a 4WD 'cause rain and they unexpectedly stopped, had a tow ball on it.</p>
<p>Seemed fine, didn't seem to have done more than dent the front bumper and one corner of the license plate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few days to a week later, while between towns (half-hour apart by car from here), engine light comes on. Had made this trip there and back twice since that bump.</p>
<p>Stopped pretty damn fast, made calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turns out the fucking bump was enough to dent the radiator.</p>
<p><strong><em>Juuuuust</em></strong> enough to rub slightly on the radiator fan at the back.</p>
<p>Which slowly wore through the radiator, which then leaked out.</p>
<p>Which didn't get noticed earlier because of the front bumper design, which had managed to catch and hold the lot of it, so there was no marks on the ground or anything, the entire time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a fucking 5-15km/h love-tap with a fuckin tow ball...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a semi professional input on this. The reason those XYZ cost so much. Is the reason they are worth their money. They come with the guarantee and support. And the guarantee and support is worth the price, not the material itself.</p></div>		</li>
