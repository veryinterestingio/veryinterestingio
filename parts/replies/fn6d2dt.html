			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that a fancy way of saying &quot;we don't know, could be any direction until we observe the direction?&quot;. I mean it clearly isn't all directions at once. A photon hitting your eye from a star 50ly away won't be the same photon going in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks, sounds like the wave part of light causes the same photon to go in the opposite direction at the same time..until it's interacted with and the wave collapses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know for sure that it is all directions at once if we can only know after observing it?</p>
<p>I mean I know that it has some probability of going in every direction, but how does one conclude that it is going everywhere at once, and not that few photons go in different directions randomly?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does it contribute to gravity in all those many places?</p>
<p>Or would contributing to gravity also count as an observation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But then wouldn't all photons interact with the closest possible particle to the point of emission? How would any photon possibly travel billions of light years if it's really part of a wave function that extends in every direction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought superposition was quantum mechanics? Sounds like the slit experiment where it seems to go in both slits until we observe it going in one.</p>
<p>Do probability fields say anything different than &quot;we don't know, could be anywhere in this probability field until we observe it's position?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can of course. But that doesn't dodge the problem since they're emitted as a spherical wave front, so the question still is: where's the quanta?  Or maybe: how does a spherical wave front collapse into something discrete?</p></div>		</li>
