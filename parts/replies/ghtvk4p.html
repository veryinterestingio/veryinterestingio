			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically with regards a blue flame, the blue light is produced by the reaction of carbon with oxygen, so any intense combustion of a fuel containing carbon looks blue.  A bunsen flame that is yellow is because the air supply is restricted and the combustion is incomplete.  This results in solid particles of carbon forming in the flame (soot), and those particles get hot enough to glow yellow hot through thermal emission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In short, the answer to the question is that blue flames aren't blue just because they're hot. There are two processes at work in a flame, emission (which depends very deeply on exactly what is burning) in the fully-burning part of the central flame and incandescence (which depends almost entirely on temperature) in the incompletely-burned soot around it.</p>
<p>In practice, flames on Earth are cool enough that incandescence is usually red, yellow, or occasionally white (in increasing order of temperature), but generally not blue. So blue in Earth-based flames is usually a chemical emission, not a temperature-dependent glow.</p></div>		</li>
