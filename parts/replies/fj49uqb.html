			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of things that can be looked at to determine health of an ecosystem. Frogs just happen to be sensitive to a lot of things, so  changes to their environment can result in changes in the population...but not just limited to expression by more or less frogs in that population.</p>
<p>The skin of amphibians is very thin, which is why so many of them are so dependent on regular access to water. But that thin skin readily absorbs more than just water, so they can be indicators of pollutants in ways that manifest as mortality and morbidity. </p>
<p>Furthermore, frogs are low on the food chain, but not at the bottom. In some places, they can also be a considerable portion of the region's biomass, and considering the energy consumed, provided, and moved around by frogs, their impact is tremendous. </p>
<p>Beyond this, there's kind of a stereotype of a frog that doesn't give enough credit to the vast diversity of frogs out there. There are completely aquatic frogs (e.g., <em>Xenopus</em>, <em>Pipa</em>), frogs whose eggs develop on land instead of in water (<em>Eleuthrodactylus planirostris</em>), and frogs who only visit bodies of water to breed and otherwise spend the rest of their life away from water or underground (<em>Scaphiopus</em>, <em>Lithobates capito</em>). Because of the complex relationships frogs have with their surrounding biotic and abiotic factors, they tend to be sensitive to change.</p>
<p>Even the bodies of water so many frogs need to breed can change in seemingly innocuous ways that impact the frogs. For instance, I work in the coastal southeast, which is a fire-maintained ecosystem. Fire is critical to the structure of the forest, keeping tree canopies open and forest floors thick with grasses and forbs. Remove the fire, the canopies close, which shades and kills the grasses, which deprives the frogs of the structures they attach eggs to (those blades of grass), and then more woody plants invade, soak up more water from the wetland, change the pH, and so on. </p>
<p>Basically, there are things we can look at, either directly on the frogs themselves or more broadly in/among populations, that we can compare (usually pretty easily in cases of more common species, considering most amphibians have huge reproductive output). </p>
<p>There's so much more one could go on and on about. But it basically boils down to their biology. As a whole, frogs are highly reproductive, highly sensitive, with changes being relatively easily observable due to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your point about frog diversity and their lifecycle is so important! These are animals with aquatic larvae that can grow to be terrestrial, aquatic, arboreal, etc. That means they're sensitive to changes not only in water quality, but where they live as adults as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true because they require good water quality. Toxins are easily absorbed through their skin and can decimate frog populations in contaminated areas. So if you see a lot of frogs in an area then the water quality is probably pretty good!</p></div>		</li>
