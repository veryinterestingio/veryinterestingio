<p>I’m pretty sure there were quite realistic paintings from back then.  Or perhaps realistic enough from painting someone in real life from reasonable distance.</p>

<p>Good point. I was actually going to make a similar thread to OP, but on the realistic, detailed oil paintings of the 17th-19th centuries; they're much closer to the realistic art of today than the almost childish-looking scribbles of the medieval ages and late antiquity. I don't think the &quot;they have photographs now&quot; in light of that really holds much weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Techniques need to be figured out, practiced and spread to other parts of the world. Little children draw things flat, they don't understand perspective and usually need to be taught how to do it and don't figure it out on their own. Vitruv's Architectura from \~50BC <em>does</em> use perspective and is very detailed, people simply didn't care and he only became important again around  1500 when da Vinci picked the ideas up again.</p>
<p>Where necessary art could be very close to reality. Vesalius' books on anatomy were illustrated in 1540, <em>printed</em>, and widely available to a growing group of interested medical professionals, curious anatomists, and set a new standard of quality for medical illustrations. Da Vinci's works were probably &quot;better&quot; but never got distributed like this.</p>
<p>It's also a question what you want to express with the art. Much (most?) of art is not about perfection but emotion and a meaning beyond the actual subject. People understood the symbols without them being overly realistic. The style highlights the meaning. The light, ethereal beauty of Chinese ink paintings would lose impact and meaning with more, unimportant details. Materials highlights the meaning. For the longest time blue paint was difficult to come by, so the radiant blue cloak of a Maria painted with ground lapislazuli, embedded in a gold background was a form of worship, which awed anyone who saw it just for the (literal) richness in color. Why would she need a hyperrealistic face? She's a holy figure and not like mundane people. </p>
<p>With many hyperrealistic drawings today I wonder, ok, nice tricks, but... what is the meaning besides showing off technique?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You absolutely hit the nail on the head there. Obviously Hyper Realism is art, but I do understand why some feel it isn't capital A Art. It is an impressive feat of skill, but they all feel so, soulless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lmao, Nice dismissal of the incredible artistry of late antiquity and the Middle Ages as “almost childish looking scribbles”.</p>
<p>Also as far back as the Dutch golden age technology like Camera obscura were being used to aid in drawing and painting, and in the 19th century it was common for photographs to used as references for art.</p>
<p>There’s lot of art from the 17th-19th century that isn’t exactly realistic, but a combination of the popularity of academic art focused on historical events and photography largely led to the development of ‘realistic’ art in the 18th-19th centuries</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not a painting, but a statue. On the other hand it's at least 4000 years old.</p>
<p>I think it mainly boils down to what's fashionable in art.</p></div>		</li>
