Now TVA does do coal plants just not in my part they shutdown the coal plants under Obama mainly because they got too expensive to maintain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't seem very accurate; in my zip code it shows hybrid and electric vehicles being only marginally more energy efficient than gasoline, despite 55% of electricity production being carbon neutral.</p>
<p>While not impossible, we would have to be running the dirtiest coal plants in the world for the other 45%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electricity is not nearly as efficient because a lot of energy (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=44436" target="_blank">over 50% in the US</a>) is lost when fuel sources are converted to electricity. Maybe that is why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point.  Carbon neutral in this case refers to nuclear and renewable energy sources though, so low efficiency procedures would still not produce more carbon dioxide, but you're right about the cost of transmission for more traditional energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>is more efficient than</p>
<p>ICE Engine &gt; Transmission &gt; Wheels &gt; Motion</p>
<p>The reason is that line losses, battery losses and electric motor losses are fairly low, and the efficiency of a big turbine powerplant is <em>much</em> higher than an internal combustion engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just go with the electric vehicle.</p>
<p>Even when using a CCGT powerplant running on oil for all the electricity production they are still cleaner than a hybrid vehicle of the same type.</p>
<p>Because a model 3 uses about 16kWh/100km.</p>
<p>A camry hybrid uses about 4.5 liters of gasoline for 100km.</p>
<p>Thats 9.92kWh/liter using the HHV. So a Camry hybrid uses 44.64kWh/100km. Plus production and transport costs of the gasoline of about 5kWh/liter which I'll just ignore.</p>
<p>If you turn the gas into electricity you get 28.7kWh. include grid/charging losses and you get 25.7 kwh of energy in your battery.</p>
<p>So you can drive 100 km (62 miles) in the Camry hybrid or you can drive 161km (100 miles) in the Tesla.</p>
<p>And that's about worst case. If you have any low carbon electricity the Tesla goes even farther with the same carbon emissions.</p></div>		</li>
