<p>Edit: exacerbated*. </p>
<p>An auto correct error. Thanks to everyone that pointed this out. </p>

<p>Also, I think the word you are looking for is exacerbated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had vomiting for like a year due to cdiff infection. I made SO much acid. They had to put me on protonix just so it would stop burning my throat and mouth every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately back in 2007 my nurses made me immediately brush my teeth to 'get the acid off. Unfortunately doing this also took off some enamel. </p>
<p>(Don't brush after puking, rinse and wait a while before brushing) </p>
<p>12 years later I'm still on PPIs. If I don't take them I will puke acid like that spitting lizard from Jurassic Park. I think my digestive tract is broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its also why you shouldn't brush your teeth after puking. Just swish and rinse then maybe brush an hour or two later. Acid softens teeth, then brushing with an abrasive paste can do some damage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you throw up, you can feel the burn of the acid in your throat and mouth, it's irritating but you're not dissolving yourself into goo on the spot.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember those days. At one point I was sitting at the GP expressing concern that I thought I was literally going to die drowning in my own regurgitated stomach acid one night.</p>
<p>You probably figured out your own methods but what greatly helped for me was losing weight, eating less fat, less sugar and no meals after 7pm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel ya.</p>
<p>I throw up <strong>EVERY</strong> time I drink. I went to one of my best friends weddings last night, had two gin cocktails and I was yaking next to the 10th hole of a private country club.</p>
<p>It really sucks too because the dinner was great and luckily none got on my shoes or suit.</p></div>		</li>
