The cord should be left intact until it has stopped pulsing to ensure full transfer of blood from placenta to baby for appropriate iron stores for the baby for the first 6 months of life. Breast milk has no iron and babies need all the placenta blood for their iron stores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>neat! </p>
<p>should they tie&amp;cut the umbilical cord closer to the mom then? so when it shrivels (does it even do this?) it concentrates more towards the baby's abdomen?  when do they decide to tie&amp;trim the cord for the belly button? </p>
<p>unrelated: what results in an innie vs an outie?</p>
<p>I have zero biological knowledge in this region so thanks in advance for any response</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont think we know what causes innie vs outie...I suspect genetics. </p>
<p>Cord length doesn't matter much. It will dry up and literally rot off (the cords stink after a couple days). It should be short enough it isn't difficult to dress or diaper the baby, but at least 1 cm long so that in the very rare case you need access to the umbilicus for an IV you can trim the dry part and start an IV into the blood vessel of the cord (for very sick babies).</p>
<p>Timing varies by provider preference for cutting. I almost always wait until the placenta delivers. However the is no benefit to waiting after you can no longer feel a pulse in the cord.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What akjenn is referring to is called &quot;delayed clamping&quot; (at least, at the hospital where my wife delivered in February they called it delayed clamping).  The use of the word 'delayed' in there may trigger you to wonder if this is a change in how the clamping procedure is done, and it is!  At least, in terms of the timeline of modern medicine it's a change.  After a baby is delivered, the umbilical cord continues to pulsate and deliver nutrients to the baby even outside of the mother's body.  In the United States, it had become very common for the cord to be clamped VERY quickly after delivery.  From what I understand, in a lot of the developed countries, they don't do it that way.  They let the cord be for a little while and then clamp it and cut it.</p>
<p>The &quot;delay&quot; in delayed clamping (in the US) doesn't take long.  In our hospital, it was barely more than 1 minute.  Seriously.  That's all the delay we're talking about here.  Some places might wait a few minutes longer, but that's it.  It's not like it goes for hours and hours.</p>
<p>For our baby, at that point they put a clamp on the cord about 1-2&quot; away from the baby's belly, and a second clamp about 1-2&quot; farther down the cord from there.  From what I understand, positioning of these clamps has nothing to do with innie/outie status later in life.  I, as the new daddy, was given the opportunity to cut the cord with clean and sterile medical/surgical scissors.  I have to say: it was surprisingly difficult to cut through!  Rather thick.  You look at the outside of it and it seems like it is more like a garden hose--by which I mean that it looks like the walls are relatively thin compared to what you expect to be an open core in the center of it.  Not the case.  It turns out it had very little hollow core to speak of, and so I was cutting through a lot of tissue.  Pretty wild stuff!</p>
<p>From there, the cord eventually naturally dries up and falls off right at the skin surface.  New parents are typically instructed to not interfere with this process: let it fall off on its own, and when it does fall off, don't pick at any scab that forms at the belly button.  It'll take care of itself.  Just watch for signs of infection (redness, tenderness, unusual warm spots around the area).</p>
<p>Now, as to whether or not delayed clamping produces profoundly better health outcomes for newborns and infants...I'm not convinced it's a HUGE benefit.  But it's certainly not a harm, and it at least makes sense that it gives the baby a small bump in the right direction.  I don't know about akjenn's claim about it giving a baby a whole <em>6 months' worth</em> of iron (although akjenn certainly seems to know their stuff otherwise--so who am I to doubt?).  Even if that claim holds up, it's not like a baby that is clamped immediately is in trouble: newborns and infants can take vitamin supplements to make up for that kind of thing.  For instance, for babies that are strictly breastfed, it is recommended that they be given daily Vitamin D doses.  Some infant Vitamin D mixtures also contain Vitamin C and iron, so you can get that iron boost in other ways (and actually our pediatrician never said to us that Vitamin D <em>alone</em> was inadequate AKA they never said iron supplements were necessary for our baby during exclusive breastfeeding).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent ointnto make about optimal cord cutting. This is pushed very hard on the NHS in accoradance with NICE guidelines. Also, they recommend a vitamin K injection, plus skin-to-skin contact with mum or dad (who ever is avaliable!). So dads, when you go with your partner to give birth, wear a buttoned up shirt so you can undo it and give that little bundle of joy a proper cuddle!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are and there are several companies that offer cord blood banking (storage), though it is very expensive. </p>
<p>Some hospitals even will collected donates cord blood for stem cell research or use in therapeutics. </p>
<p>For prolife people this is a really exciting way that stem cell research can continue without the use of fetal tissues. I think it is a great compromise and removes the ethical dilemma that has surround stem cell research for decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then they'd start getting serious with the suction.  If the kid swallowed some, gross, but I don't think it'd be too consequential.  If a bit got into the respiratory tract, that's getting more serious.  That kid is going to see a lot of stethoscopes in their first few days.</p></div>		</li>
