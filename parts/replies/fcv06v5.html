			<div class="markdown"><p>A serious answer to your question: yes price makes a difference. A good hearing aid will have many different frequency bands. Each band can be adjusted separately to match your particular hearing loss. So if you only have loss in a certain frequency range, the hearing aid can boost the volume in just that range, or even do a crossover where it duplicates the sound at a different frequency where you hear better. More expensive devices have more sensitive electronics which allow you to have many small frequency bands, rather than a few large ones. They can therefore be better customized to your ear's needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even cheap hearing aids have multiple channels and are sufficient for fitting the hearing loss in a given frequency range for pretty much everyone. Most audiologists I've known will also point out that you quickly reach diminishing returns with increasing channel numbers. I've had several audiologists tell me that most of their patients are content with four. That always seemed odd to me, but given enough experience with hearing aids and fittings, I think a big part of it is communication. Getting a hearing aid adjusted to suit your hearing loss is largely a subjective process. It would be like having someone else fiddle with the equaliser on your stereo while you listen to it with headphones on and tell them what to change. If you have a sixteen band equaliser (akin to 16 channels on a hearing aid), it just becomes increasingly difficult to communicate exactly where you want things, because it is hard enough to tell on your own. Yes, audiologists will largely base the settings for each channel based exactly on your hearing loss and check their targets with a microphone, but hearing quality is very subjective, and most of us tend not to like the out of the box settings based on our audiograms. That's probably at least partly because even those are created by patients telling an audiologist what we hear, so they inevitably get fouled up to a varying degree by all sorts of factors. Tinnitus, your own breathing, or even just being tired or inattentive can all impact your results. If you take several tests, this should even out, but I've had some pretty big swings between them.</p>
<p>The feature that shifts sound into ranges that you can hear better in are awful if you have any sound memory. Nothing like hearing music where the pitches get changed to the best fit for your hearing loss. It's also weird if you have residual hearing, because you'll hear the sound/voice faintly in the original frequency with what is left of your natural hearing, and again more loudly in the new frequency. That is a big hell no. And if you have a hole in your hearing large enough that you need this feature to hear anything in that range, you have a profound hearing loss greater than a hearing aid can compensate for (~105 dB) and might want to look into whether ot not a cochlear implant might be more appropriate. </p>
<p>The more expensive hearing aids just tend to have more features, such as built in rechargeable batteries or improved algorithms that purport to better reduce background noise or improve speech clarity over the cheaper models. How well this works really depends on the individual. I've trialled many of them and have consistently found that, at best, these features are highly situational and are best relegated to a custom program that you switch to for a particular situation. But I also find that if you ever find yourself reaching for the button to change programs because you are having trouble hearing someone, you probably aren't going to be impressed with the new program either.</p></div>		</li>
