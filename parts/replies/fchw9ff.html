			<div class="markdown"><p>A person would need more blood if they have higher muscle density just to support that muscle. I'd like to see this hypothesis used to analyze an equally fit/muscular man and woman of similar size. I bet it would scale appropriately. Men are generally larger and more muscular, but what happens if you took a female with the same muscle mass and weight as a male counterpart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would end up with significantly different looking people.</p>
<p>The average &quot;hot, trim, bikini-body&quot; model woman still has 15-20% body fat. The bodybuilder on competition day woman that has perfect visible muscle definition still has 10-12% body fat.</p>
<p>Bodybuilder men on competition day barely have 2-3% body fat.</p>
<p>So you would end up with a body builder woman and a relatively slim but not fit man. Or a instagram model and a dad-bod guy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just muscle mass, but cardiovascular fitness. The fitter you are, the more oxygen is used during exercise which means more red cells are required to transport that oxygen. </p>
<p>I don't have a particularly muscular build, but I do have a job that leads me to walk up to 22km a day and is not uncommon for me to take 20k-30k steps. I can walk without stop quite happily for over 2hrs (weather permitting) and while I can't run for shit and I am not particularly strong, my red cell count is still 25g/L above average. </p>
<p>Edit* changed pts to g/L for clarity. Average as stated was 150g/L for men and 120g/L for women.</p></div>		</li>

<p>About 3 tablespoons of blood is &quot;lost&quot; during a period. It's mostly tissue and other things.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I googled that and its true that this is the average, though some estimated closer to 4 tbsp. I always thought itâ€™s more than that, but using a cup instead of other products has shown me just how little blood is actually lost, and, like you said, how much tissue it really is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Average being the key word. Get enough wildly high or wildly lows, and you've got skewed numbers! And even among individuals it is bound to vary from month to month. My average cycle length is like 32 days, but my <em>most common</em> cycle length tends to be about 52 days. Super long cycles of 102 days or super short ones of 15 end up making the average all wonky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the volume of blood versus other fluid and tissue is 36%, meaning the actual volume of what is menstruated needs to be multiplied by .36 to get the volume of blood lost. The total amount of flow is closer to 11 tbsp, with any thing between 2 and 17 tbsp within the bounds of normal.</p></div>		</li>
