			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. What makes the headlines are the groundbreaking scientific discoveries. </p>
<p>However, implementing these discoveries into clinical practice takes a very long time and is often very gradual. Observing the results takes even longer time. So there's not really any critical point in time for where you can write a snappy headline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would disagree with the word &quot;groundbreaking.&quot; Most headlines are of things that sound nice to laypeople, not groundbreaking. </p>
<p>The really &quot;critical point in time&quot; that would be most accurate scientifically where you could have a strong headline would be when a new drug or treatment clears a phase 3 clinical trial, but I'd be more than happy to accept a clearing of phase 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can speak from my own experience. In November 2012, I was diagnosed with Stage 3A melanoma (present in 2 lymph nodes). I had no mutations; the team decided my best course of action was interferon alpha 2b. At that time, there was TONS of experimental drugs for mutated stage 3 and stage 4.</p>
<p>This past December while reviewing my history, my oncologist chuckled, looked at me and said &quot;Interferon. We would never do that now. There are so many more options.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strange (and I don't mean that condescendingly) how sharply this contrasts with the comment above about medical advancements getting fed through the hype machine and overreported.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of both.  There have been great strides and a lot of progress made.  But the hype and overreporting makes it sound like the one discovery or treatment is bigger than it actually is.  A lot of progress is made, but there's still a long way to go.  For the people directly affected it is literally a life or death change, but we're no where near a cure-all (if such a thing can even exist)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. For example proton radiology is plain magic for the few types of cancer it works on. Instead of burning a literal hole through any tissue that stands between the instrument and cancer cells it destroys just cancer cells at a given depth.</p>
<p>It has improved survival rates tremendously, but if you have bone cancer it won’t do crap. Cancer isn’t one disease so there is no single cure for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5-year survival rates for early stage breast cancer are now better than 90% but yet 30% of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer will still go on to develop metastatic disease. Which is depressing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand how that is possible, can you explain more? Is it that the women are surviving the 5 years, but developing the metastatic disease even after that 5 year window?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that’s correct. The treatments are delaying the metastasis so you are seeing a lot more late recurrences. I’ll share data when I’m back at my computer. Olivia Newton John famously recurred in this manner recently.</p></div>		</li>
