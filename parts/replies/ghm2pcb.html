			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this needs a further clarification. RNA viruses cannot use the host machinery to replicate because in general, in eukaryotic cells there is no machinery to make a copy of an RNA.</p>
<p>All RNA viruses have to use their own encoded genes to either replicate their RNA or reverse transcribe it into DNA which integrates in the host genome and then they can use the host machinery to generate viral RNA genomes.</p>
<p>In the case of coronaviruses, among the genes that are translated by the host is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other cofactors that the virus uses to make proof-read copies of its genomic RNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, nsp14 and ExoN are not separate proteins, the ExoN domain is just the N-terminal portion of nsp14. The C-terminal portion of nsp14 just has a separate function (methyltransferase activity that allows mRNA capping to avoid detection by the host immune system), so the two domains have separate names.</p>
<p>Other nsps are important in activating/supporting the proofreading activity (primarily nsp10), but nsp14 is the only one that actually does the proofreading.</p></div>		</li>
