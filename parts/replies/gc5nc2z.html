			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. 9 here. The month after I was raped by my cousin. I remember standing up to leave music class and the whole chair was bloody and my jeans soaked, kids were making fun of me cause blood on jeans looks brown and they thought I pooped my pants... Then when we had sex ed later that year and they'd talk about hormones, periods, etc, everyone would turn to stare at me and I wanted to die. Everything was like living hell until 8th grade when I'm assuming they were humbled by their own periods etc, or they just developed a little bit of empathy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One theory posits that early puberty/aging allows for increased survival in traumatic environments. </p>
<p>It grants not just sexual maturity but increased bone density, muscle mass etc. Basically allows you to adult faster to survive. </p>
<p>I know for myself when I was 14 I legit already could pass as 20 year old. Hit puberty early and hard. Trauma has massive effects on the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this count also towards mental maturity? I come from abusive household and back when I was 12 I straight up had to lie in online games about my age because noone believed me based on my maturity and voice. It always made things super awkward.</p>
<p>It felt like It only evened out in my early 20s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brain based puberty stops about mid 20`s. </p>
<p>Trauma however gives us those hormones early for better or worse and it does affect our cognition, for better or worse. </p>
<p>We are better at dealing with life, we are wise beyond our years. We are often emotionally stunted but know how the world works. </p>
<p>Innocence lost. </p>
<p>Funny story. Because I could pass as older in high-school I purchased and resold booze. For years I ran a pretty organised side business. I was displaying both maturity and immaturity at the same time. Doing something stupid in a smart way.</p></div>		</li>
