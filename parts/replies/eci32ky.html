			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the photon has a &quot;perception&quot;, for lack of better word, of infinite speed. However we can observe multiple simultaneous photons, and there is no known mechanism for a photon to travel backwards in time in order to coexist with itself.</p>
<p>It takes time for photons to &quot;do&quot; things, and there is more than one &quot;doing&quot; something at once. Untold numbers of photos are slamming into the Earth right now after a multi-billion year journey, and they sure were the same photons coming out of the Sun yesterday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually this isn't correct. Photons don't have reference frames. There is no perspective &quot;from the photon's point of view.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t antimatter seen as matter that is traveling backwards in time? Would it make sense for there to be some kind of “antiphoton” (maybe dark energy because there’s the theory that dark matter with a gravitational field that pushes) that would allow them to coexist? </p>
<p>I’m nowhere near well read enough on this so just wondering.</p></div>		</li>
