			<div class="markdown"><p>Some older European cheeses are seriously specific, too. There are some varieties where is not even &quot;we use these spores&quot; but &quot;we cure and age our cheese in this one cave that has been used for this purpose for five hundred years&quot; sort of deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact you can have a specific penicillin allergy and be totally fine with some cheeses and can’t eat others </p>
<p>P. Roqueforti e.g. Roquefort, stilton, danish blue, etc: totally fine </p>
<p>P. Camemberti e.g. Camembert, brie, langres, etc: fuck my whole weekend I’m getting wasted on Benadryl and pepto bismol </p>
<p>ETA I’m allergic to penicillin and pretty much any other antibiotic that ends in -cillin fml right </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The name 'Stilton' (which as we all know is the most superior blue cheese) is protected and the cheese can only be made in three counties in England, to a strict specification, otherwise it can't be called Stilton. Similar to how Champagne must be from the Champagne region of France otherwise it's not Champagne.</p>
<p>According to wikipedia there are only 6 dairies licensed to make it.</p></div>		</li>
