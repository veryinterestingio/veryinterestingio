			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to locating executable components, there are also many programs that have internal settings (often stored in the windows registry) that refer to specific locations on the filesystem for locating data/resources. These paths are recorded during the initial installation process, and the program may malfunction when moved elsewhere.</p>
<p>Other related issues include:</p>
<p>Convenience of pre-installed shortcuts that set the working folder appropriately, especially when it is not the same as the folder containing the executable.</p>
<p>Questionable (read:terrible) programming practices such as hard-coded paths (I am very guilty of this when writing small tools), assumptions such as &quot;the Windows folder must ALWAYS be on drive C:&quot;, or assuming that the program installation will always be on the same drive as some other resource being sought (inappropriate use of relative paths, etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh the times when Delphi was ridiculed because it created .EXE files that were a megabyte of size. Considering that was for applications accessing databases and containing multiple reports for printing, I'd call that a bargain. Just copy the EXE to another computer and that's it. Compared to &quot;modern&quot; Electron apps...</p></div>		</li>
