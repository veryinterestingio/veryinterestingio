<p>I thought a hand saw: If you use a hand saw slowly, the sound can be exactly like someone snoring softly.</p></div>		</li>

And then he would stop breathing and you'd have about a minute to fall asleep before the sound of roaring engine stated up again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>when you sleep silently, you're sleeping like a log that's just laying there not doing anything at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid I read comics like Asterix and others like that, and they would make a speech balloon with a log and a hand saw when the character would be sleeping. I never understood it until later, that the sawing meant snoring. It was one of the AHA moments of my childhood...</p></div>		</li>
