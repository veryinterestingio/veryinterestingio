<p>The combinations of notes that we from Western musical backgrounds call an octave, or a fifth, or a third, seem to be musical regardless of the cultural background of the listener. And even to a listener with little musical education or experience. This is because the brain has an easier time recognising simple patterns.</p>
<p>The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is 1:2 (the frequency of one note is double that of the other), for a fifth it is 2:3, for a third it is 3:4. These combinations of notes all sound musical to our brains because the resulting sound is more straightforward to process and recognise a pattern in than,say, two notes whose frequencies are in a ratio like 13:67. So pretty much all musical systems, not just western music will include these ways of combining two or three notes. Global variations in systems tend to revolve around how many other notes are included in a scale between a dominant and its octave.</p></div>		</li>
