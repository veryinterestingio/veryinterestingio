			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this theory. I have trouble showing my emotion and interest but music, scenes in TV, movies etc I'm always getting it. But then I've always believed I'm on the autism spectrum, mildly, so can't show it but it is there. So I thought I was a bit of an emotionless psychopath or something. Glad it's been suggested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m the exact same, word for word! Do you find you’re more easily triggered at certain times of the day. I’m really sensitive to goosebumps/welling up when I first wake up in the morning. I’m not an emotional person, as in I do really care about other people’s emotions but my own mood is level and I don’t get sad over things in my own life, I’m contented 24/7. But many times I’ve played YouTube upon waking and a perfectly innocuous advert has given me goosebumps and brought me to tears: British Airways; John Lewis department stores; Bisto gravy; the list goes on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't noticed whether it's a mood thing but I have noticed it's evening time when I've wound down for the day definitely. Totally agree about getting sad about my own life, I don't seem to. I get it with all the things you mentioned, John Lewis/Sainsbury Christmas advert every year I rate on if I get it or not! Nothing has beaten the WWI football game from Sainsburys so far, not even close.</p></div>		</li>

<p>TL;DR is it's a probably a mix of how our nervous system evolved to incorporate sensory information directly into our autonomic nervous system, and the fact that it has some social value in allowing multiple people to share an emotional state.</p></div>		</li>
