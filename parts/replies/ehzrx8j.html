			<div class="markdown"><p>FFI is at least incredibly isolated. There are less than 100 known families in the world that carry the gene for it. The families are all aware of it, and are now able to test whether or not an individual carries it and learn if they can safely have children.</p>
<p>Sporadic fatal insomnia (sFI), is much more terrifying, but even more uncommon. It has the same symptoms as FFI, but it isn’t genetic, so anyone can develop it. But it’s so rare that there are only around a dozen cases in all of medical history.</p>
<p>Still terrifying, but the more you know!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's interesting is that the people who were eating each other and lead to the discovery of prions also developed a resistance to them. This was a follow up study about them: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14510" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14510</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the followup! This leads me to another question, if you don't mind:</p>
<p>Are prions present in many people without causing disease and death? I mean, say I was stuck in the middle of the Canadian woods or something, with access to water but no food, with a buddy who died before me and no chance of rescue, and I'd be faced with the choice to either eat parts of him or starve, what would be the odds of that person having significant numbers of prions? How would he not have died from them way before, if they're so dangerous?</p></div>		</li>
