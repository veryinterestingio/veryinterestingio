			<div class="markdown"><p>A more recent study focussing on sailfish: <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2014.0444" target="_blank">https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2014.0444</a></p>
<p><em>Our analyses show that sailfish use their bill to isolate and capture prey through two main attack strategies (i.e. tapping and slashing) and that bill-tip acceleration during slashing is comparable to the highest values ever recorded in any aquatic vertebrate, including both swimming and body part movements [10–13]. The recorded speed of the bill tip was much higher than that potentially obtainable for the swimming motion of a fish the size of a sardine (see the electronic supplementary material, text). Expected reaction time and maximum speed of sardines (see the electronic supplementary material, text) further corroborate that they are unlikely to be able to avoid the strike. Therefore, by having a thin and rigid prolongation at the head, sailfish manage to move part of their body (i.e. the bill tip), at a translational speed that is too high for prey to react in time to avoid being struck, even though the sailfish rotational performance lies within expectation for a fish of the same body length but without bill extension (see the electronic supplementary material, text). Based on morphological data from other billfish species and the relationship between mean turning rate and body length, such high translational speeds at the bill tip are also expected for other billfish species</em></p>
<p>One thing to note though:</p>
<p><em>Morphological studies indicate large differences in bill morphology between different billfish species (e.g. long oval bills with lateral denticles in sailfish (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S1)) and shorter ones in marlins and very long smooth, flat, sword-like bills in swordfish [30,31] (see the electronic supplementary material, table S1) which strongly suggest that they serve different functions.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what aspect you want to compare: Increased reach, higher &quot;swatting speed&quot; and a stealthier approach (holes for less air disturbance, color potentially, sailfish basically apporach the group of fish slowly from behind and insert their sword inside the group, before performing the slash movement) are somewhat similiar.
The operational mode is different though and focussed on reducing prey maneuverability, hence the two main attack strategies and overall communication between sailfish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be hilarious if it all turned out to be for mating like nearly half of all crazy stuff in nature. </p>
<p>Bird makes crazy dance moves up? Mating.</p>
<p>Frogs inflate throats? Mating</p>
<p>Animals bashing heads together? Mating</p>
<p>Could stand to reason that it literally could be a &quot;look at the giant sword on Steve&quot; and that progressed into genetic acceptance. </p>
<p>I'm sure it has a utility, but so help me, every time I watch a nature documentary, the weird stuff always seems to turn out to be related to mating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically it is related to mating even if it is used to attack prey. Everything is isn’t it!</p>
<p>The study basically says because of the sword it swipes to the side faster that it can swim. Also the longer the sword the faster the swipe would be logical, as the tip has the highest velocity. </p>
<p>So I would guess the bigger the sword the faster the swipe the easier to kill prey efficiently and thus more healthy and bigger and thus a more attractive mate whether male or female. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This suggests that they use their swords not for stabbing but for slashing laterally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very intersting. Many animals use appendages for stabbing (horns, tusks, stingers). Are there any other animals which use appendages for slashing? (except maybe teeth)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting thing about insects is that impact-based weapons don't work at that scale. Everything is too light for a weapon to really dig in and do damage. If you were an inch tall and tried to stab another inch-tall guy with a spear, then unless his back was to a wall you'd just push him away with a shallow scratch.</p>
<p>Every insect/arthropod melee* attack I can think of starts with grabbing. Once you've got hold of the enemy, you can crush them between your jaws, push a stinger into them, etc. But you can't just whack them.</p>
<p>*Non-melee attacks being things like pistol shrimp or bombardier beetles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do know that wild pigs use their tusks for slashing, as they'll instinctively drive their chins into their target then violently shake their head from side to side. You can still see this behavior in domesticated pigs despite the fact that they no longer have tusks, just go look at some gifs of baby piglets playing and you'll see what I mean.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How? Has it never been observed in the wild? </p>
<p>I am admittedly naive and certainly oversimplifying things but I feel like this is something that’s easily solved with a boat, a diver, a camera, and a team of marine biologists. </p></div>		</li>
