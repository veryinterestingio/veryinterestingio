			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a matter of definition, but there is only one square root of 4, namely, 2. If I write √4, then any mathematician will understand that this means 2, not -2. What you are thinking of is the fact that the equation y^2 = 4 has two solutions, +2 and -2.</p>
<p>We think of +2 as the &quot;better&quot; solution since it is more natural to us (not mathematically, as one may learn in a course on Galois theory), so we define the square root of a number to be the positive solution.</p>
<p>Why must we do this? Because otherwise the square root function is not a function, since functions can have at most one output for some input. One may learn in a course on Riemann surfaces how this is mended.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since you have asked this question in this way, then the answer is that it depends on what you mean by &quot;square root&quot;.</p>
<p>Generally when mathematicians say square root of 4, they mean the principal square root of 4 which is positive 2. We would write this as &quot;✓(4) = ?&quot;. 2 is the only solution because the symbol ✓() means principal square root. </p>
<p>Now if you ask what number when squared is equal to 4 or mathematically &quot;solve x^(2)=4&quot; then this has 2 solutions which are +-2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted this on another answer but I will repost. This is a poor argument against division by zero. Why do you assume that division has to be a continuous operation? The fact that division by zero approaches two different values doesn't mean much if we define it to be something else at zero. If you WANT continuity then that's a different story but you haven't argued why we would want that.</p></div>		</li>
