			<div class="markdown"><p>Since dry skin leaves the skin vulnerable to both sun and cold it's more than &quot;staying sexy&quot; (although dry skin around the nose can definitely make you look unhealthy). Frostbite or skincracks are a pathway for infection and being dead is a pretty big obstacle to procreation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or just spread your spewing oils equally around your face and moisturize everything for free!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the acne result from not washing enough, or washing too often? Could be that washing too often triggered increased oil production in a vicious cycle that's been aggravated over years / decades... (I don't know how old you are).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Try this: lay and sleep on a fresh clean bath towel every day and see if that helps.</p></div>		</li>
