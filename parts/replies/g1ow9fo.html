			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more related to social distancing policies and population density than time of year. Victoria had a second wave when they got lax about distancing and safety, not because of winter. They have some of the biggest cities so they really couldn't afford the mistake they made. </p>
<p>I'm in Western Australia and our strict hard border (and the fact that our population is small enough to act quickly and without resistance on social distancing measures) means life is almost back to normal as we reach the coldest time of year. Aside from the fact we can't really leave the state, of course.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We didn't get any more lax than other states - just some security guard bonked a quarantined lady in exchange to let her out to go shopping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The recent Australian outbreak was localised to Victoria. NSW and victoria's policies were very similar coming into Winter yet for reasons indicated in a response below, have caused the spread. If seasons were an important factor, we would definitely had seen it explode in NSW as well, mostly due to Sydney's population density and ethnic population. Australia has not entered into hard lockdowns as we did during the initial months of Covid (apart from victoria) and we have not seen it get out of control due to the winter season.</p></div>		</li>
