<p>Lucky, mechanisms to repair these damage such as excision repair or photoreactivation repair exist; the latter being unique to specific plants and prokaryotic species. (Ironically the photoreactivation repair uses light to repair DNA damaged by light) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Photolyase, the enzyme responsible for photoreactivation, exists in most species, fungi and animals included. It's not active in placental mammals though, for whatever reason. Maybe our ancestors lived so much in underground burrows that a photolyase was superfluous and mutations weren't selected against.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what happens if we induce its expression? Maybe with some sort of inducible promotor linked with photodamage repair system or skin localization? Was it ever done in one of the rodent models?</p>
<p>Or is the gene not only inactive, but nonfunctional due to mutation accumulation and lack of genetic conservation pressure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gene is nonfunctional. But when opossum photolyase is expressed in mice, it can protect them from UV. See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC125407/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC125407/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure we even have the &quot;original&quot; gene for photolyase any more, certainly not in a functional state. We do have related genes for proteins involved in regulating the circadian rhythm though.</p></div>		</li>
