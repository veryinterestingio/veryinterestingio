			<div class="markdown"><p>Every one of your cells has its own copy of your DNA, each with their own different mutations/errors. There's not really any feasible way to repair DNA damage in all your cells.</p>
<p>Its also not really possible to clone yourself using only DNA. Identical twins have the same DNA (essentially) but theyre not clones, because what comprises &quot;you&quot; is much more than just your genetic code</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if each cell has its own random mutations then looking at a collection of cells should make it pretty easy to figure out what the genes are in an error-free form. Thus, there's no need to store younger DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know how much variation there is between DNA coding amongst different cells throughout oneâ€™s body? I would assume there might be divergence to some extant though separate instances of mutation and transcription errors. (Probably not the right terminology, not a cellular biologist)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the course of your life you get \~100 de novo variants in each cell.  That means genetically about 0.00001 % of your DNA is mutated and not corrected in any cell that you try to clone.  Chance of those variants having a functional mutation is extremely low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The DNA code itself is mostly the same, since it just gets replicated into each cell (there are errors along the way, but most errors don't cause any problems). The implementation of that code (expression) is what makes most of the difference. A majority of our DNA doesn't actually code for proteins, but is actually just there to help with regulation in response to the cell's individual environment. </p>
<p>So the DNA code is largely identical in each of our cells, but the regulation of which parts are expressed at which times and in what amounts is what makes our cells different from each other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only particular issue on that is that epigenetics are more and more being realized to be an important aspect of DNA.</p>
<p>Epigenetics contain both the direct changes some of your DNA will undergo in terms of the actual &quot;code&quot; but also some of the 'temporary' changes in terms of the shape of your DNA. Effectively, a given set of DNA can have multiple expressions depending on how that same set is bent/curved. Interestingly enough, epigentic changes can actually be passed onto your children.</p>
<p>Looking at my fat gut, it saddens me to know that the last 14 years of my life as a fat man have a very likely chance that any children in my future will almost certainly have the epigenetic changes that encourage fat growth. There's a lot of research into THAT field I'll tell you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be a bit pointless, because in the future you could just sequence a few cells, then compare the results to identify and correct the errors. That would probably be even more accurate to your original DNA anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This!  </p>
<p>When you sequence your DNA you're (almost) never sequencing a single cell -- you're sequencing millions of them. Every one of them will have errors somewhere, but almost never in the same place. The output you get is the average and will end up giving you your unmutated sequence.</p></div>		</li>
