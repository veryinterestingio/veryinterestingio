			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former logging inspector for the feds, I can vouch for this as well.  Particularly the latter part--if managed well and for the right reasons (removing diseased trees, thinning to give historic or desired species the opportunity for recovery, etc.), logging can be wonderful and can really change an area for the better.  And some logging companies are much better than others at it.  It takes really active management by the landowner and the loggers to do it well, but it's really worth doing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soil type under the forest will also affect understory growth.  The soil’s fertility, texture, structure, depth to rock, and depth to a seasonal high water table are all influential.  Also, cultural practices, including fire suppression, tree species management, and animal grazing, will influence undergrowth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. The top answers are close but not quite there. The Ecological succession is correct, but the important part is what is happening under the surface.</p>
<p>Its true that ecosystems go from dead soil, then weeds germinate, live and die, drop organic material down, and bacteria decomposes it. They love that green nitrogen rich material from leafy greens.</p>
<p>Then thicker and thicker weeds come and when those fall down, only mushrooms can break apart the lignin in those thicker stalks. As the mushrooms eat and grow (mycelium mat under the ground), the soil transitions from bacterial dominated to fungal dominated soil.</p>
<p>Bushes enjoy this and start doing really well now. Their thick woody stems fall on the ground when the bush eventually dies, giving the mushrooms even more food. Bigger and thicker bushes grow and you now are at scrubland.</p>
<p>Sure, taller plants shade soils more but whats more important is what is happening under the soil. Weeds have a hard time outcompeting these taller bushes, and the bushes gain advantage of the mushroom mat that is developing by something called a mycorhizal association. Basically roots and mushrooms teaming up, balancing nutrient, storing water, and benefiting the woody plants like bushes.</p>
<p>Then you get young trees pushing up through the bushes. The trees really love the mushrooms and the mushrooms love the trees. You are now at a forest with bush and some leafy groundcover. The mushrooms start to really dominate the soils and the leafy green plants who like bacterial dominated soils start struggling.</p>
<p>From here on out, you will see trees do really well, and leafy plants less so, and eventually old growth forest will have tall mature overstory trees, shorter understory trees, bushes, some woody shade loving vegetation in glades such as ferns, then at the forest edge you will find normal groundcovers struggling on the forest edge as the mushroom dominated soils expand outwards, covering the world in forest.</p>
<p>Forests are freakin awesome.</p>
<p>I'm actually going to have a video up tomorrow that talks about exactly that transition, and how to max out your garden and orchards to take these things into account. Many people may have heard of back to Eden woodchip method, and my video tomorrow will be about it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was gonna say here in the pnw you don't really get forests without dense undergrowth even in forests with thick canopies. I assume it's a combination of ample moisture and nutrient rich soil with loads of fungus hard at work (we got ferns comin out the wazoo) and then....</p>
<p>I hope you like blackberry bushes. Endless. Blackberry. Hell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Plants compete for sunlight.</p>

<p>Those damned maples wanting more sunlight... they ruined the whole forest for everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Folks saying it was the oaks fault. This is true, but Neil was no slouch when it came to his lyrics and how they can be interpreted differently depending on the point of view. </p>
<p>The song starts with the maples wanting more sunlight, implying that they have some, but they want MORE.  The oaks, as mentioned, ignore them as there isn’t anything they can do as they “can’t help the way they’re made.”  </p>
<p>When the maples get really angry, they claim the “Oaks are just to lofty, and they grab up ALL the light.” So their story changes from “we want more” and now imply “they are not getting any.”</p>
<p>Maples = little guy who wants their fair share.
Oaks = greedy big wigs who put the blame on the little guy for being inferior in their eyes.</p>
<p>So yeah, I should have said “greedy oaks.”  :)</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: For those wondering what the heck everyone is talking about, it’s from a song called The Trees by Rush. :)</p>
