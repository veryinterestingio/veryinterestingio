Out they showed a video of them testing the Xbox by putting it on this platform that moves and spins a lot to maybe simulate moving in and connecting and disconnecting. It gave me an interesting feeling/idea on the prospect of testing stuff for its durability</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really interesting area of reliability engineering!! One of the methods is called an accelerated life test, or a highly accelerated life test. What you want to do is to identify the mechanism or physical process that drives the failure of the product in this case it's some sort of chemical decomposition. Once you have that, you can create an exaggerated environment where a thing that accelerates that failure is driven to the extreme (be it vibration, temperature, heat, stress,..). There are physical laws governing how a given stressor relates to failure time for a given failure mode. Like, how a chemical reaction rate will increase with temperature. </p>
<p>You do it at some range where the failure will be observed in days or weeks, not years or decades. You tested a few levels in that range, and then use the physical law governing the failure to fit a curve and infer the failure rate in ambient conditions.</p>
<p>I don't know what it would look like for a plastic bag, honestly. But perhaps you're giving it a high amount of UV light, and under a high temperature. You do it at a few extreme levels, fit a curve to that and extrapolate to what would happen at our ambient temperatures and UV light. Because it is a physical process that guides the decomposition, you can be somewhat confident that this extrapolation will make sense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The local IKEA had a demo of one of these tests they use on chairs: a mechanical butt that sat in the chair and got up, over and over again, many times per minute. If the chair doesn't fall apart in a few days of the mechanical butt, it's probably not going to fall apart in many years of a real butt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely not exact. Temperature plays such a huge roll in how plastic breaks down. What might last 1000 years buried in dirt often lasts just a few dozen buried under a cars hood where temperatures fluctuate up and down a lot. I've had plastic pieces literally disintegrate into powder around my engine, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the actual model they use or if skatingraccoon is even correct, but it doesn't have to be in general. It could be modeled by a variety of mathematical models with the model's constants filled in by observing the deterioration of a material over a shorter period of time. What model is correct has probably been empirically derived through the study of materials in general decomposing.</p></div>		</li>
