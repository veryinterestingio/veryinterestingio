			<div class="markdown"><p>Grapefruit wouldn’t cause problems if you could know how much of an effect it’s having on the drugs currently in your system and adjust your dosage, but there’s no practical way to know that.</p>
<p>In fact, for some (expensive) drugs, it could let you get by with reduced dosing. Dangerous game...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True fact: </p>
<p>Almost everyone knows that you can’t drink rubbing alcohol and antifreeze. The reason they’re toxic is that your liver breaks them down into smaller molecules which have some nasty effects on your kidneys and such. If you drink a bunch of them, you’ll get a drug in the ER which disables those enzymes until we can get you to dialysis to get rid of the stuff in your blood thats gonna kill you. </p>
<p>Of couse, not every hospital has enough of the drug to keep patients alive if they end up stuck at a hospital which can’t do dialysis (think about a tiny hospital in remote Alaska during a bizzard that lasts a couple days)</p>
<p>Anyways, the other way to block the enzymes is just normal drinking alcohol. In fact, we even have a formula to calculate how much booze you need to drink per hour to keep you alive. </p>
<p>So it’s totally possible that some ER doc might need to “prescribe” a couple shots an hour to keep someone alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacist here. It can go both ways. It can either decrease or increase the drug level unpredictably. Would not recommend gambling  that to buy yourself time. In addition, if you're heading to the ER, they might want to give you meds too. Would not want to mess up those levels either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do people get tested for level of that enzyme in the ER ? I mean, if someone is unresponsive and you have to treat them, sounds like it would be important. Should I stop eating grapefruit ? Does that happen with the big Chinese grapefruit and the smaller ones we call pomelo ?... So many questions...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. The medicine does not stay unprocessed for days while the doses stack up inside you eventually causing overdose. Instead, the grapefruit has a chemical that inhibits a detoxifying enzyme. This enzyme chews up some drugs to break them down into their building blocks which have no effects on the body and are easily absorbed. When inhibited by one of the grapefruit chemicals, these enzymes no longer function as well and much more of the drug is left intact to them circulate through the blood stream and do its thing. The prescribed dose accounts for a certain percentage of the drug that they expect to be rendered unusable due to that detoxifying enzyme. Inhibiting this enzyme will directly cause a much higher dose than was prescribed to get absorbed into the blood. </p>
