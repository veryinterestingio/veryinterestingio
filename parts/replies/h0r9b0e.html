			<div class="markdown"><p>Ophthalmic tech here. I wonder if what the doctor tried to explain was that the lens has two focal points, distance and near. There is in fact only one lens in the human eye, but that lens is able to adjust its shape, or accommodate, to focus on something close up or far away. </p>
<p>When your stepson was measured using an autorefractor (which is frequently confused by the puff test because the machines look similar) he may have been accommodating, which can cause an inaccurate read on that machine. He may have been focusing with the machine, which generally gives a higher nearsighted prescription and would explain why he always wanted to take those glasses off. Most doctors will use a dilating drop to temporarily inhibit that accommodation and remeasure, so I wonder if the new doctor did so and found that the previous glasses were too strong for him.</p></div>		</li>
