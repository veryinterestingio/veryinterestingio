<p>And even if you can, sometimes the wind is strong enough to carry the fire over the firebreak anyways.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Embers can sometime blow 600-800 feet on strong winds.</p>

<p>Shoot, I've had flaming pinecones dropping from upwards of a mile away, and starting spot fires across our fire line.</p>
<p>Typically spot fires are within 1/2 mile, but up to 2 miles is fairly common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend that had a major fire come within a mile or two of their farm last year. They were getting burning oak leaves dropping on everything. The wind sucked everything up high, and it travelled and just drifted down. They'd been prepping for days and we're still lucky not to lose much (mostly crops due to ash).</p>
<p>Also those leaves will stain concrete, we've pressure washed some of them a couple times now and you can still see them.</p></div>		</li>
