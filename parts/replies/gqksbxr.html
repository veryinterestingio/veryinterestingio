			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll always think of the standard intro to physics joke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A professor stood before his class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a very large and empty pickle jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls.</p>
<p>He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was. So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.
¬†
The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with a unanimous ‚Äúyes.‚Äù</p>
<p>The professor then produced two glasses of chocolate milk from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar effectively filling the empty space between the sand.
The students laughed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That jar is still 99.9999% empty space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I've always heard it, the golfballs represent the big irreplaceable things like family and friends; the pebbles are the important things like work, school, working out, hobbies; the sand shit like watching tv, going out, luxuries. yadda yadda fill your life with the important shit first so there is room, blah blah blah.</p>
<p>But the chocolate milk is 2 beers and the moral is that there is always room in life to drink a couple beers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most of the atom is occupied by the electron field.</p>
<p>I only say this because the empty space idea reinforces the bohr model of the atom which, though easy to draw, is a bad representation of how atoms work and we've known that for over a century. A stress ball or koosh ball or something might be a better basis for analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because vacuums are spaces without matter in them.  A presence of a field isn't matter.</p>
<p>Edit: You know what, I'm going to edit my statement.  You're almost right but for the wrong reasons.  It <em>could</em> be said that total vacuum doesn't exist but not because of fields (as I stated fields aren't matter).  But you <em>could</em> find matter basically anywhere in the universe because a particles wavefunction spreads out over infinity, so you could find any particle basically anywhere in the universe.  This is sort of how quantum tunnelling works, you can find a particle in a place it shouldn't be because it's spread out over space.  But in practical terms this spreading approaches 0 over really really small distances and vacuum basically still exists.</p></div>		</li>
