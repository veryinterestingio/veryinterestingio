			<div class="markdown"><p>I am going to be a bit pedantic here. Intensity has to do with how many x-rays are hitting the painting each second. That isn't the key difference as compared to medical x-rays. What is changed is the energy of each photon of light. If you want to think in terms of visible light, Intensity is brightness and energy is color, with a photon of red light having less energy than a photon of violet light.</p>
<p>By using lower energy x-rays they don't penetrate as far into the painting, like a lower energy bullet won't penetrate as far into a target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a difference between:</p>
<ul>
<li>the energy of each photon (the shorter the wavelength, the higher the energy);</li>
<li>the luminance (the number of photons per second emitted from the source); and</li>
<li>the beam intensity (photons per square cm at the subject)</li>
</ul>
<p>The three relevant factors here are the photon energy spectrum, the beam intensity at the detector and the nature of the detector (are we just counting all non-absorbed photons, or, with spectrography, are we sorting them into buckets based on their photon energy first?).</p>
<p>The emitted photon energy spectrum will be the same as medical equipment, but the source's luminance may be lower to avoid overloading the detectors.</p>
<p>Different elements in the pigments in the paint will absorb different wavelengths, so with X-ray spectrographs, at each &quot;pixel&quot; on the painting as the detector is moved around the painting surface, we can even see which colors are present.</p>
