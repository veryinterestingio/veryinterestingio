			<div class="markdown"><p>They do, where feasible.
You still need a closed fluid loop to transport the heat effectively from the different parts of the station, and you need to be able to adjust it to differing needs.</p>
<p>Much like a cabin heater in a car uses some of the excess heat of the combustion engine. But, where a car is cooled by air flow, a station needs to be able to solely rely on radiators to match varying heating/cooling needs. And much like a car, there are parts that don't mind getting boiling hot (engine), where in other areas you need a comfy zone (cabin) or even colder (fridge/experiment storage). Basically, need some means to produce heat, lose heat, and transfer heat around.</p>
<p>With the ISS, it's more complicated, because sometimes extra parts get attached or detached from the station, causing wildly different needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's super interesting, thanks!</p>
<p>Does that mean there are people on Earth calculating/levelling these heat loads, or do the ISS's systems handle it alone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Constantly loses temperature? Maybe if it was turned off. </p>
<p>“the ISS presents another thermal challenge for engineers -- dealing with internal temperatures that are always on the rise inside this super-insulated orbiting laboratory fully stocked with many kinds of heat-producing instruments.”</p></div>		</li>
