			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it makes sense that some plants don't do this. Having to compete with your own children for sunlight, water and nutrients would be a burden. Another method of reproduction that isn't in your control (branches falling, etc) wouldn't be beneficial, which is why a lot of plants develop ways of moving their offspring as far as possible from themselves. This is especially true for trees, which usually are very successful once they've established themselves but are quite vulnerable as a sprout or a sapling. For other species of plant aggressive proliferation might be more advantageous in a circumstance where there are already other plant species to compete with, like grown trees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only look for so much &quot;sense&quot; in evolution, since it's all random chance</p>
<p>A lot of plants would get eaten, or stepped on, or caught in toes of something, so if the plant gets ripped in half, it makes sense for both parts to try to survive wherever they land, the ones that were able to evolve/retain that ability seem to have survived better over the eons, so now that's a common trait</p></div>		</li>
