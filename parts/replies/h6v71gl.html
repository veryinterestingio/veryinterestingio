<p>That is a huge change that happens during any liquor aging process (unless there are expensive refrigerated aging processes in use that I don't know about).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking off the information regarding ratios of ethanol:water and how it affects the structure of the spirit, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06423-5" target="_blank">here's a pretty interesting article</a> from <em>Nature</em> about how changing ethanol:water ratios will restructure where in the body of whiskey congeners tend to localize. The article focuses on one phenol in particular, a mostly-hydrophobic molecule named Guaiacol which has been identified by gas chromatography-olfactometry analysis as medicinal/smoky/sweet, and is found more in Scottish whiskies than in American or Irish. The takeaway is essentially a molecular explanation of why cask strength whisky can/will taste/smell different when water is added; a scientific explanation as to why when someone says adding a couple drops &quot;opens up&quot; the whiskey they aren't incorrect.</p>
<p>If you or anyone else is interested in GC-O analysis of other congeners found in whiskey, Table VII of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/j.2050-0416.2011.tb00455.x" target="_blank">this article from the Journal of the Institute of Brewing</a> has a pretty cool list of congeners found in a bottle of scotch left behind in the Antarctic in 1909 by Sir Ernest Shackleton himself!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I quite enjoyed the Nature article. These aren't about whiskey, but these Japanese fermentation articles I recently ran across may be of interest. They really help show how the quality of the initial ingredients guides sake fermentation, which is a good understanding to have when it comes to appreciating any alcoholic beverage. In particular, given the complexity that environmental factors have on one's ingredients and fermentation, this is why one can't simply rely on chemical processes to reproduce high quality alcoholic products from other parts of the world.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mr_Yozhik</p>
<p>Thank you for an answer that's on point.  </p>
<p>My original question wasn't about vodka, or aging whiskey in a barrel.  My curiosity today is in consideration of the idea of &quot;resting&quot; such as resting a large amount of recently distilled vodka in stainless steel or other food-grade containers without (I'm assuming) access to air (no additional oxidation).</p>
<p>If I understand your answer, there are minor density variations in a bottle of liquor associated with the distribution of congeners and other long-chain molecules that affect flavor and allowing the distribution of these molecules in the fluid to reach a point of maximum natural entropy and this &quot;re-arranging&quot; at a molecular level *might* account for perceived flavor variations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense, yes, but maturation is often a well regulated chemical process, so it's preferable to monitor and control it in storage tanks or barrels prior to bottling. It depends on what is being made, but in a commercial distillery aging can involve various techniques to encourage a desired consistent outcome, such as controlling the environment to favor certain chemical reactions, using additives, and so on.  </p>
<p>Also, just fyi, to prevent oxidation distillers typically use an inert gas such as nitrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Ask anyone who makes whiskey for a living.  Proofing down product for bottling isn't just adding water and bottling it immediately.</p>
<p>Proofed whiskey without mellowing tastes weird, it's hard to describe but it tastes like it's a watered down cocktail.  Whereas that same liquid after time has passed tastes like... Well, whiskey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually work with Beluga vodka and yes, that is the working theory for the resting process. They also let each style rest for a different period of time. </p>
<p>It's also really good vodka. I highly recommend the Transatlantic and the Allure.</p></div>		</li>
