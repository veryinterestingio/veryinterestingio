			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Another one is the “tick-tock” noise that your car’s turn indicators and hazards make when activated. Originally, cars used a thermal system to facilitate switching the current on and off. A bimetallic spring would heat up when current was sent through it, eventually bending and making contact with another terminal, completing a circuit and turning on the indicator, but also making a “tick” sound. Since it no longer made contact with the previous terminal, it would eventually cool down and contract, turning the indicator light off, and also making a “tock” sound. So the physical device that was flashing the lights also made the clicking sound by necessity.</p>
<p>Later on, automakers figured out how to do this using an electronic relay, which had an arm that physically connected and disconnected the power in succession, also making a “tick-tock” noise.</p>
<p>These days, when you activate the indicator on a car, it’s often not mechanical at all. The car’s computer notes that you pushed the indicator stalk up or down and activates a sequence that turns the light on and off. Still, the “tick-tock” sound persists (often generated by the radio or a speaker in the cluster), just because we’ve come to expect it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And others. There are many icons based on older technologies. The phone icon is sometimes a rotary phone. Icons for editing are pens and paper. Email icons are paper envelopes. Archive icons look like cardboard banker boxes. Video icons that look like filmstrips or camcorders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. And while a floppy disk was clearly related to saving (because in the past, you used to use floppy disks to save data, and not the hard disk drive), most of these icons never had any relevance to computing. </p>
<p>But in the 80s and 90s, when graphical user interfaces (GUIs) were coming online, interface designers needed ways to make these functions clear to new users. You might not really have known how to use a computer intuitively, but the little “pencil” for an edit function and the “eraser” for an undo function made a lot more sense than cryptic icons, or none at all.</p>
<p>Some of the terminology also reflects that, such as the “desktop,” the sort of “home screen” that most PCs have.</p>
<p>What’s more, until the introduction of modern flat UIs, designers took the extra step of making the actual surroundings of an interface look inviting and physical. A “notepad” application might have a leather border and a yellow paper text background, just like a real notepad.w</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good real-life example in recent time would be OLED and QLED TV screens.
Samsung doesn't use OLED at all because one of the reasons is the possibility of having something burned in after some time (some have tested it to be roughly 10 000 hours on some TVs). Good example would be the logo of a TV channel, it sits always in the same corner and is always displayed.
But on the plus side of OLED, their screens reproduce a better image quality and have better viewing angles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>ooo ask them how much they want for it. Some places will sell a 'defective' tv for dirt cheap. And often they want them off of the floor because they hurt the selling prospect for that brand. If the local people won't sell call corporate and let them know. I've heard of 70 to 80% off.</p></div>		</li>
