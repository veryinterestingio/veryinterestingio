			<div class="markdown"><p>Library patrons are very hard on books, not to mention the wear and tear of drop boxes and automated sorting. </p>
<p>A paperback won't last anywhere near 20 circs. That's a possible number for a hardcover, but honestly that's still pretty high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea that a library book could only last being checked out about 20 times. I thought the books in the library lasted for years. Now I’m curious if there is any sort of documentation of what this looks like. Almost like a time lapse of what a book looks like after it’s been checked in and out of the library 20 times by different people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds about right to me.  My wife's Harry Potter books (all hardback) are completely falling apart.  If they were library books they would have long been retired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On titles like the Potter or GoT books we tried to get &quot;library binding&quot; versions, which look just like the retail version but (surprise!) with a heavier binding. Best sellers too sometimes. These can handle a few more circs than a retail binding. Children's picture books more commonly come 'library bound'.</p>
<p>That said, the sheer thickness of some of the GoT and Potter books made the bindings a real weak spot to separating and cracking quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Library page here. Sometimes, particularly with children's materials, the book/item will last only a few circulations, because people, and especially kids, can be brutally rough on library materials. I've had to bring items less than 2 months old to our children's librarian that are 100% unsuitable for circulation. Rips, tears, broken bindings, markings from crayons or pens, dog-eared pages, and even broken covers are all likely for most library items. Sometimes they can be repaired, but many time they cannot. Treat your library materials kindly, everyone!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because an mp3 is just a flat file the user can keep it? There's no way there is a drm lock on a downloaded mp3...</p></div>		</li>
