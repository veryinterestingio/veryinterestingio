			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be plenty of predators on earth, with plethora of bacterias feeding on organic mater. Or just oxygen, really which is toxic to organisms not evolved to deal with it. They also wouldn't be adapted to food sources on earth, or the range of temperatures there.</p>
<p>Invasive species strive when the new environment is similar to their existing one. Organisms are not better or worse overall, they are better adapted or not to specific conditions, and space and earth have very, very different ones.</p></div>		</li>
