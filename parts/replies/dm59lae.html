			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really fascinating! I wonder if the prawns can learn to avoid pain like more complex animals do? Also, do all animals interpret pain in the same way? What about different types of pain? (&quot;Poke&quot; vs &quot;pinch&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mollusks (Aplysia) can. In fact, that's how a lot of early memory research was done. I think they would like poke or give low electric shocks to see if they tried to avoid it in the future. You can Google Aplysia memory if you're curious, I'm on mobile right now. I think they also did a lot of neuro research on squid because they have huge neurons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazing that an animal with such a simple nervous system compared to ours still performs this massaging action on painfully stimulated areas. Now I'm curious if that massage actually does anything to alleviate the pain, even in humans, or if it's a reflex that we animals do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that the &quot;touch&quot; nerve signal partially overrides the &quot;pain&quot; nerve signal and massaging like you described really does temporarily alleviate pain.</p></div>		</li>
