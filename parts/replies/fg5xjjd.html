			<div class="markdown"><p>From memory here, but I think it was slightly more nuanced than that. Many people may not remember, but Netscape Navigator was the main competition to IE in the 90's and it was a fremium offering.  I don't remember the cutoff, but they designed it to get you to pay for it (yes,a browser).  Microsoft bundled IE as a free part of Windows which made people not need to pay for Netscape.  In addition, I believe the main anti-competitive point was that Microsoft used their might to say that any computer manufacturer that pre-installed Netscape would be punished (more expensive license or none at all).  Of course manufacturers didn't want to cut their profits or damage their relationship with Microsoft (the only real OS game in town) so they complied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As in just buying &quot;a program&quot;, a single unit, yes. In the IT/Enterprise world a lot of things are moving to Software as a Service (SaaS) or the license models can be obnoxiously complex, I support one particular software that has a combination of device license, user license, uplink, server, component annnnnd 2 base licenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was more than this. You couldn’t even uninstall IE as it was integrated into the OS even though it could be installed via CD or download. Later you could remove it but there was belief that the OS suffered as a result - it would become sluggish and many errors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People didn't want to believe it but it wasn't completely false. Think of the WebView in Android.  The only way to display html content without creating your own custom renderer was to use the ActiveX control provided via IE.  There weren't really portable libraries to do such things yet.  They were being a bit disingenuous though since you could get rid of the browser app without removing the ability to view content in a control, but it was all bound together.   They preferred not to do the work of separating the components and use that as their reason why it had to be installed.  Installing from CD was only really an option for some updates and possibly for their earliest versions.  The core component was used for viewing help files and certain other &quot;active&quot; content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I mean that was mostly just a legal argument from Microsoft on why they shouldn't have been forced to decouple their products, which is what they were supposed to do.</p>
<p>The EU saw right through it and told them to implement a browser ballot. In the US, the courts were like, &quot;DDLs? DCOM? Object sharing? Fine, whatever, just leave it as it is!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>The ballot screen sucked though. You ended up doing tech support for grandma because she was using some browser nobody had ever heard of.</p></div>		</li>
