			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask whether having the active ingredient as a salt changes its effectiveness, and if not, why? I'd assumed that would be the case, as it's molecular structure is being changed, but from the comments I guess not.</p>
<p>Is it as most of the molecule is of the same shape, and so interacts with things similarly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the scaffold and mode of action.. I would not know how it is in this specific case (and I have to admit it's been too long since I was working on medicinal chemistry) but I'm presuming the HCl does not change the effectiveness on the drug target (affinity), but it might change the effectiveness of the drug in the body (efficacy) because of said solubility issues. The freed up charge from the uncoupling of the HCl in solution will help the molecule dissolve better. Amines can participate in a hydrogen bond with water, albeit a weak one because (tertiary) amines don't have their own hydrogen attached.</p>
<p>I just looked up the molecule though and it seems that histamine on itself is very soluable because of the two nitrogens in the imidazole group and the relatively small/light scaffold. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Histamine" target="_blank">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Histamine</a></p>
<p>So to answer your question, probably not in this case.
Remember the second the HCl is introduced to water it falls apart in ions, and the salt is never covalently bound to the molecule in the first place. It would be possible I guess.. in some cases that the hydrogen is needed for some reaction, but in that case remember there are thousands of hydrogens already floating around in the solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It changes the mass per molecule. Meaning a heavier salt ion would mean you have to take a higher dose, but the amount of the active ingredient in moles would be similar. When dissolved, the salt ion and active ion disassociate, meaning it doesnâ€™t really affect the potency per mol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>quick question you may know then.  I see that hydrochloride salts are the norm, but some drugs use the hydrobromide, the dextromethorphan in cough syrups comes to mind. other drugs use organic acids even, Viagra comes to mind, they use the citrate salt.  what determines what they use? is it just based on experiment and what is most soluble as long as it's well-tolerated?</p>
<p>a side question if you know, don't hydrobromide salts introduce bromide ions which have a sedative effect as well as all the side effects that lead bromide sedatives being taken off the market by the 40s? or do they not create enough or not cross the blood/brain barrier?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The counter-ion is usually chosen for solubility or to promote &quot;clean&quot; crystallization into a desired crystal form. It often has to do with controlling the rate of dissolution of the drug. There are some &quot;rules of thumb&quot; but in many cases it's chosen by experimentation.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the doses of bromide used in sedatives were much larger (as in hundreds of times larger) than what you'd ingest as drug counter-ion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrochloric acid isn't the two-atom molecule HCl, as commonly depicted.  HCl is a gas, called hydrogen chloride.  When you bubble it through water (or breathe into into your nose, where it encounters water - ask me how I know), the hydrogen is pulled off of HCl by a water molecule, to form H3O^(+) (hydronium ion), which is in turn solubilized by many water molecules.  The hydronium ion is extremely acidic (in the Bronsted-Lowry sense) and will readily donate that proton (the definition of a Bronsted-Lowry acid) to just about anything that will take it.  HCl being pulled apart also leaves a chloride ion, Cl^(-), which is itself solubilized by ion-dipole interactions with multiple water molecules.  Those ion-dipole interactions are very strong, and in part that attraction drives the reaction.  See the molecular dipole section on the &quot;dipole&quot; wikipedia page.  Dipoles are interesting.</p>
<p>When a protonated amine dissolves, the extra proton (H) remains on the amine group (R-NH3^(+), where R is the rest of the molecule; sorry I can't do a subscript on the 3) because of the amine's basicity (in actuality, it is rapidly exchanged with water, but the H is on far more often than off), and that part of the molecule is solubilized by ion-dipole interactions with water.  The chloride ion is separately solubilized.  So no, you don't form HCl gas.  A good starting place to learn about this is to read about acids and bases - Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases, to be specific.  And then read about solubility and what causes ionic solids (like NaCl) to dissolve in water.</p></div>		</li>
