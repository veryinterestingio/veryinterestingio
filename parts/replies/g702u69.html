			<div class="markdown"><p>The odor is caused by bacteria excrement. Your body has a natural balance of microbes and germs and, in most normal circumstances, it does a good job of normalizing after an imbalance event(infection, etc). That's probably what happened to you(reverse version; drought then flood).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body actually develops a tolerance for antiperspirants which is why it always feels like it’s less effective the further into the stick you go. I think this was just your body returning back to normal after using antiperspirants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always noticed this too, but then I buy a new stick of the same brand it it's back to full effectiveness?</p>
<p>I always assumed the antiperspirant manufacturers are doing something sketchy to reduce the active ingredient further down to save money</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t imagine how that’s likely since I’m sure they just mix that shit in a massive vat or however it’s made, I am sure they are making huge bulk amounts and then sort of “bottling” them. I have no expertise on the production of deodorant, I am simply assuming that’s the case. In regards to your observation, maybe it’s the placebo effect*. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gonna need some proof on this conjecture because it makes no sense. Deodorant would stop working for everyone if that were the case.</p>
<p>Edit: I say deodorant above, I mean deodorant containing an antiperspirant per the argument of antiperspirant tolerance. Additionally, I’ve googled it per u/Slash_BringingHasher and have found nothing to support this, as expected. I mostly found non-scientific sources saying it’s an old wives tale/beauty myth. Nothing concrete scientific to prove either, but burden of proof is on u/Slash_BringingHasher, not me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antiperspirant, not deodorant. I believe deodorants are simply fragrances while antiperspirants use aluminum to block pores. Also you can simply do a google search and there’s a variety of sources. I’m not sure which you’d trust but take your pick I suppose.</p></div>		</li>
