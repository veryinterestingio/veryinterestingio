			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, thanks.  </p>
<p>I tried to check that but I'll be goddamned if I can find any genuine detail specs about the SpaceX suits so just kinda went off assumptions and what I thought I knew about the old &quot;pumpkin suits&quot;.  </p>
<p>I figure most of it was true/right <em>enough</em> for a &quot;5-year-old&quot; anyway...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanting to correct a bit of a movie myth here. The force isn’t hundreds of times stronger, it is a pressure difference of 1 atmosphere.</p>
<p>The difference between 2 atmospheres of pressure and 1 (from 10.3metres underwater compared to the surface), is the same difference in force you get between 1 atmosphere at sea level and the ~0 of space. </p>
<p>A gentle sucking* force, but still not one our bodies are meant to survive for very long in as you mentioned above with the boiling at room temperature.</p>
<p>*Edit: sucking force is misleading, we’re just not being pushed together anymore.</p></div>		</li>
