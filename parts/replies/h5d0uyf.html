			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar, but a little stronger. Drugs create tolerance (resistance to the drug's effects), some faster than others. Nicotine and psychedelics have what's known as tachyphylaxis - instant tolerance from one dose, but it goes away completely in a few days. Other drugs, like benzos and opiates slowly generate tolerance over a long period of consistent use, and once that tolerance is learned it's hard to get rid of. Stimulants are somewhere in between. So in one case, your body had 5 hours to adapt to a high level of caffeine, and the level is going <em>down</em>, in the other you previously had no caffeine, and the level is going <em>up</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't psychedelics take like 2 weeks for tolerance to go away / baseline or near baseline</p>
<p>Edit: does anyone have any explanation why such a thing exists? I can understand nicotine maybe, because it's in small doses in foods etc, but why do we have instant extreme tolerance to psychedelics? Was there fucking LSD in our fruits back when we were still evolving lmao?</p>
<p>Like is there any purpose to this tolerance? How/why?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No, you can't halve the buzz AND the time, that would be like quartering the total effect. With caffeine, half the dose = half-buzz for about the same full time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In perfect theory world, you're right this makes a paradox. You can keep dividing by two over and over for infinity and never get back to exactly zero.</p>
<p>In actual life, no, the caffeine isn't in your body for ever. Your body removes caffeine at a rate that gets slower the less of it there is. But as the amount left gets very small (after a few halving periods) the liver/kidneys have no problem breaking down and filtering all the rest.</p>
<p>This paradox you're thinking of is like how if you imagine approaching a stop sign in your car, at some point you're going half the speed you were before. Then a bit later you're doing half that speed. Then half <em>that</em> speed. &quot;Does this mean you can never fully stop once you start moving?&quot; No, you just...stop, because the real world isn't a perfect theoretical math problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine is a molecule and splitting it doesn't result in two small caffeines, it's just gone. With something &quot;smooth&quot; like distance or time that can come in any size increments you can do that infinity trick, for something that comes in solid chunks there is an actual end point. Can take a while to reach it, like with radioactive decay, but eventually it'll be gone completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is not related to it being descrete or not. With speed and time the rate doesn't generally vary based on the quantity left. Half-life decay is always 50%, in a unit of time half will be gone, if you have 2kg it will go at a rate of 1kg first, then a rate of 0.5kg, etc. Speed is constant compared to the distance you want to travel in practice, if you're going at a rate of 20kph, the second 20 miles goes as fast as the first 20 miles</p>
<p>It's just the opposite of geometric growth vs constant growth too. </p>
<p>Of the number of particles to be removed by the body, there is a probability that a particle is found and removed by the kidneys/liver, the more particles the more the body will remove, as it's easier to find. There is also often a rate limit as well, which if you hit that limit too many times it can result in kidney/liver damage</p>
<p>Finding and counting populations of animals is a good analogy for this as well. You can find some precent of the animals in the area, it's far easier to find any if there are many. If it's a rare animal, we might think an animal is extinct for hundreds of years but be wrong</p>
<p>These are all problems which calculus should be taught with, graphing the rate of change (either as a percentage or as a constant) is very powerful for these problems</p></div>		</li>
