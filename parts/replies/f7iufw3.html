			<div class="markdown"><p>Exparel is a special formulation of bupivicaine that costs around $300/ vial, versus plain bupivicaine that costs a few dollars per vial. They are absolutely not the same thing. The FDA indications for Exparel right now are fairly limited. I'm certain the surgeon wouldn't waste Exparel on a lipoma excision when plain bupivicaine suffices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very misleading comment. They are not thought of as the same , unlike Tylenol and acetaminophen which are exactly the same medication under different names. Exparel has different pharmacokinetics from generic bupivicaine and shouldn't be just labeled a &quot;brand name&quot;- its properties, degradation rate, and indications are significantly different than nonliposomal bupivicaine.</p></div>		</li>
