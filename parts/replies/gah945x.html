			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few other conditions that separate roasting from baking than just cooking temperature, </p>
<p>Structure of the food: This is the primary factor that sets these cooking methods apart. Roasting involves cooking foods that already have a solid structure before the cooking process begins (think: meat and vegetables). Baking involves that foods that lack structure early on, then become solid and lose their “empty space” during the cooking (think: cakes and muffins).</p>
<p>Fat content: While many baked goods contain fat within, an outer coating of fat, such as vegetables or meat brushed with olive oil, is an indicator of roasting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also, temperature distribution plays a role. baking wants evenly distributed heat while roasting is closer to heat source causing uneven distribution and need for rotation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the definition I am familiar with</p>
<p>it is direct vs. indirect heat</p>
<p>anyone who is very familiar with using a grill knows this, btw</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. In my oven I have a &quot;bake&quot; setting that heats from the bottom elements and a roast setting that heats from the bottom and sides. I'm not sure if it turns on the top elements as well or only uses those for broiling. So in this case roasting is a more distributed heating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what you are saying, but also you can look up 100s of recipes that say oven baked chicken. I feel like with chicken, the recipe usually says roasted if that skin is still on the chicken, and it'll say baked if it is a chicken breast with no skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is my non trained understanding. There is fat under the skin so it is a wet cook, or roast. No skin means not much fat, at least for breast meat so it's baked. I've never heard of baked boneless, skinless thighs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My oven had a roast button, a convection roast button, a bake button, and a convection bake button. </p>
<p>I don't know what any of them do. I use convection bake for everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because as we have said, temperature, structure of the food being cooked, and fat content are what makes a dish roasted or baked.</p>
<p>Not the &quot;start&quot; button on your oven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, at least in convection ovens.  Bake and Roast will cycle the heating elements differently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Instructions unclear, just cooked my friend at a temperature of 220°C for 1.5 hours, basting intermittently until his skin reached a golden, crispy texture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it had to do with communal ovens depending on when in history. Personal ovens weren't really common until the early 19th century.</p>
<p>Communal (or owned by the baker) ovens for baking, residual heat from those ovens might be used  by the community to bake beans in a bean pot.</p>
<p>Roasts in the in home hearth. Such as this <a href="https://youtu.be/OGS4BY7KjTM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/OGS4BY7KjTM</a></p>
