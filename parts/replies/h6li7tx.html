<p>I cannot understand why Iâ€™m never hearing about this study anywhere</p>

<p>My guess as to why is because it's only a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint" target="_blank">preprint</a>; it has not yet been subject to peer review. If medrxiv works anything like the <a href="https://arxiv.org" target="_blank">arxiv</a>, there's minimal to no moderation - as long as you have academic credentials, you can upload almost anything. At least in my field, preprints are shared primarily for the benefit of other researchers. All preprints are subject to modification or even rejection during peer review; it would be irresponsible to report on a pre-print as if it were a published study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I need to catch up on a few episodes, but definitely follow <a href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/" target="_blank">This week in Virology</a>.  Not only are they an excellent, reliable and highly credible source of information on Covid-19 (as well as other viruses, though Covid-19 has been an outsized focus for obvious reasons over the past 18 months)... But Dr. Daniel Griffin in particular has explicitly stated that he's very interested in the answer to this question, and has implied there's more research in the pipeline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TWIV kept me sane last year! Long podcasts, though, which can be good or bad, depending on how much podcast listening time you have. But I agree, Dr Griffin's episodes on Friday are the best bang for your buck for laypeople who are mostly interested in COVID-related information. The other episodes are worth a listen for sure, though.</p></div>		</li>

<li>&quot;After a breakthrough infection&quot; is already quite a hurdle, with the likelihood of that being only ~10%. And before I personally worry about the 10%, I'd like to see what the breakthrough infection rate is for my group (&quot;healthy adult below 40 with no prior conditions&quot;). It might be much lower there.</li>
<li>Four weeks timeframe is imo too short. I have had colds which had symptoms longer than that (esp. persistent cough and occasional fatigue).</li>

<p>Since we don't know, shouldn't you assume it's <em>not</em> lower and protect yourself? Sure, it might be lower, it might be higher, we just don't know - but by the time we do know it could be too late for you (or others reading this with the same stance). I'm worried because hospitals are reporting a large increase in vaccinated 20-30 year olds</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not a plausible assumption though. We do know that there are groups for which the vaccine doesn't work as well, such as immunocompromised people or the elderly. Subtracting their elevated risk of the vaccine not working will leave the more common groups with better odds, not worse.</p>
<p>Besides, and what I think reddit often gets kinda wrong, managing risk isn't about identifying some risk and then avoiding it at all cost. This pandemic now already lasts for over 2% of our life expectancy and is moving towards 3% of it. Considering only the ~50 years of expected healthy adult life, it's even like 4%.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is, by self-isolating you are already suffering a quite bad consequence of the illness. You have to weight that against the threat posed by the illness. The decision isn't &quot;would I rather get long COVID or not&quot;, it is &quot;would I rather spend another 5% of my life in isolation or risk a much-smaller-than-5% chance of getting ill&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
