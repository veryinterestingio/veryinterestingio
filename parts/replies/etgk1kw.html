			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Boil water orders are as common as parades in New Orleans. I think everyone knows not to drink the tap water after a big storm by now. But people walk, swim, and boat through the flood waters (just see tweets from this morning) so I was concerned about that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Careful here. Boiling may kill infectious bacteria, but if the issue is <em>toxicity</em>, boiling might not be enough and you might have drink bottled water that was <em>brought</em> from other areas. Let's wait and see what your government says.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. Standard is to freeze clean water and use it to keep your food cold plus have a stash of clean water. Most people will lose power in a storm like this &amp; will have spotty reception (if any) so they prep ahead assuming they might not be able to access official statements. In other words, official statements made AFTER the storm are not as helpful as we'd hope. Let's hope most people stick to the standard practice of having a stash of water, though.</p></div>		</li>
