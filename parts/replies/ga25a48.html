			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add something to this--if you collect a UV-Vis absorption spectrum of a glass cuvette you'll see that at high enough energies (low enough wavelengths) there is a strong absorbance due to the glass. So there's an aspect of it that you need to reach a certain threshold energy. Of course, like you said if this was a system somehow isolated it would behave differently but in any practical case a sheet of glass is going to have a continuous absorption spectrum that eats up most of the UV. For this reason spectroscopists often use fused silica (quartz) cuvettes, which are essentially transparent out to 200 nm let's say. </p>
<p>Regarding the lack of visible absorptions in glass: as you know from anecdotal experience, glass doesn't interact very strongly with visible light and you can think of this as those visible light photons not having enough energy to access the excited states of the glass. That is still a requirement of such a transition. </p>
<p>The glass has an orbital structure, just like any other material. But unless those orbitals are sufficiently close (small energy gaps that can be &quot;jumped&quot; by absorption if a visible light photons) you're not going to see any visible absorption behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of the same thing but in the other direction, why does high energy light sometimes not interact with matter, ie: why does an x-ray go through skin and muscle but scatter off bone?</p>
<p>Is it because the soft tissue doesn't have an electron orbital energy level high enough to absorb the x-ray? And is it that the bone is dense enough to scatter the x-ray or is it more about the quantum orbital levels of the molecules that make up bone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ways that high-energy photons interact with matter (primarily the photelectric effect and Compton scattering for x-rays are both strongly increasing functions of Z (atomic number). So elements with higher Z will interact more readily with x-rays than low-Z material, all else constant. Bone has a higher average Z than soft tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something like obsidian would be a good example of being like a relatively ‘black glass‘, that is getting excited in the visible spectrum. Light Hits the sample, is absorbed, generating phonons (movement of the crystal lattice) Which ends up dissipating as heat. Basically, anything black is absorbing visible light. Same reason why a parked black car will get really hot on a summer day, as it is absorbing a lot of heat from the sun</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what it means when he says absorbance. I'm not totally clear on what the product is--whether net heating, increasing electric potential (i.e. solar panels and photosynthesis), fluorescence, etc. But whatever happens to the glass, the photon's energy (how much? I don't know) is considered absorbed.</p>
<p>So his point is that there are more common glass materials that absorb readily in the UV spectrum, and more exotic ones that only absorb at higher energies than those.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the levels get smeared out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Physics undergrad here (haven't done solid state/quantum yet); my understanding of this 'smearing out', as you put it, is this: the (valence) electron orbitals of each atom in a crystal lattice superpose with each other, and the fact that we have <em>so many</em> atoms in close proximity to each other, means that discrete energy levels of the orbitals split almost infinitely, to form a continuous 'band', and hence band theory. Is this accurate, to a first approximation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Materials science graduate student here, that's correct to my level of understanding. The energy levels split when atoms interact /bond because the electrons cannot occupy the same energy level and spin at the same time, and when you have effectively infinite atoms in a macroscopic object you get effectively infinite splitting of energy levels, forming bands. Of course a physicist could provide a more rigorous understanding :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Condensed matter PhD here. It's both, actually. You have these bands, composed of a lot of energies. But you ALSO, because of interaction with external fields, have a smearing of each individual energy. Another way of seeing it is that the energies/eigenvalue get an imaginary part, related to the lifetime of that state before it decays.
That effect is of course not so noticeable for energy bands, but mostly for separated energies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't quite understand that. Aren't the energy levels and spin states strictly defined? They can't just invent new ones to occupy because they're all full, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, it is my understanding that thermal vibration of the atoms causes red/blue shifting(doppler effect, but for photons). So that photon at .999E from our perspective can become 1.000E from the electron's perspective, further contributing to the blurring of the lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite fact in this in low level chemistry/physics quantum resonance are discrete energy bands, but as you learn more you are taught about Maxwell broadening: essentially the vibrations of atoms due to temperature causes electrons to be moving toward and away from the photo, which increasing the range of photon energies for macroscopic materials.</p></div>		</li>
