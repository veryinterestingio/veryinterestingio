			<div class="markdown"><p>While I have no proof of what I will claim, what you say makes a lot of sense to me.  English has such a large vocabulary because it is derived from so many different languages.  So where one language may have 3 or 4 words with similar meanings, English could then end up with 6-10 words with similar meanings.  This could then lead to one word being a euphamism, then another, then another, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Idiocy was someone whose cognitive abilities were below the expected in society. So someone with Down's Syndrome was pretty much the standard for <em>idiot</em>. </p>
<p>Then, as they realised &quot;<em>Idiocy</em>&quot; was an umbrella term for many cognitive disorders, they changed the word, but we kept it.</p></div>		</li>
