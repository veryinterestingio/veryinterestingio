			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the main problem in eating a lot of salt was getting too much sodium and that substituting some with potassium chloride made it easier on your body? Also, for having tried it, it just tastes salty in my opinion although a little less so than regular table salt (for a similar amount).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually some research shows potassium chloride in addition to excess sodium chloride can help by balancing out the sodium potassium pump. Some cardiologists recommend heart patients use potassium chloride instead of table salt to increase their intake of potassium. But yes, most still recommend just reducing NaCl intake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is total baloney. We're talking about sodium chloride, as indicated by high <em>sodium</em> content on processed foods' nutrition facts. Lol. And nobody would mistake potassium chloride for regular table salt... it tastes completely different.</p></div>		</li>
