			<div class="markdown"><p>semi rigid, HY80 has a lot of bend to it.  We used to do the rope thing before test depth dives.   Tie the rope tight across the torpedo room.  By TD it was just about on the floor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know of only one boat that has rolled.   It wasnt one of ours.  It was at PD stalking and was hit abeam by an aircraft carrier.  They apparently survived or at least the boat did.  I dont remember if it was a single roll or multiple as it was dragged by the carrier.  It didnt foul the props or get hit by the props of the carrier.  It was pushed aside.  This was in the 70's or early 80's.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Albeit brief when breaching the surface with fast forward speed is the not like 2000t up in the air loading the hull in a way it’s not designed let’s say the rear 4/5 which remains in the water ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically the volume gets smaller with the increase in sea pressure. Doors that normally slide open with ease become more difficult to open and close due to compressive effects, for example. So, the change in volume results in a change in pressure (p1v1=p2v2), but it’s negligible.</p></div>		</li>
