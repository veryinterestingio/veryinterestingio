			<div class="markdown"><p>Read ‘Sapiens’ by Yuval Noah Harrari. Megafauna was driven to extinction every place where sapiens set foot on land. If there was a an area which they couldn’t reach (like an island) the megafauna would continue to prosper, even though these animals were ‘suffering’ from the same climate change the nearby mainland. </p>
<p>The megafauna did not have new borns as often as their smaller counterparts. Thereby sapiens unknowingly caused their extinction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been curious about the idea of hunting the giant sloth to extinction. My understanding is that predators today tend to ignore sloths because their bodies are so low in meat/nutrients/etc that it's just not worth the effort. So if that's the case, why would early humans have hunted them so doggedly? Were giant sloths better for eating?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  I mean climate was probably a factor, but human presence is generally considered the largest factor in the extinction on native megafauna.  These were slow reproducing animals with minimal pressure from predation.  We were the new apex predator in every region we migrated to, and introduced new huge pressures on these species.  Even if we didn't hunt some to extinction, we disrupted their food sources (by hunting them or introducing competing species) and later destroyed their habitat (agriculture takes a ton of land).  The more adaptable species survived (Elk, Bears, and Bison are also megafauna), but most of them couldn't keep up the new predation pressure or the change caused by humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, the mammoth was hunted to the brink, bit it was actually birth defects due to inbreeding of the remaining small populations that led to the actual extinction.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the mass extinctions of the megafauna, in some parts of the earth of it lines up with environmental changes, but in some parts is doesnt. What they all seem to line up with though is humans entering the areas. Giant sloths and such had never encountered people and therefore didn't know they needed to be afraid of us which made for easy hunting. We aren't good at not killing things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I've read about that.  I don't think it's as simple as that paper (and others) makes it sound, though the evidence put forward is pretty good.  The thing is it's pretty hard to determine ancient species' population numbers, and it can take a long time for a species to go extinct.  I do think it's clear humans took down the last few when they found  them, but I don't think the archaeological evidence is nearly complete enough to say we wiped out massive pre-human populations.  Additionally the dates they use for human arrival in these locations are themselves subjects of debate, and the ranges of certainty often aren't specific enough to say they are perfectly correlated with the end of the species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally...I’m convinced Robert Schoch is right and a massive coronal mass ejection hit the earth and cause extinction, flood, and destroyed an semi advanced human society at the end of the last ice age.  The “walking man” glyphs freak me out now after hearing his explanation...check it out if you don’t know what I’m talking about, it’s a wild ride.</p></div>		</li>
