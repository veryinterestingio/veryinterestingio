			<div class="markdown"><p>Offenses do this the entire game. The beating you take in the first half as a defender really starts to set in over half time. The second half and especially the fourth quarter is where dividends begin to pay off. The Seahawks and Panthers are are perfect example in 2018. Look at their rushing yards and then their 4th quarter scoring to see it in action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, just want to add that this applies to most, if not all, sports. A big aspect of any sport is endurance. So if you're evenly matched skill wise, your best bet is being in better shape than your opponent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean &quot;all else being equal&quot; kind of relies on that, and if you want to boil it down &quot;If all else is equal, be the one that's better at the thing that isn't equal&quot; works for pretty much all &quot;all else being equal&quot; scenarios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree whole-heartedly the perfect example of this is the 2011 Stanley Cup finals game 7 Boston vs Vancouver. Boston just wore out the canucks early in the game and by the start of the third period it was terribly obvious that vancouver was just out of gas</p></div>		</li>
