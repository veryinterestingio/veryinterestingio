			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, &quot;but it won't work with sunlight&quot; means that it won't trap all wavelengths equally well.  The modal structure of the cavity will lead to a spectrum for the trapped light that looks rather more comb-like than the incident sunlight.</p>
<p>Also, a resonator can have more than two mirrors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! </p>
<p>An interesting kind of multi-mirror cavity is a whispering gallery mode resonator, where the light travels along the inside surface of a cylindrical or spherical medium. The beam can graze the edge at a very small angle and undergo many bounces before arriving where it entered.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hmm, but other comments, above in this thread, say that true one-way glass like this would violate the second law of thermodynamics (you could use it to create a hot spot and a cold spot, where there was just uniform temperature before, and run a heat engine for free).  Like Maxwellâ€™s Demon, or a Brownian Ratchet?</p></div>		</li>
