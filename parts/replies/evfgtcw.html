			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the excellent, extensive, answer. It’s much appreciated! I’ll go through all the references later.</p>
<p>Thinking about the lead and zinc example. Do you think it could potentially lead to noticeable (by observation, via population strength after two months or so) outcomes if one forces -as a simple experiment- this process by feeding worms 50% coffee grounds for 200 generations or so. And then do a reciprocal transplant experiment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm hesitant to speculate much on what you would see in that case, but I think it's plausible.  However, there are definitely differences between these cases too; digesting coffee grounds is something worms can already do, while surviving high concentrations of metal ions isn't, and so the latter presumably requires more drastic changes than just optimizing an existing ability.  If, for the sake of argument, there <em>are</em> physiological genes whose expression is important for digestion of coffee grounds, then we would expect that these genes would be more strongly expressed immediately with coffee ground exposure as a plastic response.  However, there is another process that can link plastic responses and evolution which I didn't mention in my original post because frankly I find it very difficult to explain well.  This process is called <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065266008601194" target="_blank">genetic assimilation</a> or sometimes canalisation, and I think you might very well see something like this after enough time.  To simplify what this would look like, the worms would at first only express these theoretical coffee grounds digestion genes in the presence of coffee grounds, but after being exposed to this food source for long enough, the regulation of these genes would evolve to the point that they would just be constitutively active even if you took the coffee away at some later point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again thanks! I’m all out of questions for now.</p>
<p>Genetic assimilation is one of those concepts that I understand when reading about it. And then I start thinking about it, linking it to other concepts... and then I’m not so sure anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to point out that evolution does not require the *appearance* of novel mutations in order for dramatic changes to take place (although it can work that way). It can operate on standing variation in a trait. It is likely that most of the variation in human height we see across the globe, for example, is not the result of any individual mutation that affects one population but not another. Rather, we have hundreds of genes and thousands of associated variants that affect height in some way. In some (tall) populations, the variants that are associated with greater height are much more common, while in other (shorter) populations they're more rare. In this kind of scenario, it's entirely possible for natural selection to drive the trait outside of the initial population range *even if no new variants are introduced*.<br />
Whether this same kind of situation exists with various aspects of worm metabolism or whatever is impossible to say without an in depth analysis. But the general conclusion is that many kinds of adaptation are possible even over a relatively small number of generations, because the variation being operated on already exists, and we don't need the occurrence and spread of a novel variant.</p></div>		</li>
