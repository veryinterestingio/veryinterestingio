			<div class="markdown"><p>There are tons of online retailers you can type your prescription into. I got prescription sunglasses and glasses with all the extra anti-scratch, easy clean coating, polarized, blue light filter stuff for $70 and $30 respectively. If I were to go back I would've gotten slightly more rigid frames for my normal glasses, They're flexible in a way that prevents them from breaking and are super solid, I just don't manhandle them so I prefer the rigid, arguably easier to break frames.</p></div>		</li>
