			<div class="markdown"><p>I notice this where I work. I am one of four people out of 50+ in my office who has at least a 4 year college degree. The rest of the people are tradesmen. They are very good at what they do and are not unintelligent by any means, but the way they approach new problems unrelated to their specific craft is completely different than those of us who have formal education. Their mindset is &quot;something is broken, I go fix it&quot;, but when you have an undefined problem that no one really knows how answer, they don't know the right questions to ask to get to the bottom of it.</p></div>		</li>
