<p>On the same page they say both</p>

<p>We do not sell your personal information. Ever.  </p>
<p>We do not need to (or want to) sell your information.</p>

<p>Sharing data is not the same as selling and they make the point that it is for they way Honey functions, the they way they make money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, “sharing” is a dolled up way of saying “selling”. This is extremely common phrasing used by nearly every internet site that collects data. Information is currency in the internet age, if it is changing hands, it isn’t for free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I appreciate the good faith attempt to clarify, this point is more of a &quot;technically correct&quot; statement than representative of the true state of affairs. </p>
<p>Yes, you are right in saying that Honey does not sell user data. As in, Honey does not literally aggregate information on its users, compile that in a massive database, and then sell access licenses to companies for use of that data for specific advertising purposes. However, a cursory glance over the same privacy policy you linked suggests that even without explicitly selling the data for a direct cash payment, they are still happy to hand off data for a variety of other vague reasons: </p>
<p>&quot;We know how important your personal data is to you, so we will never sell it. We’ll only share it with your consent or in ways you’d expect (as we explain here). That means <strong>we will share your data</strong> if needed to complete your purchase, <strong>with businesses who help us operate Honey</strong>, or if we are legally required to do so... </p>
<p>...<strong>in an aggregate or anonymized format that does not identify any specific person</strong>...&quot;</p>
<p>In essence, they are committing to a bit of legalese double-speak here. They may not be directly monetizing your data, but to suggest that your data isn't collected and used for monetary gain is incredibly deceptive. It is not just a major component of the app, it is the method by which the company makes money - they would not be able to do most of what they do with the app without collecting your data, and since companies exist to make money, they need to use their access to that data to do it.</p>
<p>I'm glad that you are happy with the app's privacy policies, and I don't even necessarily think it's a disqualifying factor - I used the app for a couple of years when it first came out, and am a member of other sites including Google and Facebook which do similar things. It's just not fair to suggest they're not collecting data for some monetary purpose and that you get to use the app with no consequences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The part you quoted goes on to say why the share the data.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yes they use your data, as does every personalized service out there, that's how they personalize. I fully understand being cynical, or not happy with that, but the reality is, better service requires more data, with in reason. Yes there is even monetary reason for it, but its no more predatory  or exploitative  than YouTube showing your targeted ads. My point wasn't that no data is collected or they don't use the data the collect. If they didn't then there would be not reason to collect it. The point is that the data is not a product. If they themselves need to use the data that is perfectly understandable as that's how it works, as you pointed out with things like google or Facebook.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean... alright? I guess I can't argue with you wanting to be charitable to these companies, you have every right to do so. I don't put as much faith in a company to handle my personal data responsibly, I guess.</p>
<p>I, personally, don't see the point of obfuscating the fact that the company <em>requires your data in order to turn a profit</em>. That is, by definition, <em>selling your data</em>, however many hoops they want to jump through and whatever flowery language they want to use to dress it up.</p>
<p>It's lipstick on a pig at this point in my mind, and again, if you're okay with how the company operates, so be it. I genuinely don't think that's a moral failing on any individual's part to use the app, nor does it reflect inherently negatively on Honey to do what they're doing - they're a business, they exist to make money, as you rightly suggested. I'm just saying that it's delusion to portray it as anything other than a company specifically built around a particular monetization model which <em>requires</em> aggregating user data, however anonymized and however specifically it is implemented.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not necessarily legal double-speak in the way you describe. This is a legal CYA for &quot;we use a cloud service to store our data&quot; or similar.</p>
<p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/after-the-breach-nord-is-asking-users-to-trust-it-again/" target="_blank">NordVPN experienced a security breach</a> when one of its datacenters in Finland had a flaw in its network security systems. This datacenter was a third party that Nord was contracting to host its VPN services. Nord failed not necessarily because of a failure of its own security, but because it put its trust into a third party that failed for them.</p>
<p>Honey, like many, MANY other companies, have partnerships like this that they rely on. But by using them in the ways that they do, they are required to state in their privacy policies that, yes, these extra companies <em>are</em> receiving your data. And if for some reason these companies are the failed link in the chain that comes back and burns Honey, no one can point at Honey and cry, &quot;But you said no one else had our data!!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
