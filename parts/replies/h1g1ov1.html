<p><em>Enough already, this has been fun and all but I can’t cope anymore, I’m losing control here’, then boom - a shot of the good stuff gets you back in the room, and your brain regains control and can do a quick systems check</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not being combative here, but do you realise a female orgasm works very differently from that? There are waves peaks and ebbs of a series of differing sensations that last moments or minutes, and one can lead to another in a building series of mini peaks, that if handled correctly, can lead to several different feeling orgasms with no <em>shot of the good stuff</em> to define it.</p>
<p>Edit: OK, for clarity sake... Let's say your having fantastic sex, it builds, it peaks, you nut, all is well with the world and you feel fantastic, and yeah, maybe you can go again in a couple of minutes, but that particular event is done. You have come.</p>
<p>For a woman, she might come and feel fantastic, bona-fide orgasm, grab a smoke and let's start cuddling, <em>BUT</em>.... its entirely possible, that within moments of that orgasm, another one starts to build, slightly different, approximately 5x more amazing than the last, and you think 'oh yeah, now <em>this</em> is an orgasm' </p>
<p>Legend tells that with the right techniques, there's potentially many more new and ever more mind-blowing levels of orgasm ahead, I dunno, I've only ever got to lvl 3, but apparently  tantric sex can make a women come for hours at a time. It'd probably <em>kill</em> her, but what a way to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a female with &quot;a shot of the good stuff&quot; type orgasms. I'm not sure defining orgasms based in sex is the best way to do so. Each person orgasms differently. As a female past partners have been disappointed that I'm not a multiple orgasm gal because of statements like the above that men and women orgasm differently. Everyone should explore their own body's way of release and communicate that with their partner, rather than depending on some definition or porn or whatever.</p></div>		</li>
