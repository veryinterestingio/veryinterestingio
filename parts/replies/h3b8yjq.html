			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeh, 3 days too short. The key though is not eating a ton of heavy food to break the fast, it can get way worse than you think. I am on day 4 of a fast now, expect to break tomorrow I will be taking it easy on my belly. I expect some honeydew melon, bananas, and some crackers. All light and easily digestible. </p>
<p>At a certain point in a fast though (I always thought 7 days) your body stops making stomach acid, that is when you can really hurt your body breaking the fast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>People can fast up to 3 days without safely, but any longer and you have to be VERY CAREFUL about breaking the fast. Refeeding syndrome can be deadly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've fasted close to seven days multiple times, ending on a binge, and felt perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Refeeding syndrome takes a long periods of malnutrition to be a concern, and you're not gonna see that from a healthy adult fasting even for weeks at a time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure, but this is an anecdote. Studies on fasting have consistently found dangerous side effects with fasts exceeding a couple of days and any good doctor will recommend that you don't try it without medical supervision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first ever fast was 3 days long. I've done multiple 7 day fasts. I generally eat kind of light on the first day, but that's only because my stomach shrinks. It's still normal food though, I've never worried about what I'm eating</p>
<p>That being said, I had about 60 pounds of extra weight around my body. I definitely wouldn't recommend fasting to someone unless they have ample calorie reserves to draw from.</p></div>		</li>
