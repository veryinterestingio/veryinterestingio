			<div class="markdown"><p>You can almost always resell or give disks to others. Microsoft got into some hot water for that just before the launch of the Xbox one. Usually it is much faster, because most of the game will be on the disk and you'll just need to install updates, not the entire game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really true. Most games these days far exceed even the largest capacity disks. So in an effort to save time and money it's mostly licensing information and permissions to download on disks these days.
An overwhelming majority of the time it's the same amount of time whether you buy a physical disk or just buy a digital copy.</p></div>		</li>

<li>license, not ownership</li>
<li>depending on the game it's just a 'code', you will need the whole game or at least patches to play online. E.g. Spyro's remake specified that even at launch day you needed an online connection.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite, if you get the game on physical media, then that does contain the game's data itself, so ideally you'd only need to download a small patch, not the whole multi-gigabyte thing (although lots of publishers suck at this). The initial installation is basically copying most of the disc's contents to an internal HDD/SSD, so it's not <em>just</em> a proof of ownership</p>
<p>Also, of the current generation nintendo switch games ship on cartridges, which are much faster than discs and require no installation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s also an excellent benefit to having physical copies vs digital and that’s that you can sell your physical discs when you’re done playing. I very rarely pay full price for a new game and if the game I’m bringing back is fairly new, I can get like $20 off the next one. When it comes to digital copies, when you’re done playing them, they can take up space on your hard drive or you can delete them. That’s it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was silly the went away from disks to discs (but I know they didn't have the same tech as there is now).  Cartridges should come back into play as they are much higher speeds and are getting lower in prices.  I mean, consumer SD cards for 100s of GB is like fairly inexpensive.  Companies/businesses who would partner with manufactures would get an even better deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A 100gb blueray costs pennies to press and have read speeds on par with modern HDD drive speeds. SD flash cards cost 100x more and have sustained speeds on par with CD drives. SSD drives (which have a lot more than just a flash chip) are still about $10 for the same capacity (though somewhat faster than the blueray)... but there would need to be some R&amp;D for manufacturing something useful for gaming consoles, no one is making it in a size and format that would be competitive except for Switch (where the added cost is required for mobility)</p></div>		</li>
