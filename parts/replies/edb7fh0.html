			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there!  I have a physics degree but never heard of this description of <em>how</em> Planck's law is modelled to happen.  Do you have any resources I can use to learn more about it?  I've got a number of thermo textbooks nearby (my wife was also a physics major) and you don't have to shy form advanced sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi!  </p>
<p>In my case, I put the pieces together myself from various references, so I can´t really point out a single good reference (probably there are though, this is well known in some areas of physics). I will try to guide you through one explanation that I find fundamental enough, but there are different ways of obtaining Planck´s law. As a first disclaimer, note that Planck's law is a very idealized scenario, obtained after several layers of approximations and assumptions, so there´s still a lot to dig up if one wants to fall down the rabbit hole.  </p>
<p>Ok, I will try to be brief because I tend to write too much.  In order to explain it I will follow the particular case in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4824.pdf" target="_blank">this reference</a>, which contains the simpler example of a very small particle (actually many particles, but it can easily be particularized to N=1). Note that in such reference they try to answer the question of how the temperature of a particle evolves with time as it reaches equilibrium with the field, whereas your question can be formulated as: assuming the particle is <em>kept at a constant temperature</em>, what is the energy flux it radiates per unit time? Although different, these two questions are very related and answered simultaneously in the paper.  </p>
<p>Basically, there are two ingredients you need to determine Planck's law from 'first principles' : Maxwell equations and the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem. First, we know that a body (in the reference above, a spherical particle) radiates, i.e., it is a source of electromagnetic radiation. Now, from Classical Electrodynamics we also know that every source can be decomposed into electromagnetic multipoles (this is called Multipolar Decomposition, see e.g. <a href="https://books.google.at/books/about/Principles_of_Nano_Optics.html?id=Qrf036kThTQC&amp;redir_esc=y" target="_blank">this book</a>). From this decomposition it can be immediately deduced that for the example in the reference, namely a particle much smaller than the wavelength of the involved light, only the dipolar mode is relevant, and thus we can reduce the problem to a radiating dipole. To calculate how much energy per unit area and unit time is radiated, we need to calculate the Poynting vector (the integrand in the right hand side of Eq. 1). By operating with Maxwell Equations, this Poynting vector can be reduced to calculating the fluctuations of the electric fields and dipole moments (the objects inside <brackets> in Eq. 20). This is the mathematical formulation of the statement &quot;the body exchanges energy with the electromagnetic field through fluctuating dipoles&quot;.  </p>
<p>The second part involves relating these fluctuations with the temperature of the body, which one does using the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem. This powerful and very general result fundamentally connects the fluctuations of some physical quantity in thermodynamic equilibrium to the linear response functions of the material at a given temperature. In the case of fluctuating dipoles, it expresses their fluctuations as a function of the polarizability response function (or permittivity, they are related) and the thermal occupation factor, either Boltzmann or Bose-Einstein for classical/quantum theories. This is equation (21), which is the mathematical formulation of the statement &quot;The thermodynamic fluctuations induce fluctuating electric dipoles&quot;. The final result for a single particle is difficult to extract from the reference above, but you can find it <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03811.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (Eq. 2). The power at a given frequency is the integrand in such equation, and is nothing else than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">Planck´s Black Body radiation spectrum</a>, namely omega to the third power times the Bose-Einstein occupation factor, multiplied by a certain function of omega. This function is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_emittance" target="_blank">thermal emissivity</a> and determines the deviation of the emission of a real solid with respect to black body radiation. To obtain Planck´s law, you further assume that the response to the electromagnetic field does not depend on the frequency (this is the definition of a black body) and then this function becomes a constant. In general, however, objects will not be black bodies and keeping the frequency dependence of the emissivity factor is actually very important.  </p>
<p>This is basically the gist of it, I hope it was somehow clear. As a final comment, I will mention that this is still not a first principles demonstration: one could go further and try to calculate the dipole fluctuations starting from a bunch of atoms and using condensed matter techniques. There are, however, very strong arguments proving that this would indeed lead to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, so nothing new would be gained by this. Of course, in some very extreme scenarios this theorem fails, and this makes a very interesting research topic. But this is a rare occurrence and thus a story for another time.  </p>
<p>Let me know if I can further help, and sorry for the long response!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey this was awesome.  I've left the field and gone into industry where I don't get to poke around this very often, and I'm happy to have a side project to go through some of those papers.  In particular I've never heard of the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem, so I think it'll be a ton of fun learning about it.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the laws of electrodynamics, electric charges in motion emit electromagnetic radiation (=photons). The temperature of an object makes the atoms move around a bit and, since the atoms are made of electric charges, they emit photons.
For normal temperatures these photons are infrared and we cannot see them, but if something is very hot the photons become visible. That's why molten metal glows.</p>
