			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is most users online. Adblock advertises itself as having &quot;60m users&quot; and from what I can read uBlock origin has 15m. That's 75m users worldwide. There are other adblocking solutions but these two are by far the most popular. Some of those downloads are single users downloading on multiple computers or browsers. Let's be completely unfair and round it up to 100m (world wide). The USA has 275m internet users, so it's not even a majority of Americans.</p>
<p>Hootsuite estimates 42% of internetters use and adblock, but that's not based on hard empirical data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adblock is an incredible thing which I am very surprised hasnâ€™t somehow been outlawed or sabotaged (one way or another) yet. </p>
<p>May it last forever, but with the amounts of money involved (even if only a tiny minority use it) I fully expect corporations to torpedo it in the near futur</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's a bit of an arms race. Depends on which adblock you have too and which lists you subscribe to. I'm using the built in adblock with Brave and don't get them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely love Brave, especially on mobile. Backed up with DuckDuckGo which has improved immensely in the last few years, neither of them seem like a compromise.</p>
<p>If using YouTube on mobile, I prefer to use the Brave browser instead. The UI of Youtube on mobile web isn't as good as the app, but that's a decent trade-off for intrusive ads.</p></div>		</li>
