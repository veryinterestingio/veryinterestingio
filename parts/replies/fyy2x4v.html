			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is also a filler. In my conversations, I've found &quot;ano&quot; is often perceived as bit more polite or thoughtful, instead of coming off like &quot;uhhhhhhhhhh...&quot; Also, it has more meaning than just &quot;uh&quot;, which is contextual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Itai&quot; is kind of a bad example because it actually means 'painful'. But on the other hand I guess it's an interesting counterpoint - maybe in general if the words are easy enough to say in their language, the actual words are used instead of agreeing upon a sound exclamation that means a specific thing (like 'ouch').</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's just easy to say. Again, for everyday minor owwies, you're probably not going to hear a full &quot;itai&quot; or well-pronounced one from an adult - the variations you hear are just as agreed upon. One doesn't even need to know it actually means pain to exclaim it and have ANY language-speaker understand via context XD.  We could also say &quot;That hurt!&quot; if we feel pain, but that's somewhat awkward and too long in English unless reiterating afterward. So, we never shortened it to &quot;hur&quot; or something from hurt, though we could've. Instead, we shortened &quot;OOoowaaagh, god DAMMIT! Tch...&quot; ü§£ I doubt native Japanese-speakers are thinking the word &quot;pain&quot; in their head, just as I doubt most native English-speakers are aware they just wished whatever caused their injury be damned to hell in the above outburst, but that's personal speculation.  </p>
<p>Edit for clarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beyond being a neutral and easy tone to make for keeping the attention or filling gaps. For me I say &quot;um&quot; and &quot;uhh&quot; a lot because I think too fast for my brain and mouth to work together and process. I'm not sure if it's apart of all speakers (perhaps to an extent) or if it's just far more noticeable with me because of ADHD. But I'll tear through words and sentences then hit these hard &quot;uh, um&quot; walls because my mouth quit working when my brain didnt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have ADHD, but my speech is similar. My writing skills are beyond superior to speaking. It's like my words reach a bottleneck because my mouth can't keep up, so I totally get that. I know many with ADHD very personally though that will forget what they're saying mid-sentence because their thoughts moved on and need to get back on track. It's usually silence, but lots of filler if uncomfortable or hurrying. I think it's greatly personality plus environment though. I'm a &quot;like&quot; (don't judge me), &quot;mm/nn&quot;, and silence and hand motion person üòÉ</p></div>		</li>
