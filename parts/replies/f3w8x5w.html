			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always confused by this. They say you only dream in “deep sleep” Or REM but I have woken up at 7am set my snooze for another 15min and went right back into the same dream i was just having. Its weird how 15 min of sleep can feel like an hour in a dream. I got like 5 hrs of sleep last night but woke up feeling less groggy than the day before when i got a full 8 or 9. I am confusion. </p>
<p>Maybe ill try those sleep apps my sleep is so erratic. Which one would you recommend?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>REM is not deep sleep, the brain is very active. It's actually quite normal to briefly wake up and then go straight back into REM, see the picture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep" target="_blank">here</a>. And the percentage of time spent in REM increases throughout the night so it's highest right before you get up. Also if you're sleep deprived you'll go into REM faster.</p>
<p>I recommend the &quot;Sleep as Android&quot; app if you have an Android phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this confuses me as well, I can start dreaming immediately while falling asleep while either snoozing, taking my daily nap at lunch, or even going to bed for the night because sometimes jumping right into a dream makes me sort of wake up before truly going to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cant nap during the day your lucky! It triggers sleep paralysis and generally just is not good for my mental health it seems. </p>
<p>That snooze button is one of my vices lol. Mornings are not my friend.</p></div>		</li>
