			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also do 4296 alphanumeric characters for more complex information. Another fascinating thing QR codes can do is also allow for the inclusion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code#Error_correction" target="_blank">error correction</a> (in exchange for overall length). This is because they were invented for use in manufacturing logistics, and what happens a lot is that a QR label gets scratched, smeared, ripped or damaged in other ways during transit. Using high error correction settings when making a QR code allows these cases to still reach their destination and be read successfully. This has saved large operations a lot of time and money and is part of why it was so widely adopted in these industries before they ever got popular for everyday use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s more so about the logistics industry than manufacturing. The issue isn’t making the gadget, but transporting it from the factory to the consumer. It’s the reason why the barcode was first invented - automate the tracking of train cars to mitigate the risk of human error.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The lines are of varying thickness and each number representation is actually 7 individual bits. White represents a high signal and black, being less reflective, is a low signal.</p>
<p>0=HHHLLHL
1=HHLLHHL
2=HHLHHLL
3=HLLLLHL
4=HLHHHLL
5=HLLHHHL
6=HLHLLLL
7=HLLLHLL
8=HLLHLLL
9=HHHLHLL</p>
<p>For the purposes of calling them data, the 84 separate bits representing the 12 digit code and the 7 bits for the 13th check digit aren't counted towards the total number of bits of information conveyed by the overall code</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A number is the same regardless of the base... 1101 in binary is exactly the same number as 13 in base 10.</p>
<p>For a QR code, 23624 bits of binary can store a 7111 digit decimal number, but that 23624 number probably includes the error correcting bits of the QR code. 7089 decimal digits takes 23550 bits to store, leaving 74 error correction bits. That's probably also for the biggest size of QR code, although I didn't Google it.</p>
<p>For a barcode, 25 bits can only store a 7.5 digit base 10 number, so I'm not sure where those numbers came from.</p></div>		</li>
