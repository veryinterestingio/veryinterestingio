			<div class="markdown"><p>If a sphere (or a circle for simplicity) is spinning sufficiently fast, the circumference experiences the Lorentz contraction. Therefore the ratio between the circumference and the diameter, pi, changes. Further, since a spinning disc spins fastest at the edge and slowest (technically not at all) at the center, the value of pi changes at different points along the radius of the disc: as you measure further from the center, i.e. as the value for the radius gets bigger, the value of pi gets smaller because pi = C/2r and C gets smaller due to the Lorentz contraction while the length of the radius stays the same because its motion is perpendicular to its length.</p>
<p>Edit: I originally said &quot;the ratio between the diameter and the circumference...&quot; in my second sentence and that's technically incorrect since that comes out to 1/pi and not pi itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much on relative velocity but it does depend on gravity (acceleration).
pi depends on the curvature of space-time, and the curvature of space-time depends on gravity. </p></div>		</li>
