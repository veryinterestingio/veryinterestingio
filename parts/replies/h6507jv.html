<p>Though I’ll double down and say that both CMEs and EMPs are highly overhyped as civilization-killers.  They’re based on worst-case extrapolations and wild guesses about how events observed before the invention of modern electronics would affect modern devices, and they don’t account for the resilience of modern equipment to power surges of all types.</p>
<p>In particular for CMEs, modern power systems have circuit breakers and automatic shut offs that the crude telegraph wires of the Carrington event didn’t.  A big CME would put the power out, but nobody’s convincingly shown iy would do so permanently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m glad to see a more informed take here. I have a prepper uncle who has a basement packed with expired food and he’s always going on about “a solar flare could permanently destroy all electronics and destroy civilization”. In reality we don’t have a lot of evidence to believe that would be the case besides century old stories of the effects on technologies much different than our own</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on where the electronics are. On earth you are right, likely not as the earths magnetic sphere sweeps away most particles. </p>
<p>For devices in orbit or free space, getting hit by a solar particle event can certainly destroy electronics by inducing single event effects. The most common are latch-up, burnout and gate rupture.  I’ve destroyed more than a few devices by testing for these effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also during the Carrington Event from Wikipedia:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some telegraph operators could continue to send and receive messages despite having disconnected their power supplies.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes you realize how much energy was pushing through the systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, oldschool long-distance telegraphs operated at about 100 volts or so and a fraction of an amp, and modern long-distance power transmission lines operate at 300,000 volts and thousands of amps, so I'm not sure that factoid matters much.</p></div>		</li>
