			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had a piece of food scrape the roof of my mouth and apparently something got embedded up there. Scratch healed but then I started to get pain a week later. Throbbing pain in the roof of my mouth and upper teeth. No OTC pain med could do anything but barely dent the pain. Weeks. Doctor said it's mouth, see dentist. Dentist said it was roof of mouth, see ENT. Hadn't booked appointment for ENT, but one evening while laying around like a lump, I felt the roof of my mouth throb in a different way than previously. Went into the bathroom and looked at it. There was a small hole in the roof of my mouth. A minute later, with the pump of my heartbeat, pus started erupting from the hole. Then a bit of blood. Then it was done. Throbbing stopped. A couple of hours later the hole was even gone.  The pain sucked, but that was pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My most recent c-section resulted in every single dissolvable subcutaneous staple (placed below the skin for stapling the fat layer) pushing out from underneath my freshly healed skin through a hole full of pus. There were about 20. It was super fun with a month-old baby</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might not be related at all, but this happens to me with body piercings! I've had both ear lobes, both nostrils and both nipples pierced, each set was done at the same time in the same establishment with the same jewelry. For whatever reason with all of these sets the piercing on the left side of my body would constantly get infected while I've barely had any issues with all the piercings on the right side.</p></div>		</li>
