			<div class="markdown"><p>I was dabbling in photography in the early 1990s (when digital cameras were unaffordable, so yeah, with analog) and made some nice pics using the usual colour films and that was it.</p>
<p>One day I got a present: a sample box of various b/w films from a good manufacturer. I was first disappointed that these were ”only“ B/W ... until I developed the first pictures: I was completely dazzled by the sheer quality of the pictures: ultra fine grain and so much depth and nuances! I’ve never seen pictures like this before!</p>
<p>I don’t think any digital camera can achieve what I got out of my rather cheap analog camera and these high-end B/W films.</p>
<p>Hm, I feel I should get my old camera out of the garage again... :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered why black and white photos have an artistic reputation.  I figured it was <em>because</em> of the lack of color, or maybe because they were older and so it felt more classic to people.</p>
<p>But now I see that maybe a lot of it is because the picture quality was a lot better, and this just doesn't come across with a reproduction or digital copy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong here, but isn't the lower &quot;resolution&quot; of color film sort of similar to what happens for digital image sensors? You need photosensitive crystals that respond to different frequency ranges, which means some crystals will be &quot;blind&quot; to certain colors, limiting the number of crystals that could react to the light the film receives. </p>
<p>Similarly, bayer filters do the same to a digital camera's sensor, which is in reality only able to detect light intensity, not color, which also cuts down the amount of pixels available for each color by a good amount. Usually it's half green, quarter red, quarter blue, which means green light that hits a digital sensor will not be detectable by half of the sensor's pixels, leading to reduced resolution compared to what you'd have if the camera sensor was made for black and white image.</p></div>		</li>

Modern looks like 100 ISO..
Color, yes, but so so sharp</p></div>		</li>
