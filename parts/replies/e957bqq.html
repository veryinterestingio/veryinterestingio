			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the key aspects of insider trading you keep missing is that the information is &quot;nonpublic&quot;. You can act on the information, you just have to share that information with other investors first.</p>
<p>You could call your stock broker (most trading is done through a brokerage these days) and tell them what you know. You could tell a reporter. You could publish an ad with information in a newspaper, magazine, message board, or whatever that's likely to be read by other investors, and, especially, the people you're selling your shares to. It's not your responsibility to convince anybody. </p>
<p>Once you've made a reasonable effort to make that information public, you are free to act upon it.</p>
<p>What separates the amateurs from the pro's isn't the amount or quality of information (at least, not anymore), it's the ability to analyze and interpret that information. </p>
<p>In the example: Okay, the CEO is going to kill his or herself, you have to share that fact with the world. But, as an expert stock investor, you're not obligated to share your opinion that the CEO's been horribly mismanaging the company for years, that the most likely* replacement is a goldmine of untapped brilliance, so this personal tragedy will actually make the company better. </p>
<p>* you know this candidate is most likely based on your assessment of the board members and other candidates. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not OP, but curious: how much time would you need to give those investors to react to the information before being able to sell? I mean, I presume I wouldn't be able to hit &quot;Send&quot; on the &quot;CEO is suicidal!&quot; email and then, seconds later, confirm my stock sale before the price has had a chance to react?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha. So you essentially just cannot be secretive about what you're doing, if you've went public with whatever &quot;insider&quot; info you were given, and once you've do so it's then fair game to buy/sell with the now public information?</p></div>		</li>

<p>side note: the trader will also take into account if he expect others to know this information or not. If not, he will try to time the market to also make money on the initial fall of the information, and then again on the recovery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure that would be insider trading, you have no duty to keep that information private, this supposed conversation also took place in public so others might have the same info. If he knocked on your door then I'm not sure.</p></div>		</li>
