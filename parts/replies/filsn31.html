			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless someone intentionally clogs them. Was helping my uncle do some commerical plumbing work (I was like 17 at the time, just needed a summer job while my dad was out of town for vacation) at a retirement building. It was only like 14 floors. A lady near the top was severely mentally ill and would flush just anything she could down her toilet. Entire rolls of toilet paper, dish/hand towels, dog/cat toys, plastic bags, live (at the time of flushing) rodents. Eventually fully clogged it and it would have been impressive if it wasnt so fucking awful. Solid 6 feet of impacted pipe on the 7th(ish) floor. Tens of thousands of dollars in damages and repair costs. </p>
<p>Such a shitty job. Glad I dont do anymore plumbing lol I hope the lady got help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read an essay once about how a typhoid outbreak in NYC was traced to a (registered) typhoid carrier in a five-story-ish apartment building.  Some kids had messed with the vent pipe on the roof, causing a clog, and the overflow landed atop the walk-in cooler of the convenience store on the ground floor.  Not sufficiently cleaned up, it eventually contaminated some fresh fruit and 100-odd people got sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Until today I have no idea how this terrifying contraption supposed to be sanitary.<br />
14 story building where I used to live as a kid had this chute and it was always reeking of organic waste.<br />
Sometimes when you are not cautious enough or just plain unlucky you could get caught with the trapdoor open when shit is tumbling from upper floors. The experience is hard to describe.<br />
The only solution to manage this mess was to weld shut trapdoor on each floor.<br />
I haven't seen one operational for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was lucky that the one tall apartment building I lived in had it so that you couldn't open the door to the trash chute if someone had it open on another floor. That was all well and good until someone tried to shove a pizza box in, and their door wouldn't close properly until maintenance came to fix it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work on a campus that has dormitories that have these.  The solution is to require a small angled (but almost horizontal) section at each floor with a smaller door opening than the chute diameter.  This means you can't get hit by falling debris and you cant clog the main chute because anything big enough to do so won't fit through the door.</p></div>		</li>
