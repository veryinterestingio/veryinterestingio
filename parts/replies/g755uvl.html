			<div class="markdown"><p>Your brain has expectations and a required amount of time to heal up and recover. If you cut that short, you're disrupting the whole process which can throw hormone levels off. That can cause the headache. The brain didn't have time to properly regulate hormones before waking up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>sleeping less is not the reason for your headache</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I was about to say: I don't get headaches from sleeping too little. I get them for lots of other reasons, but never really from sleeping less than normal. Even with severe sleep deprivation or just 1-2 hours of sleep. </p>
<p>In addition to your comment, I also suspect that sleeping less is associated with other unhealthy behaviors that would make headaches more likely.</p></div>		</li>
