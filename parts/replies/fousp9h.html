			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you could dig tunnel underground that would serve not as earthquake triggers but rather as channels close enough to the volcano to break open right before the eruption (due to stress) and serve as conduits for lava to flow underground through it and out a predetermined spot. Kind of like designing a release valve on a pressure cooker that would never open except when the cooker threatens to overheat and explode?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like anything, in theory you could but in practice you couldn't. We really have no idea where to drill and the size/amount of these &quot;valves&quot; would likely be beyond anything we'd be able to create or control.</p>
<p>We just don't have the ability to really manipulate things on the scale of a volcano. The depth, the size... it's just beyond what humans can do even if we did have a precise model of the internal structure (which we don't).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s been a lot of discussion about your question already, and I like it a lot, but I’d like to add one more thing; if you did successfully dig a large tunnel, an artificial lava tube underground, (which would necessitate an accurate model of the internal structure and a whole lot of luck that there’s nothing else in your way like a reservoir or an otherwise-harmless fault line) it would presumably be leading somewhere. If that’s to an arbitrary place in the middle of nowhere, okay, that’s nice, eventually you will end up with a little lava flow out in the desert, which could potentially become its own little volcano. If that’s in the ocean though, then you probably have some issues in the vein of disrupting animal habitats. Lava flow through a coral reef is no-good. Even if nothing too endangered lives there, you are still creating a massive hazard; undersea volcanoes are incredibly dangerous to surface ships for a plethora of reasons, like poisonous and superheated gases and such. Bottom line is that unless wherever lava goes, it’s probably going to displace something that’s living there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I guess it's pretty much environmental harm reduction and not elimination at that point. Lots of environmental impact reports on various candidate end sites. Plus it would involve basically creating Chunnel-like tunnels (possibly using the same equipment) as a precaution well before any danger, not at all unlike building a pressure value on a pressure cooker before you start using it it all. Lot of predicting, lots of heavy decisions to be made that would very much end an ecosystem at its destination.</p></div>		</li>
