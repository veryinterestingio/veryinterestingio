			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it also apply to reading and does one language extend to another? Growing up I've learned a couple languages at school (German/italian/Portuguese  from ages 6-18) at a very basic level, Spanish/English being my native tongues. I know Portuguese/italian/Spanish have Latin roots, which makes it somewhat easier to understand, but I don't know where I picked up the ability to read/understand French and other Germanic languages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would also apply to reading. Some native speakers are very good at speaking their language but are not able to read and write, as those are all separate skills. With reading in other languages, you might be noticing cognates which are words that look similar to words you already know, or the Latin roots like you are saying. Given a context, you would also be using your inferential language skills and your ability to use context clues to deduce the meaning of unknown words. Whenever you learn a new way to say a vocabulary word, whether it be through different verbal languages, through sign language, etc. you strengthen the pathway your brain uses to access that word to retrieve. I always think of it like a plant. If you know one way to say a word. You have one branch that comes off. But if you know more than one way to say a word and know synonyms and antonyms and other semantic features of the target word, then you have many more branches coming from that plant. You need to keep accessing that information through reading, listening, and conversation to keep the connection strong (i.e. use it or lose it) !</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person you asked, but let's consider that French is also a romance language (derived from the language the <em>Roman</em>s spoke [hence <em>Roman</em>ce language,]) Latin. Therefore, your rudimentary comprehension of French is understandable. </p>
<p>Secondly, we must also realize that English - at least in its infancy - was a bastardized combination of the contemporary German and French. As a result, English and German have a large number of cognates, or words that are of the same etymology, and have similar pronunciations and meanings between to languages.</p>
<p>Not knowing you personally, I would be inclined to assume that your understanding of German and French are basic and patchy. Basically, my guess is that, while listening to French, you hear the same sentence structures and basic vocabulary components as you're used to in Spanish. This leads to mutual commutativity, or a speaker of one language being able to understand a speaker of another, related language. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can read and got the pronunciation pretty tight, for Germanic atleast, I find French unattractive though but I can read it pretty aight. </p>
<p>I did know English is a bastard of Germanic and french, and french being a romantic language. </p>
<p>They're still all quite different though. </p></div>		</li>
