			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the cost explanation (as i was told by an optometrist): as i understand it almost everyone eventually needs reading glasses after a certain age, so the market is much much larger for a standardized item. For the near sighted, the differences are so great and each prescription has a relatively small market that itâ€™s not as cost effective for a company to create that en masse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presbyopia! One of the common symptoms of aging in humans is loss of elasticity of our tissues (i.e. skin sagging and wrinkles). Our eyes are not immune to this process (though some people experience fewer declines due to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors); the lens of the eye becomes less flexible with age. </p>
<p>The lens and the cornea are responsible for focusing light toward our retina so we can see properly; (assuming you have good vision and only start needing reading glasses with age) when we are focusing on far away objects, the lens relaxes. Conversely, when we are focusing on objects that are close to us (i.e. reading), the lens contracts. If the lense is less flexible, it does not contract as well, leading to difficulty seeing up close.</p>
<p>&quot;Reading glasses&quot; act as a substitute lens to refocus the light back toward the retina, which reduces the need for the lens of the eye to flex to be able to focus on close objects.</p>
<p>Our bodies and the science we use to overcome our physical limitations is <em>very cool</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, Iâ€™m ridiculously near-sighted (like 20/200). Will I still get presbyopia with age? Would that mean my far vision would get better or would I just not be able to see anything ever lol? Iâ€™m corrected to 20/20 with glasses/contacts, so would that mean I would need bifocals or would my prescription change altogether?</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the other, glasses cost peanuts to produce for all the non-wonky prescriptions. It's pre-programmed machinery.</p>
<p>Most of the cost of glasses is pure profit for the retailer and producer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. What about the costs of the optician grinding the lenses? Itâ€™s not pre-programmed machinery at all. Blanks (uncut lenses) have to be grinded, installed and assembled. </p>

<p>I've only ever been prescribed in steps of 0.25 and my understanding was that your eyes can vary by about that much from day to day so more accuracy is useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that variation is completely true.  I'm -9.0 diopters in both eyes and highly astigmatic.  On some days I cannot see worth a shit (literally can't see the aisle signs in a grocery stores) and other days I can spot a couple of deer in the woods a few acres away.  I'm not sure what causes the variation but it's pretty odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can't be true, light doesnt work like that. 0.05 diopters doesn't bend light enough to get you from 20/40 to 20/20, so for that to be true another factor would be at play. Could easily be that you meant 0.5 diopters, or something was miscommunicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you re talking about astigmatism axis, and the guy above was referring to lens power.</p>
<p>Im saying this because i was really disturbed, since the lens makers sell only in 0.25 steps (maybe 0.125, but i never saw).</p></div>		</li>
