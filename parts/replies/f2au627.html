<p>It is actually even <strong>harder</strong> than that.</p>
<p>Public transit cards like this are RFID cards  - the reader powers a small chip when the card is &quot;read&quot;.  The chip powers on and, using  one half of a public/private encryption key pair, sends the reader an encrypted message that can be deciphered by the other half of the key pair.  If the keys match, the reader can decode the message and get a validation; if not, then the decoded message is gibberish and not validated.</p>
<p>So, not only would you have to guess the card number, but you would <em>also</em> have to guess the encrypted data that card should produce - which is effectively impossible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Much harder. Even 128-bit encryption (which is still unbreakable but towards the lower end of strong encryption these days) has 3.402 x 10^38 possible keys. In comparison, the odds of winning the Mega Millions lottery is around 1 in 302.6 million, or 3.026 x 10^8.  </p>
<p>Assuming you, on average, guess the right key after going through about half of the possible keys, it still takes you going through 3.402 x 10^19 keys, still significantly more possible guesses than the odds of winning the lottery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually wouldn't be that easy.  If you intercepted the interaction, you would get the challenge from the reader and the response from the card, but part of the &quot;magic&quot; of public/private key encryption is that you can't reverse engineer the function that generated the response with just that.  You need the special function that decodes the response to its original challenge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All the card has on it is a number, when you purchase or use the card, it uses the number to find the account associated with the card and makes the update in the database, the card itself doesn't change.</p>

<p>There are many transit systems that store the data on-card. Of course, there's <em>also</em> a central database, and reconciling the records will make it clear that you fucked with your card and get it flagged (if you remembered to get a card that wasn't registered to you) so you'd still have to buy a new card every day.</p></div>		</li>
