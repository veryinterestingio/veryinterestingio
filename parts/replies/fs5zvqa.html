			<div class="markdown"><p>Both points here are correct, based on current understandings in evolutionary anthropology. It’s also interesting that owing to our difficulties in getting big baby heads out of bipedal pelvic openings, we’re the only primate (and mammal AFAIK) to be pretty much obligated to have social births. Most mammal females go off by themselves to have babies. For humans, it’s definitely possible for a woman to have a baby alone but it’s extremely difficult, dangerous, and never the norm in any known society. Trying to figure out when this pattern started in our lineage, and its implications for the evolution of human social behavior, has been a big area of research for decades.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is most likely the inverse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not 100% the case, many social primates give birth in the company of their social group.</p>
<p>In fact, a few years ago the sister species to the one I work with actually had <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141006-the-monkey-that-became-a-midwife" target="_blank">a recorded case of one monkey <em>assisting</em> with a difficult birth another one was having</a> - note, somewhat graphic photos in the article.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160414-the-monkeys-that-act-as-midwives" target="_blank">another case in a different species</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s very interesting and I had not seen those before. I think, however, that the reports highlight how exceptional those cases are. And even though many primates may not give birth in total solitude, they don’t usually require another primate to help get the baby out as far as I understand it. The point I’m referring to is that in contrast, humans pretty much <em>must</em> have hands-on assistance in actually getting the baby out. I’m an archaeologist/paleoanthropologist, not a real primatologist though, so please correct me if I’ve made any big errors here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But now I'm continually shocked to learn how much you get fucked up the ass with no lube by  the state <em>and you don't think anything is wrong</em>. Or at least don't actually do anything about it.</p>
<p>I mean I cannot even fucking comprehend paying 50k to give birth or 100k for being bitten by a snake . That would send me into some kind of mental depressive tailspin seeing my life plan and hard work go up in flames.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both these things are 100% true.  Additional food for thought: evolution doesn’t really “care” about pain.  Even though we have big heads and narrower birth canals, generally speaking so long as the species propagates, there’s no additional evolutionary “need” for humans to develop additional pain tolerance to better cope with the birthing process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. If child birth was so unimaginably painful women would only have one child. Evolution compensated by giving humans the ability to forgot the pain experienced. Most women who've given birth can tell that it was a horrible experience but can't remember exactly what the experience was like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not just a childbirth thing either. I can’t speak for men (or other women), but I’ve had a variety of painful things happen (gallbladder, kidney stones, unmedicated labour) and the details of all of them are fuzzy. I think it’s a general response to trauma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus because of the fact that its very dangerous to pass out of pain during birthgiving, they have a higher pain tolerance also, believe me or not.</p>
<p>Ths is different from like being-hit-on-your-face-pain.</p>
<p>But the higher pain tolerance is important to pass out less quick</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok but the entire labor hurts.  Not just the last part where you are pushing out the baby. </p>
<p>That part hurts too, but for most women there’s hours of waves of contractions ranging from mild to intense to get to that point. That’s the part that most women fear/ think of when giving birth.  When it’s time to push, it’s almost a relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pushing is definitely a relief, for me it was anyway. During labour it's like a marathon, when you get to pushing it's like finally seeing the finish line. In my case it allowed me to focus on something other than riding the waves of contractions.
One thing I did find helped was squatting into the contractions and swaying my hips. It lessened the intensity and made labouring more calm...until transition then it's all out crazy time. Lol</p></div>		</li>
