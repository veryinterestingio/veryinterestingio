			<div class="markdown"><p>The polar/grizzly is a great example. You could easily see how rapidly diminish polar bear habitat is forcing them more into contact with grizzlys and thus producing more interbreeding. It’s not a major reach to think, without intervention, the polar bear could eventually become extinct while leaving behind bits of their genetic lineage within the intergraded offspring.</p>
<p>They’re a great example of related but very divergent species that haven’t had enough time/space/pressure to become fully distinct species across all of the available species concepts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I remember what that means correctly, and I might not, doesn't that classification make them the same subspecies as modern humans?</p></div>		</li>
