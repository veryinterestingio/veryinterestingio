<p>So the answer to your question is perhaps that, photosynthesis is a trick that nature only stumbled across once (or a small number of times)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the interesting consequences of photosynthesis evolving ~2.5 billion years ago is that while it may have been efficient in its time, it is inefficient in ours. RuBisCo, the enzyme photosynthetic organisms use for carbon fixation, is very leaky and inefficient with the low CO2 we have today (comparatively low - humans are working to increase it). This makes the plants more susceptible to drought (when plants take in CO2, they lose water). If we could engineer a better version of RuBisCo and sub it in, <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a25749934/usda-university-illinois-photorespiration-rubisco-crop-growth/" target="_blank">we could see huge productivity gains and resistant to droughts</a>, which are likely to become more common due to climate change. Though this could also represent a dangerous new level of gene editing - if these plants got out, could they drive all others to extinction?</p>
<p>ELI5: Because we got photosynthesis once in 2.5 billion years, it has some problems. We might be able to fix them, but could also cause some new problems in the process. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Note to self: When engineering super plants stick exclusively to large plants where individuals are easy to distinguish and kill if need be. <em>Do</em>; make a super orange tree. <em>Do not</em>: make super lawn grass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Turns out many types of grass already use the more efficient C4 pathway so depending on which climate you're in, your lawn might <em>already</em> be super.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other interesting fact is that Chlorophyll is ill-suited to the current solar spectrum; the Sun emits most of the power in the 500-700nm wavelengths, but chlorophyll is very weak in absorbing those (&lt;25% of power is absorbed), while it's optimal for red/blue (&gt;75% peak absorbtion). </p>
<p>Pet theory: chlorophyll is optimal for planets around red dwarf stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun’s total solar emission isn’t as important as what gets through out atmosphere. The color of the sky is the big clue - blue light (~2.9 eV/450 nm)) scatters elastically with the most efficiency. It is this light which plants pick up, use the energy to split C from O2, and the fluoresce the residual of that light, which is green (~2.35 eV/525 nm). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see, it just seemed like a great passive ability to have.
Very few downsides to being a walking solar panel, even if you do need topping up from other life forms.
Thanks! I think you understood what I meant by my question best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it isn't. Photosynthesis isn't a &quot;passive&quot; ability. It requires a very special skin structure, capable of absorbing CO2, while not blocking sunlight - and it requires a huge amount of water as well.  </p>
<p>So you have to give up the thick skin, the ability to have fur, your body needs MUCH more energy to keep yourself warm, while hardly getting enough energy. 1m^2 skin could generate - assuming perfect conditions - around 86 calorie worth of sugar in an hour, which is a very low amount. Just the extra heating/water lost from the absorbed sunlight would use more energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is that photosynthesis only really works for sedentary or inactive animals with simple body designs, like for example sea slugs or jellyfish. For a more complex, active animal photosynthesis wouldn't provide anywhere near energy to sustain the animal, so it isn't much of an advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, the mitochondria that we have in our cells are thought to be originally like this as well: free, ATP-forming organisms that got swallowed by a bigger cell, but instead of being digested, over time they and the bigger cell became one. Mitochondria have their own DNA that is separate from the cell's nucleus, and if you destroy all of the mitochondria in a cell, the cell will be unable to make new ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, considering that photosynthesis by itself only denotes the ability to capture the energy of the light, it's not as hard to evolve as you might think. There're around 15 different groups of bacteria that can photosynthesize, and it is believed they each acquired it independently.</p>
<p>On the other hand, only cyanobacteria produce oxygen in the process, and that is the process that is believed to have arisen only once.</p>
<p>All in all, photosynthesis is not so hard for living creatures to develop, but oxygen producing photosynthesis is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you look at <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event" target="_blank">Great_Oxygenation_Event</a> the great big flat 3rd stage is when all the surface (air &amp; ocean)  deposits rusted. Literally: the rocks rusted. Everything that could react with free oxygen did so.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there's practically no large animals or plants until Stage 4, when oxygen started to peak.</p>
<p>My favorite toy theory is that there was non-carbon life on earth, but all the free oxygen eventually destroyed it...</p></div>		</li>
