			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck, I do this right now in college too. I never thought about it too much. I just noticed I felt better when I was fatigued and it was the only way for me to at least attempt and socialize. I'm literally doing it as we speak. Not sleeping for 2 days is pretty energizing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you may have depression. What you're describing, Anhedonia, is the primary symptom of depression, not sadness. Unfortunately it also makes everything feel pointless which makes it hard to get help. As someone who suffered from it for years, and known many people who have too, it is absolutely worth it to see a doctor and get help.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's limited NHS support for depression, I have phone therapy but it's shit and doesn't work. Just cbt they want to program how I respond to thoughts rather than the problems with environment and past that cause depression.</p>
<p>I have a sick parent who is very emotionally abusive, and so nice to anyone outside my family so that fucks with me a lot.</p></div>		</li>

Now that I'm all grown up and have a full time job which I should theoretically enjoy... I feel absolutely nothing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is not what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphoria" target="_blank">dysphoria</a> means. You're probably thinking of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy" target="_blank">apathy</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wtf, I had no idea that was a known phenomenon. I would often have a productive day after staying up all night. I wasn't very effective but things like cleaning and going outside felt much more doable. I always thought that it triggered some sort of hypomania.</p></div>		</li>
