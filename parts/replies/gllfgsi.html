<p>You'd need a tidally locked planet with a hole on the plane of th orbit but perpendicular to the direction of the orbit.</p>
<p>We'll also need to get rid of the moon.</p>
<p>I'll need a budget of $50 x 10^18.</p>
<p>I can reduce that by 30% of we can just do it on Mercury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can definitely be calculated by hand. Yes the gravity would be changing across the journey - but at a constant rate. Just as acceleration is the derivative of velocity and measures the change in velocity over time, jerk is the derivative of acceleration and measures the change in acceleration over time. Putting this all together would allow you to calculate the total time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think gravity would be changing at a constant rate. Since gravity depends on the radius, the radius on the velocity, the velocity on the gravity and the whole thing on the mass distribution there is a lot more to consider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can neglect friction, rotation, and air resistance, the time is the same (pretty much) no matter where you bore the hole, which makes sense, as through the Earth is through the Earth (assuming a spherical Earth, which we know isn't quite right).</p>
<p>The fun thing, which I learned from David Brin's novel &quot;Earth,&quot; is that it doesn't matter whether you go straight through the center of the planet-- the period of dropping the object down and waiting for its return ends up being about 84 minutes, <em>no matter the angle</em>.  (Again neglecting all those dampening forces.)  </p>
<p>And, 84 minutes is the orbital period of an object orbiting the planet somewhere close to sea level.  And as you abstract away the Earth's rotation, friction, air resistance, you realize that you've basically created an earth-sized empty space with an earth-mass black hole singularity at the center, and the ball you drop or kick or throw at any angle will orbit the singularity in 84 minutes.  You've basically re-created Newton's &quot;tower&quot; hypothesis in which an object is sent out, laterally, at various energies; at some of those energies, it falls towards Earth's center; at some higher levels of energy it will orbit the Earth without hitting it, and at higher energies still, the object will fly away from the Earth, never to return.    Only this time, the tower is extending from the black hole at the center of the Earth to, say, mean sea level, or thereabouts.  </p>
<p>The novel Earth, by the way, is about a group of scientists experimenting with artificial black holes and they lose containment, so one of theme drops into the core of the Earth and starts absorbing matter down there.  I found it to be a good read.</p></div>		</li>
