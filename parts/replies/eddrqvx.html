			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the responses on this thread have been a little too technical for me. But essentially, you're saying that a hotter object will emit a higher number of all wavelengths than a colder object, is that right? So if Object 1 is hotter than Object 2, then Object 1 will be emitting more infrared, more ultraviolet, more visible light, more radio waves, etc. than Object 2? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct. Any object above absolute zero in temperature will emit IR, but the range of IR is limited by that temperature. A hotter object is more energetic, so Object 1 will emit more IR at the frequencies common to it and Object 2 as well as the higher frequency given it's greater temperature. </p>
<p>I hope I didn't just make things more complicated.</p></div>		</li>
