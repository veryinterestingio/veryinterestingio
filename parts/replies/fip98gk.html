			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. Ultimately, the phone only has to <em>listen</em> for transmissions from the tower, not actually ask if there is any data for it - when any data comes it will be announced <em>to</em> the phone. If the phone misses the announcement for whatever reason, the tower will send it again next time it has a chance until it is received or the whole communication breaks down. And, to save battery, they agree on the exact times data will be sent, so the phone doesn't even have to be listening most of the time.</p>
<p>Once your phone falls off the network though, it has to repeatedly check to see if it sees any towers, and if it does it has to speak first to &quot;log in&quot; again and set up this entire communications scheme again. This is why sometimes having no coverage can drain your battery faster, and why having poor coverage that comes and goes is the worst case.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In many cases this is also because the phone is designed to increase or decrease its transmit power so that the signal it sends out is at the right power level for the tower.  This is not only typically deployed as an energy saving mechanism, but in cases like CDMA, it's required to prevent other phones from being drowned out.  </p>
<p>When not connected to any tower, the phone will transmit at a higher power level to see if it actually is in range of a tower, but just unable to reach it at lower power levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this, if you're using GPS, your phone's battery also drains significantly faster. Using GPS for location requires your phone's CPU to stay in a high-power active state (instead of sleeping for many cycles and then waking for one cycle).</p>
<p>If I'm driving and using my phone for directions but I need to conserve battery, I will turn off my navigation for a bit and start it up again when I need to know my next steps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the power of the transmission from your phone is managed depending on the distance to the nearest mast, if your phone is having the speak to a mast further away it will have to increase power to the transmitter, similarly if you are at the foot of a mast you'll use less power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What layers handle this? I'm guessing the turning radio off and on part happens below the TCP layer.</p>
<p>Also, doesn't TCP have this keep alive packet protocol or something? How does that work if the radio disconnects intermittently?</p></div>		</li>
