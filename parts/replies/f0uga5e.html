			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you understand what he's saying. It's perfectly reasonable, possible and could very easily be something that happened to him.  So yes, changing his number will fix the problem. It's not like these automatated spam callers are using literally every single phone number simultaneously. If he's getting 3 calls a day from randoms saying his number called, then his analysis of the situation is accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't quite correct. If there's even one bad actor company they can be used by all the people who want to set their own callerID. Basically it works by an honor system. So if a company blocks people from setting their own callerID (several actually do) then there will always be others that don't block it. </p>
<p>Also, the phone system is international. All you need is one telco company in one country to be a bad actor and that's the entrance for scammers. US Telco companies can't prevent Telco companies in other countries from allowing bad actors into the system by law.</p>
<p>CallerID is provided by the caller, not the receiver. This is unlike say encryption on the web where the identity of the site is verified by a third party certificate generation company/group like Let's Encrypt <a href="https://letsencrypt.org" target="_blank">https://letsencrypt.org</a></p>
<p>Edit: It looks like there's been recent progress in this this year. See: <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/call-authentication" target="_blank">https://www.fcc.gov/call-authentication</a> and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/at-t-comcast-successfully-test-shakenstir-protocol-for-fighting-robocalls/" target="_blank">https://www.zdnet.com/article/at-t-comcast-successfully-test-shakenstir-protocol-for-fighting-robocalls/</a> Spammers days are numbered.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Just because it has a caller-ID doesn't mean it's not spoofed. How does a Telco know that the callerID that's in the phone message they're receiving isn't spoofed?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No they can't because the VOIP company is foreign or the phone number is part of a shared pool of numbers owned by a VOIP company. For example, I can go to Twilio and get a phone number with any area code I want. Twilio blocks spoofing of the callerID when you send the phone call, but lots of similar companies don't. (If you get a phone call from the Democrat or Republican party, I almost guarantee it came from a Twilio owned number.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many legitimate reasons why a company would need to send a different caller ID than their own.   For example a company that does notifications for pharmacy refills.   They would need to send the caller Identification  of the pharmacy that filled the prescription not the sending companies number.   So that if the patient had a question they could talk to the pharmacist.  The real problem is that various companies are abusing this necessary feature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They don't know the location <em>because</em> they're monitoring.</p>
<p>But they're monitoring, <em>and</em> they know your location. </p>
<p>Do a little Googling. The federal government has installed taps on all the major service providers, but the service providers are legally forbidden from discussing it. The information passing through those taps includes data sufficient for determining very fined grained location. </p>
<p>Also, the NSA has data centers dedicated to archiving and mining all that data. </p>
<p>No, they're not watching you. HOWEVER,  in the event that they decide you're worth watching, they can go back and pull up enough historical data to be equivalent to have been watching you for the past few years.</p></div>		</li>
