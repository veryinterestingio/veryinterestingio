			<div class="markdown"><p>When i made the post, almost all the answers were either just wrong, like the guy who said mosquitos probably could transmit COVID-19 since they transmit other virus. Or they were right but with some misinformation about the biology of arbovirus in general. For exemple the first part of the current top comment is correct, but than they say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, they are an enveloped virus like Zika, so it is not totally inconceivable some coronavirus might be able to with a few choice mutations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would take a LOT more than just a few choice mutations for this virus to become vector borne, it would take all the things i mentioned in my comment.</p>
<p>There also some people talking about mosquitos injecting blood from one host into another, wich doesn't happen at all.
And finally many were basically claiming that the insects could act as a mechanical vector, but the chances of that happening are so small they can be considered insignificant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can it physically pick up the virus from a surface and transfer it to where it lands? Or other insects like flies and all. Can they carry the virus not inside, but on thier body for a small amount of time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>House flys are considered mechanical vectors of pathogens because they are attracted to thing like feces, and things like your food. This makes them act as mechanical vectors, they land somewhere full of pathogens, than phycally carry those pathogens to your food. </p>
<p>Mosquitos don't have this behavior, they are not attracted to places where there will be pathogens, and they are not attracted to places where things they pick up will be able to enter the host.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is inaccurate. A virus does not need active replication within the mosquito for transmission. If there is sufficient viral load in the mosquito then the virus can be transmitted without replication. Most viruses would not persist long enough in the mosquito without replication, but it it not required. </p>
<p>That being said COVID19 is not systemic in human circulation so unlikely to be acquired by the mosquito nor is it really transmissible in blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No... It's not ineccurate to say that COVID-19 is not transmitted through mosquitos and for that to happen it would first need to replicate inside it. </p>
<p>I've already explained why and other users in this thread, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ishimoto731" target="_blank">u/ishimoto731</a> also explained.</p>
<p>But here we go again. The possibility of a mosquito somehow adquiring a sufficient viral load and than somehow delivering the load to another host is so incredbly small that it can be considered insignificant (and that it has never happend nor it will ever happen).
Insignificant forms of transmition are NOT considered forms of transmition... If we considered every single remote, theoretically possible form of transmition, every infectious diseases would have litteraly hundreds of thousands of forms of transmition.</p>
<p>So yes, for a virus to be mosquito  transmitted it absolutly needs to replicate inside and than find a way to reliably reach the other host from the mosquito. All other mechanical ways that a mosquito can carry the virus from one host to another are so rare, they can be considered non existent.</p>
<p>And honestly people answering the main question or &quot;correcting&quot; other people should know this basic part of epidemiology...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never said it was inaccurate to say COVID19 is not transmitted by mosquitoes. It is inaccurate to say any viral disease must replicate in the mosquito to be transmissible. There are several viral diseases requiring less than 5 virions for infection. It is unlikely, but possible.</p></div>		</li>
