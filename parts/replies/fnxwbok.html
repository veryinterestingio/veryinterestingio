<p>Yup. One of the main reasons COVID is so incredibly contagious is that it IS mild so long as it stays in the upper respiratory tract. So people run around spreading it to others with little to no symptoms and don't even realize they're sick. It's only when it spreads down into the lungs that it causes viral pneumonia and becomes dangerous, but that means days of being contagious with no obvious symptoms. In a lot of cases that doesn't happen at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The quote from the NYT was merely trying to illustrate that viruses evolve to become less deadly, and more asymptomatic to reach more hosts. Not vice versa. The exact virology of COVID-19 isnâ€™t necessarily conducive to existing in a seasonal state like the flu, but it will evolve to become less deadly as time goes on.</p>

<p>No guarantee of that happening, though. Evolution does not work on neatly separated traits, it works on mutations which have multiple effects. </p>
<p>E.g. a mutation can simultaneously increase the viral load, decrease the minimum infectious dose, and decrease your probability of survival. </p>
<p>Decreasing the probability of survival from 99% to 98% is twice the mortality rate, but only 1% difference for the virus. Other effects of that mutation can make up for it.</p>
<p>In case of flu, it has a very short incubation period, little asymptomatic spread, etc. Plus the 1918 flu was far more deadly than COVID-19 , with correspondingly higher impact of non survival.</p>
<p>For an example of that evolution not happening, consider smallpox, which remained highly deadly. It was ultimately eradicated by deliberately spreading a similar virus, vaccinia, which rarely spreads between people naturally (so it was administered as a vaccine, in early days &quot;arm to arm&quot;, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccinia#History" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccinia#History</a> ). An earlier practice, variolation, used scabs from mild cases and may have resulted in selection of a less deadly strain, but not one that would spread naturally. Of course, smallpox is a very different virus with a very large DNA genome, so its not clear how much you can generalize from that other than to note that such evolution is not guaranteed.</p></div>		</li>
