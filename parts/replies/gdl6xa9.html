<p>Wait what. 2.8MJ is 668.769kcal. I'm pretty sure I'm missing something but how'd you get that much? Did you mean mJ?</p></div>		</li>

<p>A mole of glucose is about 180 g, which is roughly 700ish calories... seems about right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that sounds about right.  That reaction is for 1 mole of glucose, which is 180 grams of glucose.  We usually say sugar is 4 calories per gram which would suggest 720 calories.  (And that 4 is undoubtedly an estimate.)</p></div>		</li>
