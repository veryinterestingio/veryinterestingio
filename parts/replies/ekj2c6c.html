			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep I was part of the first occupants in a building where they retrofit an employee cafeteria. It turns out the sewer vent for the cafeteria was too close to the roof HVAC intakes. Normally this wasn't a problem, except when the wind direction and the steam coming from all the hot water being used to wash the dishes was just right.</p>
<p>Nice office smelling of hot steamy sewer gases, I always wondered what kind of Mickey mouse fix they came up with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, that reminds me of the time I worked at a subway inside of a hospital that was remodeling exterior walls and a raccoon snuck in and died in our ceiling and the liquids and maggots rotted through the tile and fell down on the walk in. Oh God the smell. 2 weeks after that another raccoon hissed at our opener and ran down the hospital hallway at 5am. I really wonder why we were still serving food to sick people in a hospital with all of that grossness going on.</p></div>		</li>
