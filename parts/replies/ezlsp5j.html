<p>This isn't really as important as civilians think it is. Quite the contrary, when the shit is hitting the fan and situations get chaotic, the very last thing you want is a squad of mindless obedient morons who don't know what to do until told. Good soldiers do follow lawful orders, because this is how effective coordinated units of people doing anything works; but they also need to be able to keep situational awareness and respond quickly to extenuating circumstances that their orders did not anticipate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much that they're looking for mindless drones, it's more like if your sergeant tells you to get down, the half second difference between acting immediately and taking a moment to think about it is all it takes for an enemy bullet to give your brain some ventilation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I'm pulling this out of a dead brain cell, but I read somewhere that marching is a tremendous empathy-building exercise. Somehow, simply moving in step with others syncs you up psychologically. It's similar to how improv groups do exercises that get them in sync to the point where it seems like they can read each others' minds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as someone who's actually done it, I can confirm this. It also teaches you how to actively use your peripheral vision to observe movement around you, namely that of other troops. You aren't allowed to look around while marching, and you have to stay in sync with everyone else. Falling out of rhythm can mess things up, and even cause someone to trip</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an experience like this at a night club in London back in 1996. I was an exchange student, and &quot;didn't know how to dance&quot;, but since I was halfway around the world, I figured &quot;what the hell.&quot;</p>
<p>Once I &quot;lost myself to the rhythm&quot; (sounds corny, I know, but it's true), then the entire dance floor became one body, one organism (myself included), all moving in synchronicity with the music. It was transcendent. I understood then how people could get caught up in rave culture.</p></div>		</li>
