			<div class="markdown"><p>Theyâ€™re definitely different chemically. They make special sharpies that are solvent and temperature resistant. The industrial sharpies are good on surfaces up to 500F and are more resistant to organic solvents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The industrial sharpies I get the chance to use have the incredible ability to writte poorly on every surface. Brick/cardoard/paper, tip is too dry and doesn't writte properly, metals and plastics, ink just wipes off.</p>
<p>Now I use &quot;industrial pencils&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting thing about regular inks and sharpie-esque permanent inks:</p>
<p>Most regular inks are mostly water soluble... Sharpie combines a water soluble ink AND an alcohol soluble ink. So that it doesnt wipe away or degrade with the water just hanging around in the air... You can try it by drawing on yourself with sharpie... Try to wash it off, and it will only &quot;half disappear&quot; youre still left with a greyish mark. Then use rubbing alcohol to remove the other half.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sharpee (permanent) wipes off our whiteboard, if we paint over it with erasable black first. Interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whiteboard markers have quick drying solvents - Isopropanol and alcohol. This keeps the resin, polymer, and dye liquid until it dries out into a rubbery film.</p>
<p>Coincidentally permanent markers also these dissolve dye in the same quickly drying solvents isopropanol and alcohol. </p>
<p>Writing over permanent marker re-dissolves the dye, and the rubbery polymer suspends the dye along with it's own colors. </p>
<p>If you ever want to get &quot;non-washable&quot; aka &quot;permanent&quot; dye out of something, blot with alcohol. It's not water soluble, but it's alcohol soluble.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sharpies are excellent for whiteboards - especially when you want to make a template and fill in variable info with dry erase. </p>
<p>Want to delete all? Rubbing alcohol for the win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The marker you're using to erase with has solvents in the ink before it dries.</p>
<p>It would be much cheaper to use rubbing alcohol to erase it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is usually an alcohol in the mix as well to make the ink/resin mixture liquid. This is why the markers smells like cheap vodka. If the alcohol dries both the polymer and the ink is a solid and you will have a hard time wiping it off. However you can apply more alcohol. They sell spray bottles for this or you can write over it with a fresh marker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I do that as well when I accidently use a permanent market on a whiteboard. So this doesn't explain how it works like what the OP said. Since the permanent marker already settle on the surface (with no polymer) so how come over writing it with a non-permanent marker suddenly allows us to rub off that permanent ink.</p></div>		</li>
