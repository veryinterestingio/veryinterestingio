<p>It's thought to activate regions of the brain that have decreased activity in depression.  </p>

<p>&quot;Thought&quot;, &quot;isn't completely understood&quot;, &quot;appears to&quot;. Honestly, this language doesn't feel trustworthy. It's been <em>observed</em> to sometimes work, but there's no understanding or evidence of why and how. Most of all, if it does stimulate neurons, seemingly in a positive way, how can we tell it doesn't so negatively in different patients and scenarios? I can't help but be very skeptical.</p></div>		</li>
