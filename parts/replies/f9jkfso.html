<p><strong>edit:</strong> nvm</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no muscles that stretch the cornea (as far as I can tell) which accounts for 65-75% of your eye's focusing power. The cornea is also where an astigmatism (misshaped cornea) lives so you cannot fix an astigmatism by doing eye exercises.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This post is wrong in multiple important ways. First, astigmatism is warping of the cornea (clear bit at the very front) <strong>E: or lens</strong>. If the eye is too oblong, that makes you myopic (near-sighted) and if it's too oblate you're hyperopic (far-sighted). If the lens is too stiff, that's presbyopia, what many aging people need reading glasses for. The muscles of the iris change the amount of light getting in, but they don't focus. The focusing is done by the ciliary muscles, which sit behind the iris.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the iris and ciliary body are essentially the same thing bc they're continuous.  It's all uvea.  Yes, there is a separate muscle for dilation and another for constriction but they do work in concert with the ciliary muscle, so I don't think it's wrong to say that essentially the iris helps autofocus in non-presbyopic eyes.   I usually tell patients that &quot;a muscle behind the iris&quot; does this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did the doctor recommend eye patches? They would cover your right eye, forcing you to use the left. I'm not sure if you are old enough to be on Reddit, if they help people older than kids. Worth an ask though. You're lucky that your brain hasn't shut off communications with that eye, because that happens a lot when one eye wants to do its own blurry thing. Good luck, internet stranger with a matching blurry left eye like me!</p></div>		</li>
