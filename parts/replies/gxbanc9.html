<p>If they get to a point where they know which genes are safe to pick from elephant that will work on mammoth, by that time they'd even be able to have a vaccine for all kinds of flu.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>see, I was thinking that while I was writing that, and I don't think that was the way it was originally explained, I don't think it was splicing individual parts of the DNA together, like they said in Jurassic Park, I think it was just like what happens during conception so they were thinking of trying to just &quot;crossbreed&quot; the dead mammoth with a living elephant, not to stitch back together missing pieces</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not always possible to bring back extinct species via cloning in the absence of any genome editing. I highly recommend the 2015 book <em>How to Clone a Mammoth</em> by Beth Shapiro, which explains the idea of using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to modify the DNA of the elephant genome so that it contains selected genes that confer the key characteristics of mammoths. I have not read all of this book, but I think that it is a great resource that may address the issue of the risks of inbreeding within initially small populations of previously extinct species. Interestingly, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/11/world/woolly-mammoth-mutations-scn/index.html" target="_blank">last living mammoths</a> may have become extinct due to inbreeding, so it is a concern worth thinking about. Some extinct species may be better candidates than others for de-extinction; there are a number of issues (are cells preserved? can the DNA sequence be obtained even if no intact cells remain?). <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/these-are-extinct-animals-we-can-should-resurrect-180954955/" target="_blank">Smithsonian magazine</a> mentions the idea of using genome-editing techniques to re-engineer lost genetic diversity into living populations of endangered species; this method would require DNA sequences from multiple specimens.</p></div>		</li>
