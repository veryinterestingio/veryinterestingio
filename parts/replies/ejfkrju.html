			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree with this. I'm an aerospace engineer, and although I agree with other posts about increased wetted area and reduced power requirements, its very doubtful butterflies evolved with this is mind... Morseo, like other animal traits, the larger the wings, the larger the billboard to advertise whatever they intend to share with the world (predators, mates, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The video mentions that even though a butterfly can still fly with only half of its wing intact, having really big wings allows for an advantageous way of avoiding predators in flight. The wings can act like a rudder and pull off difficult turns to avoid predators, and the body can contract making the wings flap with an unusual figure-8 pattern making it difficult for predators to predict the butterfly's next move.</p></div>		</li>
