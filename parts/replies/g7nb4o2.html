			<div class="markdown"><p>The equations are expected to work down to the Planck mass. If lighter black holes can exist then they need extra dimensions (or something even more exotic). In that case the light black holes are larger (potentially many orders of magnitude larger) than these formulas predict.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which theoretical tiny black holes do you mean? Small black holes have been proposed in several contexts. Some speculative particle physics theories predict that gravity gets stronger than normal at very small scales, making black hole formation accessible to particle accelerators. I think that's what u/mfb- is thinking of in his answer. But people have also proposed asteroid-mass black holes as an exotic dark matter candidate. These would be completely normal black holes (no extra dimensions etc. needed) aside from their mass being much too small to have been formed via the normal mechanism of a big star collapsing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the proposed dark matter candidate black holes might be asteroid mass? </p>
<p>That's interesting. Though I suppose it's all still a mystery. </p>
<p>You know, the other day I saw an old episode of tales from tomorrow, that old retro sci fi show. During the intro to one of the episodes, they had a TV scientist from the 50s rattling off a few fake facts like venus being 25 billion miles away. I checked after he said that and found that the actual distance isn't even close to that. </p>
<p>It reminded me that sometimes theories are close and sometimes they're far off. I wonder which way this dark matter black hole theory will go. Will it seem silly down the road? Or is it hauntingly close to the truth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say the mass is all &quot;in the singularity&quot;, are you referring to it existing at (near) the r=0 position, i.e. being roughly in the center of the spherical shell described by the event horizon (or whatever it means to exist within the event horizon)? If so, how is this known or suspected to be true when this exists, by definition, on the other side of the event horizon? Are there data from measuring black holes that imply this distribution over (non-but-not-pointlike-)uniform density inside the event horizon or the mass existing on the horizon or some other distribution I can't think of?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything on the inside of the event horizon can't be measured and is purely based on theory. We are relatively confident in the general picture of what's going on inside a black hole because the curvature of space isn't dramatically different just on the inside of the horizon than it is just outside it, and gravitational waves from merging black holes have let us measure the properties gravity just outside the horizon directly.</p>
<p>However, this confidence evaporates as we approach the center of the black hole, where general relativity breaks down. I don't think anybody who works with this thinks there's really a singularity in the center. Instead it's believed that unknown quantum gravity effects will take over and prevent the formation of a singularity.</p>
<p>Any mass distribution is possible inside a black hole, but only very temporarily. According to general relativity they must all very quickly[*] collapse info a singularity, leaving almost everywhere inside the black hole empty.</p>
<p>[*]: One has to be a bit careful when talking about time inside a black hole, as there isn't any unambiguous way to synchronize clocks inside and outside a black hole. But any piece of matter inside a black hole will by its own clocks very quickly find itself squashed into the center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only took one GR course and it was some time ago (and not my focus), so thank you and please bear with me vis-a-vis being blatantly wrong about how it or reality near black holes works and keep in mind I'm legitimately asking for clarification, not asserting you are incorrect. It's also possible that some of all of my questions come down to simple semantics.</p>
<p>My point was your first sentence. I was responding to the assertion about where (inside of the event horizon (?)) The mass exists. We have measurements on this side of the event horizon, which is fine since it's on the outside, but you state &quot;the curvature of space isn't dramatically different just on the inside of the horizon than it is just outside it....&quot; Do we know this? How and based on what data? Is it impossible for the event horizon to harbor a discontinuity of some sort and/or be a boundary at which the character of space's curvature changes drastically? I remember talking about different models about what goes on inside of black holes, but if GR as-stated is not valid inside of the event horizon, or we are applying it incorrectly, then we don't necessarily know that, for example, the mass collapses towards the center. That's why I was asking if we had any data or knowledge at all about what's going on inside of a black hole, vs. very strong suspicion based on theory that has worked outside of it.</p></div>		</li>
