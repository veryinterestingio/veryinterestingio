			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, BTW, that's not to say if this happens to you, that you have Autism or OCD .... it's supposed to be something that most people experience, but scientists study the extreme cases in order to understand the basic mechanism (EG, why they study brain injuries from car accidents)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my goodness, yes.  The repetition of OCD is maddening.  For me, though, I have to do something physical with the sounds as well.  For instance, sometimes I tap my left foot to the &quot;high sounding&quot; syllables and my right to the &quot;low sounding&quot; ones as I repeat the phrase over and over.  Or sometimes I have to pretend to type the words with my fingers, even though there is no keyboard.  And I can't stop.  All the medication and talk therapy and self-help books over the span of years could not make me stop.  It makes me feel crazy, but I feel crazier if I don't do it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>can't complete the task   </p>

<p>Is this why if I just say the shit out loud or even write it down that it helps that 'clears' those repetitive thoughts out of my brain? Because I have in someway 'completed' it then? I find both things to be helpful when I have thoughts things stuck 9n my head or thoughts that won't quiet. Within an hour or two of saying or writing the thing I'll notice that it's gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, yes.</p>
<p>When you are facing a thinking issue, changing the mode of thought often helps 'work out the kinks' neurologically.  In other words, when one part of your brain can't solve a problem, you can ask another part of your brain to do it.  </p>
<p>Example: when you are stumped by something (logic centers) and you go to ask someone for help, but as soon as you SAY the problem (verbal centers) you suddenly realize the answer.  Your verbal pathways have provided a &quot;work around&quot; to the circumvent the logical holdup.</p>
<p>Now, I say &quot;in a way&quot; because I am not aware of any literature to this effect, but it stands to reason based on what I have read in the context pedagogy (IE, strategies to help students with different learning styles reach the same education outcomes as the rest of their cohort).</p>
<p>I assume the same principle can apply to issues of &quot;incomplete tasks&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
