			<div class="markdown"><p>Rate limiting step is 100% protein folding. In general mRNA translation occurs at an essentially constant rate, while protein folding is a dynamic process that is subject to many things such as salt/buffer concentration, temperature, pH, to list a few. Some proteins fold really quick and really well, while others literally cannot fold on their own and require many different chaperones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I study protein synthesis and no, protein synthesis does not occur at a constant rate. Plus, many proteins get folded as they are being produced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are talking about is antibodies- where structure is needed to be maintained for an antibody to bind. For T cells it don't matter. T cell epitopes are linear.  In fact unfolded proteins produce better T cell responses... :)</p>
<p>And yes, you need both for an effective immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I must admit immunology is not my strong suit, but I was under the impression that a Th2 response would be better since that is the response that produces neutralizing antibodies, while T cells are more Th1 response. But like I said, I'm not sure and feel free to correct me.</p></div>		</li>
