			<div class="markdown"><p>Most whales would defend themselves with their biggest muscles - their caudal peduncle (the big thick tail end) which would give a predator like an orca or a tiger shark a massive whack. Humpbacks have massive pectoral fins, the biggest forelimbs on the planet and these are used for defence. When defending their young from predators many whales will lift them out of the water on their backs to keep them out of reach of attackers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to Tom's comments, I would add that sperm whales and dolphins are known for ramming their heads into offenders, like sharks (dolphins) or ships (sperm whales).  It reminds me of their close relatives the artiodactyls.  Many of them have horns or antlers that they use when butting heads during fighting.</p></div>		</li>
