			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to be a point, and there are some workable theories that say it wasn't. It's just generally accepted to be a point because that's what you ultimately get when you take the universe's current trend of expansion and run the clock backwards. </p>
<p>However, calling it a &quot;point&quot; is misleading. They don't literally mean a tiny little ball. The universe isn't within some other space for it to expand into. By &quot;point&quot; they just mean that any given region within our universe was once in an infinitely dense state. But the amount of space within the universe was always the same - an infinite amount, by the current leading theories. Space was infinitely dense <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p>So the alternative to a &quot;point&quot;, or infinitely dense state, would be a less-than-infinitely dense state. This would have some implications as to what, if anything, came before our &quot;time zero&quot;. We <del>will never</del> probably won't be able to see beyond the cosmic microwave background to &quot;time zero&quot;, so whichever theory is correct will have to be proven by indirect methods - if it's ever proven at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How does this relate, if at all, to our understanding of black holes? If the state was infinitely dense, how did it &quot;bang&quot; outwards?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it that we won't be able to see beyond the CMB epoch with the electromagnetic spectrum, or at all? Because I would feel that if we could resolve neutrinos better we could potentially see back to the electroweak unification epoch, considerably earlier. This is not considering being able to resolve gravitational radiation too, which could potentially go much much further towards time zero.</p>
<p>Granted, there're probably hard limits on how well we'll be able to sense neutrinos and gravitational radiation at our civilization scale anyway so...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, that will come down to semantics and relative size. 'Point' is a qualitative word which, at cosmic scale, has no meaning.</p>
<p>Think of it this way - to you, a period mark made with a pencil is a finite 'point'. To some organisms, it's a life-size coordinate; to others it's an entire region of graphite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great info. What about cosmic inflation during the early universe? I understand the hubble constant and expansion, but early inflation I need some insight. Is it tied to the structure of the universe and cmb?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflation is proposed as a tidy solution that fixes multiple different problems with a single event.</p>
<p>One problem is the homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation. Basically, any material is going to have slight variations in temperature and density throughout it. If you look at two points within an object that are really really close together, they probably have almost exactly the same temperature. But if you look at two objects that are really far apart from each other, they could have any random temperature, because the objects have nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>When we look at opposite sides of the sky, we can see the cosmic microwave background on both sides, as the final &quot;surface&quot; of the early hot dense universe. We see it's extremely uniform on all sides of the sky. For things to be that uniform, they must have come from a very very small region, so close that the whole region was basically the same temperature. The normal expansion of the universe isn't fast enough for the observable universe to have expanded from such a small region, but if you had some extra expansion in the very early universe, then you can make it work.</p>
<p>Similarly, the universe appears to be very large, and very flat. This seems awfully convenient. However, if you had extremely rapid expansion in the early universe, then that would make the universe huge and flat - all the curvature would be stretched out until it's unobservable.</p>
<p>It also explains why there's no magnetic monopoles. There may have been some in the universe, but the universe expanded so rapidly that they are very rare.</p>
<p>But there is still room to critique inflation. It's a really good theory, and lots of its specific predictions have been confirmed. But it's not quite as blatantly obvious from the evidence as the general picture of galaxy evolution in an expanding universe, and there is a reasonable minority of scientists who can push for alternate explanations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have never understood that argument. Why can the uniform temperature not be explained by all matter in the early universe having come through the same process from the same origin?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do we have any direct evidence of it at all? BICEP2 didn't pan out after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info. It definitely helped me. </p>
<p>But what about dark energy and how they/some determined the universe started expanding again say 5 billion years ago. From my understanding the cmb light was emitted like 42 million light years from us, but expanding space and time obviously has it red shifted and we pick it up 46 billion light years from us now. </p>
<p>Are they competing theories that I have intermingled? Do we need both for the model to work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We all need some insight into early inflation, all we have for it is the overall uniformity of the CMB and the rest is some well-informed speculation from extrapolating the properties of the current expansion of the universe. We have quite a bit of math which could describe inflation but as of yet we don't have a good way of knowing how &quot;true&quot; it is.</p></div>		</li>
