			<div class="markdown"><p>One pill per day has been standard for over a decade now and there are several multi-drug, single pill options. These meds also cause far fewer side effects than HIV meds in the late 90s and early 00s. The meds also block transmission to others. I've been working in HIV for 30 years, and it's amazing how much closer we have come to a cure with meds. It's not a cure, but you can't get much easier than 1 pill per day without major side effects, no storage impediments, no food restrictions, etc. But indeed they are working on making it that much easier by exploring monthly or even less frequent injections which will supplant the need for daily pills.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've since had cancer. And I worry constantly that I will get it again/fall out of remission.</p>
<p>HIV is a manageable disease, like diabetes or hypertension.  Sure, there are risks.  But it's not an unpredictable monster like cancer. #ripchadwickboseman</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d much rather have HIV than diabetes. I take a pill at night for HIV. And I’m supposed to go to the doctor for labs every six months. That’s about it.
For diabetes, you have to be very careful about what you eat, how much you exercise, and there’s horrible side effects like amputations and neuropathy if you don’t.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not just theoretical; it happened before. There is evidence that HIV has entered human populations in the past and...died out. </p>
<p>Realistically, it was HIV entering the human populations when it did that was the problem. At no time in human history were so many people literally sharing blood through IV injection; an epidemic unto itself. One caused entirely by bad public policy. </p>
<p>Realistically, we can blame Norman Rockefeller and his persecution of drug users that was used as a model around the world for AIDS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly--far, far more people would die from the bone marrow transplant than would die from being HIV+. HIV+ people have similar life expectancy as the general population (assuming access to diagnosis and retroviral treatment.) Obviously that leaves many in developing countries with a less favorable prognosis, but it's not like anybody who can't get the cheap ART pills will be able to get a million dollar BMT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just an off-hand comment, I don't think the average person realizes how traumatic some of the surgical procedures we can perform are - for example, I've had my hands re-attached, and it's not like this &quot;precise elegant procedure&quot; you'd imagine - it's literally a surgeon and an assistant using their full body weight to try and move a bone into the right place while things are popping and snapping and blood is going everywhere - a lot of surgeries are messy, risky, complicated things - anesthesia alone can kill people before you even get into the potential of infection.</p>
<p>Killing off someone's existing bone marrow and then doing a bone marrow transplant is not something you'd remotely attempt unless the alternative was 100% that person dying. The goal of most medical surgeries is to get a person back to an acceptable level of function, and if a person is already functional (HIV controlled via medication) you wouldn't just start doing procedures to try and make them &quot;even better&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Getting a bone marrow transplant is literally one of the most painful and dangerous procedures you can do. </p>
<p>Bone pain is consistently ranked one of the most painful experiences you can have, and you must <em>kill off all your marrow with radiation</em> before the transplant. You're talking weeks of one of the most painful things someone can experience, and then on top of it you have a 50% chance of serious complications and death. Not just from graft v host, but also getting sick while you have no immune system to fight (your immune system is largely based in your marrow). </p>
<p>...And then graft v host is a nightmare in and of itself (think skin so sensitive it blisters and peels from the mildest cleaning).</p>
<p>It's extremely dangerous and painful. It's NOT to be undertaken lightly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a BMT and didn't have pain in the bones. The initial radiation and transplant itself wasn't even painful and pretty anti-climatic.</p>
<p>It was was a few days later where the painful side effects of the radiation started, but I was on so many pain killers at that time that it wasn't an issue. Maybe I just didn't remember it.</p>
<p>Everything else sucked about it though on top of the risk of serious complications and death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had my collarbone fixed two years after letting it form some giant blob of pseudojoint.  The surgeon said he had to have two male nurses pull the muscle upward (from being so short/tight for so long) while he put the screws in.  Sounds like the way I would install a baseboard or something...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dislocated my shoulder and the first emergency center wouldn't relocate it due to it possibly being broken and transferred me to another hospital, that hospital needed extra x-rays and then didn't have any orthopedic people on site to set it, so it was basically dislocated for several hours or so before they set it. After a few hours at the second place they finally decided to try and relocate it and failed. They knocked me partially out with some pink IV goo, but as I was going out, they basically had like 3 people pushing and pulling on me to relocate it. They finally got an ortho guy a few hours later to help set it but it was still a few large nurses helping and again they started up before I was totally out, so I know it was a pretty rough procedure.</p></div>		</li>
