			<div class="markdown"><p>so estrogen causes increased cell reproduction which results in an increased possibility of cancerous mutations. i assume that's also the reason why breast cancer is more prevalent in women than men</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And there are also breast cancers that are not susceptible to hormonal influences.</p>
<p>I myself was diagnosed with tripled negative breast cancer which means it is not fueled by the hormones estrogen and progesterone, or by the HER2 protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  Cells divide and copy all the time. Random mutations will happen.</p>
<p>When I was diagnosed they tested me for the BRCa2 gene (and a couple of others that are less well known).</p>
<p>When it came back negative I was kinda bummed.</p>
<p>Doctors were telling me I didn't get cancer because I smoked, I didn't get it because I was obese or drank alcohol...and now it wasnt genetic.  I wanted a reason.</p>
<p>The geneticist actually said to me &quot;it's just pure bad luck&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, a lot of cancers are like that! Most of the triple negative breast tumors are caused by random mutations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine this....</p>
<p>For a cell to divide the DNa needs to be copied.</p>
<p><a href="http://bio4.us/biotrends/human_genome_height.html" target="_blank">Everytime a single cell in your body copies itself, it must type out on A4 paper, a 3 and a haf FEET tall stack or pages of GTAC.... over and over again in a very specific order and combination.</a></p>
<p>A mistake is bound to happen.</p>
<p>These mistakes are the mutations.   Some mutations are harmless.... like my black hair getting a few greys, or my brother going bald.</p>
<p>And sometimes those mutations cause cells to be harmful... boom cancer.</p>
<p>Cancer cells are faster growing... the divide more, they think its a free ride and can spread around the body... the hop a ride in your lymphatic system... so you might find some in your lymphnodes, I'f they keep going, cells from one part of your body end up in other parts they have no business being in.... that's when shit gets really serious.</p>
<p>Now, we know some mutations can be harmless.<br />
Some mutations are not totally harmless, but not cancer either... so if you hear of benign tumours.... this where a mutation had gone wrong, but not wrong enough to be considered cancer.  So like, the cells have no business being there, but they kinda just made a home where they were created and didn't jump on the bus to elsewhere.  These mutations aren't necessarily all that obvious under a microscope.</p>
<p>I remember when my oncologist told me mine was grade 3.  I freaked out.  Right?  We know stage 4 is terminal... I was close right?
Turns out grade is simply how obvious was it that the cells were cancerous under the microscope.   Mine where apparently evil looking little fuckers.</p>
<p>Sorry... I got carried away!</p></div>		</li>
