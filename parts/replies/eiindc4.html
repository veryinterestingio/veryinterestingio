			<div class="markdown"><p>Transport Engineer here. A lot of comments are about flying conditions and planes in general, but one of the main reasons for delays is the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/" target="_blank">FAA</a>'s &quot;ground delay&quot; requirements during bad weather as a result of the spacing out you mention.</p>
<p>To answer /u/Mr_Gimenez question more directly from a &quot;ground delay&quot; perspective rather than mechanical/flying perspective:</p>
<p>Depending on the extent of ground delay that the FAA enforces, the &quot;landing slots&quot; will get reduced (that is, if you can land 100 planes a day, now you can land only 90). This reduction from 100 to 90 is why you see a 10% worth of cancellations rather than 100%.</p>
<p>ELI5: 100 planes could land in an airport, but now because of bad weather, only 90 can to be extra-careful (kind of how you drive slower in the rain).</p>
<hr />
<p>Some less ELI5 tidbits: ground delay is often applied before departure, so next time you board a plane and get grounded for an hour in sunny LA and start fuming about how horrible the airline is, it's most likely because it's snowing in Chicago and there isn't a landing slot available for your flight.</p>
<p>Landing slots are redistributed according to a compressed schedule managed by FAA, but also priority always goes to planes queued in the air (circling above an airport), so even if that LA's flight was coming up and some plane arrived the in-the-air-queue, the grounded flight just lost its slot and has to wait for another.</p>
<p>Ideally, while a small air-queue is desired (to keep using the runway capacity during low supply), it generally planned in a manner to not take away slots from grounded planes. However, the weather can change drastically and unpredictably sometimes, leading to increased ground delays and complications. Think about it, you can leave Abu Dhabi while it's sunny in New York and arrive the next day in an on-going storm and find yourself in an air-queue.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That means some will have to be cancelled to help avoid a domino effect of delays.</p>

<p>Who decides which specific flights need to be cancelled?</p></div>		</li>

They have <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/weather/video/American-Airlines-Integrated-Operations-Center-Fort-Worth_Dallas-Fort-Worth-416721673.html" target="_blank">fancy operations centers</a> where they monitor what's happening everywhere and make decisions like this.</p></div>		</li>
