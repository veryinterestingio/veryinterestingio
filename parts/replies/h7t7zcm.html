			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. You'd need some sort of shading mechanism to regulate plant growth. But other than that all other things being equal and available I can't see why you couldn't create a biosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A) There's barely any plants growing there, and the animals are mostly migratory.</p>
<p>B) It doesn't actually get completely, middle-of-the-night dark during the daytime hours.</p>
<p>C) How much of the warmth they do get comes from warm air brought in from nearby sunlit areas?</p>
<p>D) The daytime darkness comprises only a small portion of the entire year.</p>
<p>On the moon, you'd have none of that.  It would be absolutely, pitch-black dark for ~10 days every month.  It would cover half the surface at a time, so the nearest sunlight would be a hemisphere away.  And there wouldn't be anything like the deep oceans Earth enjoys, which carry with them some impressive thermal mass, particularly those currents bringing warm tropical waters to higher latitudes.  It would get cold, cold, <em>cold</em> every single month, across the entire surface, and do so for a third of the time.</p>
<p>If you're trying to convince me that a terraformed Luna would be about as hospitable as Antarctica only without the benefit of a nearby ocean to supply residual heat or the base of a food chain, you've succeeded.</p>
<p>That said, you could probably tilt things in your favor a bit by engineering an atmosphere much higher in greenhouse gasses, to reduce infrared heat loss.  Dunno if you'd have to reach toxic levels for it to be effective, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find the math, but I'd be surprised if the escape velocity of the moon was higher than the average speed of O2 or N2 at surface temps. ie: the atmosphere literally just flies away.</p>
<p>Its why the earth loses helium and hydrogen released into the atmosphere, and why when you get far enough from the sun, planets like Jupiter can form.</p>
<p>TLDR: you'll never successfully add an atmosphere to the moon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If we already developed the means to create an atmosphere in the first place, it would be trivial to top it up every ten thousand years or so.</p></div>		</li>
