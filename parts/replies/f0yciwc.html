			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally agree with your first statement, but as a designer of instrumentation, I do need to point out that even with noise compensation, the increased intrinsic noise level forms a fundamental limit to the device’s sensitivity. Noise comp can only do so much and it also has repercussions with regard to measurement uncertainty. For really sensitive instrumentation, the older material will always be better. On the other hand, most instruments probably don’t need to be that sensitive, and noise comp would be fine, if it’s even needed at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>wouldn't it be easier to produce the gases chemically? Electrolysis makes O2 and H2, all kinds of reactions produce CO2, and I assume there's a similar easy way to get N2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is right. The purified Oxygen for steel furnaces is made non-cryogenically by a vacuum pressure swing absorption (VPSA) method.  Basically the nitrogen is stripped out by flowing air through huge beds of little beads that attract the nitrogen and let the O2 pass through. </p>
<p>You can “produce” oxygen cryogenically but is orders of magnitude more expensive. I don’t know enough about radiation contamination to know if the pure liquid O2 would be free enough from contamination to even be worth it if it was cost neutral. </p>
<p>This is such a small niche market. Setting up a separate steel furnace just to make the metal for this kind of instrumentation wouldn’t be economical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exposure to radiation is not a factor. The issue is that the atmosphere contains a low concentration of actual radioactive particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chairfairy" target="_blank">chairfairy</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but what's the actual contamination?</p>
<p>In the case of carbon, it's specifically that nukes created a lot of carbon-14 by slamming neutrons into ambient nitrogen. In the case of steel, it's because other air particles (e.g. cobalt-60) are radioactive and steel is made using the radioactive air.</p>
<p>For electrolysis to produce contaminated O2 and H2 you'd have to use heavy water or water comprised of some radioactive oxygen isotope</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a big number to represent all the atoms on Earth...I guarantee you are not thinking of a big enough number.  Mundane amounts of things like a liter of water has so vastly many more of molecules than you might imagine. </p>
<p>Now when one considers the number of atomic bombs that have been detonated in open atmosphere since 1945, the number goes to a few thousand.  Fun fact less than 1% of an atomic weapons critical mass is converted to energy in the blast, it's about the mass of a dollar bill.  </p>
<p>The rest of the masses of plutonium and uranium and the daughter elements produced in a nuclear explosion is vaporized meaning that everywhere on Earth has been contaminated by these molecular fallout.  </p>
<p>Now you might be thinking, wouldn't environmental cancer be up and yes it is, look up downwinders.  Thankfully though the Earth is pretty big so it's really only ever been the areas most extensively used for testing that had to really worry.  Thing is prior to this point in history, radioactive elements weren't really a part of our everyday environment, most of the really horrible stuff had decayed away thanks to half-lives being geologically short.  </p>
<p>Oh and one more thing if one were to view our planet in the decades after the development of nuclear weapons, the assumption of an observer from another world might assume the planet uninhabitable due to what would have looked like a significant nuclear exchange.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it's a small amount but a dollar bill?</p>
<p>The Wikipedia page about nuclear weapons says that little boy contained 64kg of uranium and that less than 2% was converted.</p>
<p>If you allow that 1% converted (otherwise they would have said less than 1%) that would be 64,000/100 g. So it was at least 640g.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that more powerful weapons convert more mass - maybe from a smaller total content but more fission boom must mean more conversion. Obviously fusion attains change the maths but even then don't they include boosted fission, implying more conversion again? </p>
<p>Or have I misunderstood? That's entirely possible. </p>
<p>I'm not having a dig - I'm genuinely asking. A dollar bill's tory seems like a very small amount even after you multiply it by c^2.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thank you for sharing this.  I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about nuclear weapons history (it just interests me, but I by no means consider myself an expert)....  But I had no idea there were this many!  I was also shocked by how spread out they were both physically and in terms of timeline.  </p>
<p>The impact circles at the end are a bit concerning.  I have grown up and spent nearly my entire life inside the biggest circle (American Southwest).  Not exactly a surprise, but the visual was hard to ignore since the scale of testing was so much more than I ever knew.  Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>45 and up, yep. Enough radioactive particles were created and spread around to interfere with certain sensitive radioactive measurements. For example, Carbon 14 dating doesn’t work if the organism you’re trying to date died after 45, cuz it will have a higher than normal amount of C14.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could certainly be wrong but I would think outside of Nevada, Bikini Atoll, Kazakhstan, ect. any amount of extra C14 would be uniform enough that we could still date things. We have biological samples from every year in between 1945 and now to compare them to and even in and around test sites I would think sampling of things with known ages should allow you to date things with isotopic analysis. No?</p></div>		</li>
