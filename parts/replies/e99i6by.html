			<div class="markdown"><p>A few of my ears of cactus got a little bit of rot early part of September, and at the start of October one of the big storms knocked my largest over and several ears came off. Thankfully the rest of the month was mild enough that I could replant them all and they're all fairly well rooted now. Here's hoping when winter comes it isn't too bad for the younger ones now on their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tale of the prickly pear in Australia deserves telling. Imported to create self-repairing fences and to grow cochineal insects for dyes, it rapidly took over, becoming a major plant pest. But once they imported an insect to feed on them - appropriately named the 'cactoblastus' moth - the plants were quickly killed off and out-competed by local flora.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, they're still around; they're not uncommon here in Vic. Just, you know, not in plague proportions now.</p>
<p>...but yeah, cactoblactus helped a lot. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there still around up here in North Queensland. Look after them, and you can grow them for their fruit. Used to sell them every year in a fruit shop I worked at - and you couldn't stop getting the fine hairs stuck in your fingers! But out in the wild, with the moth attacking them, other plants take over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention different types can adapt to hard pack (such as saguaro) while others can adapt to rocky terrain and high altitude such as the prickly pear found throughout Texas and the barrel cactus found through-out Texas, New Mexico and the arid  high mountain areas of Colorado just to name some examples. </p></div>		</li>
