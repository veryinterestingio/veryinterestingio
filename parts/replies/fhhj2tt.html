<p>Just for the sake of clarity I'll add that they are definitely the biggest animals <em>that we know of</em> to have ever lived.  It's likely at this point that if there had ever been something larger we would have found evidence of it by now, but that's nearly impossible to ever completley rule out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, anything bigger would also be a marine creature. And due to global warming since the peak of the ice age, even the edge of their former marine environment is now underwater. Not saying there’s bigger animals in the past, only that finding evidence of their existence is probably more difficult. </p>
<p>On the other hand, many marine environments in the distant past are now parts of mountains, deserts, or pretty much any type of topography. So there’s that too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to my (very non-expert) understanding, heat regulation definitely played a role in why relatives of elephants and rhinos in ice age Eurasia and North America (mammoths, wooly rhinos, etc) evolved to be bigger than their modern African relatives. When you're big, you have a smaller surface area compared to your volume, meaning it's easier to retain heat in a cold climate.</p>
<p>It does seem that expert opinion on why they went extinct leans more towards being overhunted by humans. But the world is complicated, so it's likely a combination of various contributing factors, including hunting and changing climate.</p>
