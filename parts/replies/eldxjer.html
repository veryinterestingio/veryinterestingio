			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't exactly know but the biggest leads come from studies around memory and dementia.  REM sleep &amp; dreaming have been correlated with memory processing.  These activities seem to assist the brain with transferring the day's experiences from short term to longer term memory storage.  There is also mounting evidence that being chronically under-slept may be a major driver of memory degradation and dementia later in life.</p>
<p>I started learning about this because I've had trouble with my sleep for most of my adult life and my experiences point to similar areas.  In my case I still slept a normal amount but with none of the restorative aspects.  Unsurprisingly I lost the energy to do much during the day, along with my quick wit.  My memory for things that had happened to me became hugely worse as that bridge between short and long term memory eroded.  I began to stumble over my words because I couldn't think at the speed of speech and would often have periods where I would be unable to think of anything at all hard, as I tried.  I almost completely stopped dreaming for years.</p>
<p>Also surprising was that I saw little results for years as doctors tried treating my lack of sleep directly.  Nothing worked until we started treating my cognitive issues.  Then I saw my sleep also start to return to normal.  Dreams returned, energy levels rose, memory started to improve.  Hope that helps illuminate a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mind elaborating on what you mean by ‘treating my cognitive issues’? Was it talk therapy that helped? Were you worried all those years or did you have trouble dealing with tough emotions? Do you have ADHD perhaps? Thank you for your post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive issues being poorer memory, not being able to think, increasing aphasia.  Treating as in medication and some supplements targeted at fixing those problems rather than trying to treat my sleep issues.</p>
<p>No ADHD.  I had doctors prescribe me all sorts of drugs for depression despite being a super level person.  Didn't work since I wasn't depressed and actually made things worse.  Just seemed like an easy diagnosis for a lot of bad-to-average doctors who didn't want to dig deeper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly just moved from one GP to another because many seemed disinterested in tackling the problem.  I looked for more specialized clinics but none were legit.  I guess I learned how huge the demand was for treatment of serious, chronic maladies that just weren't quite debilitating enough for any medical professional to give a shit.  So I just kept finding new doctors and getting passed on to a number of specialists or tests.  Each ultimately ruled out a number of possible causes but never brought me closer to a solution.</p>
<p>It eventually became clear that all these doctors were all guessing about as well as I could.  So I'd research until I came up with a theory, then would see a doctor and either consult with them on over the counter dosages or ask for a prescription.  Most doctors would give me serious medications (which consistently wouldn't help) without a second thought if it got me out of their hair.  So I'd ask them for whatever might test my theory and if there wasn't some serious risk to trying it, they'd go along with it.  Finally found a combination of treatments that worked and rigorously tested them to confirm the efficacy of drug &amp; supplement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't getting much actual REM sleep and they found I had central apnea.  Typically that is caused by neurological or cardiovascular issues.  I don't have either so I eventually just got a &quot;Yup, you're fucked&quot; and not much else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m reading a book by Matthew Walker called Why We Sleep. You should if you are interested in answering this question. My take on his take: we need sleep because there’s a finite amount of storage in the brain. During NREM, the brain prune’s unnecessary memories. A consolidation period. During REM, we create connections and make sense of the old and new memories to reinforce them.</p></div>		</li>
