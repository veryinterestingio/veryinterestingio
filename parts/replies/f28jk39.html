			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense, though I've never looked into what kinds of species neoteny appears in. I would imagine it would be most prevalent in those with very drastic differences between adolescence and adulthood, like the axolotl example. Since, from an evolutionary standpoint, neoteny happens when a population ends up in an environment where their juvenile traits are more advantageous than their adult ones. So something like a species of amphibian selecting for juvenile traits makes sense if the environment provides more advantages for them staying strictly aquatic.   </p>
<p>I don't know enough about the nitty-gritty of genetics to know how this operates on a mechanical level to have much credibility, however.  I was basically asking if neoteny &quot;deletes&quot; these genes, or if they just don't manifest physically. Like, is there a shelf-life for genetic information that isn't used? Or does it just depend on a bunch of different factors--species, types of features, etc?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The latter, although there is a lot we still don't know about it. It is probably down to the regulation of genes rather than straight up deletion or non-function of genes. Neoteny has been studied a lot in domesticated animals, and there is a delay in some aspects of brain and head development in the embryo which results in neotony but also other characteristics that are common in domesticated animals such as floppy ears or a stripe down the nose.</p>

<p>Yes, more or less, but it does depend on species, features like you suggest. It also depends exactly what you mean by isn't used, because some genes can still have functions even after they have lost their primary function (similar to vestigial structures). But in general there is a rate at which non-functional genes will mutate and there is also a species-dependent rate at which 'junk' gets lost from the genome entirely. In terms of species for example, we know that birds that fly have smaller genomes than those that fly, and this is speculated to be because smaller genomes = smaller cells = lighter animal. We also know that this smaller genome size is due to the faster deletion of genomic regions, not due to a slower rate of duplications or generation of new genes. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neoteny is often a timing thing, so the same process is still there but the control has changed making it last shorter. So the &quot;actual genes making the jaw grow&quot; (I have no idea how many genes regulate these things, probably a few), will probably still be there, but higher levels probably will be different. One last note, I believe neoteny might also be epigenetically induced at first, but I'm unsure.</p></div>		</li>
