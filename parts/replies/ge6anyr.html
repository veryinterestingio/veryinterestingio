			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they would. This stage doesn’t happen until after you’ve depleted your glycogen stored and then you have to start converting your fat into ketones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it takes some time for ketosis to activate and start providing energy. I'd guess it's that gap time when you feel the initial hunger phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what the keto diet aims for. It usually takes about 3 days (some people report up to 7 days) of no carb intake for you to deplete all your glycogen storage and start ketosis. Ketosis is when your body start breaking down the stored fat cells for energy when there is absolutely no more carb in your body, no glycogen storage to use, and no new carb intake.</p></div>		</li>
