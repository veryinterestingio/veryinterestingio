			<div class="markdown"><p>It's so strange - I have an injury that lost me half of one eye. It was a blood vessel blockage that cut off my retina for a while, basically an eye stroke.</p>
<p>Now, if I close my good eye my injured eye looks like a pie chart - a neat 1/4 slice is totally black, another 1/4 slice is really fuzzy, and the other 1/2 is decent but not great. But if both eyes are open my brain totally edits out the blank space and fuzziness and stitches everything together nicely.</p>
<p>What was fascinating to me was that it took about 2 weeks for my brain to figure out how to process the information it was getting, and during that time it felt like some type of &quot;unconscious intelligence&quot; was working alongside my conscious mind to solve the problem.</p>
<p>I watched my brain try out different strategies, each day I woke up things looked different, sometimes better, sometimes worse. There were a few days when I got stuck completely cross-eyed and had to shut my bad eye periodically to &quot;reboot.&quot; But then one day it figured out how to process everything and it just looked normal again. It made me respect the silent work being done behind the scenes a lot more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And now think of the fact that when we sever the connection between the two hemispheres of the brain, there's evidence for two minds in one brain, which has lead to the theory that there's the possibility that everyone is actually two people with only one being able to express themselves. Maybe your buddy was tinkering with you eye because he had nothing better to do.</p>
<p>^(I think the theory actually exists, but the idea that our &quot;buddy&quot; would be responsible for this is something I made up)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate. I took some shrapnel to my left eye a few years ago that did permanent damage. Just looking out of my left eye, it's like looking into a fun house mirror - everything is warped and distorted. However, when looking out of both eyes everything is normal and I can see great. Really bizarre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This thread is like a transcript of the conversation I had with colleagues at lunch earlier today. Colleague A said that you close one eye, hold out your thumb in front of you and focus on the background behind your thumb. Move your hand very slowly to the side whilst still focusing on the original spot in the background. When your thumb reaches your blind spot, it disappears. I think this was based on a VSauce video from YouTube.</p>
<p>We all tried this and sure enough our thumbs disappeared from sight when it got to the blind spot.</p>
<p>We started discussing why we can't see the blindspot in every day life and then Colleague B brings up the fact that most of the time were not aware that we can see our nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're now aware that you can't move your eyes in a smooth motion unless your eyes are fixed on something that is moving (from your perspective). Without tracking something your eyes just jump from spot to spot and your brain edits out the transitions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking off of this, there was a study done where someone wore glasses which flipped everything upside down every minute he was awake. After about a week the brain starts processing it as right-side up and everything seemed normal. Upon removing it and not wearing glasses, everything appeared to be inverse for a week.</p>
<p>Plz don't ask for source, because I'm assuming my psychology teacher didn't lie to me years ago , and I'm not about to look it up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most memorable parts of the visual novel Chaos;Head for me is actually a demonstration of the blind spot. It just shows you two dots and tells you to move your head closer to the screen while looking at one dot; eventually you see the other dot disappear, even though you <em>know</em> it's there. It's a really cool demonstration, and it's pretty easy to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do that with just your thumb:
-close your left eye
-put your thumb infront of you at arm's lenght
-focus your vision on the thumb aka straight forward
-keep your right eye focused ahead while you slowly move your thumb right
At some point the thumb should just disappear. The reason for that is that the blindspot or the spot at which the optic nerve leaves the eye is 4mm nasally from the center of the eye.</p></div>		</li>
