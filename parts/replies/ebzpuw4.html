			<div class="markdown"><p>Good reply. I noticed you said &quot;inhabited areas.&quot; I assume that is because cutting up the natural forest into nice little geometric firestarters is a really bad idea, and it should only be used as a last resort to stop property damage/loss of life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, for one thing there's massive areas of forest and it'd simply be way too expensive to hire &amp; equip people to cut it all up.  Absolutely devastating to the ecology as well.  It's unfeasible and counterproductive, so the focus is on protecting places where people live (or uninhabited infrastructure as well).</p></div>		</li>

<p>In these cases, building resistant structures is a much better strategy; again, this is left to private landowners in most cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this has been a problem! Private landowners sometimes do a really poor job in selecting fire-resistant building styles. I've even heard about HOAs mandating wooden shingles on roofs to match the &quot;character of the neighborhood&quot;, when a metal roof is a radically better choice in California today.</p>
<p>I would support legislation requiring all new roofs to be metal in California. It's time. Suck it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe wood shingle roofs are banned on new construction in California unless they're treated with fire retardant, and some municipalities have banned them on existing structures as well. That said, I haven't noticed a wood roof in California in a long time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good. It's a terrible way to design things.</p>
<p>I work in design, and the philosophy of picking an architectural style from across the world for your neighborhood over here has always bothered me. People didn't use terra-cotta roof tiles in the Mediterranean because they were attractive, they did it because it was practical for that environment. Likewise thatched roofs in Britain, and slate roofs around Paris, and whatever other local style you've got. Mimicking styles that made sense in their own environments elsewhere is dumb. Let's develop a sensible, practical California style, and let that be our legacy. Something that's smart, inexpensive, and tuned to local needs. And a hundred years from now, people will talk about the quaint Southern California cottages, with their cinderblock walls and metal roofs, or whatever ends up being the sensible option.</p></div>		</li>
