			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah except a lot of the stigma and misconception towards kids diagnosed with ADHD is &quot;they can't pay attention&quot;. It's like the first thing we're told as kids, we're failing X because we just can't pay attention. </p>
<p>No, it's that X task isn't giving me stimulus like Y task does, so I focus on Y instead which reads as &quot;being distracted&quot;, &quot;not paying attention in class&quot;, &quot;doodles on notebook&quot; etc etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk, I have inattentive ADHD and I'm not that sensitive about it. It's true that people with ADHD can't pay attention, isn't it? That's just a fact. Now, the reason WHY they can't pay attention is important to focus on, but people aren't saying (in my experience, at least): kids with ADHD don't <em>want</em> to pay attention. </p>
<p>I'm just glad they're acknowledging ADHD's existence instead of denying it and writing it off as a personality trait of problem children. Saying &quot;people with ADHD <em>can't</em> concentrate&quot; is saying that they can't help it. That it's not their fault. I don't see anything wrong with that.</p>
<p>To pay attention to something is to not be distracted. To be distracted is to pay attention to something you're not supposed to be paying attention to.</p></div>		</li>
