			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s been a bumper year for a lot of things. I blame humans staying inside all spring. My neighborhood didn’t do a lot of its regular yearly bug spraying this spring, either because the company that does it was shut down for COVID or they couldn’t justify the cost if no one was outside to appreciate it. </p>
<p>I have a lot more insects in my garden this year. There are bees visiting every day, more beetles, more mosquitoes, more flies, and I got butterflies for the first time this year. (Urban area. We don’t see a lot of butterflies, sadly.) </p>
<p>I went for walks almost every day this spring. There were more birds than I usually hear in this area. This summer I noticed an uptick in the number of spider webs I found. It feels like I saw a new one in my rose bushes every day. Today, I saw a lizard on my porch, just a little blue tailed skink, but it’s the first one I’ve seen since i moved here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We’ve not had many mosquitos, but more spiders and beetles. Our milkweed thrived this year, had quite a few monarchs.  Squirrels are super fat. While I thought there were more birds in the early spring, I read that it was only quieter so we HEARD them.  Still, if we could hear them, maybe they could better hear each other’s mating calls - maybe more baby birds. It makes sense fewer were killed by cars too. Nature seems to like the shutdown. Everything is reclaiming territory. Even humans - see so many more in the neighborhood!</p></div>		</li>
