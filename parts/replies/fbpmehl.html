			<div class="markdown"><p>yes there are anti-viral agents that <del>exactly</del> do that. Oseltamivir and zanamivir specifically</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oseltamivir is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraminidase_inhibitor" target="_blank">neuraminidase inhibitor</a>,  a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_inhibitor" target="_blank">competitive inhibitor</a> of influenza's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraminidase" target="_blank">neuraminidase</a> enzyme. The enzyme cleaves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialic_acid" target="_blank">sialic acid</a> which is found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoproteins" target="_blank">glycoproteins</a>  on the surface of human cells that helps new virions to exit the cell.  Thus oseltamivir prevents new viral particles from being released.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Ponngo/" target="_blank">u/Ponngo</a>, this is not accurate.</p>
<p>NA inhibitors block the cleavage of sialic acid (SA -- really SLAM in the case of measles, but not much changes from a conceptual perspective) and HA, preventing virion <em>release</em> after invasion/replication within a given cell.</p>
<p>To  my knowledge, there are no currently available anti-viral agents which  target SA.  The likely reason being that SA is involved in <em>a lot</em>  of stuff, and you would expect a lot of off target effects -- perhaps  most importantly the movement of white blood cells from vessels to  tissues (leukocytes bind SA during the process of vessel  adhesion/extravasation, if you want to Google this).  Hopefully it  should make some sense that movement of WBCs is the last thing you would  want to inhibit during active infection...</p>
<p>That  said, from a conceptual perspective, you're right on!  Inhibiting viral  attachment is a really common strategy when you're dealing with viruses  that don't target ubiquitous molecules like SA (i.e. where you would <em>not</em>  expect big off-target effects).  For instance, Maraviroc is used to  inhibit the binding of HIV to its initial target cell, macrophages.  And  palivizumab is very commonly used to treat/prevent RSV (a real killer  for preterm infants), and acts to inhibit F-protein which is involved in  both attachment/entry, and down stream transmission (this protein can  facilitate membrane fusion between the virus and the cell, <em>and</em> can drive fusion between infected cells and neighboring cells, which helps spread the virus.)</p>
<p>So, short answer: Yes!  Inhibiting viral attachment receptors is an important strategy, just not with HA/measles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I know what you mean, but the way I understand your answer, it is about the virus exiting the cell. My question is, can we make something that binds to the sial acid heads, so virusses can't enter at all. Anyways thanks, I've just learned what you wrote in my biotechnology class. It is super interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe we can’t because it mimics a protein found on RBCs too closely, and therefore there would be a high risk of causing some sort of autoimmune process or hemolytic anemia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We already have antivirals for influenza virus that mimic sialic acid which competitively inhibit the exiting of newly formed viruses, so it seems plausible that we could do something similar with measles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer! As an immunotherapy researcher I’d also like to point out that a lot of these abilities of measles makes it an excellent option for what we call an oncolytic virus! It can selectively infect to cancer cells and kill them!</p></div>		</li>
