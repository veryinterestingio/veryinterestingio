			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I was diagnosed with ADHD in 7th grade. Growing up every told me it meant I was real hyper and couldn't focus, as if it were that simple. I always thought I was misdiagnosed because my energy levels as an adult aren't very high.</p>
<p>But shit the way you and another commenter describe it, I think I may go in and see if theres anything to be done. So many things in my life that I need to do and or change but I just can't bring myself to do them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADHD can contribute to low energy levels in adulthood, if it's poorly managed. if you're using all your mental energy on trying to stay afloat with the demands of adulthood on your executive functioning, you'll likely be exhausted day-to-day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest man, I didnt know what's wrong with me. I just thought I was a literal piece of shit and have been depressed for so long. All these tasks that other people do and they make them seem so simple, but too me they are daunting. I really hope I can get some help with this. I took medication as a kid for about a year but my parents took me off it. Is there medication that helps adults, or any other forms of treatment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are subtypes of ADHD there is primarily hyperactive, primarily inattentive, and combined. Us in the inattentive camp don't have many of the hyperactive symptoms and mainly just suck at focus related stuff.</p>
<p>(The subtypes may not be part of official diagnosis but my doctor did include it in my diagnosis, I can't say for certain if it is/was included in the DSM)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this I'm certain of - I was diagnosed with ADHD at an early age but never given a subtype. The worst is I'm so exhausted by trying to keep up with the demands of being a young adult I feel like I'm rarely doing more than just staying afloat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd recommend trying to find a therapist with some knowledge first before getting tested. Stateside it can be very expensive ($500 without insurance) and also will definitely take several hours. Being a graduate student, I had a lot of steps, and one of them involved talking to a therapist <em>first</em> before a referral for testing, and I think it was a good step.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And, yeah, hyperactivity often has nothing to do with it. Meds for treatment are universally stimulants (as far as I can tell), meaning that they <em>give</em> you more energy and many people experience crashes when the meds wear off later in the day. I was diagnosed in middle school, and upon transitioning to high school the principal said he thought I didn't have ADHD because I was a well-performing student. While it may sound silly in retrospect, his opinion caused me to ignore my symptoms untill I was <em>really</em> struggling in graduate school. Most people simply don't understand what ADHD entails, and it's hard to blame them because it really isn't just one thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very eloquently put. Thank you!</p>
<p>My daughter is high functioning autistic and I suspect adhd. Her executive functioning skills are definitely lagging behind from kids her age. But man, she is extremely bright! Her long term memory is like a trap and she will remember every fine detail about things you didn’t even notice. When she was 3 her vocabulary was higher then most adults and she seems to understand concepts beyond her age. Conversely, she has a lot of struggles. She goes into panic with transitions even with visual aids and assistance, she has a bunch of sensory processing issues that put her into overload and she gets extremely frustrated very easily.</p>
<p>Right now, we’re trying to help her strengthen her executive functioning skills. For the most part it seems to be working, but it’s going to be a life long process I think.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for the great explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Per my psychiatrist, 60% of people with ADHD also have autism, so I would recommend getting her checked out! ADHD treatment has been a game changer for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d bet money that it’s probably closer to the other way around, and that 60% of folks with autism have ADHD. I found a paper from a neuroscience journal that places the number for that at 30-50%. That being said, it does appear that they have high comorbidity and similar symptoms, so it’s certainly worth taking a look at for someone with autism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you live in the UK, I recommend a private assessment / treatment. The NHS is worse than incompetent assessing and treating mental health issues. It took me 6 months to start treatment, after which I had an assessment, and was declared as not having ADHD and my treatment was immediately halted. They are refusing a second assessment, or a second opinion, even though I've had a positive diagnosis several times in the past, since I was a child, and living as an adult with the difficulties you list above, I bloody well know I have it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconded. I had 3 GPs tell me I'm likely either autistic or ad(h)d in some capacity and then refuse to refer me for assessment.</p>
<p>Had similar experiences with their mental health services regarding anxiety and depression too, take some anti depressants and fuck up summed it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I didn't get diagnosed properly as Autistic until I was 20 and that was only because I happened to be at university and spotted by someone working for the world's most famous Autism research lab. My GP had just given me valium periodically for years and told me that &quot;being a teen girl is hard&quot;.</p>
<p>If I hadn't been in the right place at the right time, it wouldn't have happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m in the US, but this was a huge letdown for me. My doctors that Id seen and my closest family members would agree I show all the symptoms. But I go to this one doctor for an official diagnosis, and she declares I don’t have it and that I’m anxious and depressed. </p>
<p>This would maybe have been acceptable if she actually asked me about my life. But she didn’t. Instead she told me I need to just work harder. But I know what I am, and her office was just a sham.</p></div>		</li>
