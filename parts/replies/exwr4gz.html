			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes.   People like going to an area that has choices.  Whether it’s that one street where all the restaurants are at or where all the regular shopping is.  So you end up with Lowe’s across the street from Home Depot.  Target next to Walmart.   Gas stations on opposite corners of each other.  Etc.   </p>
<p>The more people drawn to an area, the more shops open up which actually brings in yet more people...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wonder if it works for gas stations. Because when I need to buy a pants I'll most likely go to a place where I can check few different shops (e.g shopping centre). But when my car is low on fuel I'll jus stop at first reputable brand gas station that is on my way. Not really caring about a choice. Especially given the fact that when gas stations are near each other they usually have the same prices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this apply to car dealerships too? Asking because car dealerships have a bunch of weird laws around them in the US so no guarantees there...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I mean, I guess. In effect.  But in actuality, usually businesses like to build in high traffic areas, or areas under development that will be high traffic in the near future.  Since there are only going to be a certain amount of high traffic areas, businesses will congregate.  That's why there are restaurants around malls typically.</p></div>		</li>
