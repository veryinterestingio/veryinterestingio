<p>And here I am now, annoyed at my 20 Dollar headset if the noise cancellation only cancels part of the ambient noise, but not the obnoxious talking of a particularily loud colleague.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha it’s really really wild how it works, I worked with some analog graphic EQs while I was in work and I was taught that they work by duplicating the signal and then will slowly pull out of phase a certain frequency when the fader is moved down That is my broken way of remembering how it works</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got my girlfriend a pretty pricey for her birthday by Sony. It works so well all vehicles on the road sound electric when it's fully on and you don't hear your own walking noises anymore. With this tech it's worth spending good money on it because then it works well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a tough question , so let’s say you have to speakers, 10 ft apart,  each facing each other.
One speaker is in phase, the other has been flipped 180 degrees.
If you stood in the middle of those speakers and play something through them, you’ll hear just the normal audio. And the reasoning ( this is my assumptions based on experience and knowledge ). That when sound leaves the speakers, you have dispersions throughout the room, you’ll never be able to cancel out a sound in a room because of how the room changes the audio EQ.
Everything in a room plays apart to how audio will sound to your ears,
From size of the room, to if it’s carpeted or hardwood, to if there’s tables , chairs etc.
And a speaker on one side of the room may sound different to your ears than a speaker on the other side, just based off of items in the room and the probability that, no 2 speakers produce 100% the same sound ( I’m taking like less than a percent of an EQ difference but in a large room it may make a big difference)</p>
<p>...if that makes any bit of sense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Working with room audio design software you can map out some interesting high and low volume patterns where sound is added or cancelled out in a room with multiple speakers. As you said, it usually won't be noticeable to a listener under normal circumstances.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the major problems is that a microphone near the listener would pick up both the music and any noice plus effects from the room. On a headphone the mics can be placed on the outside to make them only pick up noice, the thing you want to cancel. And there is no room that causes problems. It is very hard to know which part of the sound in a room that is music, noice or room effects.</p>
<p>There are room correction systems. They are somewhat similar. You play music through a system that can compare the sound that is sent to the speakers with what is &quot;heard&quot; by a mic and then tries to adjust the signal to make it sound correct. This can take away some of the effects of the room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does our ear get both of these sound waves, the actual noise and the phase cancellation? Does the ear have to work harder to process these two signals? Does it (active noise cancellation) put additional strain on the ear?
Finally, does using active noise cancellation with tinnitus make it worse (not the perception but makes the condition worse over time)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Imagine one simple soundwave like a wave yeah? When another exactly the same soundwave also plays, at the exact same time, the waves of these sounds 'match' and they stack up. And the sound gets louder.
This is called a standing wave.
But something different happens if one of two waves  is played just a tad later so that the upper part of the wave is meeting the lower part of the other wave. So they don't match, they are complete opposite.
Something cool happens in nature when this occurs, these waves cancel eachother out. So instead of getting louder, it gets less loud or even inauble.
So no, this will not put extra strain on your ears. If anything it will be less.</p>
<p>I can not say anything about tinnitus and noise cancelation for I do not know enough about tinnitus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The engineering behind this is amazing then. From your explanation I can visualize this is something like ripples in a pond and that opposite phases can cancel out.</p>
<p>But sound is not a wave, they are compression and de-compression(?) of air right? How does opposite wave(?) then? Wouldn't this (noise+noise cancellation) increase the sound pressure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! So how it works is, let’s say you have a sound creating x amount of frequencies at like 90dB</p>
<p>If you were too take that sound, make a duplicate track but then put it 180 degrees out of phase, the waveforms would cancel each other out creating silence at 0dB.
Our ears will never hear this noise and does not need to process it because there is nothing to process</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not 0dB. dB is a log scale, so perfect silence is -<inf> dB.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, it's tough to get perfect silence. </p>
<p>Noise cancellation works by picking up the outside noise and delaying it a small amount, adding that to the sound coming out of the little speakers. This addition can be physical - a small tube in the earphones, or an electrical circuit. The correct delay to put on a wave is half the wavelength, and the wavelength is inversely related to the frequency.  Noise, unfortunately happens over a wide range of frequencies.</p>
<p>You can't cancel out really low frequencies because the wavelength is too long, and you can't cancel out really high frequencies because the delay that works for lower frequencies will be too long to cancel out high frequencies. Most noise cancellation earphones reduce outside noise by less than 10dB, and only reduce noise in a small range of frequencies.</p></div>		</li>
