			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this. Polymorphism is the term used in pharmaceuticals to indicate where a compound will have the same molecular structure when drawn on the page, but a different arrangement of the individual molecules in the solid state.  X-ray diffractometry (XRD) is used to distinguish these arrangements (polymorphic forms).  An amorphous solid is one with a random (more or less) arrangement of the molecules and won’t have a distinct XRD.</p>
<p>Sometimes, none of this matters.  The drug is formulated as a solution giving time for the drug substance to dissolve.  Solid state effects disappear.  Sometimes the polymorphs all dissolve quickly in the stomach and this bioavailability is the same.</p>
<p>Sometimes the polymorphs have different dissolution rates.  Wait, you say the solubility of something is intrinsic to the molecule itself.  Yes, but the kinetics are not intrinsic.  In the long run the polymorphic form shouldn’t matter, but in the long run we are all dead, as Keynes is supposed to have said.  These kinetic effects can cause huge differences not bioavailability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason to care about polymorphism in pharmacological compounds is shelf stability and machinability. If there are more stable polymorphs available, your compound can undergo a phase change which can break the pill. In addition, some polymorphs are easier to press into tablets than others, requiring less binders and therefore smaller tablets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this. I’m an API guy so we just make the stuff and we aren’t always sure why we are looking for a particular polymorph.  There are horror stories about a drug substance being a meta stable polymorph.  Then for no reason, the stuff does a phase change and you can never make the required polymorph at that site again.  You need to change sites and seed with an old batch and maybe you’ll get the meta stable form again.</p>
<p>Firms are said to forbid anyone from going to the new manufacturing site if they’ve been to the old one because you might bring a crystal of the truly stable form with you and seed that form in the new plant.</p>
<p>I’ve always thought it was bullshit.  The one time it happened to a place i worked the real problem was we just weren’t washing an intermediate well enough, resulting in leftover KOH screwing up the next step, but “polymorphism” was the accepted root cause.</p></div>		</li>
