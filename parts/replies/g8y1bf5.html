<p>Which is right now. LeoLabs has a tracking station in New Zealand: <a href="https://twitter.com/LeoLabs_Space/status/1316410789134245889" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/LeoLabs_Space/status/1316410789134245889</a></p>
<p>More in a few minutes, hopefully.</p>
<p>Edit: No update after half an hour, that's a good sign. If there were thousands of debris particles they would be obvious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CZ-4C R/B's apogee is 1203 km and perigee is 970 km. The site of the potential collision was supposedly around 1000 km. Whether there is a collision or not, the satellites or the debris clouds will be up there for a very long time.<br />
I read somewhere that there was another set of tracking data said the probability was lower than 1%, but that data was older than Leolabs' data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atmospheric drag decreases exponentially with altitude. In the lowest orbits they decay pretty quickly, for instance the old GOCE satellite at 250km took just 3 weeks to burn up in the atmosphere after it ran out of fuel, and it was longer than you'd normally expect because this one had a particularly aerodynamic shape. But as you get higher, as density decreases, timescales grow quickly.</p>
<p>These two are at ~1000km of altitude, so they may take 1000 years to decay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the collision does happen, it means satellites in the same range of altitudes will face higher threat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the collision didn't happen, how much of a threat could that become ? Would a scenario like in the movie <em>Gravity</em> be possible, where one collision caused a chain reaction ?</p>
<p>edit: on a quick google search, surprisingly it seems to be possible and is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome" target="_blank">Kessler syndrome</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not nearly as quickly as in the movie. Kessler syndrome is a bit controversial among scientists. So believe it could take hundreds of years to reach a level as bad ad in Gravity. Others believe it could happen much more quickly, but definitly not in a matter of hours. Obviously it depends on a lot of factors, like how much debris there is and how fast it decays.
Some scientists believe we have already reached the critical amount of debris for a (rather slow) chain reaction that could still be very hard to stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with the other comment, the movie exaggerated it a lot to make it look like it happens so quickly. IRL we measure the probabilities of collision as a fraction of a % per square meter of satellite external surface and per year. So, while it is true that fragmentation causes more collisions which in turn cause more fragmentations, the timescale would be ridiculously big.</p>
<p>Also consider the density of residual atmosphere. In very low orbits, atmospheric drag that causes them to deorbit is dominant over ejection of new debris.</p></div>		</li>
