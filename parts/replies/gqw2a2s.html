			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... seems strange to compare under 10k to 10-15k.  Those are both in poverty.</p>
<p>Infact &quot;middle class&quot; as in the middle third, starts around 50k.  Now your comparing 60-66 to low 50s or lower.</p>
<p>That is a fairly significant delta.</p>
<p>However, it's strange, the data doesn't seem to control for age.  So I can't quite figure how that would play into it.  I would expect older women to generally have higher earnings and fewer births.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume birthrate is per annum.  Plus if it were total, it would be much higher, as we know our population is steady, should be 2000 baby's for every 1000 women.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;household&quot;, not individual.</p>
<p>but yes.  middle class as defined by the middle third</p>
<p>upper class starts somewhere between 100-150k</p>
<p>if your a single person, middle class is closer to 35k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your definition of &quot;middle class&quot; starting at US$50,000 a year is definitely not true around the world. In my country, that would put you at very high middle class, or the very low high class. And people are able to live worthy lives with much less than that, although much less than US$10,000 is poverty like you said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Within countries: no. That's mostly just a straight up myth: poor women simply do not have significantly more children than middle-class ones.</p>
<p>Across countries: poor cultures tend to have a lot of kids because (a) many of them will die, (b) those countries tend to use a lot of manual labor, so kids will help you run your farm or whatever, (c) there's no one else to care for you when you age so you better make sure you've got some living kids, (d) women tend to be poorly-educated and not have very much power, particularly in terms of making reproductive choices and (e) good family planning doesn't exist even when they <em>can</em> try to make such choices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some cultures have a preference for male child and continue to have children until a son is born. This is obviously more prevalent in lower income communities who are not well educated and cannot foresee the benefits of family planning. There's a religious aspect too. I'm not an expert but some Muslim cultures believe all children are gift of Allah and do not practice family planning. Again, this impacts poorer communities most because of a lack of education.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No, you're wrong. This graph says that women below the poverty level had 68% more kids per year than women above 2x the poverty level. That's way more kids!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was so confused by the 66/1k statistic. It seemed <em>way</em> too low. If anyone else is confused, that's the birth rate (births/year), not the total number of kids a thousand women have at a given time. </p>
<p>I'm probably the only one stupid enough to be confused...</p></div>		</li>
