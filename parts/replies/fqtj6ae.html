			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC part of the reason AMD went with chiplets is that it allows them to reuse higher end CPUs which had defects in a few chiplets. The lower end CPUs are identical but with fewer chiplets so it is the same difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was floored when I found that out.</p>
<p>I assumed they had a production line that made i3 chips, and a separate line for i5, etc, just like Ford has different lines for explorers and mustangs.</p>
<p>Turns out they just make all the same sort of chip, and then sort them based on how well they actually work. Crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This used to be true but is not for current Intel chips. The i9s and i7s use a different, bigger die than the i5s and i3s. This is probably because Intel yields with 14nm+++ are so good that they dont have to.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>They stopped doing that like a decade or more ago and it's also not related to the chiplet strategy.</p>
<p>The only binning Intel does for desktop/laptop CPUs is HT enabled or disabled, and clock speeds for the TDP. They do not disable cores.</p>
<p>Only on Xeon chips (edit: and HEDT, which is different branding for the same chips) do they disable cores in their binning. i3s are physically smaller chips than i5s. i5s are physically smaller chips than i7s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amd chiplet design allows them to effectively increase yield by because defects are isolated to one chiplet as opposed to possibly making and entire monolithic die useless (or have to been binned at a lower valued part.) It also allows them to effectively printed more full CPUs per wafer. In the below link for example, 150 monolithic CPUs can be made on the same area as 622 chiplets which could be made into 155 4 chiplet CPUs. </p>
<p>This has lead to them to develop a modular architecture centered around connecting multiple chiplets. So current Zen 2 designs have 2 chiplets (2x8 cores) on ryzen branded CPUs to up to 8 chiplets on threadripper.</p>
<p>What you were described is binning, which is common among pretty much all semiconductor manufacturing. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it correct to say that when you double CPU size, you have to halve clock speed in order to not exceed the speed of light?</p>
<p>And so on, when you triple CPU size, you can only go to 33% of the usual max clock speed, but when you shrink CPU size in half, your max clock speed limit doubles...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you keep the same number of transistors and the propagation time is the limiting factor, then yes.</p>
<p>A bigger CPU could mean more transistors (so more cores, or more complex ones) as tightly packed. Without heat and cost problems, they would be faster.</p>
<p>Clock speeds used to be increased by making longer pipelines. Say a CPU needs to do the steps A B C &amp; D to execute an instruction. Old CPU does ABCD for an instruction every cycle. New CPU does step A for instruction n, in the next cycle it does the step B for the instruction n and step A for the instruction n+1, next cycle C for n B for n+1 A for n+2 etc... It can go 4x faster because the propagation time is 4x shorter.</p></div>		</li>
