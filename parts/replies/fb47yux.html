			<div class="markdown"><p>Aye! We share the signs, the exact same muscles are activated (on a group level that is), when we express basic emotions. However, when it comes to reading the basic emotions of others, we generally are better at spotting emotions on people of the same ethnic group as us. </p>
<p>Some studies have also argued that this is also overpowers gender completely. An African-American man recognize emotion better in an African-American woman than he does in a Caucasian man. Although I think this has been somewhat criticised and hard to replicate. But if it's true then it furthers the evolutionary idea that it has developed for group-functionality and is not a derivative of just looking like each other and relating it to how you yourself would express something. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Edit: change to BASIC emotions, as complex emotions are not universal etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have there been studies on whether that ethnic identification of emotion is sociological instead of biological? In other words, would a white person raised in a black family still find it easier to ID emotions on white faces?</p></div>		</li>
