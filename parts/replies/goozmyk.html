			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. The transformer is the device that occupies the larger space in your power brick and is the device that steps down the voltage from 220/110 to 5/12 volts. </p>
<p>All you need is a bridge rectifier, which is a couple of diodes to convert Ac to Dc and those are very small. In fact it is possible to design a rectifier IC (and they exist) within a 2x2mm space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does if your device requires a lot of amps at that lower voltage.</p>
<p>It's why power tool manufacturers don't really bother with 120VAC -&gt; 18VDC adapters for their cordless tools.</p>
<p>Takes a large transformer to change ~120V/6-15A to ~18V/40-90A.  Completely defeats the purpose of most cordless tools if you have to drag around a huge and expensive power brick that weighs more and costs more than a battery, or two.</p>
<p>Dewalt has a 120V AC -&gt; DC adapter for their Flexvolt miter saws.  But it's a relatively small and inexpensive adapter because they can skip the transformer and basically rectify the AC power straight from the wall.  </p>
<p>Hikoki/Metabo HPT (used to be Hitachi) make a 36V/40A adapter with a large transformer sitting in the middle.  Costs 3x as much as the Dewalt (MSRP) and weighs almost 2.5x as much.  </p>
<p>An 18V/80A adapter would be even more cumbersome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure what you are on about. AC to AC transformers that can handle the currents of a typical laptop power brick is even bigger then those you find on the laptops. The rectifier and smoothing circuit which transforms AC to DC is tiny in comparison. A typical switch mode power supply as found in most power bricks contains two of these because they are so much smaller then an AC to AC transformer for the low frequencies of the mains power. It may be this you are thinking about but even with two recifiers the transformer and associated circuitry usually take up more space in the power brick.</p></div>		</li>
