<p>Why are most venomous beings insects/snakes/reptiles?...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The video mentions that old blooded animals aren't able to expend energy over long periods of time, so instead of hunting prey they rely on a single bite and then wait</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It says above that it's because they are cold blooded, and thusly they dont want to move around and expend energy chasing down prey. Instead they sit and wait for prey to come to them and the venom was an evolutionary response to this, as it helps to make sure that when that one snack does finally come along they dont fail to kill it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is accurate, as far as it goes. Nothing is truly cold-blooded, and most Herpetologists that I personally know steer well away from that term. Some of us even steer away from &quot;Ectothermic.&quot; There are much more accurate terms.  </p>
<p>Think of it in terms of energy demands. your &quot;cold blooded&quot; organisms have lower energy demands, so mutations that favor and allow for low energy hunting methods (venom being a good example) will feed back into a loop of being a successful lower-energy consumption predator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there simply are more snakes and insects in the warm climates, so proportionately they'll have more venomous ones too. </p>
<p>I'm in Northern Europe, in my country we don't have many snakes at all, in fact we have just two, the grass snake and the common European viper. Viper is venomous, so you could say that 50% of our snakes are venomous. </p>
<p>Australia has 172 recorded species of snakes, around 100 of them are venomous but only 12 or so are likely to inflict a wound that could kill you, so that's only 8% venominess. I'm not sure if that's a word but spell-check isn't highlighting it, so I'll leave it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that u/hahahsn 's explanation does a good job of ELI5. It's really important for the OP to keep in mind that all biological life boils down to being able to collect &quot;energy&quot; to survive.</p>
<p>Some organisms have  lower energy systems as a result of the long process of evolution. The secondary consumers/obligate carnivores (the creatures that hunt) will select for effective low-energy hunting methods (which is why venom occurs in so many different groups). The same is true of the primary consumers (herbivores or plant-eaters); which will select for low-energy defensive strategies. Cryptic coloration, or camoflauge, is by far the most common, with various secretions, poisons, and toxins being another defensive strategy. High energy animals like mammals and birds will typically have survival and hunting strategies as a result of higher-energy biology.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As a uh, important piece of information to keep in mind, &quot;Bloodedness&quot; is a <em>scale</em> not &quot;cold-blooded&quot; or &quot;warm-blooded.&quot; Even within Mammalia, some mammals have low enough basal temperatures and basal metabolic rates that they could be classified as cold blooded, and there are some non avian, non mammilian organisms (sea turtles and tuna fish are two interesting examples) that have direct biological processes to help keep body temperatures up or regulate them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With all the talk of low-energy vs high-energy strategies, I was reminded of plants. Plants that use toxins to defend themselves have a different line of reasoning - I wonder if this might apply partially to animals as well. </p>
<p>Basically toxins are volatile molecules that will degrade over time. This costs plants a lot of energy and nutrients in order to replenish and maintain their toxins over time. So what you end up seeing is that plant species in nutrient rich environments tend to be able to “afford” to defend themselves with toxins. Plants in nutrient poor environments simply invest in molecules that make them difficult to digest, as these can practically last forever.</p>
<p>So you end up with a similar tendency where poisonous plants are more common in warm climates as these environments are usually rich in resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I didn't realize there was a correlation between temperate location of plants and production of toxins.</p></div>		</li>
