			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems plausible that two spaceships can flyby each other so fast that the two-body system forms a black hole. Doesn't this happen in particle accelerators? More interestingly, what would happen to the inhabitants of the spaceships?  </p>
<p>Edit: This is actually really cool to think about. Literally ripping holes in the fabric of spacetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The total energy is not sufficient in particle accelerators. And the particles are not close enough to form a black hole. There were (are?) theories of quantum gravity that explored the idea of black holes being able to be formed at those energy densities, but so far there has been no evidence of black holes forming. It is expected that even if a black hole formed, it would evaporate due to Hawking radiation very quickly. But the process of forming a black hole and then evaporating could create effective transitions, that wouldn't be possible with the standard model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder what would happen if.. Lets say you are trapped within the event horizon of a black hole, no hope of escape, everything in front of you is the black hole.. Let's assume it's a quite large black hole, so the timescales and spaghettification aren't so much a factor.
What happens if the black hole you are close to, collides with another black hole, and you end up in a region of space that might be thought of as being within the event horizon of both.. my assumption is the you can't be headed for 2 disparate singularities at the same time, is there a possibility of being flung out of the influence of either black hole, floating in a Lagrange type point between them, or what weird effects might happen before they inevitably merge? </p></div>		</li>
