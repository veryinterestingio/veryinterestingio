			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an xkcd on &quot;the size of the part of the earth directly under various space objects&quot; - <a href="https://xkcd.com/1276/" target="_blank">https://xkcd.com/1276/</a> - the explain xkcd has the math and table behind it - <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1276:_Angular_Size" target="_blank">https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1276:_Angular_Size</a></p>
<p>The most relevant part is the moon - if the celestial sphere was projected onto the earth - would only be about the size of the M25 highway around London.</p>
<hr />
<p>The other thing to consider is the Hubble deep field - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field</a> which is only about 1% of the size of the moon (really rough calculations there) and how much is in that small segment of the sky - just that we can't see it with our eyes.</p>
<p>There's also the ultra deep field - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field</a> which has another comparison:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Located southwest of Orion in the southern-hemisphere constellation Fornax, the rectangular image is 2.4 arcminutes to an edge, or 3.4 arcminutes diagonally. This is approximately one tenth of the angular diameter of a full moon viewed from Earth (which is less than 34 arcminutes),[4] smaller than 1 sq. mm piece of paper held at 1 meter away, and equal to roughly one twenty-six-millionth of the total area of the sky. The image is oriented so that the upper left corner points toward north (−46.4°) on the celestial sphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot out there, just our eyes can't detect it because the photons from those sources aren't hitting our eyes fast enough for our brain to notice something is there.</p>
<p>An old /r/askscience: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1cuhdj/how_many_photons_from_a_distant_star_hit_the/" target="_blank">How many photons from a distant star hit the Earth at any given moment or per second, and does a unique photon strike every (very small) unit area of the side of the planet that faces the source?</a></p>
<p>which has the calculation in it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The atmosphere will reflect and absorb ~half of those before they ever reach the surface, but the human eye is a couple square centimeters, so let's call it even. Your eye will receive ~100 photons every second from this distant star.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another calculation for different stars at a different distance (and often dealing with telescopes rather than eyes) - <a href="https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/602433-photon-arrival-rate/?p=8286756" target="_blank">https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/602433-photon-arrival-rate/?p=8286756</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 203mm (8 inch) aperture telescope has a surface area of 0.031415 square meters.  So, 95758 photons per square meter times 0.031415 square meters equals the eight inch telescope gathering 3008 photons per second from the Andromeda Galaxy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the Andromeda Galaxy is very large in the sky (much larger in the sky than the moon) is &quot;only&quot; giving 3000 photons per second to an 8&quot; telescope.  And the Hubble deep fields are doing exposures of days to collect enough photons to produce those images.</p>
<p>So even though there is something <em>there</em>, the distance between there and here is so great that the photons have spread out (and few are hitting our eyes) <em>and</em> many of them have red shifted into parts of the spectrum that we can't see.</p>

<p>You are also touching on Olbers' paradox - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd have to define what &quot;something&quot; vs &quot;nothing&quot; is first.  There are some very diffuse clouds out there cover a portion of the sky.  Do they count?  Where do you define the edge of that cloud?  When does it stop being something and start being nothing?</p>
<p>To further complicate, we are continually seeing further and further back into the universe. As we do, we uncover more and more somethings.</p>
<p>So there's no easy answer to this. Some fermi estimation might get you an idea of it but I'm not in a mental space to do that right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the Moon and the Sun (if applicable). Everything else is smaller by orders of magnitude. The total contribution from all planets is a rounding error in the numbers for Moon and Sun, and the contribution of everything outside the Solar System is again smaller than rounding errors in the calculation of the other planets.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's pretty much the same as standing in a dark room in a house where you can't see the wall in front of you. It's still there, but your eye can't register it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. It isn't a question of low contrast, but entirely to do with the fact that our eyes as photo receptors just can not detect photons at such a low energy. If we could detect photons from that part of the spectrum, then it would a contrast issue as anything hotter than 3 K (literally every object we know to exist that is not being specifically manipulated down absolute zero) will be brighter in that part of the spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer interprets “the entire universe” to refer to “the current expanse of the the visible universe”, correct? Because as the boundaries of the visible universe expand with time some of the spots where we currently see only the cosmic microwave background will instead show stars.</p>
<p>I feel like you’ve left out a key part of the resolution of Olber’s Paradox. Based on the closest thing to current consensus, the visible universe makes up somewhere between an incredibly small and infinitely small portion of the universe as a whole, because our light cone hasn’t yet reached the rest (and will never reach most of it). A lot more of those sight lines would end on a star if we considered everything that will eventually enter the cosmic horizon, and if the universe truly is infinite and homogenous as currently suspected then effectively every sight line would end in a stellar body (even if we could never see it in the entire lifespan of the universe).</p></div>		</li>
