			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with angular momentum.  Originally everything was just loose gas which was scattered in every direction.  But in any closed system, angular momentum is conserved.  Even though all the gas particles had more or less random directions, when you sum them all up there's bound to be one direction with more angular momentum than any other.  When the gasses collided, motion in all other directions eventually canceled each other out but because angular momentum must be conserved, the primary rotational motion never cancels out.  Once all of the &quot;vertical&quot; motion cancels out, the cloud of gas becomes a spinning disk.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this concept also apply within our galaxy?   For example, is our solar system parallel with the milky way disk, and would we commonly see that for the other solar systems within this Galaxy? (I'm not sure how far reaching this closed system reaches)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a dust cloud (nebula) dense enough to begin affecting itself with its own gravity is the fetus of a solar system. And every dust cloud, no matter the shape, can be thought of as having an average angular momentum. Sure, it's mostly chaos,  As the dust clumps together under its own gravity, that tiny bit of average spin will become magnified. Like a figure skater pulling their arms to their body, the more things collapse, the more the initial hint of a spin will be magnified. That magnified spin will become so strong it will define the initial spin of every star(s), planet(s), and the direction of every orbit formed by this nebula. After that, only interactions (like collisions!) will break the norm. <a href="https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/ask-ethan-82-why-are-the-planets-all-in-the-same-plane-4470245c8743" target="_blank">Here</a> is an article that goes more in depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Analogy I've seen useful is the sound levels in windows. Each program is a plane of rotation and direction, and their volume represents how much energy is in it. If they are all at different volumes, then turning down the master volume until only one remains unmuted is similar to how each plane loses energy to each other, until only the one that began the strongest remains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wikipedia article on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk" target="_blank">Protoplanetary disk</a> has a good explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a portion of a molecular cloud reaches a critical size, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans_mass" target="_blank">mass</a>, or density, it begins to collapse under its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" target="_blank">gravity</a>. As this collapsing cloud, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_nebula" target="_blank">solar nebula</a>, becomes denser, random gas motions originally present in the cloud average out in favor of the direction of the nebula's net angular momentum. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_angular_momentum" target="_blank">Conservation of angular momentum</a> causes the rotation to increase as the nebula radius decreases. This rotation causes the cloud to flatten out—much like forming a flat pizza out of dough—and take the form of a disk. This occurs because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_acceleration" target="_blank">centripetal acceleration</a> from the orbital motion resists the gravitational pull of the star only in the radial direction, but the cloud remains free to collapse in the vertical direction. The outcome is the formation of a thin disc supported by gas pressure in the vertical direction. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really sure that human observation has been around long enough to make that assessment. One world killing comet or massive meteor and there might be a change to that opinion. If there's anything left to have an opinion.  If you took the life of the solar system and made it last one day, humans have been here for less than a second.  Life only happened 5 or so hours ago.</p>
<p>The last comet that hit Jupiter had the force of a few billion atomic bombs and left an explosive ring the size of two earths.</p>
<p>The earth has impacts from space daily or maybe even hourly.</p>
<p>A big enough meteorite or comet could turn the surface of the earth into molten lava.  Any day or second it could happen..  we really don't have the ability to see everything coming at us. Even if the fraction of the ones we see get all the headlines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i just read from the wiki. apparently, the inner planets were in the 'warm zone', which meant water and gas werent frozen and couldnt condense, so they were unable to collect gas and water when they first formed. the outer planets were in the 'frost zone' and collected 99% of the planetary mass of the solar system (excluding the sun) the reason the inner planets formed first, more or less, is because they are smaller. of course they werent in their final state as comets and even planetesimal bodies kept crashing into them (how the moon formed)</p>
<p>jupiter is largest because it formed on that frost zone line, and has the most rock and gas. the other planets after jupiter formed a bit later taking what was left in the area. still around the same time though, within a few million years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They sort of form in order of size in that those that form earlier have more access to gas than others but once others form and begin exerting their own gravity on objects the &quot;food supply&quot;, the access to that gas, suddenly gets competitive and they can't grow as quickly.</p></div>		</li>
