<p>A significant problem is that, since the late 1970's, there has been a rise of precarious and part time work. </p>

<p>Also, the salary cap to receive overtime has decayed to almost nothing along with inflation. Many more people are now put on a 'salary' that's barely above poverty level and expected to work 12-16 hour days for it.</p>
<p>Then there's the rise of contract 1099 work. They aren't employees so you aren't obliged to pay them an hourly rate, they just get paid per piece of work or on commission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the beginning of last year I was working an average of 20 - 30 hours overtime each month, (12 hour shifts that spilled over into 14 or 15 hours, often with no lunch break) I made $24,700 a year salary at the time and was considered FLSA exempt so I didn't get paid a dime of overtime. It was a fucking joke. </p>
<p>Even now that I maks substantially more than I did back then, I still qualify for overtime now thanks to the new FLSA rules that took effect in December, it's life changing. Suddenly my employer doesn't want to keep me after my shift anymore, and I've actually been told I'm <em>required</em> to take a lunch break, when I used to have to beg for one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The salary cap prior to the changes that took place on December 1st 2016 (which are still in limbo by the sound of it) was approximately $24000, or a little less than $500 per week. It's still almost double the poverty line, but insufficient to cover the cost of living in many of the most populous parts of the US. </p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence of how bad salaried employees can be f***d by overtime rules: I've had two managers who worked over 50 hrs/wk (sometimes 60!) who made 27000/yr. At 50 hrs/wk at 27000/yr, you're effectively making about $8/hr when considering overtime as time and a half, and less than minimum wage if working 60 hrs per week. The salary adjustment for salaried workers is sorely needed and should probably just be indexed to inflation anyway. </p></div>		</li>

<p>3 years ago in Seattle, rent for a middle tier but small (400 sq feet) studio was 300 a week.  I imagine $232 is enough for a town with a population under 100k, but certainly not for any city with million+ people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd kill for a 40 hour work week. Like murder-death-kill. I work one job (railway) and they have legislation that essentially allows them to just ignore some  really basic stuff, our lunch breaks if we have an assigned job that even gets lunch breaks are 20min, and we don't have to have a weekend ever. But the pay is good so there's that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canada, like I said the job is well paid and we do have rest rules but they could do a lot more to improve quality of life. We have mandatory rest where we can't get called to work: at home mandatory rest is 8 hours and at the away from home it's 6. We are on mandatory rest after working more than 10 hours in a shift we can work a maximum of 18 hours a day by having multiple shifts, and working 64 hours without a 24 break from work gets you forced into taking a 24 hour break. My personal time off is determined by when I finish my last shift at which point I can take 24 hours off and 3 times a month I have the option of taking 48 hours rest. 48 may sound like a weekend but a regular 9-5 job gets you 64 hours off, they're also very hard to predict so your ability to make plans suffers. The longest time I've ever been on call without going to work is about 4 days. The longest call I've answered was about 5. I'm 7 years in now in another 3 I'll finally have 4 weeks vacation at present it's 3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You think that's bad.  Construction can be a lot worse. Imagine only getting paid when you are literally actively producing.  Drive 1hour to the office by 7am, pick up material, truck and tools.  Strap everything down and make sure you have everything for the day.  Commute another hour to the job site.  Clock in.  You finished early? Great clock out now, go drop off the truck and tools then go home. you only get 4 hours of pay for today.  Get home at 3pm not yet knowing if tomorrows job will be 4 hours or 15.  What are weekends?   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would probably be considered a DOL violation, however the use of 1099 contracted employees is fairly high in the  construction industry. Contractors are paid on a per job basis, which doesn't have to factor in the cost of driving and material loading times in the race to the bottom. </p></div>		</li>
