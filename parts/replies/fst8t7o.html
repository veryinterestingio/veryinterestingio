<p>Mothlight Media and Henry The Paleo Guy are two good channels.  Ooo, and Your Dinosaurs are Wrong.  Really goes into the way dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures have changed in their depictions over time as well as explaining how wrong all out current depictions probably are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add to this wonderful explanation, we are now able to tell what color feathers dinosaurs had. Fossilized feathers sometimes retain the lil pigment producing sacs in the cell, called melanosomes. We can figure out the color by comparing the shape to modern birds' melanosomes.
So far we've got the black and red (ginger) color ones down. Apparently the other colors blues and purples especially seem to degrade faster so they're still figuring that out.</p>
<p>Look up sinosauropteryx on google images, we're certain the orange bits are orange, the white bits are PROBABLY white but could be a color that doesn't preserve well. I love how it looks like a lemur tail haha. </p>
<p>(Side note, these lil guys were the first non bird dinosaurs found with feathers)

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, I took a colloidal chemistry class from a professor who was also an amateur ornithologist. He said that the blues we see in bird feathers are not the result of pigment but are due to tiny, colloidal-sized air bubbles in the feathers that refract the light back to show blue (much like we get the blue color in sky). If you hold a blue jay or bluebird feather up so that it is between you and the light, you see a brown color, not blue. I wonder whether the lack of melanosomes for blue pigment for dinosaurs may be for the same reason (I realize I may be out of my league here, but it's just a thought).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I've heard of that! Same with eye color blue and even most bugs and plants, actual pigment blue is apparently super rare in nature.
Just did some quick googling and Nessaea, a genus of nymphalid butterflies, are pretty much the only ones with a blue pigment, and even then it's kind of a greeny tealy blue.
Maybe we'll be able to tell Dino's are blue just from the structural shape of the feathers?
I'm not the most educated on this either as I came into most of this as a painter with a budding interest in Paleo art haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However we could totally be wrong about a lot. Soft tissue and cartilage don’t really preserve well. And definitely not over 66 million years unless they are fossilized or preserved in amber. </p>
<p>One example is to think of the elephant. While we might infer a lot from it’s structure we might have erred on the side of caution and never have ascribed it the kinda crazy trunk it has. Also fun if you look at the skull of an elephant it kind of looks like a cyclops which may have let a few people down a weird path of reasoning two or three thousand years ago</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO - that’s why we continue to develop technology and gather evidence. New evidence is what lead to the nostril placement movement in the first place. Absolutely we could be wrong, but we are bound by current available evidence and we should have confidence in it IF it was obtained through scientific methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Herbert Wendt's book <em>Out Of Noah's Ark</em>, most likely in the chapter &quot;The tanks Of Antiquity,&quot; he actually claims fossil skulls of ancient mammoths and loxodonts were a source for the Cyclops myths. Wonderful but sad to say incredibly outdated book.</p></div>		</li>
