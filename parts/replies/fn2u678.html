			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually go one further than most CDNs by installing their own servers in many ISP's centers.</p>
<p>That way, the ISP doesn't even have to use their own internet connection to get (some of) the video content from the CDN; it's already on their Network.</p>
<p>The servers are updated at when the ISP is less busy, usually during the night.</p>
<p>A side note: the pictures, descriptions, and titles of the movies are not stored this way. That's why the Netflix menu can be slower to load than the movies themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a company we work with called Kollective ( formerly Kontiki) that has developed a system where each node on a local cluster shares parts of the file so that the main links into a network do not get overloaded by multiple requests from the same subnets. Not the same but very close to how torrents work. The original file is cut into chunks,  tagged and then sent off. When you need a chunk of file it requests it from the nearest or least busy node in the network. Not a plug, just cool technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell they should take a note of modern video game matchmaking and have people watching as peers to the chunks they have in their cache if their upload speed allows it, it'd be great if the savings were then passed on to the consumer too, since y'know they'd be using our internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not nearly as expensive as <em>not</em> doing that. They can get better deals on bandwidth this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the fact that they're delivering the same thing to so many people makes it easier to sustain the traffic. The more likely it is that someone near you watched the same thing recently, the more likely it is to be cached in a nearby server.</p></div>		</li>
