			<div class="markdown"><p>Feynman diagrams don't involve distance at all and are not meant to depict an actual process, they are meant to symbolize terms in a perturbation series. It's a way to calculate the probability of different ways the particles can interact and scatter off each other by starting with no interactions and then gradually adding them back in. All of these calculations model the particles not as points, but as plane waves that extend over all space. If you want to model a particle as something that is concentrated in a smaller region, you have to add up several of these plane wave states (a fourier series) to have them constructively interfere only in that place. </p></div>		</li>
