			<div class="markdown"><p>The challenges of communicating about earthquakes are numerous, particularly in areas like the PNW where they don’t happen too often but large earthquakes can have substantial consequences. Given the last earthquake of size was 20 years ago (Nisqually) there are a lot of new residents who never felt a large earthquake in that area. So people may be aware of the potential of an earthquake but we can’t assume they know what that means. Further, most people aren’t stupid or lazy, they are just busy and have a lot of other priorities. Preparing for earthquakes seems like something important but when you have a long list of other things to do, it can be put off. We live in an environment where there is so much information about various risks, that it is hard to get the message across to people about what they can do to improve their outcomes.  And it isn’t just about preparedness but also about getting people to think about their particular situation, their building types that they live or work in, and what protective action is best for them to take. Finally, there is a lot of misinformation or misunderstandings about earthquakes. So it can be a pretty complex endeavor!<br />
And about uncertainty, what a great question! For earthquake early warning, at least the ShakeAlert system, uncertainty isn’t something we have a lot of time to communicate. We either get it right or we’ve sent out a false alert. We have messaging to explain false alerts when those happen. We really only have seconds, so putting visualizations together with uncertainties in them is just not something that is feasible for people to understand in time to take protective actions (like Drop, Cover, and Hold On). -  Dr. Sara McBride (USGS).</p></div>		</li>
