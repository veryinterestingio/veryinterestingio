<p>They are. Thats why fermentation processes stop short of fully converting all available sugars.</p>

<p>This isn't really a reliable way to look at things. In fact, when you look at wine, its not uncommon for sweetening to be done after fermentation is complete. This is known as &quot;backsweetening&quot; </p>
<p>Generally speaking, unless the expected alcohol percentage is particularly high, yeast will just keep going. In fact, many a brewer can tell you about the experience of &quot;bottle bombs&quot; where they bottled with too much residual sugar. </p>
<p>If fermentation actually needs to stop early for some reason, that usually means filtering out the yeast so they just are not even there to do any more. (common in commercial beers)</p></div>		</li>
