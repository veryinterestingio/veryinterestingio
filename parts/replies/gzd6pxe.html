			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some cool YouTube channels where you can watch videos recorded by maximum security inmates with smuggled iPhones. The food they’re served is seriously disgusting. We’re talking a styrofoam divider tray section with 1 scoop of cold ass grits that are so coagulated you can pick them up with your hand and they’re like hard plastic. Like a lego piece. </p>
<p>But the stuff you can buy from the commissary is pretty decent. Like instant oatmeal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really varies from prison to prison. You can't really compare a county jail to a federal prison, for example. But yeah, they're obviously gonna cut costs wherever possible. Healthy nutritious food is not likely to be found in abundance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People can be oddly polite in jail. And hanging out is a lot of what jail is (vs prison which has more going on). You don't need to be 'a tough guy' to get along in jail, you just need to assert yourself if you need to/stand up for yourself. </p>
<p>I've had many times when I was laughing my ass off in jail, to be honest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bowl of iceberg lettuce and a cup of majo for lunch hardly seems to satisfy any nutritional need.
My friend is on a kosher diet though which means she gets the same as other inmates but any non kosher items removed.</p>
<p>They're not particularly nice to Jewish inmates at this facility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually a cup of mayo is high in calories and fat.. not a terrible condiment when you need energy. I remember my father telling me how years ago some of the roofers on their construction crews would bring mayonnaise sandwiches at lunch to save money (they were paid well, especially for the late 80s/early 90s, but they sent every penny they could back to their families in Guatemala).</p>
<p>Absolutely a shitty lunch, but my point is that it's probably a super cheap way to throw calories at people.</p></div>		</li>
