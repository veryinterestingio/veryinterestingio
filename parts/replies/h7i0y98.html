			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother actually had a brain tumor successfully removed with surgery. It was the size of a squished ping pong ball kind of behind the edge of her brow to her hair line. Surgeon cut open her skull, pulled back that membrane between the bone and brain and it came out stuck to the membrane. Put everything back together and sent her to her room. That was a Tuesday and that next Saturday my grandma and I went and picked her up to bring her home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I right to say that, if it's possible to clearly and easily remove the cells, it's a very effective treatment? Part of why catching cancer early is very helpful?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My aunt had several lumps removed, but it just kept coming back. Eventually they removed her whole leg, but it was too late and... I guess it had spread elsewhere? I'm just not realizing that I don't know the details, although I know it was related to the cancer.</p>
<p>That said, I also know someone who is still alive and cancer free (for something like 5 years now?) after cancer had already spread through most of her body. They removed a number of organs that got damaged in the whole mess (most reproductive organs+bladder), but that was after she went through chemo &amp; radiation to kill the cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's so many kinds of cancer, and patients have different comorbidities, different other health conditions, different access to healthcare, different situations, it's hard to give simple anwsers</p>
<p>Many cancer patients have their cancer removed surgically. in some cases that's all that is needed, other times they need surgery and radiation/chemo. </p>
<p>Catching it early is always better, if you can catch it before it grows, before it spreads, before it damages other organs, before it mutates, etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the other person said, there are many different types of cancers. Different cancers tend to have different disease progressions, treatability, treatment types, etc…</p>
<p>When cancer spreads to other parts of the body it is considered to be stage 4. A lot of the time stage 4 cancer is considered to be terminal. Generally, stage 4 pancreatic cancer is considered terminal. Some stage 4 lymphomas can be cured though. That being said, there are over 65 types of lymphoma. Some types can still be cured at stage 4, and some types can’t be cured at all.</p>
<p>Brain cancers don’t really get staged like other types of cancer, because they tend not to spread outside of the nervous system. Instead, brain cancers get graded. Some grade 1 brain cancers can be removed completely with surgery. The deadliest form of brain cancer - glioblastoma - cannot be removed completely by surgery. Typically the course of glioblastoma treatment consists of surgery, chemo, and radiation. Even then the prognosis tends to be something like 12-14 months IIRC. I think the 5 year survival rate is something like 9%. It’s pretty fucked up. </p>
<p>Basically that’s just an unnecessarily long way of saying that it depends on the type of cancer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kind of generally, yes. If they're all in one place, if you can get to the tumor to remove it, etc. For instance, look at <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/kidney-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank">kidney cancer</a>. If you detect it while it's still in the kidney, you just remove the kidney and life is probably pretty good. If it's spread outside the kidney at all, that's much less good. If it's thrown out little tumor colonies somewhere else in the body, don't start any long novels.</p></div>		</li>
