			<div class="markdown"><p>There are way more types of eye if you look at creatures other than mammals. </p>
<p>Mantis shrimp have 3 vertical pupils, PER EYE! They also have (probably) the best colour vision out of any animal, seeing several colours that are unnamed due to us being unable to see that frequency of light.</p>
<p>Chameleons have round pupils, but their eyes move independently and have an amazing range of motion. They can look all around themselves while only moving their eyes, hiding from both predators and prey.</p>
<p>If you are looking at pupils alone, look at frogs. Diurnal frogs have horizontal pupils, nocturnal frogs have vertical pupils, and frogs that are awake at any hour tend to have round pupils. But that being said, there exists a frog with heart shaped pupils.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mantis shrimp, like most (if not <em>all</em>) arthropods, have compound eyes, and therefore have no pupils. Furthermore, the business with their color-sensing cells seems likely to be a mechanism evolved to be able to perceive color without a corresponding increase in brain capacity. Human color vision relies on a few color photoreceptors, and our brains do a lot of the work of transducing and interpreting color information. In the case of mantis shrimp, the wider variety of photoreceptors likely doesn’t enable a wider and richer depth of color perception, but rather acts as a kind of “pre-processing” system that sends color data to thethe animal’s brain which requires little, if any, further processing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are your descriptions of focus backwards? A vertical pupil should appear to blur things vertically throughout the whole field of view, since the vertical aperture is effectively larger than the horizontal. Still a little unclear on how that might help predators vs pretty though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The left and right sides of vision of a vertical pupil would be blurry while the top and bottom would be more in focus I believe (i could be wrong). I think there are lots of exceptions to the predator/prey categorizations I gave but in general a wide horizontal view is better for prey while vertical view would be better for a predator which might be surveying from up in a tree looking down etc.</p></div>		</li>
