			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit of extra to add to this comment: The reason that we pick up on these things is because humans are <em>insanely good</em> at seeing patterns. We're so good at it that we see patterns in things we're not supposed to, and we do it all the time. It's why we can see animals in clouds and faces of dead celebrities in malformed potato chips. It's how conspiracy theorists weave a deranged conclusion out of a web of insanity.</p>
<p>And it's not just visual patterns we're good at. One really interesting example of this is the 'red flag' phenomenon, where you just get a Bad Feeling™ about someone, even if you haven't actually seen them do anything that warrants caution. But in many cases, this red flag turns out to be right all along.</p>
<p>That's the pattern recognition in our brains going off. There was just something about the person that set off your internal alarms. Maybe you've subconsciously noticed similar expressions, speech patterns, behaviors, etc. in people who did actually turn out to be bad people in the past. Your brain keeps extensive records of that sort of thing whether you're aware of it or not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This man got jumped outside a club and hit his head, which gave him brain damage. They think the injury damaged the part of the brain that regulates patterns that are registered consciously and those that are registered subconsciously. </p>
<p>He can't help but see mathematical/geometric patterns in literally everything he sees. In his vision, he is swarmed by lines and patterns that his brain recognises, and he can't tune it out. Really interesting watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why the “shuffle” option for music playlists doesn’t actually shuffle the songs randomly. It uses a complex algorithm to make the songs <em>feel</em> random, because actual randomness isn’t random enough and our brains would find patterns in the song order that don’t really exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, computers cant do &quot;random&quot;.  They can simulate it, though.  In your playlist example, the &quot;complex algorithm&quot; is actually the computer just giving each song a number value, then picking the order of songs by linking them to a process number. If the computer executed a process that ended in a 3, the song linked to the number 3 is played.  Im pretty sure that I explained it incorrectly, but the concept is the same.  A computer can not do random. Now go, and figure out the system used to pick lottery numbers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He can see a pattern and usually he will know his next 5 or 10 moves, changing with what his opponent does, which can be hundreds to thousands of variations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain is very, very good at finding patterns. To the point of inventing them. Literally to a fault. Sometimes it's a great gut reaction, sometimes it's someone finding a religious extremist concept and inciting some very bad things. Good with the bad scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this also apply to very young children? Starting when I was as young as 2 or 3 I instinctively despised/was terrified of my family’s landscaper (an ostensibly very nice, likable man who had never given me/my family a reason not to trust him).I remember I’d go into hysterics whenever I found out he was at the house, crying and hiding and being a general nightmare. I’d insist on carrying around slap bracelets and the sword from my Mulan Barbie as though they were actual self-defense weapons. Most of my memories of him are of my parents constantly apologizing for my atrocious behavior. </p>
<p>16 years later he went to prison for raping and attempting to murder his wife.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In the early morning of March 11, 2014, the Dawids' teenage son was awakened by loud noises. Coming out of his bedroom, he saw his father dragging his mother by the arms, with a towel over her face, toward the garage, police said. The boy called 911. </p>
<p>When police arrived, they said, Dawid answered the door and they noticed he had droplets of blood on his shirt. They said he first told them he had gotten into a fight with the dog, but then blurted out, &quot;I might as well be straight with you guys, just put the handcuffs on me now and take me to jail. ... She's in the garage. I tried to kill her.”</p>
<p>Police said they went into the family's three-bay garage, where they found the victim lying face down on the cement floor, gasping for air and convulsing. A rope noose was suspended from the ceiling and there was a stepladder set up next to it.</p>
<p>Police said when they asked Dawid what had happened, he stated, &quot;I tried to hang her.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From his sentencing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The victim, who is in the process of divorcing Dawid, was too terrified to come to court. So her lawyer read her lengthy statement to Judge Robert Devlin</p>
<p>Dawid, dressed in a bright-orange prison jumpsuit, his hands chained behind his back, stood staring down at the table in front of him as the statement was read: “I know when he is released from prison he is going to kill me. ... He is a violent man with no regard for life, animal or human,” the victim stated. </p>
<p>“It's flabbergasting to me that (the victim) would say things that are so hurtful,&quot; Dawid retorted when given a chance to speak by the judge. &quot;I was a loving husband and during our 18 years of marriage I supported my family 100 percent. She is just trying to make me look worse than I really am,&quot; he said before being cut off by his lawyer, Edward Gavin, who quickly added, &quot;He understands she is fearful and he will not have any further contact with her.&quot;</p>
<p>“I was hoping to hear some expression of profound sorrow,&quot; the judge replied...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible others got the same impression but since he hadn't done anything wrong they consciously pushed the idea away in order to not seem judgemental/paranoid, whereas kids are way more likely to 'go with their gut' and say what they think no matter what. I remember when I was about 8 my aunt got a new boyfriend, when I met him something was just <em>off</em> and I did not like being around him at all. My parents thought I was racist because he was black. Well a couple years later he got arrested for child pornography... So I think it's very possible the pattern recognition applies to kids too.</p></div>		</li>

Also, a child that young cant even comprehend &quot;right and wrong,&quot; much less identify each based on societal norms.

<p>Something in my hindbrain just screamed <em>murderer!</em> at me. I froze in my car and just watched him. I didn't move until he was gone. </p>
