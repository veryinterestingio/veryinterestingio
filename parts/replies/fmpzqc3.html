			<div class="markdown"><p>Pro tip: lick your finger and wet the tip of the pen then draw a little circle on you jeans to get the ball moving again, then it will likely work better in the old spot.</p>
<p>You could just lick the pen but that's nasty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the same reason why when creating a color pencil drawing you need to use light pressure. That way you don’t crush the “mountains into the valley” as my art teacher would put it and it allows you to blend color better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, a ballpoint pen often stops working when there's a bit of grease or oil on the paper. The oil gets into the ball head and it doesn't roll, it slides. If it's not rolling, it's not going to produce ink. </p>
<p>That's why when you write on a new section of the paper, sometimes it takes a few strokes to get it to start writing again, you're getting the obstruction clear from the ball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the more correct answer. The tolerances used the manufacturing of ballpoint pens are crazy small so it doesnt take much to clog up the tip.</p></div>		</li>
