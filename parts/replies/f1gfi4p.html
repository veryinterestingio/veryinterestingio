			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this is the boring part... you get a sample with lots of atoms in it, then get lucky. It's not as though you can tag a single atom ahead of time, name it Bill, and then pick Bill out of a crowd. It's more like reaching into a ball pit and knowing that you can pick out a ball. </p>
<p>For an STM or AFM though, you can actually look at the sample and move individual atoms of your choice around, but that works much better with solids, so at the least you'd need frozen Oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you can do is Laser cool the atoms, and isolate them into a cloud using, for example, a MOT. That stands for Magneto-Optical Trap. This allows you to create a relatively dense cloud (compared to the background pressure which may be something like 10^-10 torr or soemthing), and then you can simply turn on the light for your trap and the atoms will more or less fall in. There is a bit of nuance to this actually because you can trap atoms in such a way that they will be trapped in an area of high light intensity, or in an area of low light intensity. For tweezers, it might make sense that these using the intensity seeking type trap because they are really just focused beams of light, so the atoms are drawn to the focus which has the highest intensity. For the other type of traps, where the atoms are repelled by the light, the geometry of the laser for the trap has to be more complicated because you need to surround the atom with light, but have the atom be in the dark. there are a lot of ways to do this, like bottle beams. in practice this laser cooling/MOT setup is what a lot of labs use that want to trap atoms because it allows you create a area of high density where you are more likely to catch an atom, and then to turn the MOT off and to have this very low pressure in the chamber where your trap is since collisions with background atoms is one of the main ways that your atoms can be lost from the trap.</p>
<p>Although, it occurs to me now that for oxygen this might be particularly difficult. I work with Rb87 which is monoatomic and very easy to work with because it can be approximated as hydrogenic, that is it has a single valence electron like hydrogen. Oxygen is a diatomic molecule though....there is laser cooling of molecules done, and people have made MOTs with molecules but it gets very hard because the energy levels of the electrons get very complicated very fast. and with just a cursory search i didnt find any papers with oxygen MOTs. But anyway in principle that is how you would likely go about it. trapping an atom or molecule at pressures about 10^-7 torr would be pretty fruitless because the lifetime of the atoms in the trap gets very short due to collisions. And they need to be cooled down to very low temperatures anyway ( like ÂµK) becasue the depth of the traps is very small, like 1mK is a pretty typtical depth for neutral atom optical traps. They can be deeper but you need a lot of laser power.</p>
<p>EDIT: oh i found something marginally relevent but they seem to use a very different method of trapping then what im familier with. But they do trap oxygen <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00155.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00155.pdf</a></p></div>		</li>
