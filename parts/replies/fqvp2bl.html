<p>For those exclusive to humans, elimination would require interventions of sufficient duration and efficacy to result in no hosts passing the virus on to others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question. Take the 2 week period for symptoms to show up and the contagious stage to lapse, it would never happen let's say everybody was able to and did abide by a 2 week quarantine and no transmission happened. Does that stop the virus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it might. But as you acknowledge, it makes a lot of assumptions around being perfect. We would need to also assume that the virus that is shed from humans after this period is non-functional, and that everyone eliminates it fully.</p>
<p>What if we have a Typhoid Mary situation where a host remains chronically infected, and sheds active virus indefinitely, while showing no signs or having any symptoms?</p>
<p>That would be bad.</p>
<p>We donâ€™t have any evidence of this happening by the way, just a grim hypothetical that we have to consider.</p>
<p>Basically we need a vaccine, or massive testing and contact tracing, with good therapy to minimize severe disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I have understood correctly, there are reports of the virus remaining active for much longer than the two weeks, including one case of conjunctivitis that lasted two months and the eyes continued to have the active virus even when respiratory tests were clear. Though I don't know whether the person was contagious during that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New influenza strains often originate in birds - wild waterfowl, mostly, and all over the world. These strains can be transmitted to domestic birds <em>or</em> to other domestic animals, and then end up in humans when we interact with them. We often call pigs and chickens mixing vessels for influenza because of this; they have their own influenzas circulating, like humans - but they also get infected with human strains from farm workers, and with wild (generally avian-origin) strains from passing wildlife and waterfowl. This is understood to be the origin of the new pandemic H1N1 influenza that broke out in. 2009. It spilled over into humans from pigs, if I recall, but the pigs themselves had a strain that was a mixture of human/swine/avian segments because of what was probably a series of co-infections from different strains.
Fortunately, most of the time the &quot;new&quot; strain isn't good at spreading among humans (see, H5N1 - scary, highly-pathogenic, but not very transmissible) or if it is good at spreading, it's not highly-lethal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought H1N1 was the strain responsible for the 1918 flu pandemic? I know H1N1 was here in 2009, but when I've read about the 1918 flu epidemic is mentions H1N1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally this is only likely to happen where people and birds interact frequently, and closely - poultry workers, for example, with H5N1 and H9N7 strains. But it does happen and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>It may happen more frequently, but we only ever find out about the nasty ones that cause large outbreaks that are reported on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Influenza viruses have special genomes that get put together in a casette-like fashion. When more than one strain infects the same host, then the casettes can get shuffled around and you get pandemics. This is called antigen shift. These hosts are usually fowl - hence bird flu - or pigs - hence swine flu.</p></div>		</li>
