			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, it was actually pretty common for many of the 'great' conquerors to simply employ the current administrators to redirect taxes to them after conquering a region. The Romans and the Mongols were pretty infamous for doing so.</p>
<p>You have to remember that during the age when empires were forming, the middle ages, feudalism was in high swing in most of Europe. This meant that you answered to the next rank up, and they answered to the next rank up, and so on and so forth. So while a kingdom may change hands, the baron you worked for could potentially stay the same, while answer to a new duke, and that duke may or may not answer to a new king, who may or may not answer to a new emperor. </p>
<p>In many ways, it's similar to how an umbrella corporation may takeover a local company that gets big enough, and simply let them continue to run under their current CEO/admin staff, while folding them into their own brand and redirecting finances to themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>coins were super, super important to empires. Because think about it; for the average commoner, even if you live in a capital city, you're never going to see your head of state any closer than over the heads of thousands of others. To you, the picture on the coin <em>is</em> King Hoitytoit, even if it looks nothing like the real man. </p>
<p>I've presented an academic paper on how Emperor Augustus used this exact form of propaganda to gain power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MA tried to style himself after Dionysus and Hercules at different points. IMO he was trying to channel Bacchic processional imagery and equate it with him like, returning from Egypt/Hellenic world to Rome.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Octavian was able to spin that into &quot;Antony is a drunk Greek bastard who's going to destroy Roman morality&quot; while also styling himself to appear more &quot;traditionally Roman&quot;. Apollo imagery was a part of it.</p>
<p>That it feels more natural to call him &quot;Mark Antony&quot; instead of &quot;Marcus Antonius&quot; is really a testament to how well this worked.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Augustus always sought to bring himself to the level of the general
populace, while still subtly stating his right to rule. The coin reveres
Augustus as a holy man, with the obverse side referring to him as DIVI FPATER PATRIAE, which translates to “Son of God, A Father to his People”
and additionally employs various pagan symbols in homage to the Roman
priesthood, which Augustus presided over. The power of this title lies in the
notion that essentially Rome was his child that he created then raises to
maturation, even though Rome had a substantially rich history and culture
before his reign. Thus, <strong>using coinage as propaganda to normalize the image
of Augustus as an imperial leader played an integral role in the success of
his rule being accepted</strong>&quot;</p>
