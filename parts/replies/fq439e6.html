			<div class="markdown"><p>There is something called the essential fat reserves, and if you go below a certain percentage the risk is not just to cardiovascular but to basically every function in your body. Endocrine system, hormonal balance, gastrointestinal system, skeletal system etc.</p>
<p>For men that's something like 3-5% (and elite bodybuilders tend to skirt close to unhealthy). For women it's closer to 15%, and it's not uncommon for female athletes to have an interrupted period and osteoporosis (weakening bones) because of a lack of essential fat.</p></div>		</li>

Having worked with women who had very low body fat in their teenage years (eating disorders), some went on to never be able to have children or require fertility treatment as a result of their previously low body fat even after recovering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of reasons why strength competition guys tend to be stockier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong stabilizing muscles. When you lift heavy the smaller muscles that give you stability and prevent injury have to be strong. While bodybuilders tend to focus on achieving a ratio that &quot;looks good&quot; the powerlifter and strongman builds for strength and stability. That gives you pretty stocky build.</li>
<li>Mass is leverage. Fat isn't necessarily detrimental. Yes, a lifter without a lot of fat will have more lean mass for their weight, but sheer weight can be used to overpower things.</li>
<li>If you diet to get rid of fat you get rid of musclemass as well. Without &quot;cutting&quot; and with a massive calorie intake (to power those muscles and the long training sessions) you develop a bit of bulk.</li>
<li>Having a bit of a gut gives you a stronger squat, since it gives your legs something to push off precisely when it counts the most.</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They build different muscles for different reasons is the main point.</p>
<p>Bodybuilders are more for glamor, while weightlifters are all about function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone should probably mention that you don’t actually have to get that low to look good either. Athletes are usually in the 8-10% range (for men). 10-12% is still pretty slim, enough to get decent looking abs and have your clothes fit really nice. You’re not starting to get pudgy until you get above 16% or so (although mind you, everyone is a little different).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It generally isn't an issue for men. It's definitely an issue for women, where excessive training and dieting can lead to careers being ruined before they've even really begun (training and diets lead to lower fat percentage than is healthy, leading to skeletal issues leading to career ending bone and tendon injuries).</p></div>		</li>
