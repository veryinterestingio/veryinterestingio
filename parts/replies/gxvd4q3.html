<p>The allergic response is normally reserved for parasites - notably worms - which we no longer encounter on a regular basis. Communities with endemic worm infections have dramatically lower rates of type 2 autoimmunity, and the same communities have increasing rates after going through deworming treatments. Seems like there's something there!</p></div>		</li>
