			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a bunch of weird facts/phenomenons about the moon. This one, and also the fact that the reason a total solar eclipse is even possible when the sun is 400 times bigger than the moon, is because the moon is 400 times closer to Earth than the sun is. Or something like that. </p></div>		</li>
