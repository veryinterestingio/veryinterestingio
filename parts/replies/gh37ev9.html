<p>That said, I've also contributed to a paper that showed solid diverter materials are going to have a life time of weeks due to helium implanting, forming bubbles, and blistering.</p>
<p>Also, make no mistake, plasma disruptions will be a bad time, as that energy will rapidly deposit it's energy into a surface, and some of that surface will boil off.</p></div>		</li>
