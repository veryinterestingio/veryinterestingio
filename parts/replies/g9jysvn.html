<p>Here's one that's adapted in a unique way to stay unicellular and grow quite large. It's not &quot;totally different&quot; but that'd probably need a branch off a a decent bit earlier than algae to occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer that I learned in biology 101 to this is that the surface are a to volume ratio makes it problematic for cells to get too large. </p>

<p>For a sphere, the volume increases proportionally to r^(3) but the surface area only increases proportionally to r^(2). That means that as it grows larger, it as much more stuff inside to maintain relative to the area touching the outside through which it can gather nutrients. This is not an insurmountable problem, but it'd require significant adaptation to address.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by “totally different set up of biology”</p>
<p>This algae is a single celled organism that looks kind of like a seaweed with things that resemble stalks and leaves.</p>
