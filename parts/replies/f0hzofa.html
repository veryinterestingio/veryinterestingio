<p>In the comment section here you have got a few videos in which a google AI makes reservations for a haircut and in a restaurant by phone. Will those service workers on the phone feel betrayed, and unsafe about future interactions, when it turns out that they have not been talking to a human? Answer: Only if the people behind the calls don't show up to their appointments.</p>

<p>While not everyone would be bothered by it, big tech companies have to consider this.</p>

<p>I think the potential here is very big to just give in to prejudices regarding our response. Sure, we <em>think</em> that we would feel very bothered and unsafe, once we can't be sure about whether we talk to a human or a machine. But will we?</p>
<p>Most of the calls and interactions that a machine will easily be able to take over are pretty mechanical in nature. It's social interaction on a conveyor belt: &quot;Take calls and receive appointments&quot;, is part of your job description. &quot;Oh, I didn't even notice!&quot;, will probably be all the reaction you get out of professionals minding phones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think many customer service workers would actually rather deal with the Google assistant over self-entitled and rude customers. As someone who has worked in a call center, I don't give a shit about the other person on the line, I just want to get my job done so I can draw a paycheck. </p>
<p>If Google can make the assistant straightforward and to the point, that would be amazing for me personally, because I can go back to playing games on my phone. </p>
<p>To address your concern, Google can say something along the lines of &quot;This is a Google assistant call&quot; at the start of every call.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My education in a direction of ICT that includes AI development.</p>

<p>For now it's &quot;just&quot; a thought experiment. Technology isn't far enough yet to get fully beyond the uncanny valley (although we're close!), so research to the real life reactions aren't possible yet. Hench my choice or words (&quot;can&quot;, &quot;if they were&quot;, &quot;would be&quot;).</p>
<p>You're talking about Google Duplex, which is a really cool AI! However, they do start their conversations with a disclaimer, they are not pretending like they're the real human who's trying to make a reservation, which helps people deal with it. So far I've heard people say &quot;it sounds so much <em>like a real human</em>!&quot;, which isn't a response someone would give if they didn't notice it was a robot at all.</p>
<p>If I remember right, Google Duplex didn't have the disclaimer at the start of the phone calls at first and were getting some backlash because of that. The AI has definitely created a storm of discussions about the ethical side of AI within the industry though, in part because once the technology works flawlessly, it won't stay restricted to professional calls..</p></div>		</li>
