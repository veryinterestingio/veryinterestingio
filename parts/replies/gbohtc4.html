			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Listen to a familiar person's recording or even phone call. They don't sound the same IRL, do they? So you don't sound the same either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>usually its that you dont obstruct your ears and they're more subtle/covert than full on headphones (probably less so than TWS earbuds though)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have these too. Mainly we bought them because my husband has hearing loss in one ear. He has rebuilt ear bones. These kind of skip that part, or just transmit better than on ear or earbuds. They are the opposite of noise canceling but that's what i want. I can hear if the kids need me or hear cars while walking. You also can hear the headphones better over constant background noises. They don't hurt my ears since they sit in front of them instead of on top. We really like them.</p></div>		</li>
