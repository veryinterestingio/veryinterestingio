			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone uses bcp solely to prevent pregnancy. It's also used to control some PCOS symptoms/associated imbalances like hirsutism or hormonal imbalances like excess testosterone. Estrogen may be more suited for that than progesterone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that’s why I personally prefer calling it HRT because I have always used it for hormone replacement due to endometriosis and eventually the hysterectomy/ooferectomy I had for my endometriosis. Now I’m on estrogen only HRT because progesterone doesn’t benefit my condition enough to risk the side effects progesterone could have when used long term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting, especially for anyone concerned about their own treatment as it relates here, the rate of blood clots is significantly increased up to 5 times the normal rate during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period - and it's not exactly commonplace even still.. I'm not aware of anyone fretting too much over this risk when considering pregnancy, aside from those with significant risk factors, of course.. and as noted, those people most at risk are considered contraindicated (i.e. ineligible) for estrogen-containing contraceptives.</p>
<p>Given other related sources of blood clots such as pregnancy being avoided with birth control, and the limiting of its use to those at low risk, the case can be made for the widespread use of birth control in a population actually LOWERING the prevalence of blood clots in that population! At the end of the day, regardless of the treatment and condition, there must be a solid argument for the benefits outweighing the risks for it to be considered. This is a good case to illustrate one component (focusing on blood clots) of such a balance, which must be considered during the prescribing process. Neat stuff.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a pulmonary embolism caused by birth control 8 years ago. Now that I’m pregnant, I’m on preventative blood thinners. I envy the people who don’t have to fret too much about this risk, because the blood thinners are no fun.</p></div>		</li>
