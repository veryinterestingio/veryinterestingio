			<div class="markdown"><p>Those percentages are based on epidemiological data. So it's usually comparing smokers to non-smokers. They see that on average smokers are x more likely to get y cancer. It's all one big average, not usually a discrete factor. You can later substratify by age, sex, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case, 50% more likely means that you have 50% more chances than the same individual that doesn't have the habit. If you had 0.2% chances and you do something that makes you 50% more likely to get cancer, you have 0.3% chances to get it. If you do something that doubles your chances, that's 0.4% chances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The percent is derived from non-exposed people. The wording sounds scary. Say your risk of developing a disease is 0.1%. If an exposure makes you five times as likely to develop that disease, your risk is now 0.5%. A great example of statistical significance that may or may not be clinically relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, your odds of getting lung cancer from anything other than smoking might be 1/80,000,000, but after smoking now it's 1/10million, 8Ã— more likely!!! ....but still only 1/10million (which means 36 Americans would be at risk)</p>
<p>Note: these are not official risk numbers, I'm just making point</p></div>		</li>
