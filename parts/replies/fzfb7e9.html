			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Rome and quite close to the Vatican One day I turned my guitar amp on to heat up the valves (the jack was not connected to the guitar), and after 5 minutes or so i started hearing someone speaking in a strange language and since i live alone at first I was kinda confused. After a few more minutes I realized the amp was transmitting a mass in latin from the Vatican radio station (Radio Maria).  Based on how i turned the tone knob (iirc) I was able to tune it so that the sound was pretty clear. Those guys must have some damn big antennas!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also yeah, Radio Maria having big antennas is an Italian inside joke, when no other radio can be heard, you can be damn sure your car will pick up Radio Maria’s signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can assure you from personal experience that you can listen to RM in Sardinia, on the alps and in Ibiza too. I used to have problems tuning in to local radios just by leaving the city... This probably makes the priests on their radio station some of the most renown radio personalities in Europe (of the world).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty amazing. I had a weird thing happen to me a couple times, my big Sony bookshelf speakers were plugged into my computer which was off and i started hearing someone's voice coming out of them. It was the strangest voice I've ever heard, it sounded like an elderly black man talking to another man of similar appearance on an old ham radio. They used a lot of slang and I could never really make out anything specific they were discussing, just lots of generalities, was fascinating. One thing he kept repeating was &quot;Bingo Bango.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, in second grade there were old books in the corner of the room and I read “Elbert the Mind Reader”, kid gets a filling and hears the radio, finds if he brushes that tooth he can mind read for a minute, then it was basically <em>Teen Wolf</em>. Good story, recommended to all redditors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not obvious. If you had a metal filling that could oscillate in sync with an AM signal placed just so, it would vibrate your jaw, which is connected to your ear and you’d hear it. </p>
<p>This is essentially what jawbone headphones are. </p>
<p>It won’t work with FM, though. And it has to be an accident really.</p></div>		</li>
