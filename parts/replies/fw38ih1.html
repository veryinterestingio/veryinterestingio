<p>If the leadership is worth a damn, they would include the tasks given and the performance in the NCOER. The next time the soldier comes up on the promotion list, the NCOER should show that they already have experience in the position which would be a leg up on those that don't have that experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The situation being described is different than that of a battlefield commission... and administratively the E5 or E6 filling the E7 slot has a different title &quot;E6 Promotable&quot; signifying that as soon as they finish the training requirements/schools the promotion is practically automatic.</p>
<p>A Battlefield commission is subverting what should be an Act of Congress to create an officer from an enlisted.  I've only known one and he was old as dirt in the late 90's.  Got it in Vietnam and stayed in so long as a JAG he had to call the DoD to remind them that the updated retirement paperwork didn't factor in his method of commission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the promotion system is different for enlisted than for commissioned officers.</p>
<p>A solder is promotable (for noncommissioned ranks) when a specific set of requirements are met, typically when time in service and time in grade are achieved. They can also be put on the promotable list if the leadership wants them on the list. The soldier then needs to make the points requirement. Depending on the state of the army, they may be promoted with or without completion of WLC, BNOC, or ANOC. </p>
<p>Battlefield commissions are typically reserved during manpower shortages when replacement officers can't come in fast enough. The more traditional way for an enlisted soldier to gain a commission is the green to gold program (army). I'm not sure if there are similar programs in the other branches.</p>
<p>[Edit]</p>
<p>I see the original post was deleted. The person was talking about enlisted soldiers filling higher enlisted ranks such as an E5 filling the role of an E7. There have been times where that has happened, but that's usually due to attrition higher than replacements can come in. It's typically the senior E6 that steps in until a new E7 can take over. The NCOER should mention this since it is a role above the pay grade.</p></div>		</li>
