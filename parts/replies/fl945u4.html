			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted this elsewhere in the thread, but wanted to be sure sure you saw it — this documentary includes THE DUDE who located and dug up bodies (twice!) from the permafrost. Really fascinating. (Bonus: a young Dr. Fauci is featured towards the end of the film!)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but reconstructed 1918 is classified a US National Select Agent and research (in the US) can only be performed by scientists with a specific security clearance (source: I had that clearance in 2009) and in specialized BSL3+ labs that have also undergone enhanced biosafety and security checks. Look up CFR 73 for the actual Us federal code. </p>
<p>I’m not sure how many non-CDC labs are working with 1918. I’ve been out of influenza research for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They reconstructed the original virus and you can see some electron microscopy images of it, which is pretty cool. One of the reasons that Spanish flu was so deadly is because people hadn’t been exposed to H1N1 previously so there was no pre-existing immunity whereas now most people would have been exposed to H1N1 through vaccination and/or a previous infection, so even with the Swine flu pandemic where a really contagious strain was spreading the overall mortality rates stayed pretty low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not entirely correct. In the article, they compare it to a seasonal H1N1 strain. The 1918 virus has differences that make it massively better at replicating in tissue than the seasonal one(Notably the RNA polymerase). See this article for some more specifics: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3029258/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3029258/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did fully reconstruct it. They tested it on mice. The mice reacted very badly and in ways very similar to humans in 1918. It proved to be a very rapid reproducer. When they cut snippets out of it and mixed it with other viruses it wasnt very potent, just that specific combination of features.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  They infected an animal with it.  The animal then showed signs of the symptoms described in history.</p></div>		</li>
