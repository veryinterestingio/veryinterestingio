			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretical answer: anywhere between 0-14 days. After 14 days, the chances of you becoming positive from a test drops to below 1%. Hence why states have a 14 day interstate travel policy. </p>
<p>In addition to the parent comment- one of the problems is that we don’t have a single standardized test, nor do we have a “recipe” for how to make the test in various diagnostic labs. While the labs that currently have the EUA to make a test (so long as they validate 5 correct positives/negatives), it’s far from being standardized. This introduces a different margin of error for every different lab that’s conducting the tests.</p>

<p>I would link to this but I’m on mobile and for some reason it’s not working? Anyways, google “Planet Money How to Test a Country” and it’ll pop up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the standard testing include an antibody test? I had a fever with chills and body aches, so I did a drive-thru test that came back negative. When they called with results I didn't think to ask if they could tell if I'd already had asymptomatic exposure, but they did mention that I could still get the disease. I don't know if that means they can tell I don't have the antibodies or they just presume I don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibody testing is different! In all likelihood, If you got a nasal swab, they’re testing levels of viremia (for current infection). If you got a blood test in relation to COVID-19, that was likely antibody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So for interstate travel, for every 10,000 people traveling across state lines, given a false negative for a test is just below 1%, that still lets through 100 people that are potentially infected.</p>
<p>What's the ultimate metric being managed? The number of new cases per day? And is that number ultimately selected as a function of... new hospitalizations per day?</p>
<p>In the spectrum of possible national and worldwide responses to a pandemic, where are we in that spectrum? If there were a significantly higher mortality rate, or if this were the zombie apocalypse, are there more extreme steps we can take? And, would those additional steps significantly change the ultimate national and worldwide outcome?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry to split hairs, but there is one tiny mistake with your reasoning - the test doesn't have a percentage of false negatives or false positives, it has a sensitivity and specificity.  The false negative rate is generated based on the pre-test probability of the population being infected.  For example, if you have a test that has relatively low sensitivity, but you use it in an imaginary population that has zero COVID infections the test ends up having no false negatives!  A perfect test (but only in that population)!  On the other hand if you are talking about using this test on people leaving the NYC area you have a much bigger problem with lots of false positives even though you are using the same test.</p>
<p>To answer your OTHER questions, no one knows.  When this is all over the public health system will simultaneously be blamed for doing too much and also for not doing enough - its really frustrating because this is completely uncharted territory and no one really knows exactly what the right thing to do is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your response, I'm hoping you can help explain, if I have symptoms such as: migraine, deep mucousy cough, fever around 99-100 for the past 5 days unable to keep food down for more than an hour.  </p>
<p>Yet my test result from day 4 came back negative, does that mean my body is beating it, or maybe I didn't have it? I NEVER get sick so this is really out of character for my body.</p>
<p>My work says I'm cleared with that negative result, yet my doc says symptoms point to a possible false negative. Work don't care what doc says...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ask doc for a repeat test, don't go to work. If you get two negatives then it's a little more convincing. Either way you probably shouldn't go to work when sick regardless. That expectation needs to be addressed with your employer, if they give you trouble, reach out to your local public health office.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How many times have you been tested? You could be fighting something else, but your symptoms are somewhat concerning. I’m with your doc on this one. I’m a med tech (I run the covid tests) and people can be negative with symptoms then turn up positive after being tested again. Nurses on the floors are so frustrated because they’re sure a patient is positive, yet continues to test negative for the virus. It’s very confusing and frustrating since no one knows a whole lot about this virus. If your employer insists you return to work, wear a mask (N95 is you can get your hands on one) and try to stay away from people when possible. Good luck and I hope you feel better.</p></div>		</li>

Thank you for everything you guys are doing I know it doesn't help you directly, but it's nice to know there's good people out there fighting the good fight.</p></div>		</li>
