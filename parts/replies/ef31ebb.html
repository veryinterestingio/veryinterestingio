			<div class="markdown"><p>For scale, the diameter of a nucleus is somewhere around 10^-15 m, so you have to make a person (10^10 )^3 = 10^30 = 1000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 times smaller than an atomic nucleus to make him collapse into a black hole.</p>
<p>My gut feeling is that the person would not survive the compression long enough to experience collapsing into a black hole, and also that quantum gravity effects would probably not be negligible for a 85 kg black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn't expect so many answers!
I think I'm still a bit confused about the sequence of events. Lets start with a normal neutron star, with nearly enough density to overcome the strong nuclear force. Is the density of this neutron star uniform or is it denser at the core? When we add some matter to it, at some point the force of gravity will overcome the strong nuclear force, but the average density is still not enough to form a black hole. I assume that it takes some non-zero time for the matter to collapse into a radius small enough to form a black hole. Wouldn't the core of the neutron star achieve this density before the rest of the collapsing shell?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your misunderstanding comes from the density of a black hole, and therefore how it forms in this scenario. If you consider a black hole to take the volume of inside its event horizon, then the bigger the black hole the lower its density. A black hole with the mass of the earth would be the size of a marble, which you can imagine would have a very very large density. The super massive black hole in the center of the milky way for example has a density similar to that of the water that you drink. Put another way,  let's assume matter to be incompressible, you could still gather enough of it to make it inside it's schwarzschild radius. If you gather millions of solar masses of water, it would be a black hole even if the water did not compress at any point. That's just how the math works out - smaller black holes require higher density.</p>
<p>Back to the collapsing star. Your assumption was that the first place to have matter contained within it's schwarzschild radius, and therefore be the start of the black hole, would be a tiny amount of mass in the center as it collapses. But that isn't how it works. The smaller black hole, the higher the density needed. As the core collapses, the density rises. The first set of matter to be contained inside its schwarzschild radius would therefore be the set with the lowest density, which therefore has to be the largest set, which is the entire core.</p>
<p>If an atomic black hole is created, it is theorized to explode with Hawking radiation immediately just like you said (our theories kinda break down when you get into quantum gravity like this, but that's a story for a different time), but an atomic black hole is never created. The first black hole created in this instance is the entire core of the star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black holes don't necessarily form from neutron stars. They form from normal stars that run out of fuel .  Neutron stars are actually formed ...the same way just when the star isn't massive enough to form a black hole.  When a normal star becomes a black hole i believe it is more or less instantaneous.</p></div>		</li>
