			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, most movies aren't depicting our asteroid belt. Maybe there is one out there that's more similar in density to Saturn's rings (though it'd have to be between 2 massive objects constantly halting accretion of that much stuff).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rings have a density of the order of ~0.1 g/cm^(3). Filling the same volume as above with that we get a total mass of 1.4 million solar masses. Well... no. It has to be much smaller, and then the question is what keeps it like that.</p></div>		</li>
