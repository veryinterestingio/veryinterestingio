			<div class="markdown"><p>One other thing to watch out for is that fish in the Scombridae family (includes mackerel, tuna, bonito/skipjack) release histamine into the flesh even after death.  EDIT: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scombroid_food_poisoning" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> (thanks to /u/fearthejet for reminding me about this) Scombridae fish have high levels of Morganella (bacteria that produces histamine).  Killing the bacteria by cooking ONLY helps if they've not already released histamine... but will have no effect on histamine already released by the bacteria.  So it's imperative that the food is handled and transported below 40ºF from origin to destination.</p>
<p>It's when raw scombroid fish are handled at temperatures above 40ºF  at any point in the process from stream to table that it can be dangerous to consume.</p>
<p>At a minimum, don't ever order these from any supplier or restaurant that doesn't flash freeze their fish at the point of origin.</p>
<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> There is NO such thing as &quot;sashimi grade&quot; tuna... it's either handled and stored properly or improperly.  And no, &quot;good&quot; sashimi is not &quot;fresh off the boat&quot;... it's flash frozen, thawed to just above freezing at its destination, and dry aged for two weeks to cut the moisture, amplifying the natural flavor.  Anyone who tells you otherwise has no idea what they're talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Causes histamine poisoning... Histamine is a neurotransmitter associated with your immune response.  The symptoms of histamine poisoning can resemble the range of symptoms of an allergic reaction (caused by histamine being secreted by your own mast cells as an immunologic response that makes your blood vessels more permeable to white blood cells for fighting infection), from tingling in the mouth to full blown asphyxia.  Because these symptoms can accelerate rapidly, particularly if you've had a progression of histamine reactions, it is very important to be aware of the dangers.  I had a friend with me at a restaurant, we both had the seared ahi tuna... I got tingling in the mouth, he ended up in the ER within an hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I and about 4 colleagues got this eating affected tuna tacos for lunch at work one day.  We all broke out in hives and had hot waves/fever.  3 of us were beefy boys and weren't as affected.  1 girl was only about 100 lbs and she went to the emergency room it hit her so hard so fast (she was ok).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Random comment here - lots of folks where I live won't eat carp because they taste muddy. It's actually the histamine from being caught that leaves the taste. Carp taste great without the histamine - when you catch them, pop them in a keep net for awhile then kill them quick. Delicious!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen somewhere that killing fish &quot;humanely&quot; (relatively little stimulation, fast, straight to the nerves) makes them spoil slower. Forgot what the method is called, something Japanese... </p>
<p>Anyway in light of this, the glycogen conversion thing makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ike Jime. Where fish are actually slaughtered and drained of blood like all other meat we eat. Seafood generally isn't slaughtered animals, rather we asphyxiate them out of water and we eat their rotting flesh. Crabs and lobsters are slaughtered right before the pot so they taste good.     </p>
<p>I saw a video with Gordon Ramsay with locals in a Southern USA state catching catfish and it was local knowledge to actually bleed the catch immediately so it doesn't spoil as fast. And Ramsay was amazed at this knowledge, I think in his mind he related this to the Japanese method of Ike Jime and how these people on the other side of the world had that cultural knowledge.   </p>
