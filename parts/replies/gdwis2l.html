			<div class="markdown"><p>Small air bubbles are fine and won’t kill you. A whole syringe of air might. A small bubble of air will get dissolved in the blood. Larger amounts would probably fuck you up.</p>
<p>I had a picc line to give myself medication at home once and the first time I had to call the nurse line because I was so freaked out by a bubble. The nurse assured me that I wouldn’t drop dead. Did not in fact drop dead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Proof? I don't believe you. I think you did, in fact, drop dead and this is all a ruse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add a little clarity—smallish air bubbles in an IV won’t kill you because they return to the right side of the heart, then go to the lungs, then get filtered out/absorbed. BUT if you have a right-to-left shunt they’re a lot more dangerous. The bubbles can get into the coronary arteries causing a heart attack or to the brain causing a stroke. The good news is that if you have a big, regular R-to-L shunt you should already know it, and a small shunt (like a PFO, which is common) is only problematic at certain times and unlikely to be at the exact second there’s an air bubble sitting there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read and seen while working in a hospital it takes a lot of air to even be noticed.  I was told it would take about 30 to 100cc of air to kill you quickly maybe more . 1 cc is equal to a ml  and one ounce is equal to about 29 ml so 1 to4 ounce of air in your veins might kill you. 4 ounces is half a cup.  Half a cup of air in your veins will kill you.. I am probably wrong about some of this stuff so take this with a grain of salt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I have a lot of patients who are sensitive to saline injections. We’ve tried using empty syringes and filling them immediately beforehand to see if they’re better but with most patients it doesn’t matter. Maybe psychosomatically with some. Even if you fill the syringes immediately beforehand, the saline you’re using to fill the syringes still comes stored in plastic vials or bags. If you could find saline in glass vials, it might make a difference but I don’t know any manufactures who use glass vials for saline now a days.</p></div>		</li>
