			<div class="markdown"><p>It would typically be lactic acid buildup as well as fluids that have slightly backed up due to adhesions within the muscle and facial layers. It is very real.</p>
<p>When getting a good massage that releases a tight area that has been tight for a while, it flushes all of the crud  and stagnant fluid back into your system to be properly process and cleaned. If you are particularly sensitive to changes within your body, you might experience a stagnant, almost metallic taste in your mouth when all the gunk is getting flushed out.</p>
<p>If you ever feel an odd tiny crackling sensation when having a muscle worked on that has been super tight, that is a lactic acid crystal being broken up.</p>
<p>It is SUPER important to drink plenty of water after a massage. It seriously helps your body clean things up faster and you will feel better. It is also possible to experience what feels like a hangover if you do not properly hydrate after a deep massage. </p>
<p>I guess one way to think about your muscles and body is like a ball of clay. It can get dry spots that you can knead and break up to get it mobile again but it needs a little water to really become flexible again along with the kneading.</p>
<p>We really do not drink enough water in today's age. You'd be amazed how much you tune out the thirst sensation during your day.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are varying degrees of dehydration. Light, mild, moderate, severe and jerky (dead).</p>
<p>If you feel thirsty, it is more of the body giving a light reminder of its needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Just like feeling hungry doesn't mean you're malnourished or need to eat right away. There's a bunch of psychosocial factors that also come into play when feeling hungry or thirsty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, or well not to a degree you should worry about you should likely go get something to drink once you feel thirsty, like the body is great at informing you of it's water needed and unless you have a medical issue you can use this information to make a decision to go have something to drink, the alternative would be chucking down water without feeling trusty something that isn't all that great of an idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe lactic acid that can get flushed out with improved blood flow?</p>
<p>Edit: literally put this right above comment saying that the belief that lactic acid plays a role in massage is bullshit. I really dont know anything about this subject lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotes aren't data, but I went from being totally healthy to sick as a dog and back again over the space of half a day once, and the precipitating event was getting an hour-long massage from a friend who was a certified massage therapist.</p>
<p>I felt great right after the massage, then nausea and head pain like I had literally been poisoned, then i was fine again a few hours later. I'd never felt sick that way before, and didn't know this was supposedly a thing, so I doubt it was psychosomatic. </p>
<p>So while I don't have any reason to think it's a VERY serious thing, I tend to believe it's at least sort of a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was it a particularly strong, or painful massage? Like a deep tissue, or something where they use their elbows? One of the big myths of massage is that it flushes &quot;toxins&quot; out of your system. Scientifically, that has no proof at all. Massage hasn't been proven to flush &quot;toxins&quot;, or lactic acid (which has been mostly dismissed as the the reason for sore muscles).</p>
<p>However, deep tissue massage can, potentially, give you a form of mild-rhabdomyolysis (it's called massage-induced rhabdomyolysis). Symptoms like muscle fatigue, fever, nausea, urine changing color, dehydration, etc... So, in effect, harsh painful massages aren't removing toxins, they are actually dumping them in your bloodstream by crushing your muscles and damaging them.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I love massages! However, just keep in mind that, from a scientific standpoint, most of the benefits of massage are seen in the form of stress and anxiety reduction (and temporary, minor muscle relief). Your massage should be relaxing, not painful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't take any position on &quot;toxins,&quot; or really ever give this question any thought, so nobody take this as an indictment of your strong views on the subject. </p>
<p>That said, no, it wasn't very strenuous and I wasn't in any muscular pain during or after. It felt good in the way you'd expect of a massage not aimed at some form of specific rehabilitation or therapy. So it was more than a quick backrub, but nothing that felt &quot;medicinal.&quot;</p>
<p>It could also just be a coincidence that I got sick.</p></div>		</li>
