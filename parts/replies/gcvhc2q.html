			<div class="markdown"><p>That explains why I've been cold lately! When I weighed just a few pounds more I seldom felt cold. No thyroid issues according to my docs, so the lower weight would make sense. 70 degrees is too cold for me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Human metabolism only varies by a couple hundred calories per day. So the difference between &quot;low metabolism&quot; and &quot;high metabolism&quot; people is about a can of coke a day. Barely anyone counts their calories or estimates their activity levels accurately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's based on cell metabolism most likely. Unlike the initial examples, some heavy people are perpetually cold and some thin people are perpetually hot.</p>
<p>The process of metabolizing energy is what causes body to produce heat to begin with, which makes it a great contender for the root cause of an individual's general body heat expectations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, having a higher metabolic rate has multiple factors and weight is only one of them.  A higher metabolic rate means you'll be warmer - in the previous example of a teenager and a father, it's likely both of those groups of people have higher metabolic rates than a middle aged woman (the mother).</p>
<p>In addition to that, genetics plays a role.  While visceral fat is metabolically active and can insulate you a bit, it's not as thermogenically active as brown fat which doesn't line your organs as much as it subcutaneous.  There is a genetic predisposition to this type of fat and more of it will keep you warmer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Very much so infact. People who live in colder climates produce more brown fat than white fat. Brown fat is dense highly organized fat cells. White fat is larger, more volumous and generally what people think of when they picture fat on their body</p>
<p>Brown fat is a higher concentration of smaller fat cells with mitochondria. This allows those cells to contribute to heat. These are make up a larger % of fat cells in people who live in colder climates.</p>
<p>White fat is more efficient energy storage. Its less fat cells but the fat cells are MUCH larger. No ability to regulate heat natively through mitochondria in the fat cells. But because these cells are much larger in volume, you have more body volume/ surface area to disipate heat. So these are preferred by your body when living in a warmer climate.</p></div>		</li>
