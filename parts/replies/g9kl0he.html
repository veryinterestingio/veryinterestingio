			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to that the fact that on any given breath your lungs only absorb about 20% of the oxygen you inhale (meaning the air you exhale is still around 16% oxygen), and the air you exhale is only about 4% CO2 and it quickly becomes apparent that even if the mask didn't allow every single breath you exhale to fully evacuate the mask, the odds of suffocating on CO2 are still zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. That is true for water droplets, but not water vapor. As such, water droplets stick to a mask, but water vapor passes through without a care in the world.</p>
<p>However, when water vapor cools down, some of it forms droplets. Human lungs are kinda toasty compared to the outside air, so when you exhale, droplets tend to form.</p></div>		</li>
