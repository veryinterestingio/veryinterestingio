			<div class="markdown"><p>Good to note that crystal lsd is usually very hard to come by and much more expensive than cocaine.  </p>
<p>1 gram of blow usually costs 60-100$ (US) and won’t last you very long (especially not if shared).  </p>
<p>LSD is usually ~$2-10 per 100ug (100 millionths of a gram) so 1 gram would be 10,000 doses(street value $100,000, actual cost well over $1000).  So it is not something people would try to pass off as other drugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I've never read a good enough account that really explains why a bunch of them were snorting it with a sensible explanation.  Either they didn't want to admit that they knowingly were snorting a humongous amount of LSD, or someone knew a chemist and a terrible mistake was made somewhere.  </p>
<p>Note that those are the <em>prices</em>, not the cost.  I suspect that the actual cost to someone synthesizing LSD back in the 1970s was not $1000/gram even accounting for inflation.  But I have no idea what the precursors cost, either now or then.  I sure as hell don't want to google it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The precursors and equipment are heavily controlled and it takes a high level understanding of chemistry to manufacture it.  There’s only a handful of LSD chemists(heroes) making the bulk of the worlds supply.  If I were to bet Id say that they were exposed to it because they were either involved in the manufacturing of lsd or laying the crystal on the blotter and this was just the story they told the cops.  Or it may have just been stolen and confused for another drug.</p></div>		</li>
