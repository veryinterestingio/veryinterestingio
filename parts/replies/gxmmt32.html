			<div class="markdown"><p>The article on the study has this information. Note they specify correlation, not causation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, there was a direct correlation between brain activity and performance in the blind. The more accurate blind people were in solving the spatial tasks, the stronger the spatial module in the visual cortex was activated.</p>
<p>&quot;That tells us that the visual cortex in the blind takes on these functions and processes sound and tactile information which it doesn't do in the sighted,&quot; he says. &quot;The neural cells and fibers are still there and still functioning, processing spatial attributes of stimuli, driven not by sight but by hearing and touch. This plasticity offers a huge resource for the blind.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was gonna say.  Even the correlation may not be huge; something lighting up even on an fMRI does not necessarily mean there's more neuronal activity, just a change in blood flow.  While blood flow may be loosely correlated with brain activity, you're really looking at a correlation of a correlation. At least up until a few years ago or so, to the best of my knowledge, that causality had not been established.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless they did the same experiment on the same people before they went blind it's impossible to tell with certainty. But it's generally accepted that when someone is blind their other senses &quot;heighten&quot; or get better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, we don't care if an individual blind person got better. We just want to know if it's generally the case that blind people are actually better. I don't think we're worried about the correlation of people who happened to be good at detecting positional audio getting blinded?</p>
<p>If you get 100 blind people and 100 sighted people and ask them where sound is coming from, are blind people more accurate? Is the difference pretty big? Or barely noticeable? Are they just using a different part of their brain for largely similar results? These are questions we probably can have answered.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that scientific consensus based on data, or &quot;common folk knowledge based on 'well I reckon..&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever heard a blind person listen to a screen reader? It's like a superpower how quickly they can process information. It's difficult to find a video on YouTube since they usually slow it down for the sighted. For example this one is pretty slow <a href="https://youtu.be/q_ATY9gimOM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/q_ATY9gimOM</a>, Molly Burke is listening at full speed in this video I think (and she even comments that she listens on the slower end) <a href="https://youtu.be/TiP7aantnvE" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/TiP7aantnvE</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen blind people using voice navigation on smartphones and being faster at it than sighted people, with the voice speed cranked up to nigh-incomprehensibility. And of course they also don't have to be actually looking at the phone while they do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, usually surrounding brain areas encroach on the unused brain areas, which is why blind people get their other senses heightened. It's neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Something similar happens to stroke victims who have to re-learn how to walk or talk. With proper therapy other brain regions will slowly take over the new roles.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Foot amputees may experience greater orgasms because the brain area for genitals is next to the area for feet and starts encroaching on it.</p>
