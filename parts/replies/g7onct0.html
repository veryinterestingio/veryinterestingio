			<div class="markdown"><p>You should check out the Netflix documentary Kiss the Ground.  It covers the role of soil for sequestering carbon and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>It makes the point that the conventional agricultural practice of tilling the soil releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide and how no till farming could not only reduce the amount of new CO2, but help reduce legacy CO2.</p>
<p>Edit: Corrected the name of the documentary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just had it on last night! Thanks for the reminder; I must have fallen asleep just as it started. </p>
<p>I also have &quot;The Soul of Soil&quot; which is out of print, so if you find a copy, nab it, and &quot;Teeming with Microbes.&quot; I must have given away 7 copies of &quot;The Soul of Soil.&quot; Everyone decides it's a reference they don't want to live without.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to point out that it's probably more accurate to think of it as a gradient rather than a mixture. The top horizon can be completely made of decomposed organic material, but the bottom layers will have very little to none. Organic material is darker in color, so it's really easy to see the divide when you look at a cross section.</p></div>		</li>
