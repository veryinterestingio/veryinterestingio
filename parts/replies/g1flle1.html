			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t usually snore. My wife however, talks in her sleep and I swear she converses with Wookies. Usually when I snore like that it’s the position I’m laying in on the couch with my neck bent at the worst possible angles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep apnea? Had a roommate who would start snoring when awake, but he was definitely tired/about to fall asleep. He had sleep apnea and ultimately wound up falling asleep at the wheel, totalling his car into a guard rail.</p>
<p>He got a cpap after that and was fine from then on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought sleep apnea was when the airway is so blocked (usually by a tongue during snoring) that you stop breathing?</p>
<p>I've got this (and was told it was sleep apnea.  I've treated it with a device that holds my tongue forwards so that it can't fall too far back.</p>
<p>I guess the side effect is being very tired, hence your pal feel asleep at the wheel</p></div>		</li>
