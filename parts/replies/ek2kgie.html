			<div class="markdown"><p>I am familiar with several dog breeds that have serious health problems because of their breeding.   For example german shepards are prone to hereditary hip dysplasia. Could breeding for speed introduce an unintended trait, like laminitis or weak bone structure ?</p>
<p>Is it ethical to force animals to engage in an activity that they are prone to an injury that will result in their death?</p>
<p>What do you think of the ethics of things like whips and prods to encourage the horses to run faster?</p>
<p>Is it possible that these horses are given steroids or other substances that may contribute to their injuries on race days?</p>
<p>Do you have an opinion on the 23 horse deaths, after races, this year at Santa Anita? I've heard them blame compacted soil at the track but I am skeptical of such an easy answer, given that they've been compacting for many years.</p></div>		</li>
