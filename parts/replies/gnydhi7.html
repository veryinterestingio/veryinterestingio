			<div class="markdown"><p>Unrelated to Texas, but to get an idea, at my job we have multiple buildings across a large campus.</p>
<p>A few years back we lost a high voltage step-down transformer. Suffered a direct short. A piece of equipment about the size of a small room. The building it serviced was down with no electricity until it was replaced. We had to get a temporary rental generator, stationed on a flatbed, until the repair was complete.</p>
<p>This was right around the time Maria hit Puerto Rico so stock on items that were needed was severely low and it took us nearly a month to eventually get a new transformer delivered, installed, and up running. </p>
<p>This was just one building.</p>
<p>Imagine a grid losing dozens of pieces of specialized equipment, some the size of a house, all at once. Just troubleshooting and securing replacements could take weeks or months. Actual replacement even longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One important thing about the size of some of these pieces of equipment: they are extremely heavy and the transport of them alone can be extremely complicated, requiring comically huge trucks/trailers and can require surveying the route ahead of time and moving stuff out of the way. For the big stuff a lot of wires have to be temporarily raised which requires tons of coordination between the transport company and utility companies, plus coordination with all sorts of different governments to shut down traffic and escort the transport convoy.</p>
<p>So while manufacture takes time, transport alone can take weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transformers are especially vulnerable in this regard. A blown transformer in a transmission-level substation can't just have a replacement dropped in (although many high-level stations these days have a ready spare that can replace a single damaged bank unit.)  A transformer of epic size that drops 500 kilovolts to 230 isn't just available to ship- they have to be custom made (can take months) and shipped to the site via massive barges and/or very large and slow flatbed road trains.</p>
<p>The incident in the SF Bay Area several years ago, where vandals who knew what they were doing cut communication links and then opened fire on transformer cooling fins in a substation with rifles, was taken very seriously by utilities and NERC, which has since ordered heavy block walls to be installed around large-scale substations as well as surveillance equipment. As some of these huge stations are the better part of a mile square, that's a lot of construction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's... not what happens if you plug a space heater into an extension cord.</p>
<p>If you leave the cord coiled and attach a large load like a heater, the <em>cord</em> can overheat. The heater will be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me it just sounds like “if the circuit breaker hadn’t tripped we would have burnt out the toaster” except the toaster is hundreds of substations (worth millions) and the circuit breaker is whatever protection circuits are in place. “Seconds away” feels like if that protection hadn’t done it’s job the damage would be enormous... but that is why the protection is there or scarily the protection isn’t there and some junior engineer had to make the call... in which case, ! I hope the Texas grid isn’t that run down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the last flare in a several-day series, we think it was so bad in part because the earlier solar flares had cleared the path from the sun to Earth so the bit that caused the Carrington Event could get here with way less energy loss. If we had a sunspot send over a flare like happened two days before Carrington and the spot was going to stay pointing in our direction, hopefully the world would scramble to way mitigate the effects.</p></div>		</li>
