			<div class="markdown"><p>So all the freshwater is diverted somewhere.  Is coastal California getting more fresh or is so much more of it evaporating as we use it for farming that itâ€™s going elsewhere? Which brings up where it goes as evaporation would likely carry it up to the atmosphere and drop a significant portion back down in the Colorado River basin or the Mississippi basin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Colorado River is &quot;Owned&quot; by the 7 states and Mexico which have historical claims to the river's water. This is known as the <a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/lawofrvr.html" target="_blank">Law of the River</a>. As the western states have developed and their populations have increased, the use of the water increased as well. These states have some of the highest population growths in the entire country. Many of these areas also value aesthetic over the sustainability of their community and therefore you have multiple thousand acre golf courses in the middle of the desert. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The problem is truly that this is the law. These states are legally apportioned this water and they will use it. Another factor is where this water is actually going towards and the vast majority goes to agriculture, a very strong industry. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What is even more terrifying really is that this is not a secret. I work in environmental management in Arizona. Everyone knows that climate change and draught are happening but nobody really cares all that much. The idea of a building moratorium or anything of that sort would be unthinkable. Expanding regulations on water quality and quantity are also very taboo. And so everyone scratches their head, wonders why we have such large problems and then goes home on friday and waters their 2 acre lawns in the middle of the desert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a somewhat pragmatic view of the edge ts, but it's definatly an issue. Lots of people in the west, especially the deserted areas, do use a lot of water, more than they need, even if they want to keep their huge lawns and such watered. The biggest problem is that attempting to regulate the water will mostly only effect the lower classes. Those who spend the water to water their big lawns and are most typical of wasting water can and probably will find ways around regulations. The lower classes that barely make a living will be heavily effected by regulations. I wish it were otherwise, but unless you cut off vital resources to those that already have barely enough, not much difference can really be made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coastal Cali gets a small amount of it relatively I n the form of municipal water for the sprawls. But inland cali uses a ton for irrigation. Which yes lots leaves from there due to evapotranspiration. The Central Valley is an ancient lakebed so not a lot is able to infiltrate the groundwater like you would see in more arid places. But to answer your question not a lot flows into coastal cali unless you are talking about wastewater or when mullholland was purposely dumping stuff to maintain water rights (but that was the Owens valley water not CO river).</p></div>		</li>
