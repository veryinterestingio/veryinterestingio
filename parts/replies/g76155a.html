			<div class="markdown"><p>Q1 - Electrical impulses.</p>
<p>Q2 - Electricity, measured in voltage, detected by an electroencephalogram.</p>
<p>Q3 - Some sort of stimulation. We can be consciously stimulated, or brain waves can be generated in response to the unconscious processes of the body to maintain breathing, heart rate, digestion, etc.</p>
<p>The actual mechanism of how it works is more complex, and fascinating. But these are the baseline answers to your questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I remember learning a bit about the electrochemistry of the brain in my intro chem series. IIRC, they said that our nerves are like pipes of potassium and sodium solutions and the potassium and sodium ions travel across the barrier, increasing or decreasing the concentrations and generating electrical potential..sending signals.. is this the mechanism?</p>
<p>Also, thanks for the answers!</p></div>		</li>
