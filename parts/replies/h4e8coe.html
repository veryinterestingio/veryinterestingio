			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually researched this topic! Our current knowledge about population growth and the reserves in Marocco allowed us to predict that we probably have enough until at least 2100. How expensive those last few years would be to mine was not in scope though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MArocco is the key supplier at the moment, but there are still a few other sources:</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has started mining phosphate about 10 years ago. There are talks of new mines in Ethiopia and Australia. Apart from that there are mines in Jordan and Russia. Not sure about the situation of phosphate mining in the USA, particularly in Florida.</p>
<p>But I agree around 2100 seems to be the agreed date when raw phosphate will be in short supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's still a lot of effort to try to close the loop and recycle phosphorus from the ocean, because nobody wants to be dependent on those countries. So I have good hope it's taken care of before then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My geology professor told me about that ! Currently, we mine it, but the mines are running out of it. We need to develop a more circular way of thinking Out ressources process, because currently, there also is an overabundance of nutriments in places they shouldn't be. (Rivers, sea, waste disposals, cemetery...)</p></div>		</li>
