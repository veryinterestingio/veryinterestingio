			<div class="markdown"><p>Mexico is apportioned ~10% of the Colorado River’s water, and they divert it at the Yuma/Los Algadones border (via the Morelos Dam) into irrigation channels.  The water table in some places is 30 ft down, and water soaks into those river sediments like a sponge, so it’s very rare that fresh water will reach the sea.</p>
<p>One of the purposes of the Minute 319 flood was to simulate a spring flooding event, and to see how the delta responded.  It was timed perfectly to coincide with sporing of native trees, and the USGS even came down and bulldozed areas of salt cedar to make way for them.</p>
<p>I do not have intimate knowledge of the marine ecosystem.  For the two weeks I sampled the floodwaters didn’t make it to the ocean.  Waters had to be diverted through irrigation canals after I flew out, in order to get those media pictures of the river meeting the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A <a href="https://otrwjam.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/dsc04367.jpg" target="_blank">historic picture of The Colorado River at Yuma</a> (not far from the sea) shows how large the river was before the dams. </p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.visityuma.com/about-yuma/history/" target="_blank">a history of Yuma</a>: </p>
<p>&quot;The course of the river was unpredictable from year to year and from season to season - and in the table-flat floodplains where it met the Gila, the riverbed often stretched across 15 miles of silty bottoms laced with unexpected back channels and even pockets of quicksand. Getting across was no easy matter, even when the river was not in flood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But at the place that would become Yuma, two outcroppings of granite held their place against the river's might and squeezed it into a narrower channel. Here the waters ran swift, but the banks held firm and the passage was, if still hazardous, at least predictable. So from the time that the earliest people took up residence in the area, this was known as the easiest and safest place to cross the river: the Yuma Crossing.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there's no flow unless the snowpack at the source of the river is big enough to basically force that type of flow to occur, but global warming has been causing the annual snowpack to be smaller than a century ago, according to this EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-snowpack" target="_blank">report</a> on average it's a 23% decline from 1955 to 2016 for all locations looked at in the Western United States.</p>
<p>Due to note that the map isn't related to the inches of snow received, but the snow water equivalent. Which is basically &quot;if the snow were to melt right now how deep would the water be&quot; measurement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd have to have snow that would refill many lakes before the river would meet the sea. </p>
<p>Parker dam, hoover dam, davis dam, hayden dam all are down quite a bit.  Snowpack would have to eat through this deficit and then maybe it could get there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are talking about this one tree because there have been a lot of papers on it recently, meaning it is very important to the field of research, it is a problem that is growing, it is a new discovery that the plant is invasive. Based on how it was phrased, I think the poster is saying the interest may be misguided but I’m not sure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a smithsonian magazine article <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-we-created-monster-american-southwest-180956878/" target="_blank">on Salt Cedars</a>. While acknowledging the plants as a foreign invasive, it takes issue with the characterization of the plants as water stealing monsters. Instead they are plants that can live in the man created salty watersheads of the desert --e.g. it is not the salt cedars that are the problem. The native trees would outcompete the salt cedar if all the water wasn't being diverted by dams and reduced flow agriculture  returns with increased salt load. In this context it is unfair to blame the tamerisk (salt cedars) for the displacement of the migratory bird species. They've been displaced because the trees they need are gone, not because the salt cedar replaced them. The salt cedars can also be exploited by other native species like hummingbirds and fly catchers, so their presence is not 100% negative toward wild life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every plant is different in different contexts. After all, every invasive weed is some other area's native plant. Salt cedar is invasive here in Saskatchewan too, but for the most part we don't have those manmade conditions you describe. Instead, it displaces our native prairie grasses, particularly in riparian areas.</p>
<p>Our soil happens to naturally have a high mineral load, which makes for great conditions for it to grow. And once it takes root, it concentrates salts in the surrounding soil, which makes it hard for other plants to compete with it. As such, this plant is on our &quot;kill it with fire&quot; noxious weeds list.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not saying it isn't a noxious weed/invasive. I am saying that in the colorado delta, blaming the salt cedars for displacing the wild life is shifting the blame. It is the lack of freshwater flowing to the delta that caused the native plants to die. The smithsonian article author makes the claim that, were sufficient water allowed to flow in Pheonix's salt river bed, the native cottonwood and willow would outcompete the tamarisk. Given your Saskatchewan experience, perhaps that is not a valid claim; but in the colorado delta with tidal surges bringing brackish water 60 miles upstream, I seriously doubt anything could grow. I would be interested to know whether they have any mangroves in the area though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great, nuanced answer that highlights how easy it can be for disingenuous interests to blame salt cedars rather than people for the issues the delta is having.</p>
