			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just amazed/confused how all kids (in at least US and Canada according to these comments) all came to know this as &quot;gleeking&quot;?  Having moved eight different places growing, can confirm &quot;gleeking&quot; was <em>the</em> designated phrase in the various states I lived in as well.  This was all pre-internet...there must be some movie or show that referred to gleeking.  That's the only thing I can think of lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha right?!  I googled it, and there's a theory that the name is derived from a Super Friends cartoon monkey whose name was &quot;Gleek&quot; and would spit in a playful way.  I have a hard time buying it fully, though, considering that would require kids all over the country to adopt that same, obscure name somehow.  Apparently Shakespeare used the word &quot;gleet&quot; to refer to spitting too lol.  Maybe it was in novel or comic book that many read as kids, and then it was passed down to generations of younger kids over time.  Gotta love thinking about how language came to be and it's easy to forget it's still evolving even now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this was a big thing when I was in high school at one point. One kid could do that on command and before we knew it half the school was gleeking all over each other. It was fucked. I never learned it. </p>
