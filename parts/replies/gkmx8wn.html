<p>Enough time has passed that the Earth has reached a fairly steady state in regards to the temperature gradient from the core to the surface.  That distribution of heat has reached a fairly consistent point.</p>
<p>But enough time hasn't passed yet for the Earth to have lost all its internal heat left over from its formation (or second formation, when a rogue planet smacked into it and made our Moon).  Particularly when its been supplemented by the Uranium and Thorium, the quantity of which (and thus, average power output) has only decayed by about a factor of 2 or 2.5 since the Earth's formation.</p>
<p>It's going to take quite a long time before the Earth is cool enough, that its thermal radiation is low enough to be balanced out by what is received by the Sun.</p>
<p>However if you look to our Moon, or to a planet like Mars, you'll get something closer to what you're describing - something that is closer to being stable in regards to exchanging heat with space.  </p>
<p>The answer to why the Earth is different is pretty simple - it's bigger, so for the same relative distribution of elements (the radioactive ones) it is receiving a greater amount of heat from the decay according to its mass.  And more importantly, the surface area to volume ratio is lower, so relative to how much heat is started with, and how much it accumulates from decay, it will lose it to space far more slowly.</p>
<p>Don't know if another 4 billion years will be enough for Earth to reach that steady state.  If it takes too long, it may never happen before the Sun becomes a red giant and consumes all the inner planets.</p></div>		</li>
