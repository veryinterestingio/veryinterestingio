			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone just looking at the picture, a small addendum: most Irish don't consider Ireland as geographically part of &quot;the British Isles&quot;. Its obviously founded in distain for the political connotations of &quot;Britain&quot; rather than distain for geography, but given no one else has any strong opinions about that usage, at this point it's probably just inaccurate.</p></div>		</li>
