			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah but you don't give breaths for CPR, that old school. there is enough O2 in a person blood for i believe about 20 minutes of CPR without respiration</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not really if you over inflate someones lungs it'll just go into their stomach and then they'll puke in your mouth. But yes it was to prevent disease spread but also so that more people would step in and help people that need CPR, not everyone is certified in necromancy but the 911 operators are trained to walk you through it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You absolutely give breaths for CPR, it's the P in there.  CCR is the one without breathing.  If you see an adult have a heart attack and fall over then sure, skip the breathing, but unless you witness the problem and know it's not related to oxygen you absolutely need to perform proper CPR.</p></div>		</li>
