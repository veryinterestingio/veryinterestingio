			<div class="markdown"><p>I always assumed it was the difference between action and location. &quot;I go to University&quot; (UK) indicating they get educated (action) where as &quot;I go to the university&quot; (US) indicating a location where we go (location) for whatever purpose we might go there for. I know, it's the same thing you said, its just clearer in my head to think of it as Actions vs location. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but we don't say &quot;I'm going to University&quot;. Not sure why the difference. A college is a specific School of training within a University. Maybe that has something to do with it. Idk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I guess the action idea could also tie in with the existence of corresponding phrases like</p>
<p>I was hospitalised, I was jailed, or I was schooled.</p>
<p>Although there seems to be more inconsistencies, and might be later derivations anyway.
Hopefully an actual linguist is reading all this and can explain exactly why some locations/activities are treated differently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And then related, but different, because they are more clearly activities/states:  orbit/freefall/nature/transit.</p></div>		</li>
