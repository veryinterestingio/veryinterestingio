Protein chains fold up by being knocked around by Brownian motion, and the components then randomly float around until they snap into place. Sometimes they are carried by motor proteins that walk along the long tubes that criss cross the cell. We would need to coordinate the thousands of different necessary proteins, make sure they are in the correct concentrations, follow the correct order of operations, and it’s different for different cells.</p></div>		</li>
