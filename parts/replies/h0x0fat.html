<p>ISS - .0013 light-seconds</p>
<p>Moon - 1.3 light seconds (1,000x farther than ISS)</p>
<p>Mars - 1,300 light seconds maximum (1,000x farther than moon, 1,000,000x farther than ISS)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought you were exploring impact on time? I.e say on Mars my life was 5,000,000 seconds but the same life on earth is 5,001,000 - so the impact this slight difference had on equipment (at nano seconds for a planet so close) - if that made sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like 2500000000 on Earth and  2500000010 on Mars. And you don't actually experience any extra time, those numbers are to an external observer, from your perspective, your life isn't any longer or shorter. Similarly any equipment, unless it's equipment communicating with off-planet equipment (like GPS).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Directly probably, but a few satellite relays can solve that I suspect. You could put a relay at L3, that would link up with L4 or L5 and send it on to Earth, or Mars respectively. But that might be more steps than are needed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mars actually ranges from ~55 to ~400 million km away, so double our problems accordingly.</p></div>		</li>
