			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense that this <em>could</em> happen to some solar systems.  However the event would have no effect on humanity because there will be no humans here and likely none anywhere.</p>
<p>This galaxy mixing is projected to be about 4.5 billion years from now, about the time our sun goes nova at the end of its life cycle.  That event will see the sun expanding greatly into a red giant star whose diameter is large enough that Earth will be physically inside the sun.</p>
<p>Even before that the molten core of our planet will have cooled and solidified.  That molten core and its motion drives plate tectonics and the magnetic field that protects Earth from solar and interstellar radiation.  This kills the people... and pretty much everything else on the planet.</p>
<p>It is also highly likely that humanity will have died out or moved away long before that.  Our species has only been around a couple of million years.  Any 'collision' with the Andromeda galaxy is 4.5 billion years out from now.  That's well more than 2,000 times as long as anything remotely resembling a human has been around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But remember that there's a bunch of things orbiting each of those systems at a very far distance. Our own oort cloud is anywhere from .05ly to 3ly away from the Sun, still orbiting it as a massive cloud of rocks. Get something to jet by that wasn't there, and it'll stir up trouble and sling tens of millions of rocks inwards and pummel the planets.</p></div>		</li>
