<p>The mechanical and electrical properties of copper are very dependent on these defects, with lots of effort put into processing the material to control them.</p>

<p>The properties are also dependent on having enough atoms together for properties like the electronic band structure to emerge.  A few atoms of copper isn't nearly enough to show the presence of a conduction band.</p>
<p>For that matter, if you were to somehow build a single unit cell and isolate it, it would probably spontaneously rearrange into something unrecognizable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is really the essence of nano science. At least originally. People noticed that in small quantities the &quot;natural state&quot; of materials are very much so not what they are in the bulk. Graphene vs graphite being the most famous example. Buckyballs and carbon nanotubes are other famous examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good way of thinking about it is the ratio of surface area to volume. Atoms away from a surface have no idea how far they are from a surface, and behave like &quot;bulk&quot; materials. Atoms on and near a surface have distorted bonds, giving them different properties than the bulk. Of you have enough surface that a large percent are now surface atoms, you suddenly get very different properties. This is why nanostructures can become interesting.</p></div>		</li>
