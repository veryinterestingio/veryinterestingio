			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, polarity only matters if it's different between speakers in a set.  This puts them out of phase, which can lead to acoustic interference.  This can create dead spots in the listening area, where sound waves encounter their bizarro counterparts and cancel each other out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: there's always dead spots in the listening area, they're just off yo the side normally. when stereo speakers are out of phase, you'll instead have a dead spot in the center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would have the same effect as anc. A speaker works using a coil which pulls or pushes the driver. This depends on the direction of the current. If you reverse the current the drivers are on opposite site(So one is deep inside the speaker and the other is far out the speaker.) These waves than cancel eachother out (to a certain degree) and makes the actual noise less</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recording engineer for two decades here, (now voice actor.) Not bullshit, but probably just bad terminology. Once an audio signal is analog, it's just electricity with a frequency and an amplitude. A speaker has three elements, the diaphragm, the coil and a magnet. </p>
<p>If we imagine a sine wave to keep it simple, as the wave goes up in the positive direction, current moves through the coil in one direction, causing a magnetic field, let's say &quot;north&quot;, and as the wave dips below the 0 line to form a trough, current moves in the other direction to form a magnetic field, let's say, &quot; south.&quot; In some speakers the coil is directly connected to the diaphragm. And the magnet is fixed behind. (It could be the opposite depending on speaker design and packaging needs.)</p>
<p>So a North magnetic field might &quot;push&quot; the diaphragm out towards the listener, and a south magnetic field might &quot;pull&quot; it away. This creates vibrations in the air that are a direct analog to the current in the speaker wire. </p>
<p>If you reverse the speaker wires, what would be a &quot;push&quot; becomes a &quot;pull&quot;. On one speaker, it makes no perceptible difference to the listener. But on a stereo or surround setup, now a speaker is what is called 180 degrees out of phase. This is usually is perceived as a strange echoey &quot;floatiness&quot; that makes instruments or vocals sound like they they are coming from various parts of the soundstage randomly. It's especially noticeable in vocals that should be coming through both speakers equally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this something a sound engineer or audiophile would recognize immediately? How obvious would it be to a lay person if they walked into someone’s living room that had an out of phase setup?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's obvious that something is wrong, even to a lay person. They might not know the cause, but it may sound like a cheap or bad system at first listen. (Again, this is stereo or more speakers. A single speaker being 180 out of phase causes no perceptible difference to the listener.)</p>
<p>Here's the best analogy I can come up with to describe it: Ever get off an airplane and one ear has popped back to normal and one hasn't? Or gotten water in one ear when swimming, and it won't come out? Things sound off. And sometimes things sound like they're coming from a place you know they aren't supposed to. Everything on one side sounds too bassy or to tinny, etc. That's what it would sound like.</p>
<p>In surround systems it can be more subtle because of the more complex interactions of waves in the room, and some sounds are coming from mostly one speaker. Still, it would sound off to most people, even if they can't put their finger on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s BS (if you’re dealing with one speaker). As someone else said, if you have multiple speakers it matters (a whole lot!). The effect isn’t subtle, either. Basically, imagine you put a microphone exactly between two speakers 180° out of phase: their waveforms would cancel each other out. That’s the basis behind noise canceling headphones.</p>
<p>If you have a single speaker, there’s nothing for it to be out of phase with, and it would sound identical regardless of polarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who has a single speaker that's connected in a way you could reverse the polarity? If you're wiring speakers to an amp, it's pretty much a given you're doing at least stereo, otherwise why would you spend the money and effort on that if you don't even care to get stereo sound?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen plenty of single-speaker sub units. Honestly, if you get one of those out of phase with the associated mids and tweeters, you’d probably never notice because the frequency ranges are so incredibly different. Like it’s not the end of the world if a 12” sub playing a 15Hz sound is slightly off from a 6x9 playing an 800Hz sound.</p></div>		</li>
