			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad had several over the years and I was always really impressed by the tech. His latest version is custom fit to his ear and frequencies tuned specifically for “general” hearing to balance his hearing loss. He then can further customize settings depending on environment and save them. One for a restaurant, one for a movie theatre, one for the dinner table. He has even tinkered enough to optimize speaking w different people like my sisters high pitched voice or myself. All synced by an app on his phone that lets him customize and switch between presets.</p>
<p>Edit: one comment reminded me, also has a feature that allows him to use his phone mic as a direct receiver, so in really tough places like a crowded party or bar he can actually rest his phone next to the person for that extra clarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad (76yo) has similar kind. He shuffles around all day with Pandora music directly streaming into his ears, so he can ignore everyone. Like some kind of millennial. </p>
<p>Except his musical preferences are Celtic/Irish instrumental, doo-wop and mariachi band.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been deaf since birth and wear hearing aids. The last feature you mentioned is actually built into the high end hearing aids. You don't need to use your phone. Amazing what they can squeeze into such a small package.</p>
<p>That said, it's probably worth mentioning how the hearing aid companies are ripping off their customers. These things can cost thousands and they need to be replaced every few years. If you're not one of the lucky ones who have insurance, you're pretty much screwed.  They shouldn't cost nearly as much as they do. Hopefully the newly introduced deregulation will help correct this. Even apple is getting into the game.</p>
<p>Most people don't get how isolating it is not to hear. You can't participate in the simplest of activities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently studying Audiology and Speech-language pathology, and one of our guest speakers from the audiology doctorate program told us that most insurance companies deem hearing aids a luxury so they dont cover them. Hearing aids cost THOUSANDS, and most people dont have that kind of money to spend every few years.
One of the latest studies has also found a correlation between hearing loss and dementia. Really, the study indicated that there was a correlation between anything that causes isolation and dementia, but hearing loss is definitely one of those things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Where can I find more about this? Deregulation of what? What's the difference between a hearing aid and Bluetooth IEMs with mics? Does anyone know of any bt IEMs with two mics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, you don't need to be deaf to wear hearing aides. People with APD (Auditory Processing Disorder) may wear hearing aides with a teacher or speaker who wears a microphone. They are not deaf they just cant filter sound, so the hearing aides amplify the important voice using the microphone while working to filter out other sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait? Seriously!?</p>
<p>I have APD and RSHL, I see an audiologist each year to track the deterioration of my RSHL - I don't qualify for hearing aids at this point because my loss is still only mild, and they warned me that few hearing aids can be customised to deal with reverse slope loss so there's a chance even when I have moderate loss I won't find aides that help.</p>
<p>I asked about options for managing the APD since I think that's more difficult to deal with than the RSHL - the RSHL makes it difficult feeling safe when walking through car parks, or talking on the phone, but in other areas of life it's a blessing: for example I live next to a highway and traffic noise keeps my partner awake but I can't hear it.</p>
<p>I've had 3 audiologists and they've all said there is nothing for APD except for occupational therapy. The OT I saw gave me a bunch of physical exercises like back muscle work outs and postural stretches.... I don't fully understand how that's supposed to help, I've tried my best to stick with the routine but it hasn't helped from what I can tell.</p>
<p>Maybe they never mentioned isolation hearing aids because they wouldn't really help me at work unless I get certain people to put on microphones. Or perhaps because those types of aides aren't covered by the public healthcare here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the hearing aides and microphone work best for school type situations where there is one main speak or small groups where there may be other background noise. Here in New Zealand my son was diagnosed by soundskillz and he has trialled his hearing aides through the ministry of education. As an adult I am not sure how this process works but I do know it helps my son. He has zero hearing loss. He just can't filter important sounds and prioritise them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing I would say is to be wary of them telling that you have APD if you have a hearing loss. Two reasons, technically testing for APD can't be done if you have a hearing loss, and technically everyone who has a hearing loss can display symptoms of APD because it is natural to have that when you have a hearing loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the protection note - back in my heavy-metal heydays my usual MO at shows would be to take my hearing aids out. Then my buddy got us 2nd row tickets for Motorhead, Overkill, and Slayer. Motorhead came on and I took my aids out. They sounded louder. So I put them back in and thanked my lucky stars that I had that barrier.</p></div>		</li>
