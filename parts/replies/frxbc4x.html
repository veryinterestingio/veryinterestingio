			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it okay to not use bar soap? Considering I've used body wash for well over 15 years I'm sure my body can regulate its own oil production and doesn't need to be stripped of it every time I shower? Bar soap also seems unsanitary sitting in humid and wet conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it really depends on the soap. I had bad bar soap that stripped too much oil from my skin and I had bad liquid soap do the same. Through trial and error I now found products that work well for me and clean well while not stripping off too much oil.</p></div>		</li>
