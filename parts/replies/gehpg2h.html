			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why Microwaves are horrible at melting ice. The wavelength used is perfect for heating up water molecules but bounces off most other things. Ice doesn't absorb the specific frequency of light so it can't melt easily. Instead, some of it will melt, then the bit of water released heats up and starts melting other bits of ice. </p>
<p>That's why when microwaving something frozen you should pause partway through and allow the bits of water that have thawed inside the food to melt the rest of the ice. Otherwise, you end up with hot pockets with either ice or lava.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why if you have food to re-heat, spray a little water on it and let soak as much as possible (bearable). It aides in even heat and effectiveness.  That and move your food around to get out of the &quot;pattern&quot; it lays down on the food. Just turning in a circle is not enough. Stop (half way through) and move it say 3 inches left or right and start again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, orders of magnitude less power, but power that's below the threshold of power that is able to affect the polar molecules.</p>
<p>Imagine you're sitting on a bench gently swinging one leg forward and backward. There's not much going on.</p>
<p>But now increase the force with which you move your leg forward and backward. There's a threshold you'll reach, where your leg is straight out in front of you, where above that, A LOT OF MOTION is going to occur, and not just motion of a front and back variety. Your knee won't let your calf swing above knee height, so now the calf AND the thigh must move, resulting in a HUGE difference in motion.</p>
<p>That is a highly suspect illustration, since I just made it up off the top of my head, but that's the kind of thing we're talking about.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Microwave ovens do not &quot;reverse their polarity dozens of times per second&quot;.</p>
<p>Microwave radiation  consists of an electric field that alternates at the wave frequency, which is 2.4 GHz both for microwave ovens and Wi-Fi operating in that band.  That's 4.8 billion reversals of the electric field direction each second.  Wi-Fi and microwave ovens are identical in this respect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you put your hand in a microwave, you’ll maybe get a burn, but not cancer. The “radiation” isn’t ionizing, it’s less energetic than human-visible light, it’s just contained inside a miniature faraday cage and happens to be the right wavelength to turn water into steam, so don’t go microwaving dehydrated foods or nothing will happen. Its not even like a laser as the emissions need to be spread out to evenly steamify water droplets; more like 10 bathroom floodlight bulbs in a small bedroom with a single window covered with a thick lace curtain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the biggest mistakes science made is to actually make the public fear the word radiation. People dont seem to realize that visible light is also radiation, and that the radiation we tend to use for practical purposes is less dangerous than visible light. Excpet of course the UV light people use to tan, but thats suddenly not scary anymore because its not called UV radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The frequency really doesn't have anything to do with water.   That's a popular narrative, but simply untrue.   The first resonant frequency of water is above 1Thz.</p>
<p>The reason microwave ovens are 2.4Ghz is more about government regulation than the resonant frequency of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because it's not &quot;attuned&quot; to water doesn't mean it's not the water molecules doing most of the heating.  To my knowledge, it's the dipole rotation of water that does most of the heating in the microwave.</p>
<p>I feel like it's just as misleading for all of you to say things like &quot;it has nothing to do with water&quot; when it most certainly does.  There's gotta be a better way to say it...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The microwave resonance of water is between 10 and 200 GHz depending on temperature and it is broad. So broad that that there is always significant absorption at 2.4 GHz.   </p>
<p>2.4 GHz is a good frequency as when the water is cold there is a high abosoption but also a high reflection meaning microwaves do not penetrate the water (enter it particularly well). The fact that we can stick the microwaves in a box however means that eventually the microwaves will penetrate the water eventually after several bounces round the oven.   </p>
<p>As the water heats up the abosoption actually decreases and the reflectivity decreases, this means that the microwaves have a slightly easier time penetrating deeper into the water where it will be absorbed by the slightly cooler layer under the surface.   </p>
<p>This leads to the myth &quot;microwaves cook from the inside&quot;. The actual truth its that the microwaves cook from the outside but heat penetrates some small distance thorugh the surface meaning there is a layer on the surface where the food is been heated. Hence less power density and less burning. </p>
<p>2.4 GHz is also a comprimise. If you use smaller waves (higher frequency) it becomes difficult to generate high powers. </p>
<p>Additionally if you go above 50 GHz you get to a point where as the water temperature increases, so does the absorption, meaning food would begin to burn as the energy becomes more concentrated at the surface.   </p>
<p>Laerger waves (lower frequency) can be used. This would result in much more efficient generation of the waves and less absorption meaning the food would cook even better as the waves penetrate more due to lower absorption. The problem is the oven would need to be much bigger and the hot and cold spots would be larger too resulting in uneven cooking.  </p>
