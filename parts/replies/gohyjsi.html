			<div class="markdown"><p>We see and speak with rare disease patients, parents and families almost every day, and study rare diseases on a daily basis.  Rare diseases are individually rare (by disease) but collectively they are common. There are about 7,000 different rare diseases, each of which affects a few hundred to a few thousand people (sometimes fewer), which collectively affect an estimated 25-30 million people in the US.  </p>
<p>The number and diversity of rare diseases makes it impossible for any one person to be an expert on all rare diseases. However, there are experts and expert centers who focus on clusters of related rare diseases, such as metabolic diseases, bone disease, or rare eye diseases, which allows for expert patient care at these centers. Some examples include the individual rare disease clinical research consortia (RDCRC) within the RDCRN – here is a link to the different RDCRC and the diseases that they study: <a href="https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/" target="_blank">https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/</a></a>.  There are other examples as well, such as Children’s hospitals which often specialize in rare pediatric diseases.  Researchers often focus on narrow areas of study for rare diseases as well. For example, there are researchers who exclusively study muscular dystrophy, or specific types of muscular dystrophy and have extensive knowledge within these areas or single diseases. </p>
<p>We recommend that patients and their families try to seek care for a rare disease at an expert center whenever possible. Should you need assistance finding disease experts, please contact the GARD information center who may be able to provide assistance. <a href="https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/" target="_blank"><a href="https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/" target="_blank">https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/</a></a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really interested in this question too. Rare diseases are collectively pretty common, I'm interested to know if anything is being done to help doctors diagnose them and find the correct experts.</p>
<p>I'm involved on the patient side and it feels like diagnosis and especially finding the right experts seems to fall on patients or their caregivers.</p></div>		</li>
