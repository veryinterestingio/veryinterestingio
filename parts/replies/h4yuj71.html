			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you a lefty? If so that makes sense. The whole left side of the brain controls right side of the body is only relevant from your face down. So if you're a lefty, the right side of your brain is dominant and that controls the right eye muscles. </p>
<p>If you're a righty.....then it just be like that sometimes lol. These &quot;rules&quot; don't work all the time for everything and our brain is super wierd and super cool and is influenced by so many different, seemingly minor, factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I'm right handed. As for practice, it's absolutely true. When I realized I couldn't wink my left eye a couple years ago, I started practicing. Day by day I could do it better. Now I can kind of do it. Not really, but kind of.</p></div>		</li>
