			<div class="markdown"><p>2: Your point about causality is well taken; yes the methodology is correlational.  The phrasing that you refer to is how we typically discuss correlational relationships - as one characteristic is higher so is the other - but we can only infer causality based on self-control theorizing.  Yet it is possible that heavier drinking the night before could make employees perform more surface acting (suppressing their negative mood) the next day.  However, the fourth author (Sayre) has a follow-up daily diary study that disconfirms that reverse causal flow.
Good point about traits - we do control for neuroticism and impulsivity (since both could be related to surface acting and drinking), and find the relationship exists beyond those effects, with the relationship being even stronger for more impulsive employees (who have a harder time with self-control).</p>
<p>3:  We are surprised to hear you say that - in our discipline samples sizes tend to be only in the 100-200 range.  This is a national dataset sampling US occupations in a representative way.  Our primary sample was those with daily customer contact (N = 1592) but we also compared them with those with limited customer contact (N = 399) and no customer contact (N = 541).  So our main sample with our analyses is the 1592, and we break that down to those with encounters with strangers (bus driver, cashier, police officer, N = 749) and those with ongoing relationships (social worker, dental hygenist, nurse, teacher, N = 843).  I hope that reduces your concerns about the sample size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, I think that adequately answers both my questions!</p>
<p>For my point 3: I didn't mean to be dismissive or anything, only curious because I'm not as familiar with research in psychology and in experimental particle physics we are often not constrained by statistics. (The LHC collides more proton pairs in one minute than the entire human population). I'm sure you do better than many other studies. My worry was just that the &quot;background&quot; rate you get from your control sample (&quot;no customer contact&quot;, N = 541) would be expected to have a statistical error of around sqrt(N)/N = 4.3 percent. And when you compare it to your &quot;encounter with strangers&quot; sample, with N = 749, you would expect a statistical error of 3.6 percent. So if you see that the rates of heavy drinking between both groups are different by less than 5 to 6 percent, then what you have is quite compatible with the null hypothesis. But I see from your posted paper (thanks for the pdf!) that you have taken many of these things into account already. I'll read it in more detail.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Responding to your first point--interesting, I wasn't aware that practice was so popular in other disciplines. For us, copyright restrictions is the main barrier to distributing the full-text version more widely. There has been a push, however, for more &quot;translational&quot; work--that is, making the findings and conclusions (not necessarily the full-text) more available and accessible to policymakers, the media, and organizations who might benefit. Our professional organization (<a href="http://www.siop.org/" target="_blank">SIOP</a>) has been instrumental in this push, and we actually have some I/O psychologist working alongside the U.N. to help address humanitarian issues in developing countries (<a href="http://my.siop.org/Advocacy/SIOP-and-the-United-Nations" target="_blank">link</a>) . Finally, press releases are becoming increasingly standard, in fact the link to our study that made the front page a few weeks ago was from a press release service (EurekaAlerts). So while it's not quite the full text, it does convey the &quot;big picture&quot; which can hopefully be of use to those who would benefit from it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. Thanks for your response to my first point. I'm sure you alone won't be able to affect any change, but if you get the chance, it might be a good idea to recommend publishing the p-values as well with all the results. As I'm sure you are aware, the challenging aspect of most analyses like yours is generally the error-bars and trying to account for all the statistical and systematic biases -- quoting only the central value might be misleading for policymakers.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, copyright restrictions are very much applicable to physics and mathematics as well. It's just that we don't really care. It's not like we make any money off our papers anyway, and I'm sure you don't either. In physics, it helps that there has long been a history of open exchange, so people used to send interesting papers to other universities by fax all the time (before publishing them officially in a journal) -- these were the original &quot;preprints&quot;; the introduction of a central online repository only made this more streamlined. And so journals don't really have a choice -- if the journal run by one organization tries to enforce copyright, all that will happen is that everyone will begin publishing in one of its competitors. But this does require some amount of coordinated action by the best scientists in your field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Putting you manuscript on a manuscript server typically results in more citations, helps colleagues from poorer institutes access your work and helps interested lay-people. </p>

<p>There's an entire movement around this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access" target="_blank">Open Access</a>.</p>
<p>There's a related European initiative called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_S" target="_blank">Plan S</a> which is &quot;a consortium launched by major national research agencies and funders from twelve European countries. The plan requires scientists and researchers who benefit from state-funded research organisations and institutions to publish their work in open repositories or in journals that are available to all by 2020.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
