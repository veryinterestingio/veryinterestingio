			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, depending on how many times the pages were folded would give a rough idea of the size/shape of the finished book.</p>
<p>Pages folded in half making 2 sheets were called &quot;folio,&quot; 4 sheets were called &quot;quarto,&quot; 8 sheets were called &quot;octavo,&quot; 16 sheets &quot;sextodecimo&quot; or &quot;16mo&quot; for short.  </p>
<p>Bookbinding is neat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Folio also means &quot;leaf&quot; so this also explains why we say &quot;leaf through a book&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been in printing for over 15 years and I've never heard of things called quarto and octavo and such. I'm not saying you're wrong, I just think it's interesting to see different terminology being used.</p>
<p>In the shops I've worked, they're simply 4-page, 8-page, 16-page. And we call them forms instead of signatures. We know what signatures are, but it takes longer to say. In fact, the only time I hear &quot;folio&quot; is in reference to a high folio or low folio lip for the saddle-stitcher.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even though the diagram says 16 page signature, when completed, it only has 8 usable pages.  Useful if you can only print on one side.  Probably not the best example to use to show how to make signatures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>After it is folded, the outside folded edges are cut so that all the pages turn freely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw something like this years ago, but they did some kind of odd cutting that I couldn't ever remember. I made several tiny note books for myself, then forgot how and lost interest and lost the instructions.This is a lot easier. Well, with the other comment that says to slice the edges. It makes a lot of sense now. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the video does not do the last step of trimming the outter edges (and thereby doubling the usable pages) because then the sheets would not hold together anymore on their own and would not anymore be something you can do with a sheet of paper and scissors only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the multiple signatures then stack next to each other to make larger books? And get glued/sewn (like all the sides gets glue and it gets glued to a cover) to each other in order? Or do they get stacked on top of each other (like in picture 4, just pile a bunch of folded open signatures on top of each other) and then glued/sewn along the spine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're <em>usually</em> glued or stitched on the spine, if they were glued to each other front to back you'd have two pages stuck together every 16 pages or so and people would be trying to peel them apart.</p>
<p>I know they would because I personally destroyed a handful as a kid peeling them apart.  They're usually not <em>completely</em> glued together but if you open the book flat on the table to the division between the signatures there'll be a quarter inch or so where the pages are glued.  Tug on the left and right page and you'll have two books.</p></div>		</li>
