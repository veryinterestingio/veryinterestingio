But the main reason why farmers cut down trees in their paddocks is because it's harder to drive around them with the tractor and machinery as other people already stated.
But having a few trees in your paddock can actually be good for a few reasons: </p>
<p>1) Cattle are easily <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030217308494" target="_blank">stressed by heat</a> (starting at 16°C / 60°F) which in turn lowers their milk yield and/or growth and makes them more prone to metabolic diseases. Same goes for other animals just different temperatures at which heat stress starts. It's becoming a more relevant problem with increasing temperatures due to climate change. </p>
<p>2) Cows love to scratch themselves on trees because they can't roll on their backs like horses. Look at how much they love those rotating brushes. Having a brush or tree increases <a href="https://afs.ca.uky.edu/dairy/brushing-dairy-cow-brushes" target="_blank">animal welfare</a>. That's becoming more important because it increases animal health and it is what consumers are demanding.</p>
<p>3) Trees lower the temperature of the surrounding area which in turn increases the humidity, biodiversity, soil quality and much more. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agroforestry" target="_blank">Agroforestry</a> specifically uses this mechanism to farm land.</p>

<p>That explains why a farmer who lives near my parents has a fully enclosed, completely air conditioned barn for the cows in summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is that animals will spend more time in the shade, and just by being there, they will over graze there  until the quality of forage in the shade gets bad enough to force them back out into the heat of the sun. </p>
<p>This also happens near water sources. The area by the water gets over grazed, because why walk more than you need to to get to food and water.</p>
<p>The term ecologists use to explain the difference in resource quality is “ideal free distribution”. </p>
<p>It also explains why better quality fishing lakes are more remote.</p></div>		</li>
