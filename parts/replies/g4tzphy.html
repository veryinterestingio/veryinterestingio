			<div class="markdown"><p>And in the case of the Spanish Flu, “better handle” could mean “not have the immune system react very strongly.”
Overreaction of the immune system was part of what made it so deadly—and since younger people have stronger immune systems, it hit the young harder than the old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spanish Flu is thought to have hit young people harder because older generations had already been exposed to similar plagues and thus had a much more effective immune response. Younger people didn't have this semi immunity which is why it is thought to have killed so many young people</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot about infections and immune systems I don't understand, and most other people don't either. I don't know what &quot;boosting&quot; your immune system means, for example. If it reacts stronger, you'll feel shittier, right?</p>
<p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but when you experience symptoms of an infection that aren't related directly to your immune response, then that can only mean the virus or bacteria already did a lot of damage, unchecked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it also related to the viral load you're exposed to?<br />
I recently saw an article that seems to point to mask wearing having a direct link to the amount of asymptomatic infections, supposing that thanks to the mask the wearer is exposed to a significantly lower viral load and thus does the body can fight the infection without apparent symptoms. (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026913" target="_blank">Article in question</a>) </p>
<p>Edit: wrong link.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many factors at play here, viral load is also likely to play some role in how the disease manifest it self. Imagine a guy with a genetic predisposition to getting slightly more ill from the sickness, the viral load might just be the critical last step in pushing it toward being lethal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering virus replicate so quickly that always seemed suspect to me. It seems intuitive but if a high viral load increases severity then a non professional caregiver like OP should get very ill. OP's case is not unique, lots of people out there are taking care of relatives, it would be noticed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>correct, so this is the hard part about COVID. People are not dying from COVID they are dying of the infection caused afterwards. Your body will &quot;kill&quot; any cells with COVID 19 fairly easily, the mass dying of these cells allows bacteria to grow in a &quot;dead&quot; cell. Bacteria and other junk fill the area where oxygen should be getting in. Young people who have strong immune systems and ability to keep breathing are much better shape than older folks who experience more cellular death, and bacterial growth, but also don't have the energy to keep breathing.</p></div>		</li>
