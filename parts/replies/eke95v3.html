<p>There are also various versions of x86, such as AMD64 which adds support for 64 bit, Intel license this from AMD, and AMD license x86 from Intel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it has to both be a parallelizable task and be programmed to actually utilize that. The programming part is unfortunately fairly difficult in many cases so people don't do it. Core counts are getting high enough, though, that there's a larger push for developers to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of misinformation about how cores work in a computer. There are lots of tasks that are extremely difficult to enhance by using more cores, most notably real time calculations like gaming requires. Having more cores won't help speed up a task if that task requires a step by step calculation that can't be calculated if if previous step isn't finished.</p>
<p>An example of this would be like having one person stack bricks as high as possible. You can add an extra person to add bricks while the other person is busy grabbing another, but adding 15 more people won't help because they can't put a brick on the stack while someone else is in middle of doing so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a developer: it’s not so simple as getting a push to do it. All developers would love to make their software run faster, and in newer programming languages and frameworks parallel work is easier than ever so it’s kind of a low bar. In fact, it’s almost always the first thing people reach for. </p>
<p>However, not all tasks are able to be parallelized. Especially when dealing with user-facing software, most tasks are forced to be serial.</p></div>		</li>
