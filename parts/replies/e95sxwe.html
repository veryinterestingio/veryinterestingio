			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for finally explaining that reference on HIMYM regarding the slutty pumpkin and Ted's costume. I've been wondering for years what his costume meant but was always too lazy to go and find out, partially because I had no idea how to spell it. :P Take my up vote for finally ending this little annoyance that pops up in the back of my mind every time I watch those specific episodes.</p></div>		</li>
