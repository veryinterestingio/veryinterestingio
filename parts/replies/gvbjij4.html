			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the right way to envision this a reference frame? My brain knows what my teeth feel like &quot;normally&quot; through the sensory inputs on my tongue, so it's easier for it to say &quot;hey, that input is different than usual, what's going on there?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the good explaination! I've heard that cats have a very interesting form of this; their whistlers can create a detailed 3D map of the space around their face. This is why some cats don't like deep, narrow food bowls; all their whiskers touch the boat and it's very &quot;loud&quot; or &quot;bright&quot; for them. </p>
<p>I also wonder how the precision of these maps can change with different modifications on the way you develop them. Is a map more precise if you look at what your hands are touching when you &quot;draw&quot; the map? (Such as learning an instrument). Is the tounge's mout-map better just because the younger is inside the teath, where-as getting a finger inside the teeth involves relatively extreme rotations and re-orientations? Do blinded people transfer touch maps into the visual portion of their brain, or do they just live based on touch maps?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you're asking many of the right questions. There's actually a suprising amount of whisker research that looks at how neural nets reprogram and reinterpret stuff in response to altered stimuli. </p>
<p>Maps, in general, are modified by all the senses at once in ways we don't understand. However, I'd venture that the smell map (yes, we have a 2-dimensional smell map) doesn't change too much in relation to sound while a touch map might change significantly from vision. </p>
<p>You could easily get a phd surrounding many of the questions you just asked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It's part of a group of conditions called agnosias though it is equally common to lose &quot;access&quot; to the maps rather than lose the map itself. Prosopagnosia is a more common one where the place that processes the face map is messed up and people can't remember faces or tell people apart. Everything else is fine though.</p></div>		</li>
