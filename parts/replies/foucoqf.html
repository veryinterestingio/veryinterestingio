			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, if we cant arouse you with vigorous shaking, somethings wrong ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>(genuine question - Irish nurse here. Was that a mistake or is that phrase used where you are? Because we usually mock and laugh at the person who documents arouse instead of rouse here but we've all done it!)</p>
<p>(and by that, I mean we've all accidentally documented the wrong word, not that any of us have tried arousing our patients!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this instance I'm guessing they had some unsolicited help in adding the <em>a</em> to <em>rouse</em>.</p>
<p>Dunno about you, but my phones' auto corrections <em>always</em> err on the side of making me look like a halfwit, and have done for as long as auto correct has been a thing. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love finding out the small differences in the same role between different countries, I find it fascinating! I just remember being a student and the triage nurse wrote &quot;unable to arouse patient verbally, pressure required&quot; and he was mocked endlessly because we are professionals ðŸ¤£</p></div>		</li>
