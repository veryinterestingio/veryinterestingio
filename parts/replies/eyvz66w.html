			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that B vitamins are hydrophilic too. Does vitamin C have a far stronger hydrophilic nature? Also, vitamin B5 is also an acid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks you for the correction. I wanted to refer Vit.B as an endophillic vitamins that likes to bind and stay inside the cell as it's required by our body as a co-factor in many important molecular functions.
And yes, Vit.C is more hydrophilic than B in this case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Vit.C is a hydrophilic compound which means it loves water and you lose it as you lose/refiltrate your body water. This is why you need to replenish your body's Vit.C levels almost every few days.</p>

<p>Where I could read this kind of &quot;vitamins how to use&quot;? It's fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found this interesting.  If you add vitamin C to spring pea soup it retains its color. <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/michael-chiarello/spring-pea-soup-recipe-1915570" target="_blank">https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/michael-chiarello/spring-pea-soup-recipe-1915570</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why squeezing a lemon or lime over guacamole will help the avocado retain it's color - the ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), rather than the citric acid is what does the trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>really? These are the things I studied when I learnt nutrition.<br />
If you want to learn a bit I can recommend doing a bit of reading on a site that's easy to read, but has a scientific approach.<br />
Like <a href="http://www.whfoods.com/foodstoc.php" target="_blank">http://www.whfoods.com/foodstoc.php</a> for example<br />
A few of their tips aren't that well formulated. They're using a scientific study to kinda lightly mention how something might work, when it's still quite unresolved. But that's only normal in the world of science. Plenty of scientists draw poor conclusions and conjecture. Since you seem interested in studying, I'm sure you're prepared to digging around a bit.  </p>
<p>You can also search journals, google scholar, or just randomly read around in journals for articles that aren't too rough to read. I can recommend <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-food-microbiology" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-food-microbiology</a> for example</p></div>		</li>
