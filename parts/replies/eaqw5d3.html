			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised this isn't farther along. I'm working on extraction methods now for NASA samples coming in to a sequencing core I work with looking at the microbiome of the upper atmosphere. (so literally capturing bacteria in glycol in apparatuses attached to balloons sent up to very high altitudes). Seems like it's almost easier to send up some sample collection tubes/media and bring it back down than develop a whole apparatus to attach to a balloon.</p>
<p>I have to wonder about the difficulty of taking and storing samples for sequencing for such a long trip home. It seems to me that certain bacteria might propagate in the storage media skewing the amount of DNA present and potentially washing out reads from less prevalent bacteria. </p>
<p>I'd also have to assume that due to the difficulty of obtaining samples, it's probably worth a deeper shotgun approach, as opposed to 16s, in order to get data on other functional genes as well as species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not quite sure what their collection system is. I’m basically 1 group removed from the sample collection. They collect it and send it to the sequencing core and I work for one of the vendors of the sequencing core to help them get the DNA/RNA they need (among other things).  </p>
<p>This sequencing core happens to get all kinds of weird stuff like rocks from deep inside the earth and other core samples that I have to help them get bacterial DNA from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if they are using 16s they won't get accurate quantification anyway. 16s copy number varies unpredictably after a certain genetic distance from the closest sequenced organism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the microbiome researchers I work with are less concerned with quantification as they are with looking for what’s in the population, so that’s why I didn’t approach it with that in mind.</p>
<p>But really it’s moot because with shotgun they’d get species, quantification and functional genes too and the latter seems like it could potentially answer more questions about differences in virulence and antibiotic resistance </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the conversation is long over, but I'm extremely curious; is there some upper limit to how high up we find life on Earth, or is it possible that there are bacteria so far above the earth that they could be considered to be &quot;in outer space?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends at least in part on how you define 'space'. The traditional definition puts it at 100km ASL (the Karman Line) but there is significant atmosphere all the way up to about 150km so at least potentially airborne organisms could be found in that block. Of course temperature gets really cold there and radiation levels are high but in a world of extremeophile bacteria I would not rule out something evolved to live there.
But if you define space as 'outside the atmosphere' then the answer is 'no'. We have no evidence of any life outside all atmosphere that we didn't put there nor any viable theory for how it could survive. Even tardigrades can only survive there in their crystalline hibernation phase.
So by the former definition it's entirely plausible but somebody else will have to answer if we have actually found proof of life up there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are able to share, is it because they lack equipment on board or qualified people to do it or both? Clearly sedning sample back to earth would compromise the whole point of the research, so i am curious why it wasn't done before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sample collection capabilities are in place, and astronauts have been trained. There is no sequencing platform that works in micro gravity, so for now, samples would have to be returned to earth, which introduces other technical challenges</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the sequencing be done on the ISS or sealed samples shipped back to earth? Also if you dont mind, do you know what methods they might use? Gravity would probably prevent ELISA tests I imagine, but they would probably want to be more specific. PFGE? Whole genome sequencing? I imagine it would also be based on what equipment is economical and feasible to ship up there.</p>
<p>Super interesting! Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most next gen sequencing equipment is very sensitive to vibration. Also, next gen sequencing tech capable of doing metagenomics is pretty heavy (the smallest one that I know of, the Illumina Miseq, is around 200lbs and can only do 16S amplicon sequencing) so it's probably cost prohibitive to bring into outer space. Not to mention all the accessory equipment you would need to prepare the samples for sequencing. Where I work, we do very small scale next gen sequencing and the sum of all of the DNA extraction and library prep and sequencing equipment takes up a small room. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The goal is to have a sequencing platform in space, but there is no system that currently works in micro-gravity. A top of the line genome sequencer on earth (which gives the best cost per base) costs around 1 million dollars, and that's for a fully commercialized  product. It will be prohibitively expensive to develop a space based sequencer. New pore based systems might work, but we are a ways off. The obvious solution is to return samples to earth, but perhaps not so surprising, re-entry is harder than it looks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's already been done actually, recently -- the oxford nanopore minION works in space. They sent pre-made, frozen libraries up and sequenced them on the ISS. </p>
