			<div class="markdown"><p>Graphite in your pencil is pure carbon as well, its just all linked together.</p>
<p>Activated carbon is just a really fine pure carbon powder.</p>
<p>Like anything, you have to have enough energy to start a chain reaction. The carbon and oxygen will only react if they are hot enough, and then it will be self sustaining. </p>
<p>This is why the pyrolysis is done in an inert atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are confusing the idea of existing as individual atoms with existing as a pure substance. </p>
<p>If you had a neutral carbon atom by itself, it would have 4 electrons on the outermost &quot;shell&quot;. This &quot;shell&quot; wants 8.  So given the chance, the carbon atom will grab whatever is closest, sharing electrons to fill that shell.</p>
<p>Carbon can exist as a pure substance, quite happily. Diamond is pure carbon atoms, linked in a tetrahedral geometry. Diamond is obviously very stable given it sits in the ground for millions of years without breaking down.</p>
<p>Oxygen has 6 outer electrons, so only needs 2 bonds to make 8. That's why pure oxygen exists as O2. It's two oxygen atoms joined by a double bond. The only other way oxygen could exist in a pure form would be a chain of single bonds (still 2 bonds on each atom). This is a lot less stable as double bonds are obviously stronger than single bonds. Even with double bonds O2 is pretty reactive. That's why it's the other half of combustion and respiration. It reacts to form more stable products like CO2 and H2O, releasing usable energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is eaten as a poison cure for this reason - by diluting the concentration of poison with indigestible charcoal, your system ends up digesting less of the poison</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word &quot;diluting&quot; doesn't do justice to the effect. That's what you'd get if you just swallowed some sand. A tiny amount of activated carbon binds (physically, not chemically) a huge amount of the poison because of its outrageous surface area - about 1 parking lot / gram in SI units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh... Not doomed. It's controversial just how problematic charred or burnt food really is, but there is a non-zero increase in cancer risk, and several other possible health problems. It's smaller than many other lifestyle choices (smoking, drinking, sunscreen use, overeating are all more significant) but it is a risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common misconception, and I blame bad science reporting. Charring definitely produces carcinogenic compounds, so people say &quot;charred food causes cancer&quot;</p>
<p>While that's not technically wrong, it's super misleading. Carcinogens raise your risk of cancer. Some raise it significantly, but most raise it negligibly, and it always depends on dose. </p>
<p>If you regularly eat food with a little char on it, you've ever so slightly increased the chances that you'll get a digestive cancer some day. But unless you have a significant risk from some other factor (like heredity), you shouldn't worry about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pyrolyzing, in this context, means to heat high carbon containing things up in an atmosphere without oxygen.</p>
<p>Essentially boiling away everything that's not carbon.</p>
<p>So yes, if your food is carbon based (which I sincerely hope your food is), it is possible to pyrolyze it.</p></div>		</li>
