			<div class="markdown"><p>This is because keeping that food under certain temps without freezing the bottom of the pan is impossible. Salad bars that are out all day almost always are above temp unless they’re swapping out pans every 30 mins.  Not to mention the high risk of cross contamination. In my state salad bars are currently not allowed due to pandemic anyway.</p></div>		</li>
