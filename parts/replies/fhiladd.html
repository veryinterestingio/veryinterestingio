			<div class="markdown"><p>An important point here for artificial hearts is that they will not stop. When you die, whatever mechanism causes your death normally causes a chain of events that includes your heart failing and the heart stopping is commonly the final failure that actually makes you dead.</p>
<p>The reason being that the heart has a massive need for energy and when it can't be supplied properly it dies very quickly. The rest of your body can survive longer without oxygenated blood and can fail in pieces.</p>
<p>This leads to a scenario where a person with an artificial heart can survive many of the catastrophic medical events that beset the very elderly and very ill, without dying, but while becoming progressively weaker, more ill, and more brain damaged. </p>
<p>To massively oversimplify, of course people with artificial hearts can die. With unstoppable hearts that cannot fail even as their body collapses around them, you are essentially condemning them to a very specific kind of wasting death that involves a long tapering off in quality of life with a very painful amount of time spent at rock bottom.</p>
<p>When a doctor should stop a healthy &quot;heart&quot; to curtail that rock bottom stage is an important and difficult question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be that as it may, if things got that bad certainly the patient could decide to simply unplug the heart, could they not?  And if they're at the point where they can't do it themselves, are they even aware of it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I transported a guy with an LVAD during my clinical rotation for my EMT license. My preceptors thought it was hilarious to ride me for not being able to get a pulse or blood pressure as did the patient, who apparently does this regularly to anyone new. </p>
<p>I felt like a tool, but it was a good laugh and I learned to make sure I am checking for that before I start CPR on someone (quickly checking).</p></div>		</li>
