			<div class="markdown"><p>Micheal Pollan’s How To Change Your Mind is a great journalistic summary on the history of drug research as well as first hand experience if anyone is interested! It really goes into the “why” of how we don’t know much about this field yet, too. Great read!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a very satisfying answer, but the correct one. We really simply don’t currently have a good understanding of the brain works, or how any drugs, whether they’re psychedelics or anti-depressants, truly affect it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your description is pretty much right on point. I initially thought there was some deeper truth that I was tapping into, but eventually came to the conclusion that it just allows my imagination to go haywire and induces a dream like state where everything feels like an extremely vivid dream. So much poo-poo information being spread by both sides.</p>
<p>That said, one of my experiences was so vivid and impactful that it still impacts the person I am today. I was a devout Christian at the time and believed that good and evil are opposite of each other. On DMT I saw a vision of good and evil being stranded together almost like DNA and essentially being the same thing. While this duality isn't a new concept by any means and Buddhism embraces it often, it went against my current belief system yet I believed it partly because of how meaningful that experience felt. I recognize that it likely just came from my imagination, but that doesn't make the experience any less meaningful.</p>
<p>Yes, I've also seen and felt the entities that people often talk about on DMT, and also felt complete unity with the universe, but our minds easily trick is to believe things that are not reflective of reality.</p>
<p>That said, being under the influence of DMT isn't any better or worse than being sober. It's just different in a beautifully bizarre way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit to this, there does seem to be some consistency in how different psychedelics alter human perception. </p>
<p>For example: visual perception alterations due to LSD intoxication are typical described as 'fractal' or perhaps 'geometric' whereas visual alterations from psilocybin (mushrooms) are typical described as more 'dripping/melting'. So when you get the classic report of visual 'geometric spaces elves' from DMT trips it likely stems from a common chemical alteration of the visual pathway and subsequent common interpretation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've tried both and honestly found a lot of similarities in both visual alterations. Psilocybin did give me this strange effect where I felt things were larger or smaller than they actually are, and often made me feel as if I was in a dome or a snow globe of sorts. Both substances created wavy illusions on the ground for me. It looked like the ground was bubbling up like soft waves in the ocean. Things like the way trees move were very similar but the sky was different. LSD makes the sky look like a kaleidoscope. On Psilocybin the sky was beautiful and seemed to change color. It was like I was watching a nonexistent light show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of the lsd perceptions can be linked to enhanced senses. Your pupils dilate, more light coming in, but everything seems to slow, which suggests your brain is processing faster. Plus there's the sensation of seeing music, and your brain is doing deep self analysis all at the same time, hence. Bad trips if you have self consciousness issues or skeletons in your closet.</p></div>		</li>
