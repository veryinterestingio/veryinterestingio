			<div class="markdown"><p>I once lived in a grove of huge loblolly pines. Every time a hurricane would blow one down and I had to clean up the mess, and count the growth rings, they all were seedlings the summer that Hurricane Hazel tore through the region and flattened the big hardwoods. It gave a bunch of seedling pines a chance to stand in the sun “growth from death” indeed.</p>
<p>The Cape Fear region of coastal North Carolina is aptly named.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>on a small scale I can relate. I grew up spending my summers at the cabin til I was about 16. From the time school ended til the week before it went back, I was in the Canadian Shield in the Whiteshell National Park in Manitoba. </p>
<p>on the weekends my dad and my brothers and I would go to the lumber mill and get the free firewood. it was mostly bark and there was a lot of pine cones and stuff.</p>
<p>We would burn that stuff in our outdoor pit all the time and every spring when we would come back after the snow melted and the ground defrosted, we would find a dozen or more little baby pine trees around the pit. we would cut them out. transplant them into places around our yard that had light and space. and many of them made it for years.</p></div>		</li>
