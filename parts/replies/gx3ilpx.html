			<div class="markdown"><p>First, when we talk about mRNA and COVID its usually in regard to the vaccine. mRNA is the basis for the technology used to make the vaccine. There isn't an &quot;mRNA virus&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, and it functions to some degree by acting/behaving like mRNA. But that's mostly a consequence of the fact that our cells use mRNA to build proteins. All viruses use our cells to make proteins and there are a few different paths viruses use to get to that goal. Coronaviruses, Influenza, Rhinovirus and other single-stranded RNA viruses just do it a bit more directly.</p>
<p>Lots of words that don't really answer the question yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can a cell be infected by two viruses at the same time? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, mechanically that's possible. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would the result overwrite the original virus? Or create copies of both viruses?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. That's not quite how it works. The two viruses would compete for resources. There isn't really a specific place where viruses are &quot;stored&quot; in a cell. Rather, they just hang out in the cell making as many copies of themselves as they can. The vast majority of viruses don't have any mechanism for sensing that another virus might be present much less take some action to remove it. </p>
<p>Imagine two competing viruses as two different programs on a laptop both sending print jobs to the printer. Together, they slow each other down because the printer can only do so much. However, so far as the printer/laptop is concerned, stuff is horrible and there's no time to print anything else. Your cells have the same problem. Even if the viruses might be competing, stuff still bad. The two viruses together will still kill the cell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or create a mutation unique to both?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, no. However, there are some important counterexamples. Influenza is also an RNA virus, but its genome is composed of 8 distinct segments. Those segments aren't particularly attached to each other. If two different Influenza variants infect the same cell, all their segments get mixed together when the virus copies are created. The eight segments that get assembled into the Influenza virus that exits the cell can be a mixture of segments from both variants.</p>
<p>That's not technically a mutation, but it can create a new variant. </p>
<p>When we name Influenza variants, its usually based on major versions of a couple of the segments. There are thousands of strains, but they're grouped by the major segment types. A decade ago, the primary Human Influenza type was H3N2 (HA type 3, NA type 2). The 1918 Flu was H1N1. In 2006 (I think), when a new variant of Swine flu appeared (also H1N1), there were a number of variants that appeared with types of H3N1 and H1N2. These came when people were infected with both H1N1 and H3N2 variants. These coinfections managed to make new variants that were unlike the two coinfections.</p>
<p>Now, almost just as importantly: Coronavirus doesn't have segments like Influenza. It doesn't do that rearrangement trick. There are still some weird things that can happen when multiple RNA viruses infect a cell and try to make copies of themselves at the same time. This ultimately means that there is an increased chance of changes (which are ultimately the same as mutations for most purposes), but not at anywhere near the rate as Influenza.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this explanation, it helps a lot.</p>
<p>One last question, just to make sure I understand the process correctly.</p>
<p>The RNA virus enters the cell.  Then it somehow injects its RNA code into the DNA of that cell (correct?) so that when the cell codes mRNA for protein creation, it ends up creating viruses instead of proteins (or rather virus proteins instead of cell stuff proteins). Right?</p>
<p>So is there a usual location in the DNA that the viruses tend to attack?  Or is it far more general and random?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same cell could absolutely be injected by another virus because as a retrovirus, the location of insertion into the genome will likely not be the same as the first and thus not interrupt the first. That said, you can have recombination (mix and match) between the two sets of genetics leading to a novel virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not 100% certain because we didn't cover this exactly in class, but i believe it would cause a mutation, basically a combination of both. I assume it would be like conjugation in bacterial cells. </p>
<p>On the other hand, depending on the combination, it could cause the cell to lyse entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm totally clueless in this topic so treat me like a toddeler playing with daddy's big words, please...</p>
<p>But it was my noob understanding that Covid has a long string of adenine on its tail which helps prevent the cell for detecting it and throwing up warning signs.  Would this play a role in preventing a competing virus from corrupting the Covid RNA and further promote the idea that the cell would possibly just manufacture both viruses independently?</p></div>		</li>
