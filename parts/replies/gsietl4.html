			<div class="markdown"><p>Hormone production our body are in a loop system, high levels of a particular hormone cuts off the production of other hormones. Take for example estrogen and prolactin. Estrogen stimulates the growth of milk ducts, thereby increasing the number of cells and hence the chance of error and mutations. But milk itself is produced from the effect of prolactin on the milk ducts, which happens after delivery. High levels of prolactin cuts off the production of estrogen and vice versa.   </p>
<p>So continually breastfeeding ensures prolactin secretion thus estrogen is suppressed. Estrogen suppressed leading to less cell turnover thus less chance of mutations leading to cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i thought a side effect of high prolactin from certain medications(antipsychotics, amisupiride i think is particularly guilty) LED to gynocomastia and stimulation of lactation?</p>
<p>ofc could be a nuance of it being a drug intoduced into the system and all sorts of other things - for all I know increases prolactin AND estrogen and that somehow does it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer .. the only part that might be worth adding is probably the evolutionary perspective to it, especially if one asks ok then compared to breast-cancer there should be way more leukemia or cancers of say the mouth or testes or stomach or uterus etc .. but there are fewer .. why are breasts more cancer susceptible even compared to their cell-turnover rates?</p>
<p>.. and there are at least two contributing aspects to it .. first species specific sexual behaviors and phenotypes are among the most rapidly changing things evolutionarily speaking, so while over evolutionary times animals have had many millions of years to try and tamp down things like cancer of blood cells or stomach which turnover way way more, large breast enlargement is relatively new addition in human physiology, and therefore selection pressures have had less time to push them back down </p>
<p>.. and second in the list, since breast cancers are fueled by hormones and therefore the risk only rises after puberty, by the time they become life-threatening, its usually after the susceptible individuals have already had or even raised the next generation .. this makes evolutionary selection to weed out the breast-cancer susceptibility genes (or to spread the protective genes) weak .. and the same thing can be seen with say prostate cancer etc .. or really most diseases of old age .. evolution is weaker at weeding out things that appear long past child-bearing ages</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All good points. </p>
<p>In addition to hormonal input, it's also important to consider genetic predisposition (with known genes contributing to either the susceptibility or the resilience of an individual), behavioral consequences (reproductive status and hormonal birth control usage), and environmental carcinogen risk (we're literally bathed in carcinogens from nearly every surface in our homes and yards).</p></div>		</li>
