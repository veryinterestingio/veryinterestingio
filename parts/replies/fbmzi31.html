<p>Truly talented DJs will also produce their own music, in which case theyâ€™re more an artist than a DJ.</p>

<p>There's an advantage too if you produce your own music.. You can design tracks to mix well with other tracks, making mixing easier..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looping is perfectly possible on vinyl. Ever heard of a sampler?</p>
<p>My mixer has one, i push a button it records whats playing through a particular channel on the mixer (a vinyl record) I can then loop this sample as many times as i want. It can even be done using a piece of sticky tape (its what scratchers do)</p>
<p>Key and beat matching are also pretty easy on vinyl. It just takes practice. Literally got it to the point i can slap on a record, listen to about 2 secs of it, one slight pitch shift. Que it up and let it go. Perfectly beat matched. (i dont use BPM counters)</p>
<p>In the case of Key matching its literally listening to a tune and deciding if its in the same key as one thats playing. Something all musicians should be able to do using nothing but their ear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looping on vinyl is traditionally done through beat juggling where you keep rewinding one record while the other is playing, Then at a certain point you switch turntable and reverse the first one to the same point and repeat for how long you want. </p>
<p>A loop button is a more high tech solution and is actually an instant replay function looping a recording of the record. So it is actually not looping vinyl, but looping a recording.</p></div>		</li>
