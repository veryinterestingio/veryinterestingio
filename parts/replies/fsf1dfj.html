			<div class="markdown"><p>Sample size of 2, then, because I understand it just fine as well.</p>
<p>My guess is Chinese characters depend on context (ie. surrounding characters) to derive meaning, so this works to a certain extent as long as the correct characters are nearby neighbors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this sentence went viral a few years ago, so I think the sample size is much bigger than 2.</p>

<p>The theory is that when you scan over a sentence, you do not read it character by character, but more in blocks of characters, 1-2 characters to the left of the character you are looking at and 2-3 to the right, so 4-6 characters at a time, and then your brain tries to make sense of the characters that it has just read.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For example, when your scan over  “研表究明 ”, your brain receives the characters 研、表、究、明. Then it recognizes 研究 (research) and 表明 (to show) as potential words, so   putting one and one together, this block of text must mean “研究表明” (research shows).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not necessarily. the stuff of mixed order in there are all self evident and doesn't rely on context. Mostly we scan more than a word (研究表明) instead of one character at a time so you know what you read even though that v+o is completely messed up in order. for those who don't read chinese, the first two characters =studies, the next 2 = shown. the order went 1324 instead of 1234 for those 4 characters.</p>
<p>when you see 序顺 you know it's 顺序 backwards. you'd have to be really beginner at the language not to know if 序顺 is a word or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>+1 to the sample size that there is absolutely no issue in comprehending the scrambled sentence.</p>
<p>However, in your example, you're scrambling the order of the <strong>words/characters</strong> in a sentence, not so much the individual words/characters themselves.</p>
<p>The equavlent to OP's example in Chinese would be to mess up the strokes within the Chinese characters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True to that. If to follow OP's example, I would say that  it does not apply to Chinese at all. If you scramble the strokes within a Chinese character, it will become completely unreadable or a totally different word: for example,  scramble the Chinese character 上 (means Up), it could become 下 (means Down), or 土 （means Dirt), or 工 (means Work).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's still readable to some extent. it's called typos and it exists in every single language.</p>
<p>For example, let's say 天下没有不散的宴席  (there isn't a single get-together that won't end in the world = all good things must end). </p>
<p>There can be a typo, changing 天 to 夫</p>
<blockquote>
<p>夫下没有不散的宴席</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you know what this means even if the first character is wrong. More often, in typing you get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>天下没有不散的演戏</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and you still know what this is. We do this all the time when IMing, especially typing on a phone. 90% of the time context will help you in determining what the sentence is about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually pretty interesting it's still legible in Chinese if you scramble the whole words, because if I were to scramble the words in an English sentence it's pretty easy to lose the meaning. Like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Able probably read sentence this to you're. Chinese does languages in like non-alphabet this work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems almost illegible to me by comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am native Chinese and when I read the sentence, I don't read it character by character, but rather my eyes skim over the whole sentence and capture the keywords and my brain synthesizes the meaning of the sentence from the keywords. It doesn't matter how each word is ordered, as long as the SVO syntax structure is still there.</p></div>		</li>
