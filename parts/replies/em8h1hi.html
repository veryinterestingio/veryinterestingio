			<div class="markdown"><p>Can this example with the perception of <em>car radio volume</em> you described have the same cause as why when I listen to music, let's say 120bpm seems to be slower when I'm excited during the run and faster when I'm relaxed in the evening?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say so, yes. Humans are terrible at measuring absolutes (with our own senses, which is why we made tools for that), but absolutely fantastic at measuring change... 20° C, for example, might feel cold to you, but raising the thermostat from 16° to 18° feels toasty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a theory that we like rhythms at the tempos we do because they resemble our heartbeat tempos. That's probably the cause for liking slow music when you're relaxed and liking fast paced music when you're excited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I've got this problem that I can almost never shut out background noise(especially anything with repetitive bass) and it gets to the point it feels like torture and I either go in to a rage where I wan't to punch someone or panic mode where I just wan't to get the hell outta Dodge. </p>
<p>What is going on here really?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be a symptom of Autism or ADHD, might be worth looking into common symptoms for these and see if you relate.  I mention this because I have ASD&amp;ADHD and this is something I struggle with specifically, especially the (seemingly excessive) frustration&amp;anxiety it causes</p>
<p>These conditions may not be at all how you imagined them and a LOT of people go through life undiagnosed because we're used to such an exaggerated stereotype (eg. Sheldon from Big Bang)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I experience a similar reaction to noises in the evening, however, I KNOW that my anger stems more from my inability to accept the rudeness of human beings because I am a very respectful person. The more respectful a person is, the more likely it is they will notice when others aren't. </p>
<p>After experiencing the same disrespect over and over from my neighbors, I develop an increased anxiety that starts up immediately upon hearing the first traces of the noises they are making that are disturbing my life in my home.  The repeated anxiety can produce the same effect as PTSD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, you can smell you house smell. You leave for a few hours and come back, your not accustomed to your house smell and can notice things. Like how the trash needs to be taken out or dishes cleaned. It’s not that it suddenly started smelling in the 3 hours you were gone, it’s just that now you notice.</p></div>		</li>
