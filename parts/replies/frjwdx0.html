			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, you produce cytokines all the time, not just while sick. And we make them for all sorts of reasons. They're just another subset of cellular messengers. Only some of them cause the deadly inflammation we see when we refer to &quot;cytokine storm&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Cytokines are essentially the way in which cells communicate! Chemokines are the way in which cells TELL other cells that there is an infection or 'fight' going down in a particular location of within the tissues of the body. Usually, when a pathogen or germ or bug successfully breeches the physical barriers (skin, mucus, acidic areas) or the chemical barriers (such as special enzymes that have anti-pathogenic capabilities also known as defensins) the resident phagocytes such as neutrophils or macrophages sense a foreign particle or pathogen and call on their friends for back-up. Complement is another way in which the body causes inflammation essentially tagging the pathogen with an antibody or a complement-related foreign flag to signal to the phagocytes to come and eat this dude or whatever is left of him after complement punches a bunch of holes in him. To get all these friends there the blood vessels become leaky and this stretches the cells all around this area to allow white blood cells to squeeze through vessels and move through the tissues, but all this fluid also creates immense pressure (swelling) onto the surrounding nerves and pissing off these nerves to talk to the brain that it hurts! The heat results from energy expense from the leukocytes fighting. The pain reminds us to not touch that area so that it can heal properly. Redness results from the blood leaking out and diameter of the blood vessel increasing in size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seen a lot of people on reddit speculate about cytokines storms, but I haven’t really seen any studies or doctors make the same claims. </p>
<p>I wonder, by now if it’s merely people regurgitating the same speculations time after time and now it’s considered fact.</p></div>		</li>

I suppose it's too early for concrete studies on this phenomena but this is interesting speculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned in a few comments throughout, the inflammatory signalling cascade helps direct the immune system to the problem. There's a generalized inflammation, but the area in question sends off the strongest signals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Inflammation also causes your vessels to become &quot;leaky&quot; in a process called extravasation. This fluid will leak into your tissue and will cause that &quot;achy&quot; pain you feel when you have the flu. This fluid contains WBCs that will go and kill whatever it's supposed to, which will lead to more pain. </p>

<p>If I'm understanding correctly your blood vessels open up and your whole body is just suffused with fluid and white blood cells. If you have a localized injury (you hit your elbow on a table or something) you'll have localized inflammation. With an all-over illness, it's all-over aching. In either case you're still just a skin bag with only so much elasticity, so if there's extra fluid around all of your joints they don't move as easily and hurt. That also lets the white blood cells get all over, so they can attack whatever they need to, especially if it's systemic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see no one wants to answer this question ... why do we hurt when we are sick? There is no proven explanation so we are left with guesses. One guess is that it limits the spread of disease, a sort of biological social distancing mechanism. If you lie down in bed, you aren’t coughing all over everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons. </p>
<p>1) Because it makes us do nothing and conserve energy.</p>
<p>2) because it works really well for injury (which also heals by inflammatory) causing us to avoid moving or using the injured body part. Evolution generally tries to do things as simply as possible and so it's not going to produce two completely separate healing systems but instead use the one, slightly differently, for all cases of damage. So we react to illness with broadly the same mechanism as we do injury. And if you were to break your arm, that mechanism (inflammatory) would tell you not to fucking move your arm or ouchie. So in illness like the flu it can cause overall aches</p></div>		</li>
