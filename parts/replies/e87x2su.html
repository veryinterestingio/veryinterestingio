			<div class="markdown"><p>Most fish is deep frozen to kill parasites if it's to be consumed raw. Other fish is fermented or preserved for some time in brine.</p>
<p>It's quite rare that fish is eaten completely rare without being treated in some way.</p>
<p>For example 70% of caught herring are infected with nematodes, that can also infect humans.</p>
<p>I don't personally know about sea food, but I expect it's the same as with any wildlife: They are exposed to many many more parasites than farmed animals, and thus aren't usually safe to be eaten directly from the sea.</p>
<p>Edit: Parasite in this comment refers to stuff like round or tape worms.
Freezing is nearly completely ineffective again bacteria or fungi, it just puts them into dormancy, and does not remove the contamination. </p></div>		</li>

Raw urchin made me vomit but only from the taste lol. I have also eaten raw chicken and raw eggs. I wonder if it is just farming methods and handling that make it okay to eat it raw here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stick to getting it st a high end restaurant, or make it yourself. One trick to make it, or rare burgers, yourself safely, is to buy a single cut of meat, pack it in salt, and refrigerate for ~30min. This will kill off the bulk of bacteria that may be on the surface of the meat (the inside will be fine). Then wash off the salt, and mince/grind the beef, and you should be good to go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey fellow food safety scientist here!
Just here to add that the main issue with seafood is often with bivalve shellfish (think oysters, mussels, scallops) because they're filter feeders, meaning that they eat by filtering water through their system and retaining food particles. The problem is that viruses and bacteria are small enough to get in there and some viruses like Norovirus can actually bind to the tissues in the shellfish digestive tract (there are a bunch of other pathogens too, Noro is just the one I know best). Since Norovirus is often shed in feces, and shellfish harvesting areas are often close enough to the coast that sewage output water can circulate to them...well...your oysters end up filtering sewage water. This is why it is generally recommended to cook shellfish prior to consumption. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately it's up to you to decide if it's worth the risk. Lots of food carry risks of pathogens (including things like fruits and vegetables, milk, cheeses, manufactured foods). You eat lots of these things on a regular basis without even thinking about the risk of pathogens.
I've done a lot of work on Norovirus in raw shellfish and I still eat them. I am also a healthy, non pregnant, non immunocompromised adult. And maybe just a tad stubborn about eating whatever I want.</p>
<p>I would absolutely not recommend taking risks with regards to food safety for anyone who is immunocompromised (pregnant women, the elderly, children, immunodeficiency, etc). </p>
<p>This is 100% my opinion and I would recommend following published food safety guidelines if you ever have any doubts about what is/isn't safe though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at it this way - how many oysters have you eaten, and how many times have you gotten sick? </p>
<p>I have eaten lots of oysters, and never been sick (<em>knocks on wood</em>) - so feel like that's decent odds. Also, where you get your oysters from matters as well.  The most dangerous bacteria, Vibrio vulnificus, is in warm coastal waters. So get oysters from colder, northern seas.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely why i refuse to eat oysters, clams, or scallops. Oyster shucks are a huge thing here in Charleston, SC. Thing is; if you look at the water a few decades ago as opposed to now after the population boomed and overfishing of oysters peaked, there's a clear cut difference (no pun intended) in the clarity of the water. Its far murkier now. Those bivalves serve a purpose; nature's little automatic fishtank cleaners. Never in my life have i thought to take the filter out of a fishtank cleaner and chomp on it, but that's more or less oysters in a nutshell. Sure, boiling's a great practice for killing off bacteria, but even with the danger gone, I can't get the premise out of my mind. They're <em>shit filters</em> and people eat them raw. Pardon me while I go lose my lunch...</p></div>		</li>
