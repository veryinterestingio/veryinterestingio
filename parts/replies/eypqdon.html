			<div class="markdown"><p>Double negatives are not always incorrect. </p>
<p>See what I did there? This is a double negative (not not correct). While it could be written as “double negatives are sometimes correct”, it carries a slightly different tone as the double negative. Especially if you stress the word “always”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mm/dd/yyyy format makes more sense though, it’s how it’s <em>usually</em> spoken. Nobody says “the twenty-fifth of December in the year two-thousand and eighteen”, they say “December twenty-fifth twenty-eighteen”. It would definitely make more sense and cause less confusion if everybody wrote it the same way though, regardless of where you are living.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took four years of French in high school and no one ever bothered to explain this to us. Saying the year 1999 as &quot;mille neuf cent quatre-vingt-dix-neuf&quot; is basically saying &quot;one thousand nine hundred four-twenty-ten-nine&quot;, or less literally but still awkward, &quot;one thousand nine hundred eighty-nineteen&quot;.</p>
<p>The last two digits don't even follow the same pattern because &quot;quatre-vingt&quot; is meant to mean &quot;4 x 20&quot; whereas &quot;dix-neuf&quot; means &quot;10 + 9&quot;. And the hundreds and thousands columns aren't expressed in the same way, each column has its own value (mille is 1000 and neuf cent is 900). I honestly don't know if one can even say &quot;dix-neuf cent&quot; and have it mean the same thing. It's been 20 years since I even studied French though, and I'm certain I didn't retain all the subtleties</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the thing though. It kind of does. What doesn't make sense is that we did it only with the 60's and 80's. And you don't first learn 80 as 4 x 20. It's just the name of the thing. You learn it as &quot;ka-tre-vin&quot;, not &quot;quatre-vingt&quot; (four twenties). Know what I mean? The four twenties, you figure it out later. And it makes you go huh....cool. We don't know the <em>reason</em> why, but don't tell me it doesn't make sense, it's mathematically correct! It's just a weird name.</p></div>		</li>
