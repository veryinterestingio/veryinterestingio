			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fantastic summary of how salt enhances taste perception on the tongue. In addition, the flavor of food is a multisensory experience that includes the olfaction/smell of the food. This is true for aspects of flavor that go beyond the basics of sweet-salty-bitter-sour-umami. Without stimulation of one of those primary taste sensations on the tongue (i.e., adding a little salt, sugar, acid, etc.), the olfactory aspects are relatively muted. Likewise, when you have a cold that affects the sinuses, food tastes bland because it mainly has those 5 basic sensations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sodium ions seem to stimulate a slight “sweet” taste when hydrated. This may have to do with the way that water molecules clump around sodium ions...the sweet receptors on your tongue respond to hydrogen atoms on the surface of sugar molecules, and sometimes the hydrogen of water molecules clumped around a Na+ ion can be the right distance apart and trigger a “sweet” sensation too</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is this also why some sparkling water (especially the “flavored/essenced” kind) includes sodium? I’ve noticed that some brands still have a somewhat sweet finish despite being sugar- and artificial sweetener-free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it has more to do with his first point: carbonation is really bitter, and a bit of salt will help reduce that bitterness and instead bring out the sweetness of the carbonation</p></div>		</li>
