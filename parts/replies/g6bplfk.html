			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi u/VeryLittle, as a physicist I guess you will be aware of IOP Publishing's announcement about introducing double blind peer review? <a href="https://ioppublishing.org/news/iop-publishing-commits-to-adopting-double-blind-peer-review-for-all-journals/" target="_blank"><a href="https://ioppublishing.org/news/iop-publishing-commits-to-adopting-double-blind-peer-review-for-all-journals/" target="_blank">https://ioppublishing.org/news/iop-publishing-commits-to-adopting-double-blind-peer-review-for-all-journals/</a></a></p>
<p>The motivation for this is all about reducing bias/increasing diversity in the review process. As diversity issues are front and centre right now, I suspect these may be a significant driver of innovation and change in peer review processes in the coming months and years.</p>
<p>On the subject of bias, and from a different field altogether, it's worth keeping an eye out for the research coming from the British Ecological Society (not for some time yet!): <a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/british-ecological-society-large-scale-study-test-blinding-reduces-bias-science-publishing/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/british-ecological-society-large-scale-study-test-blinding-reduces-bias-science-publishing/" target="_blank">https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/british-ecological-society-large-scale-study-test-blinding-reduces-bias-science-publishing/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much, u/VeryLittle for your question. </p>
<p>Rather than being dependent on the subject area, you may find it is publisher-specific. A number of publishers are running innovative peer review initiatives (I've added some examples below) that they are piloting or have now rolled out. Those publishers may be multi-disciplinary or subject-specific. The multi-disciplinary publishers might have a preference for which journals they include in the pilot - faster publication times, higher impact etc. Science related titles generally have faster publication times so they are often included in pilots to garner more feedback in a shorter space of time, however, as researchers in different disciplines have such varying needs, it's important to have a more holistic perspective.</p>

<p>It's fascinating when you look at a service like Publons the number of verified reviews in the last 12 months - pretty much every journal at the top looks to be STM related - <a href="https://publons.com/journal/?order_by=num_reviews_last_one_year" target="_blank"><a href="https://publons.com/journal/?order\_by=num\_reviews\_last\_one\_year" target="_blank">https://publons.com/journal/?order\_by=num\_reviews\_last\_one\_year</a></a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with u/LouPeckOfficial - experimentation is more publishing-specific than subject-specific. With new models being introduced it is important however that authors and reviewers do not get confused and understand the nature of peer review practices, for this reason STM launched a project to develop a standard taxonomy for peer review.
