			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. And it also illustrates the considerations that go into staying API compatible vs breaking the API. An electric car works *very* differently than a gasoline car. Gasoline cars today work very differently than gasoline cars 75 years ago. If you were building a car from scratch today you might come up with a &quot;better&quot; &quot;API&quot; for it (e.g. hand controlled slider for accelerating rather than a foot pedal). BUT it would be a nightmare to roll out. No one would want a car that they have to relearn how to drive. So you just stick with the old API (gas &amp; brake pedals, steering wheel etc) because compatibility is a smoother transition than migrating to a new API.</p>
<p>At some point, we may just have to bite the bullet and make an incompatible API change though. Probably when everyone becomes super comfortable with self driving cars so it is least disruptive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the impressive part is (if you can drive stick) you can <em>still</em> get in a 75 year old car and be able to drive it pretty quickly. Because the API has been maintained very consistently.</p></div>		</li>

My first car in HS was a Beetle and the first time I drove it I couldn't figure out reverse so I had to put in neutral and my friend and I pushed it backward. Guy in the parking lot was just shaking his head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Ideally, you‚Äôll give your API consumers (users) lots of time to implement new changes, and deprecate features/routes/versions in the meantime. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôll often see v2 or v3, or whatever, in the route of an API.</p>
<p>They‚Äôll have released a new version, but will keep the old one around for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and some APIs have different requirements.</p>
<p>Like boats.  They use largely the same API, but they can't have a floor petal because of water and because many drivers need to stand while driving, so they have a hand-operated throttle.  They also can't have brakes (duh water), so the hand throttle forms a nice (but lesser used) variation to the API for a specific purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Boats also travel much further without needing to change the throttle, because you're usually not 3 seconds behind another boat in a lane. So there's no need to have constant foot pressure to control speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The benefit of providing an API is that it is independent of the underlying code. So the underlying code can be changed/optimized without impacting any of the code calling the API.</p>
<p>Continuing the car analogy, suppose you had an old car engine with a carburator and you upgraded to an engine with fuel injection. But the way that you interact with the car (press gas pedal to accelerate) doesn't change even though what is happening upon pressing the gas pedal is changing.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I know very little about cars so I apologize if I totally got this wrong üòÅ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fuel injection example is a great one!  When fuel injection was just starting to become mainstream, many people don‚Äôt even know whether their car was carbureted or fuel injected</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Thank you for the compliment. I'm tickled pink</p>
<p>2) For non-programmers. The point /u/bendvis makes about users not knowing if they're driving a car with a carburator or fuel injection is referred to abstraction and is a best practice when programming. If you'd like to know more I think this is a pretty approachable write-up for the layman.</p>
