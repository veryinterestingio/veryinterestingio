<p>Edit, fair points regarding the stress of being homeless.  </p>
<p>I grew up around hippie artists that were usually high, drunk or both and crashing on your couch rent free. So my comment is more 'cheech and chong' homeless than it is  I lost my job, house and self respect to a robot or a health care crisis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking tool user, say they are practiced in scraping spooge off of the inside of a newly acquired fur with a sharp edge of a rock. And one day the damn hair gets in the middle of his work for the LAST. FUCKING. TIME.  Sharp edge, a bit of scraping and bam! Hrourag is your uncle.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Hrourag runs in hand over his mostly smooth scalp, a few missed patches of long wispy hair remain and his hand smudges some blood where he cut too deep, but nothing too bad. Proudly he looks up at his mate and says &quot;Hrourag clean!&quot; His mate snaps her gum and responds in a strong Brooklyn accent,  &quot;Oh, honey, don't'chu look just grand. You might want'a throw some mouse in there next time. And those Highlights, Oh My Gawd&quot;.</p>

<p>Funny, but nah. They'd probably rarely go clean shaven. Cuts invite infection. That is a very modern thing. Even in the 1800s short hair on a man would be rare. They'd use shoulder-length more than anything. and then it is clump of hair in one hand, sharp stone in the other and a sawing motion (or more likely having another human do it as part of grooming)</p></div>		</li>

<p>And gets in the way. Shoulder length would have been fine tbh. Any longer and it'd become an inconvenience, but yep at that length you get a sharp rock in one hand and a handful of hair in the other and cut it</p></div>		</li>
