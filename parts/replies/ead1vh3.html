			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on what you consider to be “occupied.”</p>
<p>The total mass of the universe is thought to be about 1E53 kg. The total volume of the Milky Way is about 6.65E60 m^3</p>
<p>The density of the earth is about 5.51 kg/m^3, so if all the mass was used to create a really large earth, it would take up about 1.81E52 m^3 which is about 0.00000027% of the Milky Way. </p>
<p>The least dense solid is a graphemes aerogel with a density of 0.16 kg/m^3, so if all the mass was used to create that aerogel, it would take up 6.25E53 m^3, or about 0.0000094% of the Milky Way. </p>
<p>The least dense celestial object that I know of is YV Canis Majoris, a star with a density of 0.00001 kg/m^3. In that case, the object would take up about 1E58 m^3 which is about 0.15% of the Milky Way. </p>
<p>This ignores that all that mass will just become a black hole, of course. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh? I'm proper confused by how a star can have such a low density. Wikipedia doesn't seem to address this much (it also states such a low density, but does not provide any information that would help my confusion).</p>
<p>How can an object so massive with such an intense gravity be so... fluffy? Does it have a more usual (for a star) dense core and a light cloud around it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This can't be right. Are you sure it's not 5.51E3 kg /m³ ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting, and we can do some back-of-the-envelope calculations.</p>
<p>The total amount of mass in the Milky Way is about 960 Billion Solar Masses - <a href="https://www.space.com/41105-milky-way-galaxy-mass-pinned-down.html" target="_blank">reference here</a></p>
<p>The volume of the sun is 1.4E27 m^3 - <a href="https://www.space.com/17001-how-big-is-the-sun-size-of-the-sun.html" target="_blank">reference here</a></p>
<p>Assuming that when we pushed all of the bodies together the density is the same as the sun*:</p>
<p>We then have a total volume of 1.344E39 m^3. </p>
<p>How does that compare to the volume of the Milky Way?</p>
<p>If we suppose the Milky Way has a diameter of 100,000 light years, and a thickness of 1000 light years, it would have a total volume of 7.85E12 cubic light years. Now, one light year is 9.4E15 meters long, so that would be about 6.65E60 m^3. </p>
<p>So, we see that even when we push everything together, we have a volume that is <em>21 orders of magnitude</em> smaller than the size of the universe. What does that look like?</p>
<p>If this compacted universe was the size of a single proton, then the actual galaxy would be the size of Rhode Island. If the compacted universe was the size of a single blood cell, the actual galaxy would be the size of a nebula. </p>
<p>*This wouldn't actually work - if you pushed all of that mass together, you would quickly make a super dense black hole, which would have a much smaller volume!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If youre definining the volume of a black hole as the space contained within the event horizon, then a black hole that massive would be MUCH less dense than the sun. Since the schwarzchild radius scales linearly with mass, but the volume scales with r^3 the more massive a black hole gets the less dense it is.</p>
<p>(Again, this is assuming we're talking about the event horizon. From the physics we know, all the mass in any black hole would collapse into an infinitely dense singularity)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hey, some back of the napkin math I could probably do.</p>
<p>So the galaxy is <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-can-the-earth-fit-in-our-galaxy" target="_blank">huge</a> at a rough estimation of 6.65x10^60 cubic meters.</p>
<p>It's probably a bit too much of a simplification to do this, but I'm going to do it anyway. the sun weighs about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_mass" target="_blank">2x10^30 kg</a> and its average density is <a href="https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/MayKo.shtml" target="_blank">1.41 g/cm^3</a>. Finally, our galaxy has about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter_halo#Milky_Way_dark_matter_halo" target="_blank">9x10^10 solar masses</a></p>
<p>I'm gonna go say hi to my friend wolfram alpha to crunch some numbers. Basically I'm about to multiply the mass of the sun by the galactic amount of solar mass to get a real &quot;how much star (since that's what most of the material in our galaxy is) is this in terms of mass?&quot;. Then I use the average density (again, that's a bad idea because it wouldn't surprise me if many stars are denser than our sun, but whatever, I'm just a nursing student) to figure out how much volume they would take up. Then we divide the rough volume of the galaxy by that number to come up with a percentage. lets go!</p>
<p>Oh, and because the metric system is very nice taking the sun density from g/cm^3 to kg/m^3 just moves the decimal point over 3 places. So the sun is 1410 kg/m^3</p>
<p>So before we take it over to the galaxy percentage, here's where I'm at.</p>
<p>((2x10^30 kg)(9x10^10 solar masses))/1410 kg/m^3 which gives us about 1.28x10^38 m^3</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I did all my units right. Wolfram is telling me that's about 96 quintillion (9.61x10^19) times the volume of all of the major bodies of water. Which is kind of absurd to even think about that.</p>
<p>so 1.28x10^38 m^3 / 6.65x10^60 m^3 x 100 should give us a decent percentage of how much volume would all the stars in the galaxy eat up if pushed together.</p>
<p>It equals 1.925x10^-21 % So all of the stars in our galaxy if pushed together into one great big star that didn't collapse on itself because science reasons would be 0.000000000000000000001925 % of all the space in our galaxy.</p>
<p>THAT'S how empty our galaxy is. Well, maybe, I'm just an internet person grabbing things from different places.</p>
<p>EDIT: you said universe, whoops.</p></div>		</li>
