			<div class="markdown"><p>So are we anywhere close to being able to make anything in the theorized 'isle of stability', or is that less likely than theorized?</p>
<p>Would 'stable' at that level still be relative and instead of a half-life measured in picoseconds, might last a few seconds or something? Such that  it would not really be possible to learn their real-world properties/applications?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably still very short for most intents and purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Island of stability would certainly not be actually stable, just more stable than the other super heavy isotopes.</p>
<p>Anything that was actually stable would be around us in the universe, certain to have formed in some quantities during neutron star collisions (which is where most heavier elements were actually formed, as opposed to during supernovas like was thought only a handful of years ago)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the isotope is so short-lived, how do they know that they were successful in creating the isotope?  Does the decay of the isotope produce particular gamma rays or other decay products?  And if so, how would they predict the energies or relative amounts of these decay products from a particular isotope?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the decay products. What an unstable nucleus decays into is like it's fingerprint</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, particularly the alpha decay spectrum. They will decay along a pretty predictable chain of alpha decays. Alpha decay produces discrete alpha lines, which are known for the nuclides down the decay chain.</p></div>		</li>
