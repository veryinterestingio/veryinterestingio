			<div class="markdown"><p>Brain is insanely good at multitasking. It handles all involuntary functions like lungs, heart, while receiving input from millions and millions of receptors to figure out what is going on with your body. Id call that insanely good at multitasking. </p>
<p>I wonder why it struggles when doing multiple things requiring focus from me vs multiple things going on in the background</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its when you do stuff but you arent thinking about if the stuff you do is what you want to do which is easier but it could be you do the wrong stuff, like when you need to go to your room to get something, then walk to your room just because you think its useful for your action. So you forget why you want to go to your room because you don’t want to care about what to do after entering the room, just hoping you’ll know it when you enter the room.
