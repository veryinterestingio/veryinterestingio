<p>While you are asleep you are not totally catatonic, only your higher functions turn off. The lower functions such as don't fall off something still work.</p>
<p>I once had intense sunburn and went to bed with my girlfriend. Apparently during the night she wanted to cuddle so she shuffled close and I had sunburn so I shuffled away. This cat and mouse game continued unconsciously until right before I fell off the bed when my brain decided it could no longer move automatically and had to wake me up to make a decision. Effectively -&gt; fall bad what do?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a few times I slept so deeply that it literally felt like time travel. I got super mad at my mom for waking me up 5 minutes after I went to bed. Took a few minutes and seeing the sun outside for me to accept that I had actually slept for 8+ hrs.</p>
<p>Damn I miss those days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be completly wrong but ive read during my bio classes in 2012 that the reason for that is mostly stress. Kids don't usually have the daily stress of adults so they sleep better than us. We, on the other hand, often have the mind racing to find solutions to our problems even as we're trying to fall asleep. </p></div>		</li>
