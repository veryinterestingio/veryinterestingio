			<div class="markdown"><p>not the commenter, but yes it a bad habit. In order to become a consistent, fast, and absorbing reader. You must learn how to quiet the voice in your head and simply look at the words and absorb the idea. Once you learn how to do this, reading will become easier, and the ideas/story of the book will become much clearer and you will be able to absorb more from the book. This reading tactic is hard to get used because most people were never taught this at a young age in school so we all read in our head, so breaking the mind vocal habit is hard, but very very worth it.</p></div>		</li>
