			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting titbit: For radiative heat transfer you need to use absolute temperature for T‚Å¥,  so it‚Äôs 373K‚Å¥ vs. 173K‚Å¥.</p>
<p>In normal air (which contains water) at 0¬∞C the -100¬∞C object would quickly form ice on the surface which would insulate it and make it warm up slower.</p>
<p>I wonder if convection would work differently for both objects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>assuming the air has humidity, any ice formed on the surface would serve to warm the object though.  not sure that it would change anything about the equation... perhaps as the ice then melts, it would shed off of the object, which would have the affect of increasing its surface area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'll really come down to the environment. Using forced fluid to bring the objects to ambient temperature should be about the same. Using natural convection, it will depend on the geometry of the environment. A hot object will heat the fluid, causing it to rise, and be replaced by cooler surrounding fluid. A cold object will do the opposite. Shouldn't make a huge difference in a theoretical infinite open space (though the cold object will raise the viscosity of the fluid, slowing down the movement to some degree). But if you have the cold object on the floor, natural convection won't work as well. Same with the hot object on the ceiling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general though, heat capacity increases with temperature (though the effect is usually small). So assuming we dont have any phase transitions (lets say both things are solid). At ¬±100C radiative heat transfer is relatively small compared to conductive/convective heat transfer. If we simplify further by assuming no convection (say they are both buried in a big sandbox) the cold object would most likely heat up marginally faster. </p>
<p>If we allow for convection we get a whole host of new problems and i agree that we cant give a definite answer.</p>
<p>Tldr; I agree that we can't give a definitive answer, but I would put my money on the cold object due to heat capacity increasing with temperature.</p>
<p>Edit: All of the above assumes that the surroundings are at 0C, so that the temperature difference is the same, otherwise the object closest to the surrounding temperatures will equilibrate fastest :)</p></div>		</li>
