			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, we think of uranium as being associated with the western part of the country, especially the 4-Corners States, or with being near nuclear power plants.  But high levels of radon in poorly ventilated basements occurs in some homes throughout the country.  This is a fairly well documented risk, and is thought to be the main cause of lung cancer in non-smokers.  However there are easy ways to measure the levels of radon in your basement and straightforward ways to solve the problem if present through ventilation to the outside.</p></div>		</li>
