			<div class="markdown"><p>What about sphincters that are usually (hopefully) shut most of the time? Is there a signal being sent to it constantly telling it to contract?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some sphincters such as the lower esophageal sphincter and the involuntary internal anal sphincter are in tonic contraction, which then require signals from the brain to relax. The external anal sphincter is a voluntary muscle which requires nervous simulation to contract and relax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The defualt state is contraction...signals tell it when to <em>not</em> contract. Think of it like an elastic: in its normal state, it's not stretched...requires input to make it stretch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the sphincter system.  If it is a sphincter like the one in between your stomach and intestine, then it is involuntary smooth muscle.</p>
<p>But if you look at sphincter systems in the urinary and excretory systems, they each actually have two individual sphincters, an inner involuntary one and an outer voluntary one.</p>
<p>For example, when your bladder fills with lemonade stretch receptors on the inside of the bladder signal to the brain for the inner urethral sphincter to contract (open) involuntarily (because it is smooth muscle).  You then have to voluntarily open the other urethral sphincter (because it is skeletal muscle) to actually make number 1, or else you would pee your pants a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did not realize there were two in the urinary tract. So for nervous peeers, which sphincter is clamping shut? The voluntary or involuntary one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Motor units can't stay contracted for very long.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm not convinced. </p>
<p>Physiotherapists and massage practitioners see people present with muscles that have been continuously contracted for days, weeks, or even months. For all practical purposes the muscle fibres are permanently 'on'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're now adding an element of pathology to the question.  In healthy individuals, individual motor units can only stay contracted transiently.  However, in people who get these 'knots' in their muscles are unable to relax the muscles that are already contracted (I saw another comment here say that ATP is actually required to release the myosin head from its actin binding site).  Now this, on the cellular level, triggers the production of lactic acid, a byproduct of cellular fermentation, which can cause pain and soreness in muscles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert but hasn't this kind of contracted state more to do with the connective tissue not being elastic enough and therefore encasing the muscle?
Again not an expert, just asking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with these is that they become more and more acidic which cannot be degraded. In molecular biology there is actually a chance that your myosin motor, which provides the force necessary for contraction is either on or off the surrounding actin filament on which the forces are exerted. This happens regardless of whether the muscle is contracted. On a larger scale, such as the whole muscle of course in total you could keep a net force for a much longer time, but as discussed over hours or days this can cause serious problems with acid build up and no regeneration.</p></div>		</li>
