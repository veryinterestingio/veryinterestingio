			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, Gary.  I’ve started with Python recently with hopes to aid him with learning it too.  Who knows, maybe we’ll see you in a few years!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure lego can be great for starting someone off, especially with the motorised pieces. Try giving him some goals to make simple things, I think you can even program some of the motors (but they're probably expensive).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lego Mindstorms. You used to be able to program them via a simple website interface, but I'm not sure if all that still works.</p>
<p>Also Raspberry Pi devices have some kids stuff on their website. In fact I would start here.</p></div>		</li>
