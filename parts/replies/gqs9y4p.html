<p>Nope.</p>
<p>If Arnold eats Dianabol for breakfast (affectionately named the bodybuilder cereal because they are fun little yellow pills) he can train for 6 hours no problem with immediate muscle recovery..</p>
<p>You apply that same workout to someone who isn't juicing, they will get tired, risk injury and recovery would be so minimal the effort wouldn't be worth it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Im not saying a non drugged athlete can take the same volume. I’m saying the same type of training that was developed for drugged athletes can be applied to other athletes as well. Some of our best training breakthroughs  have been tested on drugged athletes because that’s where we began pushing the envelopes of human performance.</p></div>		</li>
