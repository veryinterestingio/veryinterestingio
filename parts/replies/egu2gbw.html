			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it was. The Nile used to flood every year, for enough time that the farmers were out of work for a few months. It not only replenished the soil, but it also created an idle workforce to build ancient Egyptian mega-projects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the problem is water management.  Monsoon would flood the river and recede, leaving silt upon the floodplain, but then rest of the year might be very arid resulting in a water shortage.  Naturally fertilized soil doesn't help much if you cant water crops enough to sustain them.  A dam is about tradeoffs.  Damming the river stops the silt, and the natural watering from flooding, but it also stops and stores water behind the dam allowing for controlled irrigation and general flood control.  Another trade off is by protecting the floodplain it allows development of settlements upon it by trading for flooded land on the reservoir side of the dam.  As much as humans love to settle on rivers and their floodplains any time you dam one it is certain to displace people and flood historical and archaeological sites.  But then you can build a nice big city downstream on the floodplain and also irrigate and power the region around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The old Aswan dam (1902 by the way) didn't stop the flooding, it just moderated it somewhat. The newer one (not an update, a different dam entirely) has a far bigger impact. </p></div>		</li>
