<p>There's lots of evidence to support it. You can find gold and uranium on Earth, so obviously <em>something</em> is producing them.</p>
<p>Nuclear astrophysicists develop models of these reaction networks and see if they can reproduce the observed abundances. But the models require a huge number of inputs, like the masses and half-lives of every single nuclide involved in the network, as well as some information about the astrophysical site where the process is expected to occur (temperature, density, and how they evolve as a function of time, and initial composition, for example).</p>
<p>So given the huge number of inputs that some of these models need, and the uncertainties on those inputs, the results of the calculations are fairly uncertain. This is especially true of the r-process, just because of the sheer amount of different nuclear species involved.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Not really. The heaviest elements which have naturally-occurring isotopes are uranium and thorium, and we know that those can (and must, if our models are correct) be produced by the r-process.</p>
<p>It's possible that the r-process reaches up much further than those, up to a point where eventually fission becomes insurmountable. But we don't know exactly where that occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder what neutron star mergers gave us our gold and uranium and all that stuff. Pretty crazy to think about. Couple stars of the right size had to blow up, and then the leftover neutron star from each had to still be close enough to eventually collide and kilonova, and then make earth, without black holes messing everything up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spectral signatures of many heavy elements (including gold, platinum, uranium) were discovered in the plumes from the LIGO/VIRGO/every other astronomer neutron star merger collaboration a few years ago.  </p>
<p>So this theory recently got a major piece of directly observed supporting evidence for heavy elements being formed in r-process, that was backed up with observations all across the em spectrum as well as gravitational waves, from many different instruments and institutions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, all but the very first generation of stars contain other heavy nuclides from previous generations of nucleosynthesis. This is called the “metallicity” of the star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun seems to have extremely small amounts of iron (0.5%) at the moment, and that as well as anything heavier than that would have come from outside sources and would be at undetectable levels.</p>
<p>Currently the sun is not hot or dense enough to fuse heavier metals, including iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun is made from the same stuff as the rest of the solar system - it just got nearly all the hydrogen and helium (and indeed, nearly all of any matter) since for most of the time of formation of the protoplanetary disc, it was the one place with enough gravity to hold onto it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any way to know how many stars’ lives preceded ours based on the current elemental makeup? And are there stars, or galaxies, out there that haven’t had time to make it that far, so you’d have planets with no iron?</p>
<p>It kind of blows my mind thinking of the time it took prior to our solar system existing just building the elements we take for granted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can try to estimate it by looking at the abundances of our solar system, and coming up with models for what processes must have happened in the past in order to get them to where we are. I don't know much about that though.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Depending on where in the galaxy the star is, there may have been many previous generations of stellar evolution, or they may be relatively new. You can tell by the metallicity of the stars. High metallicity stars have more &quot;metals&quot; (anything except hydrogen and helium), which means that they must have formed later, after heavier elements had been produced. Low metallicity stars were formed before there had been significant nucleosynthesis. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It didn't take as long as you might think.  While it will take our star several billion years to work through all the hydrogen, massive stars, the ones that go supernova and actually reach the iron stage, only have a life expectancy of a few million years.  That's still a long time, but a tiny bilp in the age of the Universe.</p></div>		</li>
