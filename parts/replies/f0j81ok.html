			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you explain what you mean when you say that the same is not true for kittens and puppies? If get a german shepherd puppy and place it with a a bunch of poodle puppies, they won’t be able to communicate? What does communication even entail at that level?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the sense that UG typically considers language, it's totally different from communication and may even be independent from communication in its development as a way to structure human thought. Animals communicate all the time, of course, but the ways they communicate are very different from human language, which is about syntax and recursion and has no finite range of possible expression, unlike, say, a bee's waggle dance.</p>
<p>So, we could call what bees do &quot;language&quot; in some sense, but it's not the kind of language that linguists are chiefly concerned with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this known? I understand that small children don't learn their first language the <em>same way</em> that adults/teens learn a second language but I'm skeptical of the <em>effortlessness</em> of it.  Do we know that they don't, like, spend almost all day every day for the first several years of their life desperately trying to make sense of the noise coming out of adults mouths?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put an adult in a foreign location and they will be able to communicate pretty well eventually - but unless they spend time <em>deliberately</em> studying grammar, they will usually continue to make serious grammatical mistakes. Children are <em>always</em> able to acquire perfect grammar without ever being directly instructed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about instead of puppies or kittens, you use crows or parrots or something else with the necessary mechanisms for speech?  Is it possible that a parrot can model tongue-mouth-teeth combinations, but not others that are intrinsic to a language?  Maybe a guttural language like German is fine, but they'd never be able to get the tonalities of Mandarin right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The faculties that UG proposes are actually cognitive in nature and not just about externalization. So, even if a dog or a gorilla could speak perfectly fluent German or sign language or whatever, the idea is that the cognitive machinery underneath doesn't exist. It's more about parsing and constructing language than being able to communicate it. Another way to put this is that a person might still be perfectly capable of language, even if they'd been in some horrible car accident and can no longer communicate because they're paralyzed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting, but I'm not convinced that a dolphin or octopus might not be intelligent enough to learn a language and communicate, I mean what about those sign language learning gorillas?  The cognitive load probably limits vocabulary and some advanced linguistic concepts like irony, but I think they could &quot;learn English&quot; in as far as a 3 year old can &quot;learn English&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
