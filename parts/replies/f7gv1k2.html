			<div class="markdown"><p>I build cisterns for water storage and without any light getting in the tank you don’t get algae etc. The same principle works today as did back when. I have studied traditional water systems throughout the Middle East / India and they usually have a series of sediment traps to keep water clean then a dark tank, often below grade to buffer temps. Many of these systems are still operable with minimal maintenance over hundreds of years.  </p>
<p>Also shoutout to Brad! He’s one of my mentors and I had the opportunity to spend some time with him last week!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s awesome, Brad’s books on rainwater harvesting are really useful, I’m eventually going to be making my own rainwater tank inspired by his stuff.
Thanks for sharing!</p></div>		</li>

<p>a properly designed cistern actually keeps water very clean, and knowledge of the proper ways to do it goes back thousands of years</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sounds fascinating, do you have any further reading on this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a bunch of papers about ancient cisterns, but they’re mostly about the archaeology, not the water quality science. I know for a fact someone has studied the water quality of old Byzantine cisterns because I read that once, but can’t find it now. </p>
<p>For a basic overview, check out Coombes et al 2006, “Key Messages from a Decade of Water Quality Research into Roof Collected Rainwater Supplies,” I know there are better recent studies on this but I’ve lost track of them. </p>
<p>If you’re interested in the archaeological stuff, let me know and I’ll link to some papers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Found one more!
“Role of biofilms in improving microbial quality in rainwater tanks,” Mikyeong Kim and Mooyoung Han, 2013
Both papers should be available on researchgate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an amazing book on traditional systems in Rajasthani India in the thar desert. I find this place and their traditional systems fascinating as it is a  populated desert surviving on one rain event a year. </p>
