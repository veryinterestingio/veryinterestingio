			<div class="markdown"><p>First question first.   The experimental setup used in EHT is called Very Long Baseline Interferometry or VLBI.  This has been used in various forms since the 1960s, but at much longer wavelength (and therefore higher frequency).   Since the resolution of a VLBI experiment is proportional to the wavelength (shorter wavelength = finer angular resolution), EHT only became possible once it was possible to do VLBI at very short, millimeter wavelengths- frequencies that are almost a factor of 100 higher than the frequency that warms your burrito in the microwave.   There were many obstacles to doing this, including both organizational and technical obstacles, and the innovation in EHT consisted in overcoming *all* these obstacles and making the image.<br />
Second question.   Short answer is yes.   The resolution of a VLBI experiment is inversely proportional to the size of the array.  Bigger arrays can have finer angular resolution.   We'd love to have a station on the Moon! (Charles)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the first response, can you talk about the &quot;organizational&quot; obstacles? Was this coordinating with other agencies and countries? What this the sheer logistics (mechanical, software, etc.)? Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
