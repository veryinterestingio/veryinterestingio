			<div class="markdown"><p>Drove cabs without air con and always used a beaded seat cover as they provided genuine air flow and, just as importantly, the varnished beads did not absorb and re-emit odours. Contrary to what you might think they are not at all uncomfortable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stopped using those after the varnish ruined two of my t-shirts by putting tiny yellowish spots all over my back. Granted, it's probably a case of low quality varnish, but there wasn't much choice then. So fabric seats ftw!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so I've got pleather seats in my car, and I love how easy they are to clean, and my kid spills things regularly, so they arent going anywhere. Unfortunately, I live in the low desert, and the solar gain from the sunroof is <strong><em>INTENSE.</em></strong> I have burnt myself on the seats more than once during the summer. This is my dream car, and I am never getting rid of it. I'd like to make it as comfortable as possible. I also have chronic pain problems stemming from several autoimmune disorders and an old spinal/pelvic injury. I have considered getting a beaded seat cover for years, but they scare me. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You say they are 'not at all uncomfortable,' so I'd like your opinion. How comfy are they - exactly?? Did you find they dug in anywhere? Are smaller beads better than large ones? What about long trips? Do they cause increased wear and tear on the seats? How hot do the beads get? Do they still allow you to get a benefit out of heated seats in cold weather? And lastly, any particular manufacturer you could recommend? Thank you in advance for indulging me...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My last car had black leather seats which, let me tell you, was like sitting on a bed of burning coals in the summer. But that thing stayed clean. My newer truck has a cloth interior and it is filthy already. Leather is supreme.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is not so much the different types of sweat the glands emit as it is the restriction of airflow that keeps those areas moist, which allows faster bacteria growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I think you're mostly wrong as you're the only one claiming this.</p>
<p>&quot;Mostly&quot; because I'm sure the speed at which sweat dries off the skin has <em>something</em> to do with it, but the different kinds of sweat and the bacteria seem the more likely main source.</p></div>		</li>
