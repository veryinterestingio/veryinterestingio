			<div class="markdown"><p>It is rare in science to make a clear prediction and have it so amazingly well confirmed by experiment.  So, the EHT image itself was not so surprising in that it was in keeping with Einstein’s theory.  But for many of us it was the uncertainty of whether the instrument would work (it was incredibly complicated) and whether we would be able to see all the way to the event horizon where the predicted ring of emission would be observed (all the infalling hot gas can obscure our view of the event horizon in some cases).  So the surprising thing was that everything worked out: all the things we had control over and also those we didn’t.  In the end, the infalling gas was transparent enough that we could make the image and the instrument worked exceptionally well, AND we had great weather.  Of course if the ring had looked different from what we expected, we’d be asking whether Einstein was wrong! -Shep Doeleman</p></div>		</li>
