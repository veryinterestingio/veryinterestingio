<p>yes, it's technically possible... however no, you'll VERY quickly run into the realm of memory limitations keeping all the chunks loaded to maintain cohesion of the redstone signals. </p>
<p>however, flipping back to yes: you can cheat and use command blocks to emulate some instructions but that gets very messy very quickly. look at the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/deep-thought" target="_blank">Deep Thought clone in MC</a>. It's an impressive machine that's very compact. and was a f-ing nightmare to design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can build a computer that will emulate any other computer if given infinite time and space, which is something a bit different.  If it requires enough memory to cover a continent to build a Minecraft i9 CPU and it takes 5 years per operation to run it, your Minecraft computer isn't very useful and you'd want to avoid running Minecraft on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like a lot of things in computing the answer is theoretically yes but practically no. Minecraft already has everything you need to do anything real circuit designers do.</p>
<p>That being said, figuring branch prediction and multithreading on redstone sounds pretty impossible to say the least.</p></div>		</li>
