			<div class="markdown"><p>The one region of language where kids have an unquestionable advantage is phonology (what a component of language sounds like). If you want to sound like a native most people have to be natives (learnt the language ideally before age 6, but preferably before puberty), since the way you hear language becomes more and more set as you grow older (you tend to rationalize sounds you hear into an existing language framework).</p>
<p>Some people have the ability to do this as adults anyway, but it will require more effort and time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, that is why it has been recommended to enroll children into different language classes as early as 4. They might not understand the language, the rules of it and the meaning, but they'll be learning phonology. In my example learning english I always struggled with th and r sounds as they are quite difficult to pronounce being a non-native english speaker. Cavalry, world, three, tree, just couldn't do it.</p>
<p>I work with children and some of them watch a lot of YouTube and english Channels. They don't have a problem pronouncing those same sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I’m pretty good at accurately mimicking sounds in other languages, but I’m also very aware of the mechanics of how sounds are formed and practice different variations.</p>
<p>I know I would be less able to do it without that knowledge, because I had to go back and retrain my pronunciation of certain sounds in, for example, German once I’d learned a bit more about general phonology and realized what I needed to do to form them properly.</p>
<p>Children get the same or better results with less knowledge of the mechanics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No adult ever taught a child to say 'I goed', they just 'correct' it to 'went'.</p>
<p>Think about what this child just did. They <em>subconsciously</em> took the root of the verb 'to go', <em>go</em>, and added the <em>-ed</em> suffix to make the past tense of English. That is how children <em>generate</em> language. No one taught this rule to a two year old and no child ever heard <em>goed</em> from an adult. They come up with the past tense <em>on their own</em>. Almost all of them make this 'mistake'. It's amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a really interesting theory on how these mistakes happen with kids. Up until a specific age (can't remember which!) children will get the irregular past participles right e.g. I went, and it's assumed that it's because they're learning by copying.</p>
<p>Later they'll learn the 'rule' that past tense in English is formed by adding -ed and start to form regular past participles correctly e.g. I played. What's super interesting is at this point they'll overgeneralise this rule and apply it to irregular past participles they'd been producing correctly before. So a kid could have been saying &quot;I went&quot; correctly but will then learn the -ed rule and start saying &quot;I goed&quot; - it then takes a bit longer for them to figure out the difference and produce both the irregular and regular participles correctly. Just a bit mind-blowing that if a kid starts making mistakes they've not made before it's actually a good thing for their overall language development!</p>
<p>There were lots of different theories about how/why this happened and i don't know if one is now accepted as being true.</p>
<p>I remember one theory was to do with regular and irregulars being processed differently in the brain. Regulars being generated like you said according to a rule and irregulars being stored and retrieved. For an irregular to be retrieved it has to be strong enough to override the generate rule. (Or the child has to have not learnt the generate rule yet.)</p></div>		</li>
