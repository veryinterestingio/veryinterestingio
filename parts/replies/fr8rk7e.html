			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some wild fisheries populations that are still sustainable. Calculators and materials from several conservation groups can help you make your choices.  Inevitably, as humans, we will need to turn to fish and other aquaculture products to satisfy our desire for seafood (and frankly, to feed the world in future).  There are so many actions an individual can take: eating lower on the food chain; being really careful about waste disposal; reducing use of resources including freshwater and energy; seeking out responsibly manufactured goods; and talking to your family, friends, and neighbors about their choices (politely of course!) etc. Thank you for wanting to do your part!  You might contact your local conservation groups in your area for specific ideas and to get involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry!  By lower on the food chain I mean: more plant-based foods and less contribution to your diet of higher level herbivores, like beef etc. on land. The marine equivalent would be fewer salmon and more sardines.  There are other reasons you might make these choices however, like taste. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, and I'm curious too.</p>
<p>I'm a vegetarian mostly because raising meat is bad for the environment. So maybe eating plants instead of animals since plants are lower on the food chain?</p>
<p>Not sure what it means in a marine sense. Maybe oysters are more sustainable than tuna because they are lower on the food chain? I'm guessing the seaweed snacks my daughter loves are ok, well except for the unnecessary amount of plastic packaging.</p>
<p>Edit: it may be asking too much and outside the scope of this, but if OP had a link to a list of types or brands of seafood that one could consume without damaging the oceans I sure would appreciate it. I know the big environmental problems are solved at the political/societal level and that individual action alone won't change much, but many of us would at the very least prefer not to contribute to the problem.</p></div>		</li>
