			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Helmholtz is just one of many options.</p>
<p>@OP, this is (roughly) the right answer though. The bottle and/or the fluid column is acting as a mechanical oscillator. </p>
<p>There are many different flavors of oscillating phenomena and it's impossible to pin down exactly what mode it's in without detailed information about the fluid density and viscosity, the geometry of the bottle mouth, and the exit velocity. Those variables are used together to calculate something called Reynold's number (mentioned in the post I'm replying to), a dimensionless value that describes the balance between inertial forces and viscous forces within the fluid. </p>
<p>Different Reynold's numbers can yield radically different behaviors (just type 'laminar flow' into the Reddit search bar to see some wild gifs demonstrating that point). Just know that oscillation can happen in many different ways, and your bottle is definitely oscillating. But we can't tell you <em>exactly</em> what's happening using the limited information we have.</p>
