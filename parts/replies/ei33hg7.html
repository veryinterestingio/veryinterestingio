			<div class="markdown"><p>I generally brush the filings off of whatever they're on since things have to look nice once installed. The longest I've seen them stick is a couple days, before I tap the pipe with my kleins and it all falls off. </p>
<p>Its definitely not a stong magnetism, and doesn't last long, but it's extremely noticeable for a short time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. You're right that it takes a long time for a strong magnet to demagnetize - but the magnetism in this scenario is only very weak: neither of the materials is magnetic to start with, and the metals rubbing together only creates a fairly weak magnet.</p>
<p>It's strong enough to temporarily hold a few filings - but it's barely stronger than if you sit and rub paper clips together.</p></div>		</li>
