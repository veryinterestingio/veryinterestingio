			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now is an exciting time for comet observers! People monitoring Y4/Atlas with their telescopes have witnessed its spectacular disintegration before it was able to reach detectability with the naked eye. Immediately, C/2020 F8 (SWAN) came in to take its place, brightening out of nowhere to reach 8th magnitude in the last week. It’s predicted to reach as bright as 3rd magnitude at perihelion on May 13th, so that will be one to look out for, if it performs as hoped. C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) is another new discovery, currently hurtling into the inner solar system, and again, has a chance of reaching 3rd magnitude in early July - potentially visible to the naked eye from a reasonably dark location. Scientists measure brightness in terms of “magnitude” in which lower numbers are brighter; 6th magnitude is visible to the naked eye on a dark night, away from city lights. -- MAC</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for the mixup there - May 13 is closest approach to Earth. Perihelion of F8/SWAN is in fact on May 26 (UT) — MAC</p></div>		</li>
