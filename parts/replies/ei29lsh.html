<p>Edit2: About the scattered part i am not sure, how the Ozone layer comes to effect, as it filters UV rays it also may filter blue slightly. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ozone would tend to make the light slightly more blue, as its absorbtion falls off dramatically in the near UV to blue wavelengths, then starts to climb again in the green and yellow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t this true for everything you might take a picture of on the surface of the earth without the mirror though? </p>
<p>In order to see something (even with a camera), what you’re detecting is light bouncing off the object. The sun is the source of light so it must make it through the atmosphere to reach the object. Then in order to see that object, since the picture is being taken from outside the atmosphere, light reflected off the object must make it back through the atmosphere to the camera.</p>
<p>I don’t think the mirror changes the equation here much. Say you’re taking a picture of someone’s face in the mirror. Light from the sun goes through the atmosphere once, hits the persons face and reflects to the mirror. The mirror reflects the light, which travels through the atmosphere a second time to the camera. </p>
<p>I can’t think of a practical situation where the light must travel through the atmosphere more than twice without adding more mirrors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is about the total distance, that is passed in the atmosphere. At least if you use a perfect mirror it does not matter how much the light reflects context.</p>
<p>If you take a photo of someones face, the distance is &quot;basically zero&quot;, so no scattering occures there. Like i said. Scattering is unlikely. Almost every blue photon you see from the sky scattered only once on its entire way through the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but, assuming the satelite is taking a picture from directly above, the extra trip through the atmosphere isn't going to be that great either.</p>
<p>Using a radius of 6,731 km for the Earth and a thicknes of 450 km for the atmosphere; light would be traveling through 2,436 km of atmospher at sunset/rise. Our mirror only gets us to a 900 km trip which isn't even half that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seem spo on, All a camera does is take a picture of a reflection, with the exception being the light source itself directly, which you can not do taking a picture in a mirror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you are directly above the mirror, I think the reddening effect would be dramatically less than at sunrise/sunset. There's only about ten miles of (thick) atmosphere, so a 20 mile round trip. Versus however much atmosphere sunlight travels through at sunrise/sunset. Maybe someone can do the math on it, but I feel like it must be at least an order of magnitude more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, if the mirror and sun are directly above, then the reflected sunlight will appear the same as when the sun is 30 degrees up here on earth. Not even close to red!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re exactly right. OP’s comment is garbage and a perfect example of how askscience is nothing more than a bunch of iamverysmarts that don’t understand basic concepts masquerading as if they are some sort of expert. Yet he’s a top comment, been gifted silver, and keeps responding to comments as though he were an authority on this subject. Time to drop askscience as a default. </p></div>		</li>
