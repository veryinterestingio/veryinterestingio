			<div class="markdown"><p>Although this is a good metaphor for electrical current, it doesn't answer op question. </p>
<p>In this metaphor it would take more force (voltage) to push the balls up than it would down or sideways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also worth adding the &quot;strength&quot; of electricity is WAY MORE than the &quot;strength&quot; of gravity, so to OP's question, pushing the balls up is about the same amount of effort as pushing the balls down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what actually addresses the OPs question. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The reason they seem to move the same speed (whether that's drift velocity or the perceived speed of a light turning on with a switch) it's because the gravitational force on the electron is very minor (it has low mass) compared to the electromotive force on it.</p></div>		</li>
