			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.   While momentum and gyroscopic forces play a role, it is minor compared to the rapid adjustments of the front point of contact using tiny adjustments to the handlebars.   And without the bike's movements, those adjustments don't actually move the contact point under the center of balance, so you end up balancing using only your body position instead of body position plus bike position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I mean you could even test this, put two more wheels not touching the floor on a bike, being them up to speed and try to balance without moving the bike along the floor.</p></div>		</li>
