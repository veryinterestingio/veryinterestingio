			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick googling gave me <a href="https://speedendurance.com/2009/08/21/usain-bolt-200-meter-splits-speed-reserve-and-speed-endurance/" target="_blank">this</a>. First 100m 9.92 seconds, from 100 to 200 meters 9.27 seconds, but the time from 50 to 150 meters was only 8.82 seconds. Not as fast as Asafa, it seems. </p>
<p>It would be interesting to see splits from like 30 to 130 meters or 40 to 140 meters though, would they be quicker?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was part of this WR due to him running a bit under 100m so that Bolt could have the baton longer? As in, Powell handed it off at the beginning of the exchange zone rather than exactly at 100m. </p>
<p>I know Powell is a stud in his own right, but not quite the same level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing the reason you'd do this is too see who has the highest top speed rather than top speed + acceleration?</p>
<p>If so, I think the easiest way would just to make everyone run 200m (maybe 400m) but record your time after every 10m. Whoever posts the shortest time for a 10m segment wins. If you're quick to accelerate then your shortest time will happen in an earlier 10m chunk, if you're slower to accelerate it'll happen later, but for the competition that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>It'd be a terrible spectator sport though as you wouldn't be able to tell who won by eye</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s what the 100m already does. </p>
<p>There’s really no human in history who’s able to be 100% accelerating over 100m. Everyone hits top speed in the 50-80m and starts fading by the end. </p>
<p>I don’t think you’ll ever see a 100m winner who wasn’t the fastest in a given race</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard because runners set their own standards.  The point at which your start running is set and practiced. The baton receiver knows where the teammate should be for him/her to start. They build a feeling for the safe speed at which to pass the baton. It's all person to person and changes even between legs on the same team. </p>
<p>So outside of the already in place starting position and end point for baton passing, not much you can standardize for the 2 secs each baton pass actually happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could do this if people didn't race all together. Any one person could be timed individually, which is basically all a 100m dash is anyway - there's no real interaction between runners. With a marathon, there's a lot more planning and strategy towards the end. </p>
<p>So basically, just let people take the running start they want, mark out the 100m, and determine which body part crossing lines defines the start and end of the race.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this, 200m runners at the top level always negative split their second 100m. Since they don’t have to accelerate during the second half, the second 100m is always faster than the first 100m.</p></div>		</li>
