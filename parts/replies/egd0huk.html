<p>However, if the radio station isn't great reception, you are also increasing the volume of the crackle sound (image noise). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the old days, when cameras used film, ISO (or ASA,  as it used to be called) was an indication of how sensitive a particular roll of film was. If you wanted to shoot in a somewhat low light situation, you might use 400 ISO film, but expect graininess. For average light, average quality, maybe 200 ISO; then 100 ISO would be better quality than that, but you may want to use flash, definitely, if indoors. You could get 64 ISO &amp; 25 ISO (Kodachrome) as well if you needed it. Later they came out with 800 ISO, and so on. This does not describe everything that was out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s best to think of the separately and later join then.</p>
<p>ISO: how sensitive is the sensor told to be. Higher the number the more sensitive it is. There’s more noise because is picks up on other stuff like interference from the camera itself.</p>
<p>Aperture: how much light is let through. Think your eye F18 is like you are squinting. F1.8 your eye balls as so freaking wide they might pop out of your head</p>
<p>Shutter speed: how long you keep your eyes open before blinking. </p>
<p>Now join them together. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Technically this doesn't affect the sensitivity of the sensor. That can't change. It affects the gain of the analog-to-digital conversion that takes place when the picture is recorded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can see this with your hands! Make a pin hole with one hand, hold it up to your eye (like a teeny tiny telescope) and then stretch your other arm and hold up a finger. Notice the finger and background will both be in focus. Remove your pinhole hand and then you can manually focus on either the finger or background.</p>
<p>I learned this from shooting rifles.</p>
<p>It relies on diffraction. You may have learned it in physics and forgot. When light passes through a tiny point instead of going straight through it acts as a point source. Because of that it's like the stuff through the hole are on the hole so you can focus on all of it at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think (though I could be wrong) that that's the correct explanation, but I do love me some physics.</p>
<p>Basically, the idea behind a lens is that light from a single point will hit it and then be focused down into a single point behind the lens (and directly opposite the original point).</p>
<p>The issue with this is that the distance <em>behind</em> the lens that the light gets focused depends on the distance of the object in front of the lens. This means that, at the retina, the light from anywhere other than the distance being perfectly focused will instead be in a little circle around the point it should be, blurring it as the many light rays don't perfectly recombine.</p>
<p>The reason pinholes fix this is that because of the tiny hole, basically only a single ray of light gets through. Now, there can't be blurring, since each object only has a single light ray, so each ray hits a single spot on the retina and everything is in focus (though a bit dim).</p>
<p>Now the diffraction explanation <em>would</em> make sense (had to think about it for a while). But the reason I don't think it's what's going on here is that it requires almost perfect diffraction. For that to happen, the hole needs to be basically equal to the wavelength of light. At about 500nm, that's far too small to make with your hands, and you can see it does work for larger holes.</p>
<p>Hope at least someone else finds this interesting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aperture is one factor that determines depth of field.</p>
<p>The focal length of the lens and the distance to your subject have a larger effect.</p>
<p>For example, a 600mm lens at f/8 shooting a subject 5m away will have less depth than a 70mm lens at f/2.8 with a subject at 5m.</p>
<p>You could stop the 600mm lens down to f/32 and <em>still</em> have less depth than the 70mm f/2.8 at 5m. That's how important distance and focal length are to this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, I feel like I <em>almost</em> understand what you said. I am having a hard time understating the quantity of depth the 600mm lens would have at both f/ settings (stops?) Vs. the 70mm. Is there an algorithm or picture you’re aware of that helps illustrate this? I’m not even sure what decent search engine terms would be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a trick I used to use when I first started videography and only had cheap camcorders. They don't really have fast lens nor large sensors so you can't easily get a shallow depth of field so I would set the camcorder far away and zoom in. </p></div>		</li>
