			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. Also good to mention that stimulants do not actually even help with all symptoms of ADHD and some drugs donâ€™t actually help at all and have to try some other brand.  </p>
<p>Like the sensory overload OP mentioned, god how I <em>wish</em> there would be a cure, but unfortunately people with ADHD are on same left-to-suffer boat with OP on that one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, have ADHD.</p>
<p>First day using ritalin I turned into an absolute beast, did a whole list of stuff that was backlogged.</p>
<p>Two weeks after, however, after my body got used to it, the effect is quite a lot weaker, so I do need mental discipline not to go back to bad habits.</p>
<p>That said, it sure is a hell of a help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never used ritalin, but I take Adderall XR for my adhd. I've found I need to take days off for it to be effective. Usually one day a week I won't take it. I won't get anything productive done that day, but being productive for the rest of the week more than makes up for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My body got used to ritalin So fast when I was young that I had reached a point where neither the doctor nor my parents were comfortable with the dose I was taking. On the flip side when they put my wife on it in 1st grade she had suicidal thoughts,  So we both ended up having to figure out how to do without medication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sincerely wish for treatments to help with sensory overload in our lifetime too! My sister is autistic and she's been on every anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication available in the US for most of her life (she's 36), along with drugs to treat epilepsy. Nothing much seemed to help the sensory overload, mood swings, or agitation she experiences pretty much daily. She's a trooper through it all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it would be awesome if I could be on the medication 24/7 or if they could find something that worked 24/7 without keeping me up at night. I would sleep a ton better without all the garbage in my brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a tiny bit to this, the chemicals that ADHD lacks is dopamine. Often times thats why it is very common for ADHD'ers to jump from interest to interest because once we get that initial jolt of dopamine, we get bored and move on to the next dopamine fix. ADHD meds balance out our lack of dopamine so we are better able to focus and concentrate on what we need to rather then going for the dopamine hit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also why ADHD is comorbid with depression, because you don't get the satisfaction of completing a task of finishing something, so you don't want to do anything, especially the things that &quot;need&quot; to get done.  </p>
<p>Doctors are more likely to treat you with SSRIs or something for depression than for ADHD unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd further make the distinction that we don't know how autism works as a physical mechanic, not just that we don't have an understanding of what causes it. Those are two very different things.  </p>
<p>I only point that out, because there is a stark difference between prevention, treatment, and cure... and usually the way that we &quot;discover&quot; any of those three. Sometimes the same thing does more than one of those and we discover the more broadly reaching benefits by accident. More recently, we have been able to target one specifically, and intentionally, in the manner it is developed and applied.  </p>
<p>Frankly speaking, we have comparatively very little understanding of how most of our brains work. We're learning quickly though.</p></div>		</li>
