			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun thing with denim. The fabric is made from a indigo dyed warp (the yarn traveling length wise and up and down) and white weft (the yarn traveling width wise). </p>
<p>Then the whole thing is woven as a odd twill. A fabric where the warp is mostly on one side of the fabric. This means that one side is more blue then the other. This also means that as the jeans are worn the blue warp yarn is damaged exposing the white weft yarn. </p>
<p>Faded jeans are not faded due to bleaching but due to mechanical damage to the fabric itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Denim nerd here: as you said the warp side is generally the exposed side. As the warp is damaged, it's not the weft that is exposed initially, but the undyed core of the warp thread. First, poorly fixed indigo rubs off, then the outer parts of the warp thread is worn away. Indigo (synthetic or natural) is actually not very good at penetrating through the entire thread, nor fixing very strongly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The weft is left white intentionally. That and the uneven twill is what gives the denim fabric it’s look. If the inside of your jeans are a different colour then it’s a twill two tone fabric. </p>
<p>I have a pair of black jeans that are the same shade on both sides so the weft is black like the warp.</p></div>		</li>

<p>, but it seems the tiny insoluble blue particles get trapped in the cotton fibers and not exactly bound to them. </p>

<p>Yes, this is why the color in jeans fades the way that it does.  If you wash your jeans regularly they will fade more rapidly to a lighter blue, but will do so consistently across the entire garment.  If you wear them more between washings - and especially before the first washing - the indigo chips off due to folding and abrasion and creates the patterns we see.  Radial &quot;whiskers&quot; from the folding at the crotch, &quot;honecomb&quot; pattern behind the knees, and &quot;stacks&quot; above the cuff. </p>
<p>This is also why my car seats end up blue from indigo chipping off while breaking in new raw denim.</p></div>		</li>
