			<div class="markdown"><p>It requires a little thought and effort, but you can use  <a href="https://cronometer.com/" target="_blank"><a href="https://cronometer.com/" target="_blank">https://cronometer.com/</a></a> to track what you eat each day, and it will tell you what percent of each macro (fat, protein, carb) and various vitamins you're getting. It does require you to make an account, but I've never gotten spam from them, and if tracking your nutrients is important to you, it's far from the silliest thing to have an account for. I went vegan a few months ago and it was very helpful in tracking my meal preps to ensure I wasn't missing out on something or only eating like 1400 calories a day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey there! </p>
<p>To answer your question, I generally recommend the USDAâ€™s MyPlate which can be found via a quick google images search or on their <a href="www.choosemyplate.gov" target="_blank">website</a>....which can be a little clunky if Iâ€™m honestly speaking </p>
<p>In short, itâ€™s a pretty straightforward and color coded poster that not only helps with identifying what type of food groups one should have on their plate but also give one an idea on portion sizes</p>
<p>Edit: just to piggy back off pirate peteyâ€™s comment: you can certainly use apps like Cronometer or MyFitnessPal but they are a bit more intensive and rely on a ton of input from your end. Donâ€™t get me wrong though, theyâ€™re great resources if you plan on investing your time and effort into it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as I measure out the amount of each food according to the Nutrition Facts, then I'm good, right?</p>
<p>[Edit: I mean measure out according the nutrient amounts in the Nutrition Facts, and then measure out other food, until I get enough of each nutrient]</p></div>		</li>
