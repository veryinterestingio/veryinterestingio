			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are looking for is Wien's displacement law <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> - it says that for a blackbody (object at temperature T), the brightest wavelength is proportional to 1/T. </p>
<p>In SI units, this is (wavelength in meters) = 0.0029 / (temp in Kelvin).</p>
<p>The actual distribution of radiation vs wavelength is, as others have said, given by the blackbody distributionum</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on that, could an object at high enough temperatures only give off UV and higher EMR? Essentially completely blackbody with no IR radiation? Or would such a temperature be impossible to reach?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, bodies at higher temperatures emit more at <em>all</em> wavelengths than those at lower temperatures. </p>
<p>The linked animation is misleading in that it shows the proportional distribution, when actually while the peak of the curve shifts towards lower wavelength, the total emission increases at all wavelengths with temperature as well. I think the Planck's Law page posted by the top comment is more informative than the other image.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, any blackbody at any temperature will emit radiation of each frequency. It's the amount that varies with temperature. As you bring the temperature up the amount of lower frequency radiation decreases, at very high temperatures it's almost negligible, but it will always give off that lower frequency radiation. </p>
<p>In fact the opposite is also true, cooling a blackbody down lowers the intensity of the higher frequency radiation but it always emits some amount of higher frequency radiation. Even a blackbody very near absolute zero will do this.</p>
<p>Now these are only for theoretical blackbodies and, while these results accurately match a lot of objects in the real world, as you start to reach very high or low temperatures or work with more exotic objects these results will differ from experiments. There are no perfect blackbodies in the real world. Not only that but radiation is quantised and this is a classical theory so when you start looking at very small amounts of radiation being emitted then you have to move to a quantum theory which will be stochastic (random) in nature.</p></div>		</li>
