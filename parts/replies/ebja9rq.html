			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not used a ton anymore due to sound quality, among other things, and is discontinued in some countries.</p>
<p>In the US, it is primarily used for talk radio, sports, and some very traditional radio broadcasts such as The Grand Ol Opry, which has been giving the world country music for almost 100 years.</p>
<p>Back in the 60s and 70s, Mexico would license AM stations to operate with an extremely strong signal such that at night the station could be clearly heard throughout much of the US and the more populated parts of Canada.  Wolfman Jack was a famous DJ at that time who taped his show in San Diego, California, but had the tapes broadcasted out of a &quot;Border Blaster&quot; station in nearby Tijuana.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's used extensively on the air bands for communications via air traffic.  One reason is because AM does not exhibit the capture effect of FM, thus two stations can theoretically talk at the same time.  They won't hear each other, but a third station will.  Thus if one plane is talking to the tower, another can break in over them.  When the first one stops talking, the tower will notify them that another aircraft has priority traffic and to stop talking so the second aircraft can.</p>
<p>Aside from that, it tends to be much more efficient (~10x often) to cover the same area as an FM transmitter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you'd call it.</p>
<p>In the UK if you said &quot;is AM radio used?&quot; the answer would be no.</p>
<p>But it is, it's just called MW. It's a very specific band of the AM frequency but as every device lists it as MW no-one thinks AM is used here.</p>

<p>Some tunnels support satellite based radio services too. The antenna doesnâ€™t care where it comes from, just that it does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case it doesn't matter.  The modulation isn't the issue, it's the wavelength.  You can theoretically have either modulation type at either wavelength, we just happen to use them in a certain manner as stated above.</p></div>		</li>
