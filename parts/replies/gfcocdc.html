			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it’s totally a social thing. Studies show when people are alone they tend to just smile when encountering something funny, and only really laugh when in front of others. It’s part of the reason some tv shows use “laugh tracks” so we feel like we’re watching it with other people and feel more inclined to laugh out loud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya if you YouTube a sitcom without its laugh track, most of the jokes fall really flat and usually it even just sounds depressing. Like Raymond's mom putting down her adult sons is a lot less funny when its done to silence.</p></div>		</li>
