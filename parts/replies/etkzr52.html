			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh God I once took a practice SAT test that had one of those reading comprehension passages on the subject of yawning. Fucking boring as fuck. The last bit talked about how it was contagious and the last sentence said something to the effect of &quot;you're likely to be yawning by the end of this sentence&quot;. So pissed when I did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard (no source) that this was to do with us forming communities and when someone yawned because they were tired it signified to the rest of the group that it was a safe area to sleep.</p>
<p>Not sure how true this is though. Might be something I heard on QI many years ago...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably more just 'monkey-see monkey-do'. Humans instinctively ape those around us without thinking about it. Gives you some weird results like e.g. humans playing rock-paper-scissors having a higher than chance chance of choosing the same sign as their opponent because they're unconsciously copying the other person's movements in-action without realizing or wanting it. Much like how you might be infected by a yawn without realizing or wanting it.</p>
<p>It's an extremely useful feature though, that allows humans to perform incredible synchronized movements with little-to-no effort. Not talking obviously complex stuff like e.g. marching in order, but more something like lifting a log, or food, or whatever else together with another person and coordinating your movements with his. Stuff like that's really easy for humans without any effort or training at all. But take something like a chimp and they'll never pull anything like that off. And chimps aren't stupid either. Yeah, they don't have language, or all our culturally acquired knowledge (rob us of all that and honestly humans are pretty shit at most things; we evolved to outsource our thinking to our culture, as a result leaving our brains less impressive than one might expect in several areas), or our (perhaps unique?) capacity for abstraction, but, as long as you can get them to understand the task, they beat us even at some cognitive tasks, like reaction speed, short-term memory, even <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/06/chimps-best-humans-game-theory" target="_blank">game theory</a>. But they can't move a log together, 'cuz they just don't have that intense sense of unity with others that humans can develop.</p>
<p>That's probably more likely to be what's happening than some complicated biologically evolved signal for 'yawn=safe'. Although, what do I know. I'm just a reddit comment.</p></div>		</li>
