			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats really interesting. I wonder if the delay between the fast and slow responses are what causes rage when you stub your toe. Like your body will flush out all of the anger because it's going to be experiencing the emotional pain very shortly.</p>
<p>In practice, i know after stubbing my toe, i may push whatever i hit it on to a different spot during the rage phase, since i won't be able to think to do so after the slow response kicks in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. The fast pain response doesn’t interact with the areas of the brain responsible for emotion - the somatosensory cortex really just deals with the question “does that hurt?” and respond accordingly “remove hand from fire” for example. The slow fibres are neurally linked to far more areas of the brain, including emotions (such as the anterior cingulate cortex) hence the wider response. Interestingly, and somewhat paradoxically, if the pain is severe enough, once the initial fast pain is registered, the slow fibres can shut down parts of the brain responsible for pain in an extreme survival response. This is why some people after getting shot in the battlefield only learn if their injury when they’re told about it.</p>
<p>Fact is pin is highly complex and not fully understood. The neural pathways responsible are many and there is no single “pain centre” of the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically there's the &quot; <em>oh shit</em> , that hurt &quot; and the &quot; <em>FUUUUCK</em> &quot; , kind of pain.</p></div>		</li>
