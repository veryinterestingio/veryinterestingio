			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this question. Certainly, I cannot speak for Native Peoples, but there are some great voices out there that discuss this very issue. One who comes readily to mind is Robin Wall Kimmerer. She bridges the gap between the western science and indigenous wisdom in her writing. Personally, I believe there is more to restoration than just creating a nutrient cycle. And yes, many plants have co-evolved with human harvesting and seem to diminish when just left alone. As well, the land was tended for millennia by indigenous peoples who harvested, burned, and stewarded the land to their benefit as well as the mutual benefit of the plants and animals there. Just looking at the Salish in our area, they have lived here for conservatively 12,000 years, probably longer. In that time they didn't starve or pollute themselves out of existence, which means they managed their resources well. There is deep wisdom in that level of success. Western culture cannot claim the same. </p>
<p>Your question also hits on the philosophy of the preservation of natural places as meaning the exclusion of human influences when those same places saw the stewardship of indigenous peoples for countless generations. There's a lot to unpack in your question and I won't be able to get to it all. Thank you for asking that. </p>
<p>I would love to do more to facilitate an integration of traditional ecological knowledge in our restoration practices. We are beginning to implement the use of fire, but that is tricky in a dry environment surrounded by human habitation. I'll say more about the specifics of what I have attempted in the followup question below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have attempted to connect with the Salish but have not been successful. My hope was to open access to some of their traditional homeland here in the Bitterroot, get their thoughts and opinions on its management, learn if there are sites that we should protect because of their significance, and then also to permit some traditional harvesting and set up experiments to see how plants respond to those harvesting methods over time. Those were the things that I could reasonably offer, but my attempts didn't get very far and for this I can only assume that there is a lack of interest on their part. That's fine if it's the case, people are busy and have other priorities, so no worries. I would be happy to speak with any tribal member interested in discussing any of this and would encourage them to reach out to me. Also, this was a several year process, not just a couple emails on my part.</p></div>		</li>
