			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what bothers me the most. I have an engine light for a O2 sensor in the exsaust. It's stuck lean, but only sometimes. Haven't been worried about digging down to it.</p>
<p>But because of that, I won't know if a more serious engine issue haooens because the lights always on now.</p>
<p>I have a Bluetooth OBD reader I can check with my phone, and that's great. Added bonus is I can read off not only the codes but all the real time data as well!</p>
<p>There really should be a &quot;minor check engine&quot; and a &quot;critical engine condition&quot;. One being a simple sensor and another being anything that can cause large performance issues or damage to engine if operation continues.</p>
<p>I also got to add here....
Screw Ford and their useless dash temp gauge. Car overheated yesterday causing coolant to overflow to belt which started to smoke. Temp sensor was saying engine nominal. Pulled OBD reader app out and was way over temp. (fan relay went bad on me, while in traffic with AC running.)</p>
<p>Bluetooth OBD reader I can at least SEE the actual coolant temp in real time and quickly can notice when somethings wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The OBD2 standard actually does cover the severity of the issue as well. Some of the codes thrown (Misfire in particular) cause the Check Engine light to flash continuously, that's to let the driver know to pull over immediately and shut off the engine. It won't tell you <em>why</em> the engine is misfiring, but nearly all of the reasons are  big enough problems to damage things. It might be a failing sensor, or a loose spark plug wire, but all the computer knows is that there's raw fuel being dumped into the exhaust, and the catalytic converter will die if that keeps happening. Legally OBD2 only requires monitoring of systems related to the emissions, lately manufacturers bring more data into that system for other purposes but those are not required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be careful with that stuck lean o2 sensor. If your vehicle perceives erroneously lean operation it may run rich to compensate. This could result in excess hydrocarbons getting stored on the catalytic converter which, once lit, could cause it to melt. </p>
<p>Regarding your temp sensor, are you sure the temp sensor on your dash is tied to the temperature sensor which measures the coolant at the location that it ended up being the hotest. I'm not sure how uniform coolant temps are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there are still things that non-technical people can easily take care of if they have the information. A coworker of mine took their car to the mechanic because their check engine light came on. The issue: Their gas cap wasn't tightened enough.</p>
<p>This can result in two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>People ignoring the check engine light because they aren't given enough information.</li>
<li>Mechanics taking advantage of people because those people don't have enough information about what is wrong.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The monitoring system triggered in your example is the evaporation emissions system. The car will try to recover all gas fumes and hold them in a charcoal canister to feed into the engine while running. </p>
<p>For this to work, the gas tank has to be pretty much air tight unless the ECM commands it to not be. There are several failures other than the gas cap that will trigger an EVAP error, but it just so happens that the gas cap not being on right is the most common cause of an EVAP error. </p>
<p>If drivers had to go through actual training on how cars work, similar to how pilots have to actually know how aircraft systems work (not necessarily be able to fix them though) then you could have more information shown to end users. Unfortunately if you can't figure out a $10 chinese OBD2 scan tool from Amazon bluetoothed to your phone and be able to google a P0456 EVAP leak code and troubleshoot the gas cap as the first problem, then a check engine light is really the best option for the unwashed masses who can get a drivers license with nearly no education on how cars work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know what happens when my internet stops working? Sure I can call geek squad but I can also run the troubleshooting tool. And that tool provides me some basic and simple first steps. &quot;Make sure the cable is plugged in, restart the router, check my modem, etc.&quot; and if none of those fix the problem then it tells me to get help. It wouldn't be complicated for the car to say &quot;EVAP error: Check your gas cap and if that doesn't work take to a mechanic. Issue is serious but your car is drivable.&quot; Then if I get to my mechanic, I know it's a problem related to the evaporation emissions system so he can't try to upsell me into also doing a coolant flush or some other bullshit. There is no harm in providing users more information. And not providing enough causes people to ignore the light.</p></div>		</li>
