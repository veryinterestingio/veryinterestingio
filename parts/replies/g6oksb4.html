			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants are a monophyletic group of multicellular eukaryotes. Many algae and such are not plants in that sense, but are simpler eukaryotes (though some would be sister lineages to plants). Also there's blue-green algae which are actually bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually very interesting. Cyanobacteria are bacteria that have the ability to photosynthesize, and a very early type of single celled algae “swallowed” one of them. Cyanobacteria provided energy to the algae and the algae provided protection or other resources to the cyanobacteria. This relationship worked well, as we now have a special name for it: the chloroplast. </p>
<p>It’s actually a little more complicated than that and there were multiple occasions of smaller photosynthetic organisms being incorporated into larger ones, but I can’t remember exactly how it goes and I don’t feel like digging through the internet to get the specifics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Today, that is true, but back in the Carboniferous when there were no ice caps and the whole planet was covered in forests of scale trees (not true trees which didn't exist yet, but a type of woody fern) basically from pole to pole, the land-based contribution of oxygen would have been notably higher than current times. </p>
<p>Still not the majority by any means, but it was absolutely the tipping factor that broke the equilibrium. It wasn't just production that bumped up the atmospheric content of oxygen, but by trapping the carbon it otherwise would have bonded with in lignin (which was not digestible at the time), a major source of oxygen consumption was also removed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm almost sure it was different in the carboniferous, and that plants could thrive and produce more oxygen than now because there were no real massive population of big herbivore yet, nor microbes that could decay lignin and other plant material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a geological time-frame, 5000 years is incredibly short. Also, keep in mind that this would means ~500 years to decrease the ratio of Oxygen VS rest of the atmosphere significantly enough to cause major die-offs already</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen in the form that we breathe is a very reactive chemical and participates in a variety of oxidation reactions which affix one or more oxygen atoms to another atom. Rusting iron is an oxidation reaction, and so is burning most any fuel in air. Most metals you might be familiar with such as iron, aluminum, nickel, lead (sometimes lead sulfide in its softer oxidation state) are found in the earth as oxides and must be reduced (the opposite of oxidation) to get the shiny metallic stuff. Most oxygen that's used up on earth gets bonded to carbon in the forms of CO2 and CO which are atmospheric gasses, or CO3^(2-) which occurs in some solids like limestone.</p>
<p>This can be thought of as an equilibrium between carbon dioxide and elemental oxygen where photosynthetic life drives the reaction towards molecular oxygen, and animal/inorganic processes drive it towards carbon dioxide.</p></div>		</li>
