<p>Incredibly thorough response.. Thank you kindly, stranger.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, definitely not limited by scientists sitting around brainstorming, but by hard limits. (All the obvious and semi-obvious ideas were thought of within a day or two of the outbreak). Consider also how a vaccine works as opposed to other therapies: it has an effect on the patient's immune system, and then the immune system attacks the virus. The vaccine doesn't attack the virus. </p>
<p>On the other hand, let's say you wanted to develop an antibiotic for a bacterial infection, or an antiviral drug. In both cases, if you can come up with a small molecule drug that destroys the bacteria/virus, then you're ready for trials. So you can do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_screening" target="_blank">automated high throughput screens</a> to test tons of candidates in multi-well plates. When you get &quot;hits&quot;, compunds that seems to work, you can follow up by validating them, and then evaluate whether they would be safe, and proceed to trials. These trials can be fast-tracked as you mentioned. But there's no shortcut (yet) for rapidly screening for a desired human immune response. </p>
<p>For this reason, we'll see COVID-19 therapeutics before we see a vaccine. And within that category, the first will be drugs that are already approved for other purposes (can skip the safety phase) and also seem to work against nCOV. For instance:</p>

</ul>
<p>Interestingly, the urgency of COVID-19 is driving rapid R&amp;D, which is awesome. We are seeing <a href="https://pipelinereview.com/index.php/2020022573876/Vaccines/Moderna-Ships-mRNA-Vaccine-Against-Novel-Coronavirus-mRNA-1273-for-Phase-1-Study.html" target="_blank">completely new strategies</a> for making vaccines.</p>
<p>Coming up with a flashy new way to make a flu shot isn't too exciting. But with the entire world desperately needing an nCOV vaccine, suddenly there is a lot of &quot;Hey, why don't we just...&quot; and ideas that might actually work well. Yay science!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I got it! Why don't we do the same as with any other vaccine and just use an antigen of the Corona virus to create a vaccine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is what Trump is getting confused.</p>
<p>He gets some responses that pharma companies could develop a vaccine with 3-6 months.  This is true.  He repeats this number as when the vaccine would be available.  However, it’s not true that it could be available in this time frame.</p>
<p>They then tell him that no, the FDA requires you to demonstrate it’s safe first, which requires clinical trials.  So while you could theoretically have one in 3-6 months, it won’t be tested.  It’s this part, that if fast-tracked to hell and back could be done entirely, from development to testing and then scaling production, in 18 months or so.  That’s an incredibly fast timeline.</p>
<p>For comparison, your average small molecule pharmaceutical takes 3-10 years to discover, then another 3-5 years for clinical trials, then you ramp production.</p>
<p>Also, for all projects worked on, they have somewhere between a 2-10% success rate, depending on field of study.</p>
<p>For vaccines, the optimistic numbers are also not taking into account fail rate.  They don’t fail at anywhere near the same rate as small molecules, as I understand, but there is some fail rate in clinical trials.</p>
<p>So when a drug is available for sale, it has to pay back 6-18 years of R&amp;D for that project, as well as 10-50x other projects that failed the company also has to pay for.  This it the reason drug prices are high.</p>
<p>The process is super long and takes quite a bit of trial and error.  Even 18 months for a vaccine is extremely optimistic in every single aspect of the process.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAS, but IIRC H1N1 was a variant of something that was common, prevalent, and its particular mutation was not such that it looked radically different from something the human body was already fighting. So it was new, and different, but it was close enough to existing things that they were able to piggyback on existing vaccines/treatments to skip some of the delay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current state of vaccines against influenza viruses is very different from the corona viruses.</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines have been around for a long time and there is a lot of information on how the work, their safety and efficacy (effectiveness). New variants are developed to match the new virus strains that appear once or twice yearly. As they are very similar to what already exists, testing can be simplified, mainly to confirm that the new vaccine behaves like the previous variants.</p>
<p>COVID-19 on the other hand is the first Corona virus to be seriously considered for a vaccine. As there are no other vaccines for Corona viruses, much more work is needed for development. And the full suite of safety testing is required as it is a novel drug, then full testing of the efficacy is needed. Completing a new vaccine in 12 months would be an extraordinary feat requiring lots of skill, collaboration, planning and quite some luck.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This makes me wonder... I know some other coronaviruses cause the common cold (also SARS and MERS, but those have been very limited, while dangerous). Even though it's not super serious stuff, wouldn't still there be something to gain in warding off against it? Why has it never been pursued much?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a tangentially related question. Each year, we need to renew our flu shots due to the flu rapidly mutating, correct? If this is the case, that it takes 6-18 months to develop, test, and produce a vaccine, then how effective is an “annual” flu vaccine anyway? Seems like the flu shot will always be a year behind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah your intuition is correct. Each year the vaccine they end up producing is basically a bet on which strain will be prevalent that season, and some years it's very effective and other years it's not. See estimates for past years here: </p>

<p>For forecasting, there's a lot of data that needs to be crunched and then predictive models are created. Check out (note the URL name!) data on seasonal flu and nCOV here:</p>
