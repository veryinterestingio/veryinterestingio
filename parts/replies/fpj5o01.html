			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah we had them all around a pool I worked at as a teen.  Fortunately, they don’t sting people often.  We had probably hundreds that had nests nearby and they were everywhere, but I never heard of a single person getting stung by them the whole time I worked there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the picture. If the “murder hornet” is picture A, it doesn’t look anywhere near as huge as all the pics I’ve seen on other posts recently, with insects almost as big as the palm of someone’s hand. Were those mostly bullshit posts of some other species?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That picture likes to make it’s round but it’s a poor representative of the species. Although those are indeed Asian giant hornets, they are preserved (in alcohol or similar substance) wasps which accounts for their dark coloration, and preservation in liquids tends to unnaturally swell the segmented abdomen of an insect. Such can contribute to length not otherwise present in life. Those individuals are also queens, which are the individuals that reach 2”. The workers (the vast majority of the colony) average 1.4”-1.6” in length. Finally, they’re big insects on a small hand. </p>
<p>They’re still the largest social wasp in the world, but they’re definitely not small-bird size like some pictures or exaggerations are making them out to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pictures I've seen the murder hornets look much different and larger, as in the ones in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/asian-giant-hornet-washington.html" target="_blank">this article</a>. Are those photos all of queens?</p></div>		</li>
