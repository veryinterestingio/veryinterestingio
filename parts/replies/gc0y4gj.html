			<div class="markdown"><p>Not trying to detract from your point at all, but your &quot;familiarity&quot; with your speed is probably mostly to do with the lines painted on the road, which in most countries change length and spacing according to the rated road speed - causing them all to &quot;flash past&quot; at the same relative frequency on roads of differing speed limits.</p>
<p>For instance, a road with a 100km/hr limit will have much longer, much further spaced lane divider lines than a road rated for 40km/hr.</p>
<p>Rather than becoming familiar with the speed of your surroundings whizzing by, your brain is more likely &quot;tuned&quot; to the &quot;beat&quot; of the road lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which countries in particular? In the US, almost without exception, the dashes are 10 ft long and the spaces between are 30 ft long. They do not change based on the type of road or speed limit.</p>
<p>Other countries appear to use a standard of 3 meter long lines with 6 meter long gaps.  (Canada, UK, Sweden, Denmark, Norway).</p>
<p>There may be changes based on curves, passing allowances, or to show hazards, but I haven't seen anything talking about speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I also couldn't easily find mention of it in federal road marking specs - however within individual state/territory road documents for my country (Aus) I found specs detailing a change of length &amp; spacing from 3m to 9m on roads over 70km/h in most states and territories.</p>
<p>I guess it doesn't vary as much as I initially thought - though <em>most</em> of Australia sticks to 40/60, 80/100/110. Except Queensland where the cops try to fuck you at every turn. Their limits seem to shift by 10km/h every few km so the cops can screw you around the next bend.</p>
<p>After trawling through all those documents for a while, I cant really be bothered trawling individual state docs for other countries...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't notice road lines as much when I first learned to drive, it was checking the speed occasionally and after a while it just seemed to work. Plus I dont really worry too much about speed unless I'm by myself on the road, I just try and keep with the traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be part of it, but the super rural area I come from seldom had roads with lines on them, and the feeling of speed still worked.</p></div>		</li>
