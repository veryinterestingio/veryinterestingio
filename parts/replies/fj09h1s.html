			<div class="markdown"><p>What some doctors refer to as a &quot;pneumonia vaccine&quot; (when they're in too much of a rush to give the full explanation) is a vaccine against one particular bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae which is a major cause of serious pneumonia (less so now that we're vaccinating aggressively against it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking your comment to ask: what defines which virus causes pneumonia and which virus stops e.g. at the nasal cavities or the larynx? Why do some strains of Coronavirus strike at the lower respiratory system since the entry method is the same for all kinds of coronaviruses? What makes the SARS inducing strains different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different cells have different molecules on their surface - the viral receptors. The outer surface or capsid of a specific coronavirus strain may contain certain attachment proteins which are able to bind to certain viral receptor molecules on certain host cells.</p>
<p>This would explain why an upper respiratory system cell is more likely to get infected by virus X over a lower respiratory system cell.</p>
<p>It's all molecular biology, and how certain molecules on the viral surface fit together better over others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called tropism when viruses can only infect certain cell types.</p>
<p>Also just to clarify a bit, what you're calling viral receptors are normal cell surface molecules the viruses have evolved to bind. Those cell surface molecules have normal biological functions they also happen to be targeted by viruses.</p></div>		</li>
