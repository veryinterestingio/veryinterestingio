			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm red green colorblind. The kind that literally is only noticable during those circle tests. I can see some of the numbers but not all. Anyway, the Magic Eye things always worked for me. In fact, I was usually the first person to &quot;see&quot; them. My friends always had to do the thing where they pull the image slowly away from their eyes at least a few times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the behind the wheel portion of my drivers ed, I wasn't used to seeing traffic lights and the sun was behind me (which I now know makes lights harder to see). A light was green but I assumed it was red from how it looked due to the sun and slammed on the brakes. The truck behind me had to swerve out of the way, honked, and the instructor yelled &quot;WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?&quot; I had to explain that I was colorblind and then thought I would never get my license.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure where you are but I’m guessing NA from your spelling of “color”. Here in the UK, it’s easy for colourblind people to still be able to drive because the red light is always on top, and the green is always on the bottom (with an amber light between them). Is this not the case for where you are?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazing explanation. I am colorblind and have Enchroma glasses. Adding on to answer the part about how I know what the colors are if I’ve never seen them. The answer is I can see them. Not all colorblind people are completely colorblind. I can still see red and green, they are just less red and less green then they are for non-colorblind people and sometimes they look the same, kind of a brownish color. It’s like those colors have been desaturated. So when I put my glasses on, something that was red before becomes RED! And any colors that are a mix of red and another color, like purple (red and blue) become far more vibrant. And it’s amazing. The same goes for green.
The first time I saw a rainbow with my glasses on I stared at it for 5 minutes the middle of the parking lot and just said, “Wow!” over and over again. My friend asked jokingly if it was the first time I’d seen a rainbow and it kind of was. It was like seeing it for the first time. So beautiful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a good question. I had to think for a bit and I do not study any of this is a forma way so my thoughts are all anecdotal, but I would say no. Seeing the rainbow with my glasses on for the first time is a good example. Before my glasses I’ve always been able to see a rainbow but some of the colors, like the red and orange, were one dull reddish blob that kind of merged into the yellow. It’s hard to describe. So when I imagined a rainbow that is what I saw. After seeing the rainbow with my glasses I was able to see all the colors vividly and separately. However, I spent so much of my life seeing that dull rainbow that it is still hard to imagine the true vividness of all the colors without seeing it. And when I do, even after having my glasses for 5 years, I am still struck by its beauty and vividness. Maybe as I see more rainbows with my glasses I’ll be able to imagine it better.
Another example are green street signs (in the USA). Without my glasses they are this dark almost forest green but with my glasses they are far brighter and greener. So now I’m able to imagine them as both.
I hope that helps answer your question, it is hard to describe because I have nothing to compare it to. One of my favorite quotes is by <a href="https://youtu.be/F5FEj9U-CJM" target="_blank">Zefrank in his True Facts video about Mantis Shrimp</a>. Mantis Shrimp can see way more colors than a human and to describe this he says, “Imagine a color you can’t even imagine.” That accurately describes what I’m trying to do when I imagine things with colors I can’t see very well like a rainbow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have both the outdoor and indoor glasses. My understanding is that the nature of how they work causes them to be tinted so the less tinted indoor glasses don’t work quite as well. With that said, I 110% recommend them. Especially the outdoor sunglasses, I use those as often as I can. It took about a week for my brain to fully adapt to the new vibrancy and colors but after it was an entirely new world. I’ve had them for 5 years now and I still occasionally come across something that is so spectacularly colorful it nearly brings tears to my eyes. It literally changed my perspective on things like flowers, rainbows, animals, anything colorful. </p>
<p>Caveat: they do not work for all types and severities of colorblindness. There is a <a href="https://enchroma.com/pages/color-blind-test" target="_blank">test on Enchroma’s site</a> that will tell you your type and severity. It isn’t perfect but it will give you an idea if the glasses will help you. I believe they also offer a 90 day (could be wrong about the duration) return period for a full refund if you find they don’t help.</p></div>		</li>
