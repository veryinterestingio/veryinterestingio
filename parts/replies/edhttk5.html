			<div class="markdown"><p>My mind went straight to that too, lol. I love that book and find myself rereading it every once in a while. I was kind of disappointed with some of his later books in the series, as he vastly changed his writing style, but the first few books for both points of view are great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you only talking about the speaker for the dead series? Or the shadow saga as well?</p>
<p>To explain this for someone who knows nothing about these books:</p>
<p>Ender's game: young adultish sci fi (slightly hard. Sonetimes) which tackles some interesting themes. </p>
<p>Speaker series: the sequels to Ender's game. Much more mature. Lots of philosophical sounding questions. Very different book to read. Much dryer.</p>
<p>Shadow saga: the first book is in parallel to Ender's game, from the perspective of a major supporting character. The sequels follow them and many other supporting characters through the events that directly follow Ender's game. This series retains the young adultish nature which the speaker series lost. Much easier reading. </p>
<p>Edit: reread your comment and it seems to actually answer my initial question. But I'll leave this as is because I've encountered a good number of people that don't even know the shadow saga exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I loved Ender's Game, but I never understood the hype around the quote &quot;the enemy's gate is down.&quot; Isn't the idea simply that the cadets' performance suffered in zero-G because they lacked a common point of reference, so Ender gave them one? There's no other sensible way of doing it. The zero-G arena had two opposing gates and a bunch of randomly placed obstacles. Naturally, pick one of the gates and orient yourselves relative to it. That doesn't strike me as a particularly difficult mental model to adopt, but then again, I'm not a preteen astronaut-warrior. Am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that within the context of the book, everyone is a kid.  Even the captains of each army are 12 years old (yes, they are characterized as extremely smart for their age, but they are still kids.  The book even makes reference to some of the younger kids not picking up on the concept of orientation changing in space).</p>
<p>Prior to Ender becoming a captain, almost all of the armies were trying to use the same orientation within the battle room that they were in when they stepped from the space station into the battle room.   The army was still given a common point of reference, but was thinking of the battle room as a horizontal space with one gate in front and one behind.</p>
<p>Ender changes this up and makes his team imagine that the enemy gate is down, turning the battle room into a vertical space.  This also had the effect that when his soldiers were advancing on the enemy, their feet would be exposed and not their full body, making them harder to hit. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most difficult thing I had to wrap my head around when I was learning to play Descent was that with no gravity or 'ground' there wasn't really an up or down, and so it didn't really matter if the enemy ship I was chasing was 'upside down' (from my perspective) because there <em>was</em> no up or down. </p>
<p>And yet I'd still waste time trying to orient my ship the same way 'up' as my target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been playing Descent recently and this was the first thing to pop into my head when I saw this question. They intentionally change where the ceiling lights are oriented so you feel like you need to flip over. </p>
<p>My son tried to play and couldn’t deal with the lack of fixed orientation and the keyboard only controls. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really good answer actually. Also you've reminded me to reread Ender's Game, so thanks for that. I'd forgotten that perspective that Ender cultivates in the book, and how useful it was to following the events in the games. Thanks! </p></div>		</li>
