			<div class="markdown"><p>Going to piggy back here and interpret the infinite descent proof in a way someone less math literate might understand better.</p>
<p>The way we're going to prove √2 is irrational is through a cool thing called a proof of contradiction. That is, we're going to make an assumption and do some operations on it until we find a contradiction which will prove our initial assumption is false.</p>
<p>For the purpose of contradiction let's assume √2 is rational.</p>
<p>that assumption means that there exists some combination of integers a and b where a/b = √2 and a/b is in its most simplified form.</p>
<h2>a/b = √2</h2>
<p>taking that equation above. square both sides to remove that gross square root</p>
<h2>a/b = √2 =&gt; a^2 / b^2  = 2</h2>
<p>from there we can multiply both sides by b^2 to get.</p>
<h2>a^2 = 2b^2</h2>
<p>this here shows that a^2 must be even because a 2 times some integer (b^2 being the integer). this means that a must be even because an odd number times itself is never even.</p>
<p>therefore we can say:</p>
<h2>a = 2k</h2>
<p>for some integer k.</p>
<p>using the above we can plug that into a^2 = 2b^2</p>
<h2>(2k)^2 = 2b^2 =&gt; 4k^2 = 2b^2</h2>
<p>dividing both sides by 2 gives us</p>
<h2>b^2 = 2k^2</h2>
<p>this tells us that b^2 is even as well. Using similar logic as for a, therefore b is also even. so we can say</p>
<h2>b = 2j</h2>
<p>for some integer j.</p>
<p>from here let's substitute a and b in the equation from our original assumption.</p>
<h2>2k/2j = √2</h2>
<p>this is the contradiction. We defined a/b to be in simplest form but the above equation shows that a/b can be simplified by dividing by 2. This contradiction means that √2  is <strong>not</strong> rational and therefore must be <strong>irrational.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will restate your question to make sure I understand what you are asking...</p>
<p>Since the circumference of a circle (c) is equal to pi times the diameter (d) of that circle (c=πd), then π can be expressed as a ratio: π=c/d. Assuming that c and d are whole numbers, doesn't that mean that π can't be an irrational number?</p>
<p>The answer is: Yes, that would be true, except that the assumption &quot;c and d are whole numbers&quot; is invalid. They would never both be whole numbers. That's just the nature of the relationship between the circumference and diameter of a circle. One of the numbers (or both) will always be irrational, for all circles.</p></div>		</li>
