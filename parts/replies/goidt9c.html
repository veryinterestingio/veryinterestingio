<p>Flu circulates near year-round in tropical regions like Southeast Asia and Latin America, and its these regions of the world which can be thought of almost as reservoirs for influenza. I say near year-round because their flu seasons are more tied to wet/dry seasons. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0153003" target="_blank">Influenza seasonality in the tropics</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the southern hemisphere is flu season is actually the opposite of ours what happens is the seasonal flu in the northern hemisphere migrates to the southern hemisphere traveling on the backs of people taking planes or boats or otherwise getting to a new destination they give it to one individual and then it spreads like wildfire in the fertile habitat of a lot of people being close to each other potentially some vitamin d deficiencies and the cold causing people to be inside next to each other a lot more than in the fall it flips where somebody from the southern hemisphere comes to the Northern hemisphere where the flu then finds its fertile ground to spread like wildfire up here.</p>
<p>I used people here for this example but it is also possible if it's an avian flu for a bird to flat down to the southern hemisphere or for it to piggyback on cattle being transported</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think they do that.  Birds migrate north and south across the equator, but none fly over either pole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Interesting. It keeps circulating, in individuals. Always- until there are no more cases, like for polio, or smallpox, or yellow fever in most of the world. Also it persists in the &quot;animal reservoir&quot;. In fact there is a whole program at NIAID, calleds &quot;CEIRS&quot;, the Center for Excellence in Influenza Surveillance&quot;, to watch this issue, and there are really more than one, like a handful of these. So, you get 4-10 performing swabs on birds, and characterizing the flu strains, and sending them to fludb after sequencing. You look at the birds and strains, and reservoirs, and serotypes like H3N2 which is rich in crows and chickens and ducks especially. Most of these strains do not leap the species barrier, but some do, and we have to keep a watch on them, because for instance a significant portion of flu in the past 5 years has actually been H3N2. Can we vaccinate wildlife? No. So flu will stay with us forever.  And as for transmission, it has to pass from an infected person to another. If there are fewer cases, there is lesser transmission. Unlucky people that are immune compromised may be at greater risk of contracting moderate illness, but the risk of infection in the first place is not changed based on their ability to fight it.
