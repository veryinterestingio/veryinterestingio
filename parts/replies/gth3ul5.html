			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, that's not it at all.   For this analogy, consider that the human is a Huge  8 CPU Enterprise class server, running at 3 Gigahertz.  It is trying to respond to a stimulus that is 200 yards away over copper ethernet cables.  The small fly is an embedded controller nestled between the wheels of a Segway-type self balancing robot, running at 500 Mhz.  The server would fail to balance the robot because the signal would take too long to travel the distance between point a and b.  a 500Mhz embedded controller with 6 inches of cable length can simply respond faster.  that and the &quot;OS&quot; of an embedded controller is much smaller, and has less software to control.  (this is an analogy, an admittedly flawed one)</p></div>		</li>
