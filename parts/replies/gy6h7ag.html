			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on this - 16 is merely the most common leaf size for large books. The main division is always four - so a children's picture book might be 16, 20, or 24 pages - but never 21 or 15.</p>
<p>The front and last page of these sorts of books are also often glued to the cover - thus the book will be 22, 18, or 14 pages as two of the pages are used to attach the book to the cover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation, but it's also the case that some items traditionally appear on a certain side. Like how the title will appear on the right hand side (recto). If the content to be typeset isn't structured that way, you have to have a blank page before it to make that happen.</p></div>		</li>
