			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's really dumb. When blue boxes and recycling became the norm, people had to push harder for the big companies and factories to waste less and recycle more. Residential recycling is a good idea, but isn't that effective due to poor sorting, and also does little to address the tonnes and tonnes of waste from factories and offices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My bugbear is that take away coffee cups aren't recyclable (most, if not all, have a lining inside).<br />
That, and packaging - if I buy something from Amazon or Ebay I have no control over how it is packaged, and some of it can't be recycled.<br />
It should be up to these companies to create recyclable packaging, not the consumer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a student at Unnamed University and worked in the dining halls, I learned just how much of a farce corporate recycling campaigns are. Publicly, there was a big push for students to recycle, and there were recycling bins all over the campus. Behind the scenes as an employee, we were not allowed to recycle any waste. There were not even recycling bins in the kitchen area. And there was a lot of recyclable waste that we had no choice but to throw in the trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has its pluses forsure. Even though it’s a lie sometimes it gets people at least thinking about being green. Doesn’t help in the end but it’s a small nudge in the right direction. It’s crazy to look at “us” vs some places. In Kamikatsu Japan they sort their recycling into 45 different categories. Most people in the west can’t even name 5</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most messed up thing is I know a lot of people who put plastic bags in their recycling bin so they can just take the bag out and throw it in the recycling. All bags, even if full of clean recyclables get pulled and go to the land fill. Who knows if the employee or machine is going to pull a bag full of clean stuff or a bag of trash that will contaminate everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh, depends where you are. Residential recycling is my job, and we spend a ton of additional time sorting people's bins before we toss them in the truck. If we throw a bag in, the guys at the plant separate it, then just empty the bags.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work often in recycling facilities and they use every thing from human to machine to do the work.</p>
<p>Its done in mutiple step.</p>
<p>They use human to do a first removal of trash
Then they use a magnet to remove metal
Next step its 2 conveyor with camera that sort plastic, paper, glass  and so on.
Then we finish with human for the last sorting</p>
<p>This is the way that the facility were I go work proceed but just to be clear they don't all do it that way.</p></div>		</li>
