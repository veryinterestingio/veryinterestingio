<p>Humans did math with pen and paper or whatever until calculators were created. Which does basic math for us quickly.</p>
<p>A computer is basically a calculator created to do MORE math faster. A regular calculator can do 1 &quot;math&quot; at a time.</p>

<p>Fun fact, we call them computers because the people who did calculations before then were called computers.  The device replaced the job and was named after them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, in the late 19th and early 20th century institutions like banks and insurance companies would have rooms full of computers.</p>
<p>Which in context were people who did math all day (mostly women) on everything from interest, to loans, to insurance premiums, all done by hand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So a super computer is basically a bunch of regular computers working together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowadays they are, though that type of super computer is typically called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster" target="_blank">Beowulf cluster</a>.  Because of a combination of cost (using commodity hardware), networking speed increases, individual CPU speed increases, and advances in parallelism.</p>
<p>Previous to the rise of Beowulf clusters Supercomputers were large machines with massively interlinked memory, processing units and storage. Take a look at the Cray series of supercomputers.</p>
<p>What is also hilarious to look at the specs of those &quot;Supercomputers&quot;. For example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-2" target="_blank">Cray-2</a> was released in 1985, was the fastest in the world and was a giant submerged watercooled beast.   Had a peak performance of 1.9 Gflops.  A modern processor like the 5900x has a proformance of 900 Gflops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in 2008, I was wandering through Los Alamos, NM, and happened upon a museum with a Cray. I almost sat on it, because it looked like a piece of furniture from the 1950's. </p>
<p>Before I could commit to sitting on it, I noticed the index card with the description and specs. Using the phone in my pocket, I pulled up the hardware specs for my phone off the internet. I think it was an HTC One, and it matched or beat all the processing, RAM and storage of this high backed circular couch from 1985. Main difference was that my phone would last a day on battery, vs using the annual power of many 10s of households per day.</p></div>		</li>
