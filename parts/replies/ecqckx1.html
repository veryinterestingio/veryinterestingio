<p>Everything Google does is to empower its primary business, which is advertising. Android, the Pixelbook line, the photo apps are all cost-centers (meaning they are business units not concerned with turning profit) </p>

<p>That's not really true anymore.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s pretty amazing that they’ve been able to transform their hardware business into a profitable business unit.  </p>
<p>It’s still nothing compared to the main advertising business, but I know a lot of Product Managers from Google that hated working on projects like the Pixelbook because anytime there was a problem Upper Management would throw more money on the budget because they never viewed the hardware products as anything more than cost-centers (meaning the Product Managers were never really challenged to come up with creative product or planning changes because there was always money available to fix the problems).</p></div>		</li>
