			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess that the effect is caused by the orbital plane but probably not that there are more aimed at the center of the earth, but rather that they are predominantly travelling &quot;sideways&quot; to the earth.  I'd suspect there is more atmospheric rejection of objects (bouncing off the atmosphere) near the poles because of the shallower angle of incidence.</p>
<p>As for why the moon gets a stronger effect from what must be some other mechanism is kinda confusing though, so I could be way off.  But if all the objects were clustered in a tight plane with the Earth's rotation and that packing density were the cause, one would expect the effect to be stronger with the larger earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up the scattered disc effect - I wonder if this has something to do with it?</p>
<p>I bring it up because most objects in our solar system that have irregular orbits come originally out of the solar asteroid orbit, Jupiter's Trojan asteroids, and the scattered disc.</p>
<p>What it means is that most meteorites should come from somewhere that's already on the orbital plane. Objects from the Oort cloud won't be, but many of those wind up on the scattered disc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the paper, they talk about the mass of the objects having a larger effect. Basically slower objects that are &quot;nearly coplanar&quot; can be pulled into the Earth and then hit the poles more frequently. The moon has less mass so it can't pull those objects as effectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The paper does not take into account any atmospheric effects. The meteorite flux is calculated for the top of the atmosphere and the calculated flux is validated with radar tracking of meteors burning up in the upper atmosphere. There's no mention of the possibility of meteors skipping out of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The effect is only due to orbital geometry of Near Earth Objects and the Earth. </p>
<p>If that happens, then the disparity could be slightly larger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because I had to re-read this a few times until it became clear - the quoted paper says that, for Earth, meteorites are 20 times more likely to hit the equator than the pole per unit of area. And for the moon that ratio is only 10 times.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oops, no it doesn't. The paper says &quot;here is a ratio&quot; and then quotes 5% (implying a 1:20 ratio)... Somewhat confusing. In actual fact the ratios are 0.958 for Earth and 0.903 for the Moon, with a difference of 5 and 10%. That means meteorites are <strong>1.043 times more likely to hit the equator than the pole on Earth</strong> and 1.11 times more likely on the Moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty certain you're reading it wrong. The ratio is 0.958 and it's a &quot;small deficiency&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm interpreting it wrong but doesn't it say the effect is less pronounced on the moon? ~5% of Earth's hits occur near the pole compared to ~10% of the moon's hits.</p>
<p>Edit: I interpreted it wrong. Kind of weird wording but the numbers make sense. On Earth, impacts at the poles are 5% less likely and on the moon they're 10% less likely.</p></div>		</li>
