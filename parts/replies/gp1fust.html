			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually felt it when lightning hit a lake I was in once. The storm had started causing some fairly big swells and someone trying to swim back to the boat was really struggling. Jumped in with a couple life jackets to help them. On the way back lightning struck, hard to judge distance but didn't seem crazy close. Felt a shock for sure though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mainly a concern at higher voltages (&gt;= 100V, especially AC), though you might manage to get a relatively bad shock at a slightly lower voltage if you douse yourself in very salty water.  ElectroBoom touched live 120V AC wires with dry skin and in that brief instant, less than 1 mA flowed between his fingers on one hand.  Though, the current steadily rose for those few seconds since the HV AC was &quot;breaking down&quot; the skin, reducing its resistance.  DC is much safer, though obviously will be dangerous at high enough of a voltage.</p></div>		</li>
