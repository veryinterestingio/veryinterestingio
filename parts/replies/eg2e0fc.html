			<div class="markdown"><p>There are prototypes, but it is difficult to get enough oxygen and to remove enough CO2 with that.</p>
<p>Most of the oxygen is recycled already, but the ISS needs the hydrogen from water to get rid of the CO2 (overall reaction: CO2 + 2 H2O -&gt; CH4 + 2 O2, the CH4 is released to space). The ISS has a nearly closed cycle for oxygen.</p>
<p>A system to convert methane to carbon and to recover the hydrogen would reduce the water demand of the station a lot already, and (nearly) close the loop for hydrogen as well.</p>
<p>After that the next step is to grow food with the CO2 produced by the astronauts - closing the loop for carbon as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CO2 and sunlight helps plants turn carbon into starches but the 02 the plants release comes from water, so you’d still need a lot of water for the plants unless maybe there’s some more efficient algae or something </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They successfully grow vegetables on the station as experiments. They have not begun studying using plants as a source of oxygen. The demand is just too high for the space they have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is at least in part how much space they'd need for the plants. </p>
<p>Imagine that it takes an extra 50 cubic yards of space station to grow any substantial part of an astronaut's diet. You have to move all that material to build it to orbit, plus the extra water/air/etc to make the system work. This means a bigger surface area of the station, and thus more maintenance, fuel, etc. </p>
<p>Whether there's a net benefit to it is questionable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they harvesting water from respiration, or I suppose, from urine? Or do they just truck it in? I wonder if they have fuel cells to supplement the solar power. That would produce some water if they do have them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not to my knowledge. They have batteries - they need them for the night side anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water being H2O so the O is 16 times the atomic mass of H. So in a water molecule 80% of the weight is the oxygen. Removing the hydrogen doesn’t save you much. And water is a lot easier to store and work with than compressed gas. You’d probably have more weight with the extra storage than you’d save.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen is difficult to store - you have to cool it down a lot or use a container that can hold a high pressure. Oxygen is a bit better but still difficult. Water is trivial to store.</p></div>		</li>
