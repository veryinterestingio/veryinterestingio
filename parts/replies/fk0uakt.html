<p>For the ML/AI space validation and experimental data are <em>crucial</em> and necessary for training the models. That is why I have the thesis that robotic experimentation connected to AI models will be very important in many modalities.</p>
<p>Of course basic fundamental physical chemistry measurement are crucial to understand the <em>mechanisms</em> that our molecules, materials and devices undergo which in turn inform the AI/ML models. </p>
<p>For small molecule quantum chemistry calculations though, quantum computing for quantum chemistry holds the promise of giving us <em>exact</em> answers as quantum computers come online:  <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00803" target="_blank">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00803</a></p>
<p>“More generally, what do you think AI and automation might do to fields of chemistry that are difficult/impossible to automate? Is this something you or your colleagues consider?”</p>
<p>How do you know the field is impossible to automate ? If a human does it what is the barrier to overcome to automate? Any automation can help in throughout.</p>
<p>Difficult I can take, impossible is a word that cannot be thrown lightly :) </p>
<p>Cheers and thanks for your questions </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you may be too busy to hold a conversation, but since you asked: </p>
<p>The nature of fundamental study seems to me to require an ability to question and refine the most basic assumptions of your models - something that to my knowledge we're not near automating. It would be a lot like trying to automate <em>your</em> work.</p>
<p>Could an AI identify that a discrepancy is due not to experimental error, but due to a fundamental misunderstanding baked into the model? One day maybe. In the meantime, some fields can benefit from automation more than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Together with Mario Krenn in my lab, as well as other co-authors we have been spending time trying to answer this question. We are very excited about it, and it is very hard to know how far an &quot;AI&quot;-system can go in helping scientists. We think that our jobs will always be safe. What scientists can do is gain insight from these models and find new &quot;laws&quot; or &quot;rules&quot; that give them insight. More than that? Happy to post here the preprint when we are ready. But this is indeed a fundamental question.</p></div>		</li>
