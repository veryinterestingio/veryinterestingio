			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: broken or unplugged panels are hotter than working panels, because more of the sun's energy stays in/on the panel instead of being converted into electricity. This can be easily observed by thermal cameras. The same is true of each cell within a panel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but I doubt it would be any more reliable than a voltage monitoring device attached to each panel. You might get false positives if a squirrel was sitting under the panel, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but getting enough of the panels in one shot is difficult because of the angles and the way rows overlap. It's usually done by drone, and has been done by airplane and ground-based vehicles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't this mean if we could ramp up the collection rate efficiency would go up?  Like with cooling (or other ways too) for instance?</p>
<p>A solar farm next to a running body of water could potentially use the water to cool the collectors for increased efficiency.</p>
<p>Like when we liquid cool our computers for increased benefits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct om the broken ones but incorrect on the unplugged. Hi...I work in solar. </p>
<p>Due to the current from making power heating up the wires, junction box and the silicon a module that is in the string and performing is always hotter than one which is not producing energy. Ill try and dig up a IR photo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry solarjunk, but that is absolutely not true. I spent years on a project where I personally took hundreds of thousands of thermal images of solar panels at some of the nation's largest solar plants with a variety of thermal cameras. I personally wrote the software that analyzed those images and could pick out the broken ones and the unplugged ones because they were both hotter than the surrounding modules. It then automatically generated reports of where each faulty module and string was. I promise you, unplugged and broken modules are hotter than the surrounding modules. Disclaimer: this only applies to photovoltaic solar modules. There's an example photo of a disconnected string in this pdf: <a href="https://thermalcapture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pv-system-inspection-thermal-drones-07-15-19.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://thermalcapture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pv-system-inspection-thermal-drones-07-15-19.pdf" target="_blank">https://thermalcapture.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pv-system-inspection-thermal-drones-07-15-19.pdf</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Panels heating up is even worse then just losing energy to heat - electrically panels lose in efficiency due to rise of module temperature, typically meaning at least 30% cut in max power output during 30°C summer day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wind is already doing that, panels on the roof get few degrees cooler the higher risen they are from the roof itself - of course this does not mean you get 20 degrees meter away from roof. But air movement between panels and roof cover (not flat roofs) means 3-5 degrees lower module temperature with each 5cm away from roof itself.</p>
<p>Without water cooling there is not much you can do to lower the summer working temperature below the typical 60+ degrees. And water cooling instalation would increase the price of whole system more then 30% lost on heat inefficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like they’re saying, “Gas engines are examples of efficient engines and they don’t get to 90% efficient.” There are much better examples of efficient engines than the ones we put in cars. For example, combined cycle gas turbines reach 50-60%.</p></div>		</li>
