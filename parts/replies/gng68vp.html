<p>What if I don't want new features. 95% of Adobe's Photoshop user base would be able to get their work done on PS CS4. Having yearly updates is borderline irrelevant for the vast majority of users.</p>
<p>I should have the option to buy a 5- to 10-year old product for a single one-time fee, <em>OR</em> the option to subscribe to the newer version with regular updates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But presumably you wanted to have an up to date system. </p>
<p>It would be nice to have the option but Adobe would rather just have one (more profitable) model.</p></div>		</li>
