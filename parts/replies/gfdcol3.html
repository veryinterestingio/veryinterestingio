			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. The other one currently at the top doesn't cover that there's different chemicals being released in the body during the different activities, and that those can play a role in damage to the heart and body. </p>
<p>You can even die from overwhelming stress from you heart being paralyzed or being weakened and just end up ballooning out, or getting hernias. It can mess with your nervous system and brain, and just a lot of things in your body in general. It's not just cortisol either, but basically stress is bad, damaging chemicals, especially over time, but exercise is good.... Well depending on your body. Some people it can be harmful too and you have to be careful with what you do.</p>
<p>Some people have conditions that cause an exercise intolerance and can freak out their heart or cause exhaustion and pain, or all kinds of other conditions (how'd you like to feel like you have the flu every time you exercise? Or get nasty rashes and hives, bleeding, pressure on your ear drums that could cause deafness, increased pressure on your brain, etc kind of problems that people can get. Bodies are weird and annoying). So even &quot;good stress&quot; can still end up causing problems and there needs to be work-arounds for what they can or can't do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oh goodness, no idea! I know the other stuff only because I teach stress management tools to teens so I researched it for that lesson/presentation. I am otherwise the least scientifically-minded person imaginable, but it's a question I'd love to hear answered (I'm guessing they would have better skills at calming their nervous systems and staying focused just because of their physical and mental experience training)</p></div>		</li>
