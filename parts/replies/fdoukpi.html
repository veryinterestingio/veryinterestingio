<p>EDIT: A thank you to all the responses. I don't know much about planes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ocean is so big and deep that even with that they still just don't know where to even go to look for the signal.</p>
<p>Look up how far down under the water the titanic was. It took 73 years to find. It was 2 and half miles below the surface. Drive your car 60 miles an hour for 150 seconds. That's how far from the <em>surface</em> the titanic is. And MH370 is deeper than that, they think.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>would it be possible that instead of always transmitting the signal, it only transmits it when it receives another signal? That way it could save battery and last longer</p>
<p>then the places youre using to look for it instead have a box that transmits the signal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have that. They also have underwater locator beacons as well. They're battery powered though so eventually run out of battery.</p>
<p>Also, black boxes are a misnomer, they're bright orange and quite visible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MH370 had a satellite link with some of the parameters being streamed. This got turned off.</p>
<p>As for this latest 'incident', there is a big chance that if it was an explosion that the satellite link would have been cut at the same time. The shock itself would have most likelly dealigned the antenna, making it unable to transmit. Plus, the airplane exploded! It's not like the front fell off...</p>
<p>So, what would be the real purpose? When the airplane have issues and crash in a remote location, unaccessible... That happen what... Once per 15-20 years? It is not worth the billions of dollars.</p></div>		</li>
