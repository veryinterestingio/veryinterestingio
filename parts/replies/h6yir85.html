			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, I believe this can also start desertification and mass erosion given the right circumstances. If your climate is already fairly arid, then removing all vegetation in such regular intervals could remove much of the root protection against erosion and desertification. Once either of those processes start, they're fairly difficult to reverse.</p>
<p>I may be misremembering this, but it was from a conversation with a parks guy about why we don't have more firebreaks than just the ones near semi-rural areas.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many large animal and tree species require large tracts of dense forest to thrive. These forest edges create small, but potentially critical differences in climate and environment that can be detrimental to those &quot;deep forest&quot; species: for example, light, wind, and temperature can enter the forest horizontally, new species can establish themselves along the new edges and start to encroach into the forest and outcompete established species, and the breaks can hinder migration throughout the forest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. Suburbs cause the same effect, creating lots of edge habitat while destroying deep forest. That is why deer populations are at record highs, being higher than when only 2 million people in North America, while wolves essentially dont exist any more.</p></div>		</li>
