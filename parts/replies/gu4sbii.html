			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. You can even miss oxygen and not even realize it, just fading into delusion, confusion, hallucinations and death. Look up space/flight/diver training for low oxygen emergency training. Always put on your oxygen mask before others, it happens FAST!</p>
<p>Tried inhaling co2 from empty sodastream bottle with only carbondioxide as a youngster and the experience was instant &quot;need to breath&quot;-reaction, even though oxygen was plenty</p></div>		</li>

<hr />
<p>This Smarter Every Day video about why you should put your own oxygen mask on first in case of an airplane emergency has a chilling demonstration of what oxygen deprivation without the CO2 buildup looks like: <a href="https://youtu.be/kUfF2MTnqAw" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/kUfF2MTnqAw</a></p>
<p>It's terrifying. This <em>very</em> intelligent, competent, and capable man becomes unable to take a quick 5 second action - putting on his oxygen mask - to save his life after just a few minutes in a low oxygen environment.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>And you have ten times as long at the altitude he was simulating vs. in a passenger jet.  If you were suddenly transported to 35,000 feet, you've got <em>at the absolute best</em> 30 seconds before you are unable to save your own life.  You aren't just using up the oxygen in your blood, it's <em>actively leaving your body</em> through your lungs and other membranes.  Holding your breath doesn't help; the oxygen would rather be in the empty space in your lungs than in your blood.  </p>
<p>On top of that, you're in crisis mode.  Your heart is beating faster and you're burning more oxygen.  If you're struggling to do something, you're burning <em>even more</em> oxygen in your muscles.  You should expect 15 seconds of understanding that you're even in danger.  In the case of a sudden decompression like he showed, the fog created by the drop in pressure will obscure vision for up to several seconds.  Your eyes might water and you might shut them reflexively.  You're almost guaranteed to burn precious seconds in shock before you see the masks.  If you take ten seconds to shut your eyes and try to collect yourself, that might be too long.</p>
<p>Even if you're 100% prepared, the worst case scenario will block your vision.  By the time you can see your mask and understand what to do, you might have just ten seconds to get your mask secured.  Imagine if the person next to you panics and tries to grab you like a drowning person might.  You need your mask on and your wits with you, because if they delay you by ten seconds you may forget what you're doing in the middle of pulling the straps tight.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_decompression" target="_blank">Only a few thousand people have experienced unintentional decompression events</a>.  This is less important than lightning safety, putting a drunk person in the recovery position, and choking first aid.  It's exceedingly unlikely you will ever, ever use this information.  Still, knowing that you <strong>need</strong> to put on your mask first is the difference between life and death.  You can be revived after minutes; your kids will be absolutely unharmed if you take three minutes to get their masks on.  If you take more than fifteen seconds to get your mask on, you're dead.  If your kids needed your help, they're dead too.  Nobody will be able to help you.  People will watch you die, helplessly, from a few feet away, too afraid to unbuckle their seatbelt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partial pressure: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure</a></p>
<p>When you hold your breath, you're just slowly using up the oxygen in your blood while you slowly build up corresponding CO2. When you breathe in low-pressure or deoxygenated gas, you're still using oxygen, but that oxygen is also generously diffusing into whatever it is you're breathing in and out—diffusing at potentially a very fast rate. You basically exchange a bunch of oxygen for not-oxygen at a rate dependent on what's entering your lungs.</p>
<p>Combine that with our warning sensations coming from CO2 increase and not O2 decrease and you can go from normal to unconscious to dead in the span of a few breaths without even realizing what's going on. It's scary, but it's certainly not the worst way to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an aside, blood pH is very sensitive in both directions. Not only does our body experience distress with too much CO2, but also not enough (proportionally)! When we hyperventilate, we are clearing too much CO2 and experience feeling hot, light-headed/dizzy, sense of unreality, tingling. This is what happens with panic attacks: feel “short of breath” (due to fight-or-flight response, not actually short of breath though) and over-breathe to compensate, which leads to worse symptoms and worse anxiety. Boom, panic. Pace breathing to prevent hyperventilating and panic passes faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you timetravelled to a time when there was less carbon dioxide in the air would you hyperventilate because your brain thinks you aren't getting enough air? Would you die quickly from too much oxygen? </p>
<p>A friend of mine once told me he thought we would and I've wondered ever since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is about 0.04% CO2 in the air currently, compared to about 4% CO2 in your exhaled breath (100x difference).  If the air instead had 0.02% CO2, you probably wouldn't notice a difference because the atmospheric concentration is essentially negligible compared to breath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it’s the other way around, if there is high co2 in the air then you would hyperventilate to try to remove the co2/acid from your blood. You would probably develop hypercapnic (high co2) respiratory failure if it was significantly higher than we can tolerate. If it was just a bit higher, then your body may be able to adapt over time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>we will breathe slower. C02 goes into and out of the bloodstream by diffusion. So lower oxygen levels in air, will mean more Co2 is able to diffuse out of bloodstream into air in the lungs. if more CO2 is leaving the bloodstream naturally, we have less need to aggressively get rid of C02.  so breathing slows.</p>
<p>Remember, breathing is about getting rid of CO2 (bringing in O2 is just a side effect). Quick breathing is way to get rid of C02 quicker. C02 diffusion happens near instantly in the lungs. so if you have excesss Co2 in your blood, the more quickly you can get low Co2 air near the blood, the more Co2 you are able to evacuate from the blood. thats why we breathe faster. so if we are in a low Co2 environment where we are able to evacuate more CO2 from the blood with each breath, we will need to breathe less often.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Transporting Oxygen and co2 in blood are 2 different processes. CO2 gets in and out of the blood by diffusion (i.e it just happens, it goes from where it is high to where it is low, kinda like a wheel naturally rolls downhill). so CO2 levels have a real effect on blood. it affects the ph, think of CO2 as being a weak acid when in  aqueous i.e water-based fluids.</p>
<p>Transporting oxygen OTOH is a biologic process. Oxygen, unlike CO2 can't just &quot;float&quot; around freely in your blood (bad things will happen), we therefore need special delivery trucks for oxygen (hemoglobin), and it takes time to load oxygen at the lungs and unload Oxygen at the cells that need them .</p>
<p>why does this matter to breathing. Breathing quickly, affects C02 ( a pure diffusion process that happens near instantly), but has little effect on O2 levels ( you still need to load the carriers, breathing faster won't necessarily make the loading process happen faster)</p></div>		</li>
