			<div class="markdown"><p>Won't there also be massive radiation that damages satellites and planes, which are not protected as much by the Earth's magnetic field? Considering how much of our important technology relies on satellites, and how difficult repairing and protecting them is, it seems like a big threat. And even if our small devices won't be directly damaged, along with power grids damage may be caused to long-distance telecommunications will make many critical devices useless too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a different issue.  Satellites are not protected from X-rays emitted by solar flares, because they're not in Earth's atmosphere.  There are two types of problems coming from solar flares: Radiation and geomagnetic storms.  </p>
<p>Radiation happens instantly at the same time as the flare happens.  X-rays travel at the speed of light towards Earth, reaching us in about 8 minutes.  Those X-rays are harmful to satellites and radio communications on Earth, which is how they would affect aircraft who rely on both for navigation.  However, that radiation is absorbed before is reaches the surface and wipes out your cell phone.  Only electronics that are in space can be directly wiped out by solar flares, but that happens because of X-rays, not inductance.</p>
<p>Geomagnetic storms happen due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs).  CMEs happen when a solar flare violently ejects plasma from The Sun into space.  That plasma takes several days to reach us, but is what causes the disruption in power grids.  The plasma pushes the Earth's magnetic field and thus causes these induced currents in power lines, because we now have a magnetic field that is moving relative to the cables in our power grid.  The effect of the pushing of Earth's atmosphere causes a geomagnetic storm, which is also what causes the aurorae at the poles when that plasma concentrates at the ends of Earth's magnetic field and causes the atmosphere to emit light.</p>
<p>It's not that these flares aren't disruptive.  They definitely are.  My complaint is that the media has misrepresented those effects for views and likes.  There is a very real threat to our satellites and power grids.  That will cause a lot of problems for us, but we <em>can</em> get the grid back online, probably after several months or years, and our devices will work again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, which is why the prepper people do have a decent point. If a massive chunk of our countries power grid is fucked for years it would get real rough, really fast.</p></div>		</li>
