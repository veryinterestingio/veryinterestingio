			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact, Mercedes have developed a system for their cars that will play a very loud white noise over the sound system when it detects you are about to be in an accident. Vehicle collisions are incredibly loud, but by playing that loud white noise shortly before a collision your ears will do exactly what you stated here and be more prepared for the collision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always think this is a cool idea and then I think... if they can detect that you're about to be in an accident, aren't there better things they could be doing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other systems in the car do everything they can to keep you from getting in an accident, braking when someone pulls out in front of you or you aren't paying attention for example. But there are times where it's just inevitable, like getting t boned or someone pulling out in front of you in a manner that is just unpredictable. In those instances the car does whatever it can to minimize the damage, in this case that includes damage to your hearing from the monstrous cacophony produced by a car collision.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought a bunch of ear plugs a while back for something unrelated to this. I figured since I had so many I'd wear a pair while mowing the lawn to see how it is (and I wouldn't have to worry about sweat like I would with my larger ear muffs).  </p>
<p>I had no idea how bad the noise level was until after I finished mowing the lawn and noticed how much better I felt than I normally do after that. It really makes a big difference so now I wear them every time I mow the lawn (and now that Autumn is here and I'll be using the leaf blower more I'll be keeping my ear muffs handy for that).</p></div>		</li>
