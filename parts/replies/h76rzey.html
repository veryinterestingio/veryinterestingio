			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with you on the &quot;they could potentially be anywhere on any surface at any angle,&quot; but I'd like to add that they could be on no surface at all.</p>
<p>A friend of mine who didn't understand my fear of spiders thought it was so unlikely that a spider would/could drop down on a silk thread from directly above a person that it (in his mind) had effectively never happened in human history and chalked the story of every instance of that happening to me to me up to being dramatic and lying or making shit up. (It's happened 3 times since I was a kid, always in the bathroom, always in front of a mirror - which is how I discovered the impending attack, twice in the same bathroom on separate occasions).</p>
<p>The same friend also thought it was equally improbable that any spider had ever slung a web (to crawl along it to travel to a surface not attached to the surface they're coming from) in such a manner that it had ever stuck to a person as they were sitting. So my tales of having had a spider sling a web that landed dead center on my forehead and then only discover them as I notice a dot with legs crawling in an imperceptible direction, either directly toward my face or directly away from it, at an imperceptible distance (depth perception will really screw with you when all you've got to focus on is a previously unnoticed black dot, the diameter of a pinhead, but with legs) sounded like total bullshit to him. It's happened to me several times since I was a kid.</p>
<p>It wasn't until that friend saw that happen in our dining room while a bunch of friends were seated around the table playing games, that he thought there might have been something to my stories.</p>
<p>So to the other arachnophobes out there who've just been horrified by these stories, I'm sorry. I (obviously) feel you.</p>
<p>To the other people around us who make fun of us or give us shit about it..... Fuck off with the judgement and believe us for a damn minute, k?</p></div>		</li>
