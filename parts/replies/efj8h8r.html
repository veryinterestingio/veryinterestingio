			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes in British English we drop the 'the' when the reason you are going to the place is for its primary function i.e sick/hospital, convicted/prison. If we were visiting a person in the hospital or prison, we would include 'the'.</p>
<p>EDIT: Rarely are there language rules without exceptions. It is possible that the hospital/school/prison fall without 'the' because the visitor becomes something else while there i.e., patient, pupil, prisoner - whereas they do not when going to the pub/gym/store etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting.  In the US we do that with prison, but not hospital. </p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to prison&quot; implies you are getting locked up for a crime.  &quot;I'm going to the prison&quot; just means you are going to be at the physical location, and kind of implies that it's not because of a crime. </p>
<p>But we don't do the same for hospital, wonder why that is. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's odd.</p>
<p>As an Aussie, I used to say &quot;I was in hospital&quot; when I was a patient, vs &quot;I was at the hospital&quot; when I was a visitor.</p>
<p>I think it's because &quot;in hospital&quot; implies receiving treatment whereas &quot;at the hospital&quot; implies just physically being there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's because &quot;prison&quot; is an activity AND a physical place. Hospital is just a physical place. So, &quot;going to prison&quot; and &quot;going to the prison&quot; don't necessarily mean the same thing. &quot;Hospital&quot; isn't an activity... &quot;I'm going to surgery&quot; or &quot;I'm going to chemotherapy&quot; works, but &quot;I'm going to hospital&quot; doesn't. Same with school - &quot;I'm going to school&quot; means the activity of being a student, &quot;I'm going to the school&quot; means going to the physical place. That's why you can say &quot;I'm going to school&quot; when you're taking an online class, but a teacher would say &quot;I'm going to work&quot; or &quot;I'm going to the school&quot;, not &quot;I'm going to school.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because if we don't really talk about going to stay in the hospital. As an in patient. We assume that it's a temporary trip, and so we go to the hospital to leave the same day, we never become a permanent or pseudo permanent resident. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing happens in US English for certain nouns. I think that happens when it doesn't matter which specific location/building you're talking about.</p>
<p>You could say &quot;I'm going to <strong>the</strong> prison&quot; if you have a certain prison in mind. But saying &quot;I'm going to prison&quot; is just about the concept of being locked up/imprisoned. It does not imply a specific building.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a justification for why Americans say they will write their friend instead of write <strong>to</strong> their friend? It’s not actually correct right? Just a local kind of slang?</p>
<p>Because if asked you to type your dad, it goes like this:</p>
<p>Your dad</p>
<p>If I asked you to write your dad it should be the same thing but with writing, not writing a letter to someone.</p></div>		</li>
