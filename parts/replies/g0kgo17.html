			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Learning Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) can help a lot. Check out some workbooks online (there are tons) or the Mind Over Mood book. There’s also some subs on reddit. Can’t check at the moment to link you, sorry!</p></div>		</li>

<p>So you acknowledge and accept the feeling consciously, and it seems to fade then...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try writing things down, like in a journal. I was having a hard time not long ago and just wrote down everything that was bothering me. Afterwards, it felt like my brain was emptied of all these negative feelings. The problems in my life were still there of course, but my feelings toward them felt more manageable once I wrote it all down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good point. Not one I like to engage in but it definitely works when I’ve done it. I think avoiding the negative thoughts exacerbates them and they come back with a vengeance through my subconscious. Then I can’t sleep, eating issues start, it snowballs from there. Thanks for your help!</p></div>		</li>

<p>But yes, total non judgemental acceptance of the feeling is the key. Distracting ourselfs from it is the worst thing we can do. Lets say youre feeling lonely (or whatever), our mind usually rushes throught ways to &quot;get away from it&quot;. We start to think about ways to not think about it (makes no sense), or things to do, wich of course does nothing. Best thing to do? Sit with that feeling. Dont think about that feel, just feel it in your body.</p>
<p>Questions that always help me:</p>
<p>-&quot;Can i accept this feeling, even if it never goes away?&quot;</p>
<p>I found most of the time you can answear yes to this. But you gotta be honest with yourself. If the answear is &quot;no, i can't&quot;, then it means you have a second feeling attached to that first one. Example: lets say youre feeling guilty of your shortcomings, and youre trying to let go but cant, maybe youre feeling ashamed of the guilt, or you might be angry that you feel guilt, or maybe youre afraid of what happens if you let it go. In this case you need to let go of the underlaying feeling first, before processing that guilt.</p>
<p>Then you proceed to the next question:</p>
<p>-&quot;Can i let go of this feeling if i choose to do so?&quot;</p>
<p>Yea, theres nothing holding it in anymore, you felt it, learned from it, it serves no purpose now. Its about surrender, not in the sense of giving up, but just giving in to the reality of what is, without any judgement.</p>
<p>-&quot;Will I surrender to it and let i go?&quot;</p>
<p>To me the answear to this was usually a &quot;fuck yeah&quot; accompanied by tears, a smile and goosebumps. By this point you can feel its energy dissipating already. It actually feels like taking an emotional dump.</p>
<p>It sounds daunting at first, but with time and practice it actually becomes sorta automatic, like breathing (took me around 3 months or so). Now youre letting go of stuff all the time, just strolling around and &quot;oops i just let go of something, dont even know what&quot;, its pretty weird but super intuitive.</p>
<p>Just know that we carry a looooot of baggage, more than we think. I started doing this a year and a half ago and even tho i feel amazing now, i still find myself getting somewhat triggered by stuff that reminds me of my traumas. When that happends i take some time to acknowledge it and consciously let it go. Just keep opening that pressure valve until its all released. So some things you can let go in an instant, others will take time (youll still feel better about it everytime you do it), dont be discouraged.</p>
<p>This was a life changer for me, i absolutely hated myself, I literally could not look myself at the mirror without feeling hatred, now i smile everytime i do. And honestly, my life didnt change all that much, so its not about your life situation, just about how you deal with it.</p>
<p>I hope this helps, been a year and a half since i read it and im starting to forget things. I know how horrible intrusive thoughts are, how desperate it makes you feel, how real the &quot;id rather be dead&quot; thought seems to be. I thought i was going mad at one point. But in fact thoughts have no weight at all, when you deal with the feelings the accompanying thoughts completely dissipate with it.</p>
<p>Feel free to PM me anything at all. Cheers friend!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just a normal boy</p>
<p>That sank when I fell overboard</p>
<p>My ship would leave the country</p>
<p>But I'd rather swim ashore</p>
<p>Without a life that's sadly stuck again</p>
<p>Wish I was much more masculine</p>
<p>Maybe then I could learn to swim</p>
<p>Like (fourteen miles away)</p>
<p>Now floating up and down</p>
<p>I spin, colliding into sound</p>
<p>Like whales beneath me diving down</p>
<p>I'm sinking to the bottom of my</p>
<p>Everything that freaks me out</p>
<p>The lighthouse beam has just run out</p>
<p>I'm cold as cold as cold can be
Be</p>
<p>I want to swim away but don't know how</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean</p>
<p>Let the waves up and take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion</p>
<p>Let the rain of what I feel right now come down</p>
<p>Let the rain come down</p>
<p>Where is the coast guard?</p>
<p>I keep looking each direction</p>
<p>For a spotlight give me something</p>
<p>I need something for protection</p>
<p>Maybe flotsam junk will do just fine</p>
<p>The jets; I'm sunk; I'm left behind</p>
<p>I'm treading for my life, believe me</p>
<p>(How can I keep up this breathing?)</p>
<p>Not knowing how to think</p>
<p>I scream aloud, begin to sink</p>
<p>My legs and arms are broken down</p>
<p>With envy for the solid ground</p>
<p>I'm reaching for the life within me</p>
<p>How can one man stop his ending?</p>
<p>I thought of just your face</p>
<p>Relaxed, and floated into space</p>
<p>I want to swim away but don't know how</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean</p>
<p>Let the waves up and take me down</p>
<p>Let the hurricane set in motion</p>
<p>Let the rain of what I feel right now come down</p>
<p>Let the rain come down</p>
<p>Now waking to the sun</p>
<p>I calculate what I had done</p>
<p>Like jumping from the bow, yeah</p>
<p>Just to prove that I knew how, yeah</p>
<p>It's midnight's late reminder of</p>
<p>The loss of her, the one I love</p>
<p>My will to quickly end it all</p>
<p>So thought no end my need to fall</p>
<p>Into the ocean, end it all</p>
