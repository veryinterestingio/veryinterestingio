			<div class="markdown"><p>This the energetic side of the argument, but you should also be careful not to ignore the second half of the equation the entropic argument.  Keep in mind phase equilibria (boiling points, freezing points, etc.) is dependent on both since the free energy is what drives it. </p>
<p>HBr has entropy working against it  In the case of the liquid because polar species tend to have a higher degree of ordering compared to non-polar species. This intrinsically means they have lower entropy. In the case of HBr you have incredibly weak polar bonds AND lower entropy. </p>
<p>HBr has to line up like this to maintain proper polar bonds.</p>
<p>H-Br ---- H-Br ---- H-Br ---- H-Br</p>
<p>Where as Br-Br can rotate in pretty much what ever direct it wants because London forces tend to be more dependent on distance instead of rotational orientation and both sides of the molecule are equivalent.</p>
<p>This is the same case in something like water, but the difference there is the hydrogen bonds are very very strong so the loss in entropy is offset by a huge gain in energy.  HBr's weak bonds aren't enough to offset the loss in entropy. </p>
<p>As such Br2 actually has a higher liquid entropy than HBr.   A higher gap between the gas and liquid entropy tends to drop the boiling temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> So I was actually curious how much energy vs entropy matters for this particular species. I couldn't find all the info for HBr, but I could find it for HCl and Cl2.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nuclear-power.net/chlorine-specific-heat-latent-heat-vaporization-fusion/" target="_blank">https://www.nuclear-power.net/chlorine-specific-heat-latent-heat-vaporization-fusion/</a></p>
<p>Heat of Vaporization Cl2: 10.2 kJ/mol</p>
<p>Heat of Vaporization HCl: 16.2 kJ/mol</p>
<p>Boiling Point Cl2: 238K</p>
<p>Boiling Point HCl: 188K</p>
<p>So actually when it comes to HCl the heat of vaporization is still higher for HCl gas than Cl2.  Yet Cl2 has the higher boiling point.  Which seems to imply it is almost entirely driven by entropy.  I want to double check the numbers I found for accuracy though.</p>
<p>So if this is indeed true for HCl then HBr may also have the same trend. So energy may have absolutely nothing to do with it. In fact the vaporization energy would predict the opposite trend.  So energetic explanations are not correct at all if HBr and Br2 follow the same trend.</p>
<p>In other words the phrase: Br2 has stronger bonds than HBr is in all likelihood not correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more that it's chemistry trivia.  Kind of like how I can't tell you the energy difference between two peaks in methanol that were split via tunneling even though the value exists in the literature and the theory to do such a thing is well known.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be the first time I've done phase equilibria on HCl and HBr specifically.   The principles are the same as many other compounds, but unless you know the exact values (in this case I didn't know the heat of vaporization and the respective boiling points) you can't predict the source of the behavior properly.</p>
<p>It's similar to if you were to ask me if your car could pull a truck trailer. I would need to know what kind of car it is to be able to guess if it had enough horse power.  Knowing that the car is a truck versus a compact car matters a lot.</p></div>		</li>
