			<div class="markdown"><p>Did this imply that there is a hypothetical &quot;crushed asteroid belt&quot; floating at their buoyancy level in the atmosphere from the presumed myriad that have crashed into the planet? If A LOT of asteroids fell in would it form a shell or crust layer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My knowledge on the subject is very limited, so you might want to check back on my comment later to see if someone has corrected me. But afaik the Jovian atmosphere is not just very dense, but the pressure also creates immense heat. My guess is any impacting asteroids or comets would dissolve and the substances they consist of would float/sink to their appropriate level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd assume most would burn up like they do on Earth, asteroids would need to be massive enough to be slowed down to a halt inside the planet by drag forces before the drag forces burn them up. And then, how massive would that need to be? Maybe so massive it would basically displace a good chunk of the planet with its sheer size? Or maybe not, but this math is way above my pay grade, but I think one can safely assume there's bound to be at least some small-ish asteroid debris floating inside a gas giant. Interesting take tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, aside from the fact the pressure'd kill you - if you got out of your craft, presumably you'd float at a different level to the craft (I want to say higher?) and would be unable to return to it, being left to swim through the gas around you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presumably! It’s hard to say the effect the intense gravity would have in counteracting the buoyancy, but my gut says humans would float a bit higher too. Just like submarines, though, there’s probably some tricks to get the craft to float at the right level so you don’t get left behind after an EVA.</p></div>		</li>
