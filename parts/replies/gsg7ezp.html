			<div class="markdown"><p>Not my area of expertise, but wouldn't a different speed of light have far reaching consequences considering its relationship to the other fundamental constants like mu naught, epsilon naught, Planck's constant, the fine structure constant, and the fundamental charge?  A universe with a much different speed of light would be a very different place than we inhabit now, would it not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do all fundamentals being variable seem less plausible that one fundamental being variable?</p>
<p>I know that as far as we know the six constants are unchanging, but could there be a system where they all scale in a manner where we have essentially the same macrophysics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not? But given the current constant values; how would we be able to demonstrate or falsify this thought?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, we have a <em>lot</em> of physical constants, but they can often be expressed as mixtures of each other, like how the speed of light relates to the electric and magnetic constants as you say.</p>
<p>Theorists often are more concerned with the 'dimensionless' constants, which can be treated as the independent values that the other constants can be constructed from. Still, many of the 'dimensional' constants, like the gravitational constant G, Planck's constant, and the speed of light are just so convenient to work with that people use them instead- but finding a time dependence in them is actually equivalent to something deeper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s important to note that the speed of light is actually the speed of information, literally the maximum rate at which any information can be transferred, in any form.  It is also the minimum possible speed that massless objects, such as photons can travel (in a vacuum).   I think when phrased that way, any tweaks to that constant would affect the universe at a fundamental level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Causality is also a good way to explain it. You can't have causality or information without the other, and you can't have either without a means of transmitting it from one place to another.  I think for (all?) practical purposes, light is that means - but gravity waves do the same thing for impractical (so far) purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically Would the variable speed be wildly different or would it just be a few mph different? I could imagine even a difference of less then 1% would make for huge difference on a cosmic scale .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, any change would have to be relatively small, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.063526" target="_blank">this paper claims</a> it can't be more than a few percent different going as far back as the CMB, when the universe was about 300,000 years old, otherwise observations would be noticeably different.</p>
<p>It's one of those things that's hard to really 'prove' - we can only really put constraints to say 'it can't be any bigger or different than this small amount,' but maybe any change is just so small we haven't detected yet? Most cosmologists are satisfied to think the fundamental constants are really constant, but since we're scientists we actually have to check.</p></div>		</li>
