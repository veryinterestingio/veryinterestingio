			<div class="markdown"><p>I get where you're coming from.  &quot;Advantages are selected for, so things that have evolved must be advantageous.&quot;  But that doesn't actually follow logically. The trick is that things can have evolved without being advantageous. &quot;Genetic drift&quot; is an example. </p>
<p>In logic-speak, you took the statement A-&gt;B, given B, and concluded A.  It's a mistake we all make, one that SEEMS like it makes sense, but unfortunately does not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe too aggressive males were taken out or just often died in feat of battle. While the more stable males played the “the grey man” role. Of sticking in the middle of the battle group and not sticking out too much. In military special operations training, you don’t want to stick out. You want to blend in, the instructors will make life hell for everybody, but if you just seem to keep coming up on their radar for whatever reason, good or bad, they will call you to do extra push ups, extra sprints, just because they feel like it. It’s a random process and you would think being a stud is a good thing. But, more attention in warfare is never a good thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you certain the neuroscientist meant that as a takeaway for all somatic cells, and not just the nervous system?  </p>
<p>Inside the blood brain barrier, androgens get converted to estrogen, so there is a lot of estrogen in the male brain.  As such, changes in hormone levels aren't going to be as large percentage-wise.  But I haven't heard of a sex difference in cell's responsiveness to hormones outside of the nervous system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! The discussion was definitely about gender differences in the brain so maybe his research does not apply to this discussion at all...</p>
<p>(Still, even if I my post was completely off-base I got my first reddit silver! I really just wanted to start discussion and give a chance for a neuroscientist to chime in.)</p></div>		</li>
