			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the coffee left in the cup will have a higher concentration than before. However, drinking it would be the same as drinking the original cup of coffee</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except for the amount of water consumed, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't there be a possibility of the water vapor carrying part of the soluble components (i.e. caffeine, flavor compounds) along with it, while leaving the suspended particles behind? Do vapor physics allow such a thing, even if the boiling point of individual compounds is not reached?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water vapor won't carry it, but any volatile compound that boils off can be collected (together or separately) along with the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge no, but chemistry is not my expertise. Salt, for example, is very water soluble....yet you can boil salt water and get purified water. It <em>should</em> work the same with other water soluble components. In essence, water soluble just means it dissolves easily in water, by doing this it forms very strong chemical bonds with the water that are difficult to break. One of the ways <em>to</em> break them is through heat / thermal distillation.  </p>
<p>But if anyone knows any different, do correct me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because it's not small bits of liquid water floating off (which could contain the solute), but individual gas molecules. Only compounds that evaporate at or below the same temperature as water could go along with it.</p></div>		</li>
