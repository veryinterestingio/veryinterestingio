			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with major depression I would have a lot of questions how any of it is defined, especially &quot;suicidal thoughts&quot;</p>
<p>I've ranged from &quot;wish I was dead&quot; to &quot;really really want to be dead but not by killing myself&quot; to &quot;what if I just did 100mph and ran into an embankment&quot; to &quot;things would be easier for everyone if I was dead&quot;, to lazily cutting my wrists, etc.</p>
<p>Through different amounts of seriousness of my desire to be dead I would wonder what level it takes to be considered a serious desire to commit suicide.</p>
<p>edit: in case anyone wonders I tried medications on and off for the past 4 years (giving each time to work). Taking them was almost more frustrating than the depression at times and at others actually exacerbated it due to the ED effects of most of them. After 4 years of trial and error I got one that seems to work for me and it's a night and day difference. Occasionally if stressed/busy I can forget to take it for a day or two and I can tell after 2 days missed that SOMETHING is off, and then I remember I missed my meds.</p>
<p>NOTE - Many have been DMing me asking about the medication that helped me. I'm not a doctor and can only give my experiences. I can't promise anything will work better than another. For people not taking any meds please talk to a doctor or psychiatrist and don't try to get anything online. It's almost always fake and/or dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, &quot;suicidal thoughts&quot; is very broad. Basically everyone at some point in their life might have the thought of &quot;what would it be like if I weren't here&quot; and it's pretty common to feel tired of life. This study uses the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression, a very good measure. The suicide sub scale on this measure has 5 scores: 0) absent, 1) feeling that life is not worth living 2) wishing one was dead 3) suicidal ideas or gestures (I assume meaning having a plan or making preparations) 4) suicide attempt. Generally, when assessing for suicide there are several factors that are most relevant. 1) is it active or passive e.g. does someone just feel like life isn't worth living or wishes they would not wake up (also referred to as death ideation), or do they actively want to kill themselves. 2) does the person want to die? Not everyone who is suicidal wants to die, some just feel that death is the only way out. 3) is there a plan? 4) how realistic and feasible is this plan, do they have the means readily available to them? 5) is the person future oriented and do they have things to live for (from their perspective. I hope this is helpful for you in understanding some of the nuances in suicidality severity from the clinicians perspective.</p>

<p>That seems to make sense if you're considering something like asphyxiation by gas, where there's all sorts of materials and preparation to do. But what about swerving your car or jumping off of or in front of something? At least one of those is realistic, feasible, and available to virtually everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe having a plan is considered to be just a degree below actually attempting it.  Like in my state if you have a plan and the means, a doctor can hold you against your will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a pediatrician, I only have information about teens/children, not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for:  &quot;Over 28% of adolescents report depressive symptoms every day for 2 or more weeks that caused them to stop doing usual activities in the past year, and 7.8% had attempted suicide.&quot;   </p>
<p>Eaton DK, Kann L, Kinchen S, et al. Youth risk behavior surveillance - United States, 2011. Morbidity and mortality weekly report Surveillance summaries 2012;61:1-162. </p>
<p>Also in the Effectiveness of a Quality Improvement Intervention for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care ClinicsA Randomized Controlled Trial ( <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/200194" target="_blank"><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/200194" target="_blank">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/200194</a></a> ) 43% of the kids were depressed and &quot; 27% reported suicidal ideation,<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/200194#REF-JOC41972-60" target="_blank">60</a> and 13% reported suicide attempts or deliberate self-harm (defined as some suicidal ideation plus some suicide attempt or deliberate self-harm during the previous 6 months on the Youth Self Report)&quot;  </p>
<p>Clearly there are some depressed kids who are not suicidal, and some suicidal kids who haven't received diagnoses of depression, but I think the latter is lower.  So maybe a safe estimate based on the above trial is 20% of depressed adolescents are also suicidal?  </p>

<p>What is that 7.8% referring to? All adolescents in the US? And is it &quot;in the past year&quot; like the first half of the sentence or over their lifetime? 1 in 13 US teens/children having attempted suicide seems crazy high to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kay Jamison's Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide says the following... </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>looking worldwide, and despite varied views of what constitutes suicide, 1-4% of all adults reported having attempted suicide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adolescents have more variable rates depending on location, between 2-10% have tried to kill themselves, with many making more than one attempt (so depending on the study 7.8% likely refers to all adolescents, which is a very sobering statistic)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why there's a disparity between age groups is unclear, but studies suggest people have a tendency to forget or minimize attempts</p>
</li>
<li>ex, an Australian study showed that 40% of people who had acknowledge having had suicidal thoughts (ideation) at one point in their lives, when followed up with four years later, denied ever having suicidal thoughts</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point the book will be 20 years old, but they haven't released a new edition, so I'm assuming she hasn't felt there's a need...</p>
<p>There's 100 pages of citations so I didn't dig out the studies mentioned above but I can if you'd like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I didn't know there was a granular model of suicidal thoughts. Usually I've always seen it as not at all or &quot;I'm gonna do it.&quot; That perception makes it hard for people lower on the scale to discuss it with a professional because they're worried about an overreaction. (Me included)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, accurate assessment of suicide risk is (and should be) highly granular, taking into account patient specific factors as well as overall demographic factors, in order to come to an accurate assessment of the risk a patient presents to themselves.</p></div>		</li>
