<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYoQnFFnr-0" target="_blank">here's</a> a video of them running at full speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was working in NYC once and a roach ran across the floor. I dropped a chair leg on it to squish it. I didn’t feel like cleaning it up so I just left it there and went home. Came back Monday morning and decided a chair in the middle of the room was annoying so I picked it up. The roach scurried away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, it’s important to remember that they don’t use Venmo’s solely for hunting. It’s a defense mechanism as well, so that if a bigger animal, maybe a fox or a rabbit or something, decides to get nosey, a single bite will really teach them a lesson-maybe a permanent one!</p>
