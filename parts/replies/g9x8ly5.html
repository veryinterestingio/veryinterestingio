			<div class="markdown"><p>What about two stars coming close enough that they pass through one another's planet systems? That seems like it would be much more likely, given the size of our solar system compared to the size of the sun. It's not strictly a star collision, but it seems like it could have a pretty significant impact on the planets involved even if they don't hit anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If two galaxies collide, and there was a &quot;near miss&quot;, what would it look like, i.e. would the stars be travelling extremely fast in comparison to each other or slowly? </p>
<p>Would there ever be a scenario where a star could whizz past Earth at fantastic speed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much none.</p>
<p>The galaxies &quot;collide&quot;/interact in the sense that a certain region of space we attribute to &quot;Galaxy A&quot;  and the analogous space we attribute to &quot;Galaxy-B&quot;, which both contain a group of stars/objects that are gravitationally bound to their respective galactic centres of mass, overlap enough so that Galaxy-A's stars start getting influenced by the gravitational presence of Galaxy-B and it's stars, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>If we try to put this into &quot;human&quot; terms (you'll see why the quotes are necessary), we can do this: the average size of stars in the milky way is \~1.4 million km in diameter, and the average distance between neighbouring stars is \~5 lightyears = \~47.3 million million km (that's not a typo, that's a million millions). Now, even if you work in freedom units, it doesn't matter too much that I used kilometres. What matters is that, from what we can see, the average distance between stars is about 34 million times bigger than the average size of the stars themselves.</p>
<p>Let's say we try to replicate a galaxy collision with people by gathering two groups of people with the same average size to average distance between them ratio as stars in galaxies, and then we tell them to run at each other. Let's consider the average person to be 0.75 metres in width (\~2 feet 5.5 inches). We now have to distance the people by the same factor we found with stars, so 0.75metres * 34 000 000 = \~25.5 million metres between any two &quot;adjacent&quot; people.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>place two entire Earths worth of space between each person.</strong></p>
<p>Now have the two groups run at each other. Even with an extremely large group of people, the chances of two people being so perfectly aligned that they collide with each other is... well I would consider playing the lottery comparable.</p>
<p>This analogy is missing something akin to the gravitational interactions stars can have so we can consider this: Even if, in your unfathomable solitude of being the equivalent of the last human on <strong>two</strong> Earths, you decided to run straight for any other human you caught a glimpse of... well I don't know about you but I can barely see someone 5 blocks away let alone a distance comparable to <strong>a planet</strong>. The equivalent in star-terms is that the distance makes most gravitational interactions negligible.</p>
<p>So, in the end, with the scale and sheer number of stars in the universe, hey it <em>could</em> happen, but don't hold your breath. This isn't so much a &quot;theory&quot; as in a sort of law we think governs the mechanics of the universe, it's more that it's just a setting of our expectations based on what we see plainly looking at galaxies around us.</p>
<p>Hope this was informative and helpful!</p>
<p>Edit: And I hope it's accurate! I did a bit of astro research but am not an expert, so I welcome any corrections someone might have :)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very few collisions, but possibly a decent number of interactions via gravity.  For instance, my understanding is that the Hill sphere is the area of space around an object where it dominates the attraction of satellites.</p>
<p>Earth's Hill sphere is only about .1 AU (about 5x the distance of the moon).  An object would need to be denser than lead to have a Hill sphere larger than itself at a distance of 300 miles (approximately where the space shuttle is).  </p>
<p>My understanding is that sun has a Hill sphere that extends out approximately 0.3 light years, which would be around the estimated maximum stable of comets free from the perturbation.  The comets in outer Oort cloud (.3 to .8 light years) would be more unstable.</p>
<p>Stars don't often come close enough to have major interactions with these stars.  Gliese 710 will pass within 1.5 light years of the sun, but not for about 1.4 million years.  That may cause some significant comet displacements.</p>
<p>I imagine such circumstances (two stars coming within about 1.6 light years of each other and perturbing their Oort clouds) are far more likely in the event of galactic mergers, as the size of the Oort clouds far exceed the size of the stars themselves and stars will have significantly different linear velocities (whereas most stars in a galaxy are going to more or less be rotating, and at similar speeds).  I haven't seen a paper on this though, it is just conjecture.  Everything I've seen has mainly focused on the unlikeliness of star collisions (approximately a 10% chance of <em>any</em> 2 of the 200,000,000,000 stars in the two galaxies colliding), not the possibility of comets being disturbed or of solar systems being flung out into intergalactic space (actually, it seems this has a 12% chance by current models).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not just the distance of passage that matters, but the ratio of how dominant the local gravity of that nearby star is to the overall gravitational potential set by the rest of the system entirely. That said, when two galaxies merge, there will certainly be a few examples of stellar systems that are distributed, such as binaries being flung apart, etc. Most of these instances would not generally impart enough energy to get objects out into intergalactic space, but certainly into the general interstellar space of the new galaxy. Which will, as it turns out, be disturbed for quite a while, as it reconfigures from e.g., two disks like MW and Andromeda into a spherically shaped elliptical galaxy. Though stars near the edges of the galaxies that are colliding will experience some tidal forces that could lead to faint streams and shells far out around the collided galaxies — though they are almost certainly still gravitationally bound to the new galaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much just how any other orbit works. Since all the stars are 'buzzing around' in orbits, they've got enough tangential velocity to the pull of gravity to not actually collapse inward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We would only be able to see such an event directly in the globular clusters around the Milky Way (other GCs in other galaxies are too far to resolve individual stars). The MW has a handful of GCs with good observations, and we expect a stellar collision to occur in one of the MW GCs roughly every 10,000 years. As a note, I’m excluding here cases were stars collide due to being in a binary with decaying orbits that in-spiral to collision. I don’t know of any confirmed observations of this actually occurring that have been taken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if that counts, but one of the first times gravitational waves were detected by scientists were produced from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817" target="_blank">collision of two neutron stars.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep — we have lots of examples now of neutron star mergers, and expect white dwarf mergers to happen too. But these are caused by binary systems which lose energy in their orbits and spiral onwards (releasing GWs), not by a stars orbit in a cluster colliding with another star’s!</p></div>		</li>
