<p>Don’t forget the Roman Numerals may or may not be capitalized depending on their chord quality.</p>

<p>&quot;It's supposed to be a B major chord, but I play it badly, so I'm writing vii.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>It really isn’t to make money, I sell at cost.  I got so fed up with the texts out there buuuut, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Music-Theory-4th-ed/dp/1492831638/ref=nodl_" target="_blank">this one</a>  is pretty light but accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Music composition major here. My personal recommendation is to go through some beginning piano lesson book series, as they progress through different common and ‘classic’ chord/harmonic theory from the most basic and build up as you go through the books. </p>
<p>It will give you a sense of what works and you will gain some intuition on putting together your own. My 11 year old has been taking piano for around 2 years now and is just kind of picking up composing by mimicking the concepts in those books alone and playing with it.</p></div>		</li>
