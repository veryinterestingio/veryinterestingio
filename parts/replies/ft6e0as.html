			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m 5’3” and 110 lbs, which according to the chart is basically the average size for women around the world, and adult dosages of medication knock me on my ass. I have to take the kid’s dose and bump it up a little for almost everything.</p>
<p>The ‘adult’ dosage of most medications was calculated with 5’11”, 200-pound men in mind. “...until 1988, clinical trials of new drugs were conducted on predominantly male subjects... By 2001, two thirds of trials still excluded women. While 91 percent of studies found evidence that gender made a difference in the way drugs were metabolized or in the occurrence of adverse reactions, scientists failed to analyze results.” <a href="https://www.drugwatch.com/featured/fda-let-women-down/" target="_blank">https://www.drugwatch.com/featured/fda-let-women-down/</a></p>
<p>For example, just recently the FDA had to cut the recommended dose for Ambien for women IN HALF, because it had never been tested specifically on women. It took 20 years after it was released before anyone realized it works much more strongly in women than men.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that weight isn't the only factor that can determine how you react to medications. Genetics plays a part too, there are a lot of medications that will have a stronger or weaker effect depending on how your body reacts to them. As I understand it some people don't have the right enzymes to break down or &quot;activate&quot; certain drugs or do so too quickly leading to higher blood levels etc. I think this is also why not drinking grapefruit or quinine is recommended with certain drugs, sometimes if only due to theoretical interactions.</p>
<p>I don't know if there are medications that have significant differences in their effect between men and women when controlling for weight, would be interested to know. Either way there should be more testing. Some of the things listed in your link sound horrific...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gingers generally need higher doses of painkillers/anaesthetics than the average population. I know my two experiences with anaesthesia as a ginger are VERY different than anyone else I've talked about it too. Just one example of weird random shit that can change the effects of medications. </p>
<p>Another fun fact: CBD is metabolized by the same enzyme as grapefruit juice, and theoretically would have the same drug-interfering effects. Since CBD is officially sold as a 'supplement', there's no requirement to test for drug interactions or safety, but it's definitely something to be aware of before using it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Confirmed. I am similarly standard woman sized but I apparently metabolize drugs like a large dude. I’ve been prescribed things based on my size before and my dr. came to realize I had to increase to figure out what levels would actually work on me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This mostly works ok</p>

<p>I'm 6 foot 6 and 250 lb. Last week I was in hospital in excruciating pain (kidney stones and other stuff). They gave me the tiny standard dose of morphine. Result: still in excruciating pain. Three hours later I finally got enough pain killers, but it's one of those times I wish I was smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am sure that is the ideal, but I wonder how often it happens in reality? Of course this is only one anecdote, in the midst of the pandemic, in a rural hospital. But the overwhelming impression I got was that I did not matter to them.  Now triage is important. Maybe a plane crashed just before I arrived. But if I was to guess, based on what I saw, I would say the problem was a broken system. The endless rolling crisis, the chaos and absurdities that creates, low pay, understaffing, bad management, prejudice (I looked healthy), arriving at the end of a long shift when every space was full, and more than a little &quot;why should I care? I have seen what happens to doctors who care&quot;. I can't blame them: you can only push a doctor so far, and if they have any compassion left there were easier targets than a tall whiny man. But what I am saying is that guidelines are one thing. The reality may not always match up.</p></div>		</li>
