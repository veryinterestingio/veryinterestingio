			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add something, I think the way people talk about the singularity is very misleading.</p>
<p>The singularity is just a mathematical concept and we have no idea if it is real or not.</p>
<p>General Relativity says it is but quantum mechanics says it does not. And we don't really know how QR and QM play together so we have no idea what the center of a black hole looks like.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Veering away from ELI5 here, but although this is true of general relativity it is seemingly incompatible with quantum mechanics. There is no generally accepted resolution to this discrepancy. One (controversial) proposal is that there is a seething mass of high-energy particles just at the event horizon. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(physics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(physics</a>). Matt Strassler has a more in-depth explanation of the paradox (still appropriate for the layman - ELI20 maybe) <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/black-holes/black-hole-information-paradox-an-introduction/" target="_blank">on his blog here</a>.</p></div>		</li>
