			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading these explanations also made me think of a faster than light spaceship.  After all, GR doesn't say that faster than light travel is <em>impossible</em>, only that travel at exactly the speed of light is impossible.  The math has no problem with FTL travel....</p>
<p>As long as you have negative mass, or are moving backward in time.  And I think there is speculation that you could tunnel across the light barrier just like any other potential barrier, mathematically speaking.  But if you got fast enough for this (a spacecraft would have to be at 0.999999999999999999999999999999(99999nine99999(9999c requiring more energy than the universe has probably, and then you'd have to hope that the entire spacecraft tunnels in the same way and not just, for example, half of it.  Boom.  So yeah, fun thought experiment, but in practice prolly ain't gonna happen.</p></div>		</li>
