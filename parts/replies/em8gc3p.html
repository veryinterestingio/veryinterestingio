<p>Additionally, where people usually need the crack, in the junctional areas of the spine (where the curve switches) is not very easy to crack yourself so you end up cracking the middle hypermobile part and not the part that actually needs it.</p>

<p>Can you elaborate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not who you asked, but I think they’re talking about this:</p>
<p>The spine has three major curves: it goes in at the neck, out through the upper back, and the lower back curves back in again. Commenter above is saying that usually where we feel like we need a pop is where those curves “switch” from in to out, that is, where the curvature is more or less straight. However, because we’ve got all those nice convenient curvey curves, you’re more likely to get your pop at the most bowed part of the S (especially ime the neck and low back) rather than where you wanted it. Those parts are so good at curving they think they should be doing it all the time. It’s a lot more challenging to keep them stable.</p>
<p>This is also why backbends are hard: your low back is so good at curving it wants to do the whole job, but if it does you’ll end up injured. The key is keeping the low back stable so that the upper back can do the opening instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, good explanation.</p>
<p>each vertebra level of your spine is supposed to bend a specific amount.  what happens is if we continuously crack the same ones over and over again, those end up being more flexible and the ones that don't get cracked stiffen up.  The ones we usually feel are the stiff ones, but the ones we typically crack are the flexible ones that don't necessarily need it.</p>
<p>that 'crack' sound is gas being released which also facilitates an endorphin release at that joint.  That is what gives you the relief for 20-30 minutes before it feels like it needs to crack again. same relief you feel with massage or TENS</p></div>		</li>
