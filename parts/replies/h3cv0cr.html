			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I can't seem to grasp, is how do SSRI's actually resolve the serotonin issue? Like, would one with these issues expect to take something the rest of their life or does the effect cause changes in the brain that help lead to a resolution? If you stop taking them wouldn't you expect the issue to come right back?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For most people, this is the case, they (we) need help with reuptake forever. In some people, the need is temporary, like when someone is having temporary depression after they lost a family member. </p>
<p>Unfortunately a lot of people take this to mean that everyone's depression is temporary, and leads to a lot of people saying that you can power through depression. If one person can do it, then anyone can, right? People are identical, after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This exactly! I never needed any help in that department until my dad got sick with colon cancer (passed in 09). Started having severe panic attacks (which I had before but were completely debilitating at the time along with constantly crying).  I tapered off about a year after he died and it felt like every time I turned my head, that my brain was spinning inside, untethered. I threw up for two months every basically every time I stood up or moved. It was horrendous. Absolute turmoil. The tapering took about 4 months but it wasn't until I stopped completely that the spinning started. I'd advise anyone not to do it unless a)you expect it to be permanent and b) you REALLY need it i.e. on the verge of ending it all. Frankly, I mean that someone feeling down for less than a month should never take these drugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They usually don't resolve it permanently and need to be taken ongoing.</p>
<p>Best explanation I've seen is &quot;if you can't make your own neurotransmitters, store-bought is fine&quot;.</p>
<p>Note, this is for clinical depression with a physical (chemical) basis, people who actually can't produce or regulate their neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>And yes, if you stop taking them (especially suddenly all at once) it can be even worse than before. Any changes in SSRI regime should be planned with your doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way my psychiatrist put it, one of the reasons for a lack of serotonin is that the brain isn’t “calibrated” to the right level. Once it sees so much loose serotonin floating about, it assumes that to be the right amount (which is apt for either the fewer receptors or lower production problem you originally had), and hence you can taper off.
Hearsay though, I never looked it up - so take with a pinch of salt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of related, but not really. It has to do with how widespread those &quot;major&quot; neurotransmitters are in the body (serotonin especially) and how many body processes they're involved with, from mood to sex to digestion. In fact, <em>most</em> of your serotonin is in the digestive system not the brain.</p>
<p>Living things have been using serotonin so long that some mushrooms also use serotonin, meaning we both inherited its use from a common ancestor before we branched off from fungi.</p>
<p>As a result of being used in many things besides mood,  SSRIs aren't a matter of &quot;block reuptake = more serotonin = feel better&quot;. It's way more complicated and has many side effects in the body and mind besides the intended mood improvement.</p>
<p>The risk of suicide as a side effect is at least partly from people taking medicine imperfectly (taking to much and or stopping suddenly) leading to imbalances and withdrawal symptoms. Much like other drugs, the withdrawal is the opposite of the drug effect. Your body  gets used to the boosted serotonin level, you feel better, then a young person says &quot;oh I feel good, don't need to take this anymore&quot; then they crash into their worst depression as their serotonin plummets to even lower levels than before. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about young people specifically, but antidepressants don't work instantly and can increase motivation and energy before they start to increase &quot;happiness&quot; (assuming that's ever even attained). For someone who's already on the edge of suicide, this increase in motivation can push them to actually do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it involves serotonin itself. There are certain serotonin receptors that when activated causes feeling of dysphoria and despair. There's multiple different types of serotonin, and a plethora of receptor functions in all different parts of the brain. Some people get too much serotonin where more activity = bad, every neurotransmitter is like this in certain areas of the brain. That's why SSRIs are so scrutinized as being a &quot;nuclear option&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be way off and a stupid question, but would that be similar to say gaining a tolerance to something (like alcohol) to the point where you need more and more, and when you don't get enough you go into a form of withdrawal, making you depressed as opposed to &quot;normal&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, yes! Alcohol tolerance has 2 causes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your body becomes less sensitive to the effects of alcohol, including by producing more &quot;stimulant&quot; neurotransmitters to counteract the constant alcohol's sedative effects. Then if you suddenly stop drinking, your body is still over-producing stimulants, leading to the shakes and seizures and heart attack risk. This is the effect that's not identical, but similar to suddenly stopping SSRIs. Lots of drugs have withdrawal effects that are opposite of the drug, for that reason.</li>
<li>Your liver gets faster at metabolizing and removing alcohol, so there's less in your blood after a given drink size to begin with. This effect doesn't apply to SSRI type drugs directly, since the liver doesn't process neurotransmitters (I don't think. Certainly not its major role).</li>
