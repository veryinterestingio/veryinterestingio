			<div class="markdown"><p>I also think the extended car warranty people, at least some of them, get lists of contacts from car dealerships. It seems to me I only started getting the extended warranty calls after I had bought a car from a dealership in 2016, which I had not done since 2003. So the first time or two I had such a contact, I thought it might actually be connected to the dealer. Fortunately I had no interest in an <em>actual</em> extended warranty.</p></div>		</li>
