<p>we don't start wrinkling until after childhood, that we often wrinkle far more/earlier in the face and the fact that our skin can easily regenerate after a wound, it leaves you wondering why that is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer the things you questioned in the order you questioned them: </p>
<p>1) We don't wrinkle in childhood because our skin is growing and producing more connective tissue (not less) and we tend to have fatty deposits under the skin that fill out the areas that will later wrinkle. People typically don't look &quot;gaunt&quot; unless they are old and losing those deposits or on drugs or starving. </p>
<p>2) We wrinkle in the face more than anywhere else because 1) the face is exposed to ultraviolet light every day of our lives in a way that, say, the small of our back is not. Ultraviolet light is very damaging over time to our skin and the underlying connective tissue. </p>
<p>3) Skin wrinkling is the result of general degrading of the body over time, not a traumatic wound that the body attends to immediately. Think of it more like a tree simply getting older and the bark becoming worn than a limb snapping off and the area healing as the tree grows and covers the damaged space. Or to use another thing in the analogy it's like the difference between getting into a car wreck where you immediately fix the body damage and the marred paint, and the car simply aging over 20 years of ownership.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be just environmental exposure, ie mostly sun but wind too.  Most people seem to have wrinkles or &quot;aged skin&quot; on their face and hands/arms.  I've seen pictures of truckers who keep one arm out the window while driving and that arm always looks &quot;older&quot;.  Same with cowboy types or folks  who spend a lot of time outdoors and in the sun and snow as well, they wear long sleeve shirts and their arms look ok but their faces are really wrinkled.</p></div>		</li>
