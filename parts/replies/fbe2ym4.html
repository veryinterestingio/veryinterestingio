			<div class="markdown"><p>Learning stages critical phases have largely fallen out of favour in most neuroscience / cognitive psych research there isnt a lot of evidence for them except in very specific cases like visual selectivity (need early exposure for neural learning in the visual cortex) </p>
<p>The big thing is just exposure currently read to your kids read to your kids with things involving numeracy show them numbers and letters and they will be better off. Families with lots of books that read to their kids  tend to see an increase in early school performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took an intro to psych class this year, so not sure if he is still relevant in higher levels of learning, but yes. There are some issues with his model like the OP mentioned, but for the most part he is still taught about.</p></div>		</li>
