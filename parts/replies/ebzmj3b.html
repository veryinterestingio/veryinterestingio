			<div class="markdown"><p>You point out a problem I always have with super strength in comic books/movies/etc. Superman can't pick up a boat or a plane, with ALL that weight bearing down on 1 sq ft wherever he's holding it. Everything massive that he'd try to pick up or catch would break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funnily enough that’s another case of comic books being comic books and being highly inconsistent. </p>
<p>Sometimes, mainly with Superman and his supporting characters and usually with falling planes where only one person catches it. </p>
<p>But other times multiple heroes will come together to catch falling objects, despite all of them technically being strong enough to lift it on their own. The Green Lantern characters are often drawn creating constructs that support a greater area of the object. </p>
<p>And this doesn’t just apply to super strength. Comics are really inconsistent when it comes to speed too. </p>
<p>Sometimes a writer will throw in a line about how Superman doesn’t fly as fast as he can in cities because if he did the speeds he was flying at would level the place. Other times he flies Batman to Africa while Batman is in the middle of a sentence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The DC writers came up with an explanation for that. Superman has latent telekinesis that kicks in whenever he intends to lift a larger object, versus punch through it. It’s latent, though, so he can’t use telekinesis to fetch a teapot or give Jimmy Olsen a wedgie.</p>
<p>Krypto, on the other hand, lacks this ability. He happily punches through anything without a care. He’s a dog. </p>
<p>His super pee stream also ensures Smallville fire hydrants are more often than not, severed halfway through like a tinkley laser cut through it. And don’t get me started on how neighborhood cats feel about Krypto’s “playful” sense of “humor”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This follows the typical superhero super strength dilemma. Super strength accidentally destroys everything because the objects involved cannot survive the force.</p></div>		</li>
