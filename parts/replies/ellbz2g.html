			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow so there's really no solid evidence that MCTs have any beneficial properties, specifically on how the body processes fats? I would assume that plays into Ketogenic eating being a fad too then since the whole concept revolves around the idea of ketones and their role in increasing metabolism i.e. faster weight loss. I have no medical background, I'm just curious to be honest. As far as nutrition goes nowadays I feel like it's pretty easy to be misled into thinking something is factually and medically &quot;healthy&quot; when there are no studies to suggest so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read lots of studies that support keto, but alas I do not have a scientific mind so i can't really regurgitate them in a way that would make sense.</p>
<p>I can, however, share my experience. I'm 5'7 F and currently weigh 138 pounds, down from 215. I can eat enormous quantities of food and continue losing weight, as long as I keep carbs below 20 net grams per day. For example, on weekends my typical intake is 1/2 lb sausage, 2 eggs, 6 slices of bacon for breakfast; and 1lb meat and 1/2 - 1 pound vegetables for dinner. During the week I typically eat less as I only have time for dinner, but it's still far more calories than the 1200 or whatever that's recommended for my height and weight. And I'm still losing around 0.5-1lb per week. And for the record, my physician is fully on board with all this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keto (or any other diet/protocol) isn't magic. If you lose weight you're eating lees than what yo use that's all. Fat are just way more satiating than carbs - it's really hard to eat a lot of them.</p>
