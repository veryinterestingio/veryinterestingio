			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the things that I wish I exactly knew, in regards to uncertainty in physics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also don't know exactly where they are...</p>

<p>Is it &quot;don't&quot;? Because I was under the impression that it was &quot;can't&quot;, and possibly even that &quot;there is no such thing as where they are&quot; in the classical sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is the more precisely you &quot;know&quot; where they are now, the less you know about where they are going to be next.</p>
<p>In order to figure out where they are, you have to physically affect them (&quot;observe&quot;) by using some energy to detect them.  This means bouncing lasers off them, getting near them with energized probes, or using your own physical detectors (also made of electrons and protons) near them.</p>
<p>In doing this observation, you affect them and change the direction and speed they are currently moving with (their momentum).  So now you know where they were, but you might have knocked them out of orbit, shifted them to a different interval, or reflected them to a different location.</p>
<p>To get a more precise location, you need to use a higher energy to detect them with to make a smaller spatial resolution.  This affects their momentum more drastically because duh, more energy.  Quantum mechanics can express this relationship of limits between location and momentum with math.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True-ish, but as far as we can tell, the electron doesn’t actually exist in some specific location. Your description suggests that the electron has a definite position and momentum but we just can’t figure it out. In reality, there is a field whose quantities describe what we perceive as an electron. Measurements affect this field in such a way that it affects future measurements. But the properties of the field are not point like, they spread out over some range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I've come to understand it is that it's not the tools affecting the particle that make one variable uncertain, its that fundamentally, no matter how little the system is affected, to know an exact position of a particle means you cannot, under any circumstances, know its momentum as well. It's just the nature of them, to know one makes the other unknowable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this is incorrect, it is not a limitation of technology that prevents us from knowing both the position and momentum of an electron, it is simply fundamentally unknowable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a bit of a subtlety for an ELI5, but yes, you are correct. We cannot locate an electron's position to a single mathematical point, both experimentally and in theory, based on the wave-particle nature of electrons and our current understanding of quantum physics. </p>
<p>That said, we can still obtain scientifically significant and useful estimate of particles positions/momenta. Just not at the same time and not to infinite precision. </p>
<p>Hope this clarifies it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real gist of my question is between the &quot;we can't know&quot; and the &quot;there is no such thing as&quot; bits. Is it that these states cannot be measured (at least simultaneously)? Or is it that one or the other properly does not exist in this context?</p>
<p>For the longest time I thought the former, that it was merely a limit on observational practices, as stated by others in response to my question. But the past few times I've tried reading into it, it instead seems like the supposed relation to the observer effect is actually a pop-science fallacy, and that in fact the Uncertainty Principle is describing a <em>fundamental constraint to the actual states of wave-like systems</em>. That in effect, an electron that you knew was in an exact location, would inherently then have a momentum that literally cannot be reasoned about in any way.</p>
<p>I'm prepared to hear one or the other. It's not too exotic a claim either way, especially considering a close analogy of understanding in mathematics per the Monsters of Real Analysis: The idea of something having a well defined position and connectivity everywhere, yet going <em>nowhere in particular</em> is seen in the Weierstrass Function and others like it. But which one is it? Are we merely limited from knowing? Or is there literally no such thing, in these Uncertainty Principle cases?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't have a definite position, they are not moving around the nucleus. They just exist as a quantum superposition until they interact with something. Putris's first sentence is misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons aren't  a solid permenant object the way that protons and neutrons are.   Electrons (well... leptons really) exist as excitations in the electromagnetic and Higgs fields.</p>
<p>It's less accurate to think of them as a particle buzzing around randomly in its orbital than it is to think of it as a feild where electrons are constantly popping in and out seemingly at random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the intensity of the requirement of your definition of useful increases, the number of pages required to go through for a useful answer increases. With sufficiently high standards of usefulness, the probability of finding a useful answer anywhere converges to 0. For typical definitions of usefulness, the probability converges on 100% with reducing pages converging on 1 if the search is sufficiently worded and is useful for any assumed single purpose.</p></div>		</li>
