<p>Yes it is expensive but if you were really worried get 2 in series on the main water line so that when you need to replace the first one the second one takes over the filtering duties. I mean it has a stated 1 million gallon capacity which using the average 100 gal/day per person gives a family of 6 a hypothetical replacement time of ~1667 days or about 4.5 years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The capacity of GAC and AIX (anion exchange) is limited to the amount of PFAS it can bind, before the GAC or AIX resin is saturated. They need to be replaced over time. This is further complicated by the fact that some PFAS are readily adsorbed in the early life of a filter, but is later pushed out and desorbed by other things in the water, and other PFAS are always adsorbed no matter what life the filter is in. So, you need to change it more often than suggested.  </p>
<p>GAC is good since its a catch-all for all kind of pollutands, be it PFAS or pharmaceuticals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are cots solutions for pfas filters. It is especially necessary for people with wells in areas where there is no municipal water supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the best ways to treat PFAS are with GAC, AIX (anion exchange membranes, resins) and MF ( membrane filtrations, wich include RO). Yes, its a valid treatment option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to a talk on PFAS in our local water supply (Orange County, CA) last week and our local groundwater replenishment system runs the treated water through RO filters and it gets all the detectable PFAS out.   The downside of RO is that they end up with concentrated PFAS to deal with</p></div>		</li>
