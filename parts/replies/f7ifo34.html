			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  When I was learning massage therapy we tested to see how sensitive our backs were.  We would put one finger on a person's back, then a second, and they said they could feel two.  One finger was gradually moved toward the other, and when the  fingers were about 4 inches apart, the person said the could feel only one point of pressure.  Unlike our feet and hands which are loaded with sensory nerves, the back a wasteland in comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lower back pain is a strange ailment. Most of the time the cause of the pain cannot be determined. It doesn't make a lot of sense anatomically for many people to experience random bouts of oft excruciating pain without any trauma or unusual strain. But it still happens and doctors are powerless to do anything about it most of the time, except prescribe pain medications.</p></div>		</li>
