			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a thread on Reddit a couple of months ago about someone who moved the dead body of a crow from their yard and the other crows in the area appeared to hold a grudge on the individual for days afterwards. Apparently it disrupted their “mourning” process. I’ll see if I can find it.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/9oeuas/how_do_you_repair_relations_with_crows/?st=JPLJT9CE&amp;sh=ca4585d9" target="_blank">Here it is.</a> It’s quite a humorous read, honestly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was actually some sort of experiment done where a fake dead crow was placed on the sidewalk on a campus, and tons of crows started gathering around in the trees surrounding the areas, seemingly mourning. </p>
<p>I tried to find the video but couldn't find the exact one. It looks like it's been tested many times though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems really odd to me because where I am we occasionally in the summers get flocks of crows that are annoying as hell in our area so to get rid of them we place a dead crow somewhere around our property and problem solved, just like that theyll all be gone for weeks. Works everytime weve done it and I know many people who use the same technique. </p></div>		</li>
