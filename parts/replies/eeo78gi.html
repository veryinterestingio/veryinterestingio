			<div class="markdown"><p>You would only do this with a small paring knife which usually are not razor sharp. Not that I would tell a child to do it but an adult with good hand eye coordination should have no problem. Of course an apple peeler would work as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even then, I'd say that it's safer to use a sharp knife than a dull one.  Mostly because a sharp knife will cut easily and you won't need to put much force behind it and should have good control.  It's when you're pressing hard with a dull knife that accidents happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't do that with anything sharper than a butter knife. </p>
<p>If you are using a choke grip with a sharp paring knife, you don't really move the knife. You use your thumb to push the food into the knife. And even then, you should keep your thumb off the knife blade. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely unrelated, but did you know, in a pinch against someone in heavy armour, it was a common tactic to hold a sword by the blade, using the hilt as a bashing weapon, similar as to how one would use a mace or club. This is because bending the opponents armour, prevent them from breathing or breaking their bones, would be a much more effective way of taking them down than to attempt to cut them.</p>
<p>Anywhoo, you'd think that holding the blade would be a great way to cut your fingers off, and indeed it was all about the grip and technique: you had to grip the blade and make sure it absolutely could NOT slide up or down, as the movement would carve the edge into your skin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Halfswording is when you grab the blade in the center, to better control the tip and top part of the blade, when you thrust (also used against armour). That's why it's called <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zZdQSgbidn4/hqdefault.jpg" target="_blank">&quot;half-swording&quot;(Halbschwert)</a></p>
<p>The technique he describes is <a href="https://i.makeagif.com/media/8-31-2014/qNiLTX.gif" target="_blank">Murder stroke (Mordhau)</a></p>
<p>It is technically half-swording, but in reverse and for a different purpose.</p>
<p>In an ideal situation, you want to murder stroke the living shit out an opponent with a single strike, then switch to half-swording and finish him with a thrust either to visor or gaps. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It also helped that this was usually done with some sort of gloves, and not just bare hands. So a little sliding wasn't a huge deal, because you had the glove providing some protection.</p></div>		</li>
