			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean if you have an operation on your ears that changes the shape of them you may hear that short term? Is there a specific part of the ear that has to be changed or would any part changing cause that?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you mean &quot;operation on your ears&quot;.</p>
<p>Anything that changes the way sound enters your ear canal will have a percivable change in the sound you experience. Until your brain get used to it.</p>
<p>Think of it like changing the shape of a funnel that you're pouring small marbles into. The wider the funnel the slower the contents will pour out the other end because marbles might hit eachother and will take longer to end the hole. The more narrow the funnel, will make the marbles pour out faster.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>
