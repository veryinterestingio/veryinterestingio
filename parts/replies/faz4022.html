			<div class="markdown"><p>The fuel lasts <del>about 5 or 6</del> 3 to 6 years but it's not swapped all at once. About a third of the fuel is replaced at every replacement cycle because depending on where it is in the reactor it will be used at different rates.</p>
<p>The ceramic pellet have an expiration date mostly because of the stresses and degradation the solid pellets (and the rest of the assembly usually made of a zirconium alloy) encounter during their use in the reactor.</p>
<p>For example some fission products are gaseous like Xenon 135 which causes actual cracks and voids inside the pellet.</p>
<p>This unfortunately means that a nuclear reactor can't use a lot of the energy in the fuel (this is also because of the kind of reactor itself and the type of neutrons used called &quot;thermal neutrons&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really dependent on reactor design most US plants reload on a 24 month cycle.  But not all the fule is replaced, only about 30% so they burn it all about 3 cycles.  Figuring out what rods to put where is pretty complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a reactor operator at a nuclear plant in the US. I work at a Westinghouse three loop PWR. I also supervise fuel movement each outage and where each fuel assembly moves in the core. A single fuel assembly is used for three cycles. Each cycle is 18 months. Barring nothing going wrong (manufacturing defects, no leaks, etc) each fuel assembly will be used for 4.5 years.  The placement of each assembly in the core depends on if it is a “first burn” (brand new assembly), second burn, or a third burn (has been in the core for 2 cycles already). Long story short, the third burns are placed in the outer ring. Moving in you have the second and first burns. This is done to maintain an even flux profile across the core both axially and radially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the reactor, but the typical timescale is 1-3 years. After a while there is not enough U-235 left, time to swap the fuel rod for a new one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed with 99% of what you said except that beta radiation is incredibly easy to stop as it only has a penetrative power of a few microns and can be readily stopped by standard clothing. The majority of radiation that is of concern coming off is gamma and fast neutron (both of which require several inches of lead and steel to slow down (thermalize), or be absorbed by some material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrons are more effectively slowed down by light nuclei, such as concrete. Like if a tennisball hits a bowlingball, it bounces back with almost the same speed while the bowling ball hardly moves. Whereas if a tennisball hits another tennisball, the energy is divided more or less equally over both balls. </p>
<p>The idea of a neutron bomb is based on this, as neutrons can penetrate tank armour easily whereafter they are absorbed in the body of the crew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. For the fuel, you want a large percentage of fissile material. Being fissile and having a high specific activity aren’t really related to each other.</p>
<p>Reactors operate on induced fission reactions, not any kind of radioactive decay. So as long as the fuel can undergo neutron-induced fission with a high probability, and using neutrons of arbitrarily low energy, it is in principle suitable for use as fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if I understand correctly, nuclei with a lower activation energy are more easily fissionable and probably also have a higher activity? E.g. U-235 can be split with thermal neutrons and has a smaller half-life than U-238, that's not a coincidence right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radioactive decays of short-living fission products are a relevant fraction of the overall power. Fission to stable nuclides would be amazing because it would make things so much easier, but it would also mean a bit less power (or more fuel needed).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation isnt really how we make power. The neutrons produced from the fission is. The neutrons that are born fast bounce around the water molecules transferring their energy to the water (thus slowing down until they are thermalized). The energy transferred to the water raises its temperature.</p></div>		</li>
