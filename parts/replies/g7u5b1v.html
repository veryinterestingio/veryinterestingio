			<div class="markdown"><p>As the user below stated it could be due to a large heat source leaving the body which does stimulate your autonomic nervous system, and when you're cold you do shiver for this reason.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely convinced this is why and there isn't really an agreed upon (or identical, for that matter) reason these occur. </p>
<p>Could be that the urination relaxes you as it does serve as a &quot;relief&quot; for your autonomic nervous system?</p>
<p>Our nervous systems are incredibly complicated, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly &quot;why&quot; these things occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I don't think it has to do with heat leaving the body, because when you pee you don't really get colder. You just lose that mass. Your body already spent energy heating up that fluid while it was inside you. You're not replacing it with something colder that will absorb your body heat when you empty your bladder.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So If I was out in the cold trying to keep warm, I should avoid peeing if I can?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Several people have referred to the &quot;piss shiver&quot; being caused by heat leaving the body, but I don't believe that's the reason.  After all, do you get a &quot;shit shiver&quot; when you drop a deuce?  That's warm, too, but the heat leaving your body doesn't cause one.  (Nor do you get a &quot;puke shiver.&quot;)</p>
<p>I think the most likely cause is related to our reproductive systems in that, sometimes, as we urinate, a nerve related to pleasure is tripped and causes a kind of micro-orgasm.  Such mixed signals/crossed nerves are not unheard of in the human body.  (Check out the &quot;photic sneeze reflex&quot; for another common one.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have cerebral palsy and get myoclonic jerks, or dystonia. It feels like energy is &quot;zapping&quot; or is going backwards. I violently shiver a few seconds and shoulders shake, then it travels down the legs and arms.</p>
<p>It's my own personal earthquake and no one is invited. </p>
<p>I can't drive a car with this, it happens intermittently. I can't really say what triggers it sometimes noises will and having fatigue and stress. Sometimes being at rest or dropping back to normal body tension. when my thyroid tanked out completely I had more episodes, pain, and neuropathy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you're having a quick flash of fight or flight because your body is very fleetingly experiencing danger. It happens to me sometimes if it's dark and I think, for just a moment, that I saw someone stepping out into the street while I'm driving. That quick flash of danger is enough to cause the shivers.</p></div>		</li>
