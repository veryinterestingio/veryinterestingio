			<div class="markdown"><p>I did the math once. Believe it or not, it takes like 10x the energy to reach orbit compared to just getting really high and falling back down.</p>
<p>(Edit: /u/old_guy_536x did the math too, and came up with 40x. He's probably right. Using 2,233 mph vs 17,500, I get even more than that.)</p>
<p>In rocketry, there's a thing called &quot;specific impulse&quot; which has something to do with the weight of the fuel and the amount of push (&quot;impulse&quot;) it provides. This means there's a limit to how fast a specific kind of fuel can get you going, no matter how much you have. I recall that the fuel used by Rutan in his Spaceship One meant that the ship could <em>never</em> reach orbit, no matter how big the rocket under it was. Dunno about these two new spaceships.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's what galls me: I heard Rutan speak at Oshkosh once. He was referring to NASA as &quot;nay-say&quot; and acting all superior because they spent billions where he only spent millions.</p>
<p>But the thing is a) NASA started from zero whereas he's standing on their shoulders. Except for the tires maybe, there's not one piece of technology in Spaceship One that NASA didn't have a hand in creating for him in the first place. If he'd started where they did, it would have cost him just as much.</p>
<p>And b) he can't do a fraction of what NASA can do. They put people on the moon and brought them back. They put probes on Mars and out of the solar system. He can't even get into low orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Space is only 100km away, it's not far. Even if 100km upwards, it's still &quot;easy&quot; to go there.</p>
<p>The problem is staying there. In the atmosphere, you can push on air to stay up (plane), or just be lighter than air (balloon).</p>
<p>In space, either your rocket must continuously provide 1g of thrust the whole time, or you have to accelerate to orbit speed. Both require a lot of energy compared to just reaching space and falling back down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically you are much closer to space than you think. But you need to be going really really fast to stay there.  And that requires a much more complex and capable rocket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough this is what makes getting close to the sun so difficult. You have to decelerate your ship/satellite enough to transition from earth orbit to a low sun orbit. It takes an immense amount of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And I did exactly that at 17. But it was 5000 miles round trip from Wisconsin to the Santa Monica Pier. Still got the photo we took with a film camera and no flash at 3am.... But I made it to the West Coast and saw the ocean....</p></div>		</li>
