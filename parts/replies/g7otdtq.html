			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah I’ve had insomnia since I was 15 and had a sleep study done when I was 16. Spent a whole night laying in a hospital bed with 40+ wires glued to my scalp while some guy named Ken watched me on the monitors. Learned absolutely nothing and it took 7 showers to get all the glue out of my hair!</p></div>		</li>
