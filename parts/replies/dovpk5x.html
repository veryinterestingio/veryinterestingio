			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same unfortunately. I'd rather use deodorant as I feel like it's probably <em>less</em> bad for you, but ultimately it doesn't prevent me from getting BO whereas one application of antiperspirant works all day, so antiperspirant it is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol that's funny. It's funny because the only people who would say this are people who dont sweat much. Deodorant doesn't do shit for me, I sweat it right off. I need antiperspirant, I'll get new shirts. Also never had a shirt change color...I'm guessing you're talking about white shirts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look into Drysol or similar products. You apply some before bed once or twice a week, and you basically stop sweating from the armpits. I'd almost call it life changing.</p></div>		</li>
