			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, the lenses in the headset could be designed around a person's particular vision, but that wouldn't be economically practical.</p>
<p>Edit to add: Yes some vision issues can be corrected for by simply adjusting the lens-eye distance as is possible in some headsets, but this doesn't cover every vision problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DSLR cameras and binoculars have a “diopter” focusing mechanism that can adjust the viewfinder for impaired vision - so I can use my camera without my contacts in simply by adjusting a dial. It isn’t necessary that costly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I'm nearsighted (around -3.25 dioptres) and I start seeing blurry at about 40 cm (1.3 feet). At 2 feet I can't read regular sized text and at 3 feet I can only read big headlines. The guy below says the focal point is actually at 1.4 m in current VRs, that for me is basically legally blind territory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the light passes through the lenses making it approach your eye the same way as something from a large distance out does </p>
<p>So if you are near sighted you need to wear glasses.</p>
<p>Basically the lenses on VR are glasses for normal people that make the light seem a bit further back so it's easier for normal people to see as too close an image would be very unpleasant.</p>
<p>Being near sighted this makes it harder to see clearly so we need our glasses to see this far away image, if that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the same way the lenses in your glasses make a distant object appear close so your near-sighted eyes can see it, the lenses in the VR goggles make a screen that is really close to your eyes appear really far away. It’s just doing the opposite thing as your glasses.</p></div>		</li>
