			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't guarantee it's correct, but it's absolutely more correct than the blank page. The blank page analogy is an analogy that explains <em>what</em> the post is about, but not <em>why</em> it happens really. </p>
<p>The truth is nobody really knows the answer. Here's one theory about what causes tip of the tongue syndrome (not quite the same, but similar to OP's question)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The blocking hypothesis states that retrieval cues elicit the retrieval of a word related to the target that then blocks the retrieval of the correct word and causes the tip of the tongue phenomenon to occur.[2] In other words, TOTs occur when plausible but incorrect responses to a query come to mind quickly. The person recognizes that the related words are incorrect but cannot retrieve the correct word because it is inhibited.[2] These related words are termed blockers because they block the ability to retrieve the correct word.[2] This accounts for why TOTs predict memory performance. Once the inhibition of the correct word is removed or the blockers are forgotten, the TOT will be resolved.[2] Evidence for this hypothesis is minimal as it is difficult to measure.[2] Most research that takes on this approach give participants blockers and see if they produce TOT states.[2] This method is controversial as it is unclear if the blockers given produce TOT states or act as retrieval cues.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it mimics the way the brain is built in the physical world. As a web of neurons connected to each other. Some connections are lost but other connections stay alive. </p>
<p>A physical book and pages assumes pages are big chunks of data that are not connected. </p>
<p>Except the last sentence on a page and the first sentence on the next. But that is still a big chunk connected to another big chunk.</p>
<p>When in reality it is tiny neurons and one neuron is connected to many more neurons (not just two)</p>
<p>So it’s tiny things connected to many more tiny things.</p>
<p>Not big chunks two way connected (previous page, next page)</p></div>		</li>
