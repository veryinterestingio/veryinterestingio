			<div class="markdown"><p>I just realized last year that the reason the tile wall around my bathtub had water spots was that I would rinse the cleaner off with cold water (small bathroom with no fan, it gets really hot cleaning in there, so I try to minimize steam). I feel so vindicated now, since I didn’t really look into it, I just assumed I was right and moved on lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To explain to a 5 year old? I would say something along the lines of:</p>
<p>So the heat capacity is kind of like long it takes to heat something up. Think of when your parents turn the oven on, then open the oven door, that air that comes out is really hot? That's because air has low specific heat capacity, so it heats up quickly.</p>
<p>Now think of when they put some water on the stove to boil for the potatoes, that takes a bit longer right? That's because water has a higher specific heat capacity, so more heat needs to be put into it to make it hotter.</p>
<p>Stone is even harder to heat up, but when it is heated up, it can hold that heat for a while and you can actually cook a fried egg on a stone that's been in a fire for ages! </p>
<p>I think it's a difficult concept to put into layman's terms, but incorrect simplifications are detrimental to understanding. </p>
<p>The trampoline model of relativity, the planetary-esque model of atoms and the shroedinger's cat model of quantum physics are all misleading explanations of the fundamentals, taught because its easy.</p></div>		</li>
