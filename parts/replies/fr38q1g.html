			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, certainly, we are. These trees are in no danger of going extinct; the worry is that we'll lose the amazing old-growth stands where the trees especially large.</p>
<p>Coast Redwoods (the tallest tree in the world) are endangered but not critically; most of the old growth stands in California are gone, but they're very easy to plant and grow within and even somewhat outside of their old range up into Northern Oregon and Washington. (Redwood is an extremely desirable wood for construction and woodworking; it's durable and bug- and rot-resistant. Most of the big stands were logged ages ago.) We might be in some danger of not having many or any of the beautiful old growth stands around, but it's extraordinarily unlikely that they'll go extinct; they're too interesting and too easy to cultivate for there to a real risk of extinction today. There's tons planted in and around Northern California towns and cities; they're attractive and relatively hardy, and they grow quickly, at least for the first hundred feet or so. I had a beautiful giant one in my backyard in Berkeley; my third-floor deck in my apartment was up in the redwood branches and it was a stunning tree. They'll totally destroy your sidewalk and driveway with their roots, though. They've been planted all over the world, too, in arboretums and at private homes. My wife is from Northern California and grew up with these things, and she's pointed them out to me growing in France at her family's old home in Brittany before. (Brittany gets tons of rain and is fairly sunny but not too hot in the summer; were it mountainous, it would be ideal for Coast Redwoods, and they do well anyway.) Any place with mild, wet winters and not-too-dry, not-too-hot summers can support them easily, and they'll deal with hot, dry summers OK if you water them, they just won't grow quickly. What they really love are mild, foggy coastal mountains. My wife's dad planted a few in hot, dry Central California, and they're alive decades later, but they're not very tall, only forty or fifty feet.</p>
<p>Giant Sequoias (the largest trees in the world, in terms of volume/girth of the trunk) are much more endangered in the wild; there's only a very few old-growth groves left, and even within their current &quot;range&quot;, they're still kind of uncommon. Big ones are much older than Coast Redwoods. They're also less commonly planted as ornamental plants, because they grow <em>so slowly</em>; they're planted mostly as a curiosity. That said, they're not <em>hard</em> to plant, and don't need crazy amounts of care, but they do need semi-dry mountains to really thrive and are more tolerant of snow than heat; cold but not freezing, dry mountains are not real common in the world and it's not where lots of people tend to live, so they're not often planted except by arboretums and the like, at least for long enough to grow to an impressive size. That said, you can find them in lots of different places around the world where they've been planted in gardens. These are also not likely to go extinct, but there is a real risk that the old-growth stands could be wiped out by climate change and/or wildfires. </p>
<p>Over the last century, the Forest Service in America has replanted a few stands of Giant Sequoia, but many stands did not ever really take hold and even those that did won't be really large for another couple centuries. They did start an entirely new grove in the San Jacinto mountains outside of L.A., which is not part of their historic range but may well have been in pre-history. </p>
<p>You can buy seeds and seedlings of both species at lots of state parks and tourist traps in California, and I assume can order seeds or maybe seedlings through the mail. They're not hard to start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if we do, they take very long to reach their impressive size. The oldest current ones are like 3,000 years old.</p>
<p>We're talking so long that we'd be planting them for people who would regard our civilization as ancient history, similar to how we see the classical Greeks. Crazy to think about, and also part of the reason that even if we are planning them, most people probably would never know about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they grow up to 4' a year.    They start and end slow but get pretty wild after the first 5 or so years. </p>
<p>I have six of them.  One has grown almost 4&quot; in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Their range is limited,  in part,  because they need fire to germinate.  The seed pods don't open without it.   We've been so careful to avoid fire for the last few hundred years, in addition to harvesting untold amounts.   The irony is they're not great lumber bearers.   When cut, they'll splinter once they hit the ground.</p>
<p>If I had to hazard a guess,  I'd say drought is another big one.   Mature giant sequoia can take in 500-800 gallons of water a day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno about &quot;harsh&quot;, but some of the challenges in their environments are regular wildfires and long dry spells (whether summers or longer drought). Redwoods/sequoias have fire-resistant bark and pine-cones, and, at least for Sequoias, get a lot of their water through fog/dew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oregon didn't cut them all down. There's confusion in this thread among three related species. The natural range of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens" target="_blank">Coast Redwood</a> extends into the extreme southern Oregon coast. There aren't a lot of them there, but they're still there. </p>
<p>But OP asks about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoiadendron_giganteum" target="_blank">Giant Sequoias</a>, native to a small area of the Sierra Nevada. They never lived in OR (at least within the last few thousand years, unsure about potential fossils).</p>
<p>The third extant species, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasequoia_glyptostroboides" target="_blank">Metasequoia</a>, is native to China. It was known as a fossil in OR before it was discovered alive in China. All three now grow as ornamentals in coastal OR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reverse is also true.  Starting around 150 years ago, people brought blue gum eucalyptus trees to California, with the idea that they would create a lumber industry from that.  It turned out be an ill-considered venture, since eucalyptus apparently doesn't make good lumber until it is very old.  But blue gum spreads well here in California, in part because it has few natural pests to keep it in check.  Today, blue gum is considered an invasive species here.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in New Zealand, I was told there are very few native forests, and a lot of the trees are a species of pine from the US - lodgepole maybe? Forests are managed from planting depending on their intended purpose - lumber or pulp. Sadly the same is true in Canada but you would never know it. Most &quot;wild&quot; areas have been logged at least once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in New England where the old growth forests are long gone.  That said the existing land is now about 88% forest, the vast majority of which is from the last 150 years.   It's kind of crazy when you think about it.  Only 5% of the forests are &quot;natural&quot;.</p>
<p>Also - the population continued to grow during that time, the only thing that really changed for the forest to come is that the farms left.</p></div>		</li>
