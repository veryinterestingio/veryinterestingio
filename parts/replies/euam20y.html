			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another layer to this. Soap is the potassium salt of a fatty acid and is reasonably soluble in water. Calcium or magnesium in your &quot;hard&quot; tap water can can bond with the fatty acid and that stuff is poorly soluble in water, it gets deposited on surfaces as &quot;soap scum.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK on a basic level dish and body soap work the same way so it should wash dishes to an extent. However, body soap is formulated to be less effective at stripping oil so as not to completely strip the natural oils on the skin. It is also often perfumed and may contain moisturiser. So whilst it will probably wash the dishes, they may end up with a nice scent and a thin layer of moisturiser on them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, body soap is still a mild soap, with its same chemical properties.  Just donâ€™t experiment with putting body wash in the dishwasher.  Your brand may have too many surfactants (chemicals that reduce surface tension), and you would have a crazy amount of bubbles foaming out of your dishwasher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally, soap is &quot;happy&quot; to be in the water. It's having such a good time that it brings some oil molecules with it (remember, water and oil usually don't mix. Soap changes that).</p>
<p>Until one day some calcium comes along, and it's like soap has met its soulmate. It's no longer happy dissolved in water, instead it wants to live the rest of the days in a 1-to-1 monogamous relationship with calcium, stuck to the side of your bath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classic soap is sodium+stearate. Stearate is both water-soluble and oil-soluble because one side of the molecule is a long chain (oils soluble) while the other side is a carboxylate salt (water soluble). Sodium ionizes with the carboxylate salt side and can only do so with one molecule at a time. </p>
<p>If calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are hanging around in your water (&quot;hard&quot; water) these molecules want to grab the stearate too--but Ca and Mg don't just want to grab one stearate. <em>Each Mg or Ca atom wants to grab 2 stearate molecules!</em> The resulting molecule is one big long chain with Mg or Ca in the middle. This is magnesium stearate or calcium stearate (AKA &quot;soap scum&quot;). The fact that it's now a long chain makes it oil soluble only, so you need a special cleaner that won't be broken down by your hard water to wash it away without leaving any residue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the actual answer. The resulting magnesium and calcium stearates are very poorly soluable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its important to note there is not one single study that shows anti bacterial soap removes any more bacteria than normal soap. This is exactly why the FDA said they cant put it the label or advertise it anymore in many cases. Not even surgeons use antibacterial soap to scrub up because they understand the most important aspect is mechanically removing dirt and grime, not chemically killing anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its not dissolved. its in an emulsion. Fat is insoluble in water, because the water molecules are polar, while the fat molecules are not. imagine it as if theres a sea of magnets and wooden chips. the magnets would stick together because of the magnetic forces acting on them, pushing the wooden chips away.</p>
<p>Soap on the other hand has one non-polar end, and a polar end, so it can easily stay with one end among the fat molecules without getting pushed away and one end in the water molecules. Effectively it creates a more stable film between the two phases that means you can disperse the fat in the water phase to such an extent that it appears to be a single phase, not two, as it really is, think really small bubbles of fat.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the reason it gets stuck to the ceramic, is because the soap can also adhere to the wall, so in stead of creating a film around the entirety of the fat globule, when hitting the wall, parts of this film will rather adhere to the wall in stead, making a bubble cut at the interface with the fat and grease in contact with the wall. like you've probably seen bubbles stick to the wall before,  when you wash the soap away, this fat is left behind. Which is why you see a rind of dirt at the water height after taking a dirty bath.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I dont think germs have &quot;grip&quot; of any sort. its rather the fact that by washing away the stuff the germs are in, you essentially wash away the germs too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Making a note for you if interested:</p>
<p>Bacteria have &quot;grip&quot; in the form of a capsule, film, or extracelular Matrix (or a combination of them). </p>
<p>Depending on which of these they have, sometimes a bacteria may be found in someplace or another, for example: there is a kind of bacteria we always search for in the tip of a central venous catheter (or most any catheter) because it has usually colonized it and propagates from there: staphylococcus epidermidis</p></div>		</li>
