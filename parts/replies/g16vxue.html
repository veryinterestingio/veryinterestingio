			<div class="markdown"><p>You may have just explained the strange looking spider I saw.</p>
<p>It has set up shop right next to a very large colony of harvester ants I have. The ants are sneaky and some of them keep figuring out a way to escape, at which point the spider makes quick work of them. She usually always has a couple of ants in her web. </p>
<p>I've been wondering if she was some different kind of spider from what I usually see around the house since her abdomen is so large and round, but now I'm thinking she may just be really well fed.</p></div>		</li>
