<p>Then point was you could teach fear for anything with the electric shock. But only with certain things (snakes, spiders, and theoretically other phobias) did the fear persisted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't trust this study. The fear of spiders is completely different from the fear a shock gives you. When you do something that often results in negative stimulus, you start feeling that negative stimulus whenever you do whatever it was associated with, which is different than the fear of spiders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is related to movement, and the ability for something to move around/get on you. The brain/eyes are very good at picking up movement in the full field of vision, so you see these insects and your brain marks it as a small, moving potential threat and induces the flight or flight mechanism</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But most spiders and snakes can't actively cause harm. There are basically 3 or so species of spider in each major geographic location that can really hurt you, and very few spider bites can actually kill you.</p>
<p>Snakes are pretty similar depending on the area. There really aren't that many venomous snakes out there that can kill you. When you factor in the agressiveness of each species the numbers are even lower.</p>
<p>Most bears on the other hand, can totally fuck you up and will kill you if you get in the way of them and what they want. Mountain lions and large cats, even more dangerous. If you see a Mountain lion on the trail you're already in a bunch of trouble.</p>
<p>But for the latter nearly every kid has a cuddly stuffed animal of one of them. And there are countless children's shows and movies featuring these animals as the heroic protagonist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a <a href="https://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v17/n1/full/nn.3594.html" target="_blank">Nature Neuroscience article on the subject with mice in 2014</a>, as well. In summary, mice can inherit behaviors trans-generationally, even when genes are fertilized into a group not exposed to the new behavior themselves.</p>
<p>Iirc, there have also been studies with rhesus macaques that showed an instinctual fear of specific object patterns that resembled predators that the macaque group hadn't been exposed to for generations. There is a particular group of macaque monkey this has been tested again in, I believe on an island off Puerto Rico. But I can't swear to the specifics of those studies, because it was something I watched in a Physical Anthropology years ago. A deep research dig would probably be required to find those specific studies.</p>
<p>At a cursory dig, I did find one showing that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2230660" target="_blank">macaques have been shown to selectively develop a fear of snakes</a>. It's dated back to 1990, so I'm not sure if it's been replicated since.</p>
<p>So it's not beyond the possible that phobias are trans-generationally inherited in larger mammals like humans. But studying this sort of things with humans is difficult, and suitably so, since the Belmont Report.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to phobias but some traits are absolutely inherited trans-generationally in humans! It's via environmental disruption to epigenetic reprogramming during sensitive periods. I just finished a course in epigenetics that covered this topic ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's more. At least one study suggests that fear of spiders is truly hardwired: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6014324_Do_Infants_Possess_an_Evolved_Spider-Detection_Mechanism" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6014324_Do_Infants_Possess_an_Evolved_Spider-Detection_Mechanism</a></p>
<p>This would mean that similarly to animals, also humans have pre-existing environmental information in their brains at birth. Not at all surprising, but still fascinating.</p></div>		</li>
