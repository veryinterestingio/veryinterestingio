			<div class="markdown"><p>I had my fingertip cut off in a gnarley paint sprayer accident. Carried it with me to urgent care and a doctor sewed it back on. A nurse threw up in the sink which made it awkward (it was her first week I guess) and anyways it looked gross. I asked him this same question and he just chuckled at me like probably. After about two weeks it was like my finger shed its outermost layer not unlike a snake would and undersea th was this soft misshapen little nub. Not it looks normal enough but the fingerprint is wacky and has big lines through it and my fingernail. Grows like rock pushing out of skin it’s fucking weird looking.</p>
<p>Edit: you really wanna see it? Here me trying to show it while it’s stupid cold and in my car lol kinda hard to get close enough where it doesn’t blur but I tried  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5u0yEol.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/5u0yEol.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ayyyy. That's a good one. </p>
<p>My nail is wonky, but not as bad as yours. </p>
<p>I had a crush injury (dropped a dumbbell on top of another dumbbell. Partially sleeved my pinkie. Crushed the joint, broke distal phalange diagonally (distal to the extensor attachment, proximal to the flexor attachment) and it healed all wrong and doesn't straighten any more. Plus the palm side is a lump of scar tissue</p>
<p>At least yours still bends and shit!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah luckily mines just got desleeved or whatever and hung on by the nail cuticle. Had the bone crushed that pain would have been awful, hurt enough with basically just peeling the bottom portion of the pointer tip off lol. Worst part was I had an issue with pain medicine so when I went in and they offered me opiates I had to decline. He told me a local wouldn’t do much for me but that was the only other option so I took it. I always compare it to getting a tattoo... it was that same sensation of like scratching an area raw, just very uncomfortable but not super painful I guess?</p></div>		</li>

<p>you don’t get to wear gloves when you’re fingerprinted. change your fingerprints after your fingerprints go into a nationwide database.</p></div>		</li>
