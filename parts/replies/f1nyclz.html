			<div class="markdown"><p>A question diving deeper into this: How does one, who purchases a stolen piece of art, get away with having it in their collection? Wouldnt people notice the famous painting, recent stolen, is hanging up in their host's house? I would also assume people who buy stolen art dont display it publicly...but then what's the point of having the art?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bask in the private knowledge and laugh at everyone who points out flaws where the reproducer messed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cant answer the first question, but I can answer the point of having it with a winner of a quote from my rich bitch high-school classmate:</p>
<p>&quot;I dont buy these things because I can afford them, I buy these things because <em>you</em> can't&quot;.</p>
<p>It's not about the thing, it's about being the only one to have the thing.  And the only people who would see it, will care less that it's stolen, and more that you have something they can't have, because the only thing a rich person can't have is something there's only one of.</p></div>		</li>
