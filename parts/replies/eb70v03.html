			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think so. It takes time for your body to recognize it as “hey, this sound isn’t trying to kill me”, so that’s why it works for a period of time. I’ve heard that if you change alarm sounds, it’ll become more effective. </p>
<p>(Not a doctor or anything, just what works with me and my understanding)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly. That’s why you might need to change the sound of your alarm if you start to get used to it. </p>
<p>I used to use pleasant music to wake me up, but eventually I started sleeping right through it. Now I have the blaring default iPhone alarm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My second alarm is pleasant music. My first one is more jarring, I think? To get me out of the deeper sleep. The pleasant music for the second one is to ease me out of my final sleep, and then the third one, more jarring again, to tell me to get my ass out of bed now that I've taken some me time to wake up gradually. User to just have the first two, but I'd dink around in bed, reading to wake up and forget to actually get up and out, so the third, I'm already awake, it's just telling me to move it or I'll be late if I don't start getting ready.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like my brain is 'trained' to listen out for my alarm. If I wake up earlier, I get anxious at every sound that sounds like the first second of my alarm. It's like my brains is a dog itching to hear a command.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just wanted to add - not only if it's a threat, but if it's deemed important. there was an experiment on the sound level required to wake kids up using an alarm clock and their mother's voice. The mother's voice needed much less volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me the most effective alarm sound ever, even at a really low volume, is the sound of a dog vomitting. Nothing gets me out of my bed that fast. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aw! My mom used to wake me up gently every day (cause alarms didn’t work for me).
Ima tell her this this Christmas - maybe it will all feel more worth it to her to know that. Haha </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exact opposite for me. I tell people not to wake me. I don't respond well to humans waking me up, esp if it's not an emergency. It makes me grouchy. I don't gaf if my alarm wakes me - it does it on time and does it effectively. </p>
<p>People feel my wrath and get upset by how I treat them when I wake up, before my filter is in place. I don't like being woken up, so I can be mean in the mornings. I don't even know I've been mean or rude. I have no real recollection of that, but I know it makes me hate the person.</p></div>		</li>
