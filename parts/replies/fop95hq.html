			<div class="markdown"><p>Well done. I was hoping to open the thread and find a human or the earth just happened to be in the middle. Turned out our arguably most important cell is in that spot.</p>
<p>Those coincidences that happen to fall into what would otherwise be dismissed as anthropocentric bias always catch my interest.</p>
<p>Interestingly... the entire universe is significantly bigger than the observable universe. Sadly, theories do not include one a billion times larger than the observable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah unfortunately it is probably a coincidence. If nothing else, the observable universe is expanding while the Planck length is definitely not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that’s just it, right? We only observe perfect conditions because we wouldn’t exist if they weren’t perfect. Or, put another way, the fact that conditions are perfect for our existence isn’t a coincidence precisely because it is the reason <em>for</em> our existence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was strange that we could surf waves on the sea: that they were at a scale that worked for us. </p>
<p>Ten times smaller or bigger and they would t work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean... The ones we surf are. There are places with little to no surfable waves because they are too big or too small. We don't surf in those places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heck, they don't even surf in the places that sometimes have surfable waves at times when the waves are too big or too small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, to be fair, plenty of things are out of our scale, and because of that, we never think of them.</p>
<p>We could have fully active volcanoes as our space heaters, the ability to lift 30x our body sizes over our heads like ants, the ability to leap between planets, or landmasses so large that we would never run out.</p>
<p>The joys of coincidences is we can always expect more!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there are waves that are bigger and smaller. There's thousands of beaches all over the world that don't have good surfing waves. Deep sea waves in storms can be towering, and there's plenty of massive wave spots on beaches and reefs famous for killing people surfing on them. </p>
<p>We made surfing to fit the waves, that's why it works so well.</p></div>		</li>
