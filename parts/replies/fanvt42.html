			<div class="markdown"><p>When I saw this post, I thought, &quot;That's a good question.&quot; Then I see the first comment is seemingly very well thought out and see that it's because cows are ruminant animals and did a facepalm.  </p>
<p>I still want to know the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of ruminant, efficient ruminants and non-efficient ruminants. A cow is an efficient ruminant which can completely break gown grass and fibers. This leaves their stool unsolid or the so called 'cow patty'. Non efficient ruminants are animals like deer and to some extent sheep. These animals somewhat breakdown grass and fibers but not fully. This leaves behind a more solid fibrous stool that is more round and spherical in shape</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They gave an answer though. Less fiber, on account of them digesting it. Fiber is responsible for structural integrity in plants. It does similar things to fesces, including human.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After doing a little research, it looks like it does have to do with water content. Smaller ruminants for the most part lived in high areas where water was more scarce and they had to absorb as much as they could. They were also more vulnerable while drinking water. Cows lived in the lowlands and had fewer natural predators so they didnt have to worry about absorbing as much water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may not look that way on the surface, but cows REALLY don't have many things capable of hunting them. </p>
<p>They can weigh 1,500-2,000 pounds full grown and kick hard enough to pulverize the head of literally any animal on Earth with their fairly sharp cloven hooves. They also generally congregate in groups of 20+ if not 200+ if not separated by outside influences. </p>
<p>What predator is capable of hunting such a beast when it's backed by another 100 of its own kind? The answer is not many. Wolves, coyotes, and cougars often find themselves trampled or kicked to death at the end of their hunting attempts.</p>
<p>As a result, wild cattle got to hang out wherever the fuck they felt like hanging out. Which meant they stayed by the water and left giant sloppy shits because they don't have to worry about a lack of access to water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cows are so neat. I love how they have this symbiotic relationship with the bacteria which digest their food. They are like a giant moving chamber of bacteria, and it really makes me wonder who’s in charge sometimes, the cow or the bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My (limited and completely assailable) understanding is that we primarily break down our foods by chemical means (acids and enzymes) and that flora in the gut is secondary, changing as a result of what we eat.  </p>
<p>For ruminants like cows, it is a primary means of digestion as bacteria are the only thing that can digest cellulose, which they turn into short chain fatty acids and other stuff that the cow can digest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid I toured the university of Saskatchewan veterinary dept. and they had a cow with a plug in it’s side. You put on arm length rubber gloves and you could put you arm directly into its stomach and feel around. Cow was chillin. Then they would take your glove and put it under a microscope and show you the bacteria zipping around. It was awesome.</p></div>		</li>
