<p>We also know gas giant structure, because of physics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kind of a strange answer, all of the answers we have are because of physics. </p>
<p>To expand on gas giant core structure, one measurement we were able to do was measure the speed of our probes orbiting them. If they had a solid core, we would expect the speed to stay relatively constant because the density of the planet underneath the probe would be more-or-less uniform which would mean a constant speed.</p>
<p>What we actually found was that the speed of the probe fluctuated as it orbited. This points to the core being a state of matter in between liquid / solid with larger fluctuations in density leading to variations in gravity and therefore variations in the orbiting probes speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for elaborating. This brings me to a new question - reading your comment reminded me of the difference in spinning a hard boiled egg vs a raw egg. So wouldn't the core consistency have a greater impact on the rotational speed instead of the orbiting speed? Also does this &quot;imbalance&quot; lead to a reduction in speed/rotation over time due to the liquid core creating friction against the solid parts of the planet?</p>
<p>EDIT: I am sorry, I was too fast and totally misunderstood your comment. The speed of the probe was fluctuating, not the orbital speed of the planet itself! Got it.</p>
<p>So maybe a better question would be if the orbital or rotational speed of a planet is fluctuating at all like in the egg example?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you need to avoid the raw egg thought, it's my understanding that the core of an egg refuses to catch up to the velocity of the edges, and robs energy from the system as any imperfections in the motion and especially the oval shape change rotational momentum into core undulations and redistributions until uniform. Basically backwards for what you're looking for with planets unless you're looking at brand new planets, I guess. But all of it is very different from eggs because the planets are round due to 'hydrostatic equilibrium', like surface tension for granular or regularly deformed solids holding the object as round as possible, with any rotation adding to the equatorial bulge while eggs are oval because of the hardened shell and organ from which it's sourced.</p>
<p>As far as I know, only the earth is affected by a slight change in rotational speed caused by the friction from the tides from the moon's orbit. I think the gas giants are too large relative to their satellites to gain a similar effect.</p></div>		</li>
