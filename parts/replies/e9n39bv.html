			<div class="markdown"><p>Huhahh agreed. Just some further elaboration upon the Santa Ana Winds Mr. u/BONERSTORM: </p>
<pre><code>        I actually wrote a whole paper on Santa Ana winds and what they are in my air quality management class. They are what is called Katabatic winds. They come from, like you said, up from the mountains and pick up speed downhill going from high pressure to low pressure areas picking up a lot of dry air in the desert along the way not to mention a lot of particles - dust, sand Etc. They can get incredibly fast up to 100 even 120 mph! They don't fuck around! Thus they also cause bad allergies and people to just simply feel "off" during these events. No wonder LA's air quality is shitty, and possibly people wise...</code></pre></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Joan Didion, in her essay &quot;Los Angeles Notebook&quot; wrote the most accurate and lovely description of the Santa Ana winds and what it felt like when I was a kid:</p>
<p>There is something uneasy in the Los Angeles air this afternoon, some unnatural
stillness, some tension. What it means is that tonight a Santa Ana will begin to
blow, a hot wind from the northeast whining down through the Cajon and San
Gorgonio Passes, blowing up sand storms out along Route 66, drying the hills and the nerves to flash point. For a few days now we will see smoke back in the
canyons, and hear sirens in the night. I have neither heard nor read that a Santa Ana is due, but I know it, and almost everyone I have seen today knows it too. We know it because we feel it. The baby frets. The maid sulks. I rekindle a waning argument with the telephone company, then cut my losses and lie down, given over to whatever it is in the air.
To live with the Santa Ana is to accept, consciously or unconsciously, a deeply mechanistic view of human behavior. I recall being told, when I first moved to Los Angeles and was living on an isolated beach, that the Indians would throw themselves into the sea when the bad wind blew. I could see why. The Pacific turned ominously glossy during a Santa Ana period, and one woke in the night troubled not only by the peacocks screaming in
the olive trees but by the eerie absence of surf. The heat was surreal. The sky had a
yellow cast, the kind of light sometimes called &quot;earthquake weather.&quot; My only
neighbor would not come out of her house for days, and there were no lights at
night, and her husband roamed the place with a machete. One day he would tell me
that he had heard a trespasser, the next a rattlesnake.
&quot;On nights like that,&quot; Raymond Chandler once wrote about the Santa Ana, &quot;every
booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and
study their husbands' necks. Anything can happen.&quot; That was the kind of wind it
was. I did not know then that there was any basis for the effect it had on all of us,
but it turns out to be another of those cases in which science bears out folk
wisdom. The Santa Ana, which is named for one of the canyons it rushers through,
is foehn wind, like the foehn of Austria and Switzerland and the hamsin of Israel.
There are a number of persistent malevolent winds, perhaps the best know of
which are the mistral of France and the Mediterranean sirocco, but a foehn wind
has distinct characteristics: it occurs on the leeward slope of a mountain range and,
although the air begins as a cold mass, it is warmed as it comes down the mountain
and appears finally as a hot dry wind. Whenever and wherever foehn blows,
doctors hear about headaches and nausea and allergies, about &quot;nervousness,&quot; about
&quot;depression.&quot; In Los Angeles some teachers do not attempt to conduct formal
classes during a Santa Ana, because the children become unmanageable. In
Switzerland the suicide rate goes up during the foehn, and in the courts of some
Swiss cantons the wind is considered a mitigating circumstance for crime.
Surgeons are said to watch the wind, because blood does not clot normally during a
foehn. A few years ago an Israeli physicist discovered that not only during such
winds, but for the ten or twelve hours which precede them, the air carries an
unusually high ratio of positive to negative ions. No one seems to know exactly
why that should be; some talk about friction and others suggest solar disturbances.
In any case the positive ions are there, and what an excess of positive ions does, in
the simplest terms, is make people unhappy. One cannot get much more
mechanistic than that. </p></div>		</li>
