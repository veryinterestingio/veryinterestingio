Unfortunately, it has been difficult to prove consistent desired effects for many existing probiotics/prebiotics (but there are several exceptions). This is likely due, in part, to the fact that many probiotics and prebiotics will have different impacts in the contexts of different microbiota. In addition to personalization issues, many existing probiotics are 'grandfathered' into the market because they are listed as GRAS (generally regarded as safe)  by the FDA due to their presence in existing foods (e.g. yogurt, cheese, sour kraut, kombucha, etc.). Most of these organisms are not abundant in the adult human gut microbiome. Sadly, many of the 'good' bugs that are important and abundant in the gut (e.g. Faecalibacterium prauznitzii or Akkermansia muciniphila) are not GRAS and would require Phase I safety trials before they could be given to people (making them much more expensive than traditional probiotics). However, these 'next generation' probiotics are likely to be much more useful. Here's a recent perspective piece that goes over these issues in more detail: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31061539/" target="_blank"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31061539/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31061539/</a></a></p>

<p>Some more, sci-fi, futuristic approaches are to simulate the metabolic capacities of complex microbiota, in order to infer the impacts of personalized pro-/pre-biotic interventions on a given person's gut ecology. For example, Dr. Christian Diener (in my lab) has developed such a model (<a href="https://micom-dev.github.io/micom/index.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://micom-dev.github.io/micom/index.html" target="_blank">https://micom-dev.github.io/micom/index.html</a></a>). However, these approaches have not yet been validated in human cohorts, so their usefulness is TBD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add that regulation on these is very very new. some bacteria die off faster than others, they could have been handled improperly and there’s no one really regulating it-even those who are regulating it -NSF-only look at the presence of the ‘right stuff’ as opposed to the concentration or health of the right stuff. Is it really helpful if you only get 3 live but sickly bacteria in a pill as opposed to 30,000  strong versions. Well that regulation is changing -always look for NSF Tested probiotics</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question but  a loaded one. You need to look into the strains, how they have been documented, what they have been shown to do and what the expected benefit is. We need to stop generalizing and calling everything probiotic.If I have a headache I would task aspirin not a statin - both are drugs. Because too many companies are not doing research on strains and products, the medical field has an element of cynicism if not skepticism. Sadly, some taint the whole field as bogus when it is clearly not. The clinical guide is helpful although not exhaustive. <a href="https://www.usprobioticguide.com" target="_blank">www.usprobioticguide.com</a> or <a href="https://www.probioticchart.ca" target="_blank">www.probioticchart.ca</a> </p>
<p>Prebiotics, again as defined substances, do offer benefits but again the type and dose are important</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I do have a follow up on this one question. Are there tests that a doctor could do to find a probiotic that is beneficial to an individual vs buying OTC? Is this something that a dietician would be able to direct patients towards?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to second u/Suspicious_Dinner_31 here and say that in theory, both should be helpful, but they are both surprisingly unregulated markets, so there's a very low bar (when there is any bar) to selling something as &quot;probiotic&quot; or &quot;prebiotic.&quot; I've definitely seen some probiotics with strains in them that straight up will not stick around, or presumably do anything health-wise, in a human. There is now a lot of research doing clinical trials using probiotics or prebiotics to treat specific conditions/try to make specific health outcomes, and while those are largely unsuccessful endeavors, there are some promising cases to treat things like chemotherapy-induced gut issues.</p></div>		</li>
