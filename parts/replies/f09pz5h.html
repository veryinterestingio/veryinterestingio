			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's a &quot;differential&quot; problem. It's still a problem of the amount of pressure. </p>
<p>If you dive to 140ft, that's roughly 77psi. Yes it's all over your body, but it's relatively low amount regarding crushing force.</p>
<p>A 5gal bucket is roughly 10&quot; diameter on the bottom. That's roughly 79 square inches. 5 gallons of water weighs roughly 41.7lbs. if you drop that bucket from 10 feet, the force applied to say a person, is roughly 20,016lbs. But this is exerted over 79sq inches of bucket, which is around 253psi, or like diving to 550 feet. </p>
<p>Also absolute pressure doesnt mean there's pressure all around you. At 100ft, there's 4 bar absolute pressure. 3 bar water pressure (1 bar per 33feet), plus the 1 bar of atmospheric pressure applied to the water at sea level. </p>
<p>The only reason a &quot;differential&quot; of pressure would kill you vs all-around pressure is because the smaller surface area creates MORE pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. A Barrell crushes you by the kinetic energy it enforces on your body. Water pressure doesn't crush you not because it pushes on all sides of you but because your body can push back with enough force to balance it. If you dive deep enough the pressure all around you will certainly make you implode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. How is the kinetic energy 'enforced' onto your body? Via pressure.... Pressure is just force /area over which the force is applied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the question was  - can microbes get crushed -  so op could’ve “wrapped up” the answer, if you will,  with a line about whether there’s a scenario in day-to-day life where microbes can be subject to pressure differential.</p>
<p>Still a decent answer regardless,  send nudes.</p></div>		</li>
