			<div class="markdown"><p>This and utilizing alternating current over direct current (also AC can handily use transformers to easily convert voltages which helps immensely). This is a fantastic answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, high voltage direct current is actually more efficient than high voltage alternating current. The issue is that converting voltage is so much less efficient for DC that it completely overtakes the advantages of using DC for power transmission.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, just as efficient, only much harder and therefore more expensive than AC until recently.</p>
<p>New technology has enabled the construction of HVDC lines, which don't create problems with offset phases when transferring power between regional grids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Current Wars between Westinghouse/Tesla and J.P. Morgan/Edison were fought because of this very principle. Which method would become the standard method of power transmission (and get its providers filthy rich)?</p>
<p>Edison famously electrocuted a circus elephant named Topsy with Alternating Current in a bid to prove how dangerous it was (and also filmed it with his movie camera), but ultimately AC won out because of the reasons you mentioned: easy and efficient-enough step-up and step-down to high voltages that make transmission less power intensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second to last sentence in the second paragraph is a tad confusing at first. If you increase the voltage, you increase the current. If you convert between the two with a transformer then you can decrease current and increase voltage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transformers are a bit different and might seem a bit counterintuitive. The linked article discusses them in more detail but your question can be answered with the conservation of energy. You can never create or destroy energy. Thus, since Power = Voltage * Current, you have to decrease current if you increase voltage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the physics/engineering well. Normally, if you increase voltage in a circuit you will also increase the current and the power. It is only in this specific situation that you are trading the two with P=IV. </p>
<p>Since this was ELI5 I didnâ€™t want other readers thinking that higher voltage always resulted in less current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water pressure is proportional to height (or more precisely, depth below the surface), so it's more intuitive to think of a transmission line as a river of water suspended in the sky. This sky-river carries the same amount of water as regular river, but when you let the sky-water fall back to the ground, each drop releases a huge amount of energy.</p>
<p>Note that the point of this river is to transport energy, not water.</p></div>		</li>
