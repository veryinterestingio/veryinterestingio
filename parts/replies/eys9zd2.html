			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe? I scuba dive a lot and out on the water if a storm forms most people I know would rather jump in the water. Can’t tell there are 10 ft waves 100 ft under the surface. </p>
<p>I’d presume marine life does the same but I don’t honestly know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine (&quot;deep sea&quot;, edit: meaning oceanic as opposed to coastal/land edit edit: deeper than 100m, see below) mammals just avoid them altogether, their habitat ranges are much bigger than the size of a hurricane</p>
<p>edit: <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/hurricanes-sea-life.html" target="_blank">https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/hurricanes-sea-life.html</a> (thanks to /u/FerricDonkey)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a storm churns across the ocean, the warm surface waters provide additional moisture and can fuel the storm into a hurricane. As the hurricane grows larger and more potent, it can generate waves as high as 18.3 meters, tossing and mixing warmer surface waters with the colder, saltier water below. <strong>The resulting currents can extend as far as 91.5 meters below the surface</strong>, wreaking deadly havoc on marine life.</p>
<p>If the wild currents fail to break up coral reefs in their path, the rain-infused water they bring reduces salt levels and otherwise stresses corals. As the hurricane moves toward shore, the underwater tumult can cause shifting sands and muddy shallow waters, blocking the essential sunlight on which corals and other sea creatures rely.</p>
<p>Slow-moving fish and turtles and shellfish beds are often decimated by the rough undercurrents and rapid changes in water temperature and salinity wrought by a hurricane. <strong>Sharks, whales, and other large animals swiftly move to calmer waters, however, and, generally speaking, are not overly affected by hurricanes.</strong></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im no expert but most animals are pretty decent at knowing when a storm is coming on land, wouldnt whales and dolphins have the same sense in theory? Natural selection probably at play here.</p></div>		</li>
