			<div class="markdown"><p>the speed of sound is the propagation speed of vibrations of audible frequencies in air, and is actually different for each frequency. If your wavelength is comparable to the height of the medium, different physics (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_waves" target="_blank">Lamb waves</a>) is needed to accurately describe the propagation</p></div>		</li>
