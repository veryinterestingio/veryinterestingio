			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this a bit, the reason that red and green light combine to look yellow is a bit of an optical illusion that's caused by the way our eyes work.</p>
<p>Eyes have 3 different cone cells that detect different colors of light (red, green, and blue).  But while the cells are most active when seeing their preferred color, they can be partially activated by colors that are nearby in the spectrum.  When you look at something yellow in real life, like a banana, you're seeing true yellow light (~580 nm), but since yellow falls between red and green, both your red and green cells become partially active.  But when you look at a picture of a banana on a computer screen, there is no yellow light at all.  There is only red and green.  But because the same cells are active in your eye, your brain sees the colors as the same.</p>
<p>Different animals have different types of cones, and therefore see combinations of colors differently.  You might be amazed at how realistic the images on your TV and computer can be, but your pets are probably baffled by all the crazy surreal colors you enjoy staring at for long periods of time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this one more, what’s really interesting is that magenta as a color does not exist as a light wavelength. </p>
<p>Our brains make it up when the cones in our eyes receive a combination of red wavelengths at one end of the spectrum and purple from the other end of the spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this has anything to do with how magenta makes me feel. Sounds weird and I never really thought about it before now, but if you ask me my favorite color I’ll usually think green. I don’t feel any enthusiasm or passion for green (or any color in particular, really), but I like it and want the question to be answered. It just occurred to me though, that whenever I’ve stopped to look at magenta for as long as I can remember, it’s almost like I’m impressed by it. I love it like girls love hot pink but there’s always been something more about magenta. I wonder if all this time it’s been because my brain is doing something different and it somehow takes me by surprise every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you could actually measure it but logically how do you know that it is true yellow light vs the banana reflecting the right amount of only red and green to make us think it is yellow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like you said, by measuring it.  There's no way to logically <em>prove</em> the exact true color of something using just our eyes, because our eyes are easily fooled.</p>
<p>Edit: One experiment you could do would be to find a filter that lets true yellow light pass, but reflects all other colors.  If you looked at a banana through the filter it would still look yellow, but the computer screen would appear blank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the banana doesn't only reflect yellow wavelengths. It absorbs almost all the blue, but reflects some of the red and green along with all the yellow. So the light that hits your retina isn't just yellow wavelength but a bell curve of the adjacent wavelengths. You can test this by looking at the banana under red light or green light. It will appear red or green respectively, but it will appear black under blue light since it doesn't reflect the blue.</p>
<p>Sunlight bouncing off of a green leaf will contain primarily green wavelengths, but also blend of other wavelengths.</p>
<p>Our eyes will perceive colors based on combinations of wavelengths, which is precisely why we can trick our brains into seeing yellow by combining a bit of red with a bit of green.</p>
<p>Edit: I didn't really answer your question. I don't know if there are materials that appear yellow but don't reflect much yellow light. I was going to guess that materials like to reflect specific wavelengths and adjacent wavelengths. But purple objects reflect opposite ends of the visible spectrum, so I don't know. Coming back to the OP's question, mixing red and blue paint gives purple, but mixing red and green paint gives brown. It might have something to do with their bell curves overlapping. But then again, yellow+blue gives green, so I'm at a loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>would this mean a species with receptor cells tuned to true yellow wavelength would see weird non-color when they see our computer screen the same way our brain glitched out purple/magenta colors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because it's not absorbing everything because materials aren't perfect in their absorption.  If they were, making an invisibility suit would be quite easy!</p>
<p>The red paint isn't perfect and only reflecting a single wavelength of red, but many, many wavelengths of different colours, just &quot;mostly&quot; red.  The green is the same.  So when mixed they overlap and absorb lots of stuff but they're still reflecting <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise everything would appear to look like Vantablack... a substance that reflects almost no light at all.</p></div>		</li>
