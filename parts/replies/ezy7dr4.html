			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing has changed except the methods. As a cyber security specialist, its truly SHOCKING how blissfully ignorant the OVERWHELMINGLY VAST majority of the human species is when it comes to best practice digital security. Our entire society runs off of digital infrastructure now, and NOBODY understands how it works. And that's frankly just a side-effect of the technological explosion over the past 50 years. We went from digital enterprise being a pipe dream, to complete societal reliance on digital infrastructure in less than a generation. </p>
<p>The only thing that has changed are a few regulatory requirements for establishments that handle sensitive information (HIPAA, PII, etc) and even still, its on THEM to establish and maintain compliance with federal regulations.</p>
<p>What makes it worse, is that the majority of IT professionals in work today still don't have any clue what they are doing. That's how fast the field is evolving. The people who are supposed to be experts are still trying to catch up. </p>
<p>Which makes the internet the new wild west for cyber criminals. Which is why I have a job, haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. HTTPS is secure as long as the device you're using is one that you can believe hasn't been tampered with. I would recommend not doing banking on a device that someone besides you controls (like a work laptop or a public computer).</p>
<p>HTTPS is designed to protect data between you and the server even if the connection itself can't be trusted. The only way it should fail is if either the server or client has been compromised.</p>
<p>When I was in University, I know for a fact all the campus computers had a custom root CA so they could block certain sites e.g. This also means they could impersonate any site and spy on any traffic, if they choose to be malicious. But they couldn't do that to my personal laptop that didn't have their certificate installed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. If encrypted properly its not trivial to steal sensitive information (other than IP addresses and amount of data) on a secured or unsecured network.
When using HTTPS the client and server perform a TLS Handshake in which both machines exchange information (among it are supported versions, certificates and randomly generated strings). This exchange is unencrypted and easily interceptable. The client then encrypts a message called &quot;premaster secret&quot; with the servers public key (so that only the server can see the message). Based on the previously exchanged random strings and the premaster secret, both client and server generate a new session key which they will use for symmetric encryption from there on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. HTTPS is quite secure. An open WiFi network is just nice convenience for accessing the data, but it should be assumed that any information going over the internet is accessible by the bad guys with or without WiFi.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's so true. Network security is the future, and even the specialists are just constantly chasing that one elusive fly in your bedroom in the middle of the night. And even when they do catch it, there's suddenly another one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there somewhere I can go, take a class or watch a video to learn the basics of security and whatnot? The other day a friend of mine said that she was advised to purchase an ipad, or device that is used exclusively for online banking and she wasn't to use that ipad to login into any other website other than her bank. First of all, is this even a good idea? I would like to learn the basic steps I should take to protect myself is. Maybe there is an online course where I could learn.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lol wut? That's ridiculous. That Ipad is going to send and receive data the exact same way any other piece of hardware will. It all runs (largely) off of the same basic protocols. Really, The only way to protect yourself is through gaining awareness. Honestly, you can take online course if you really want to, and if that is more effective for you personally. But you can also just browse YouTube and Google for a ton of information also. And that's free. There is an absurd amount of information available on best practice security on the internet with just a quick google search.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, plenty are using plain text to store your passwords.  I had a scholarship that requires me to keep them updated for 10 years post graduation. So they send out this survey every year through some 3rd party website. I forgot my password and click on the forgot password link.  I was emailed my password.  This should never happen. Any website with even the most basic security should save a hashed version of your password. This is why you always have to change your password rather than the website just telling you...the website doesn't even know your password...it only knows the hashed version of your password.  Made my blood boil. They still haven't gotten back....the platform is:  </p>
