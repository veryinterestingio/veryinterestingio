<p>My sister killed herself. GPA dropped like 20%, failed 1 class. Had to graduate the year after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't thank you enough for posting this.  I am due to take a polygraph for a job interview next week.  I have never taken a polygraph test before.  I have already been sent the paperwork for the pre-polygraph, and I spilled my guts about everything bad I ever did (mostly drugs in college).  Since the paperwork is sitting on my desk, may I take the hint that I should reprint it and leave most (almost all - if not all) of that stuff out?
I want this job so badly!  Should I disclose anything?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No! Don't include drug history just deny deny deny. They do this to you on probation give you a paper and let you tell on yourself then read it word for word in court to see how long you should be on probation. I about cried as a big bearded criminal because they tell you the truth is a good thing and then they use it all agaisnt you and you gave it all to them..I'm tearing up now..sons of bitches..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you 6 months out of college, and your drug use in college was frequent or impacted your ability to function?  Or are you a decade out of college, your drug use in college was marijuana while playing video games, and you haven't used anything since?</p>
<p>In the first case, don't you agree that it's reasonable your prospective employer would want to take that sort of behavior into account when reviewing your and others' applications?</p>
<p>In the second, don't you agree that, if the employer will be as great an organization to work for as you think, they'll view the information as irrelevant - but appreciate the integrity you demonstrated by answering the question honestly?</p>
<p>That said, don't incriminate yourself and get into legal trouble for the sake of a job interview.  But there's a huge difference between declining to answer, declining to answer in full (e.g., &quot;I confirm that I have not used illicit substances in [N years].&quot;), and intentionally lying.</p>
<p>Fair warning: I have absolutely zero interest in either helping you get the job or getting you rejected from it.  I just think a lot of the &quot;advice&quot; here is bullshit and unethical.  Behavior can have consequences.  Be an adult and accept them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of the people they hired instead of me was recently arrested for making child pornography.</p>
<p>As in raping children on film and selling it.</p>
<p>He passed the poly, let that sink in.</p></div>		</li>
