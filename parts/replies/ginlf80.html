In my observation, this is far more based in truth than purely in philosophy once you dig down deep enough into where we suspect &quot;we&quot; came from. In reality we are still &quot;it&quot;, we're just asking questions now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's all the same thing.</p>
<p>Made of the exact same building blocks.</p>
<p>The only differences is in what manner those building blocks are put together.</p></div>		</li>
