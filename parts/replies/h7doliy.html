			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, that makes sense. But why am I reading that a bridge is used to connect two separate networks, turning them into one? Is that not true, or is bridge just one of those terms that has multiple meanings?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say I have 50 computers in building 1, all connected to a switch with a firewall that provides internet access. I then install 20 computers in building 2, but internet access is not available, and it isn't possible to run a cable between buildings. I can put one side of a bridge in building 1, and the other in building 2 (usually they need to be in the line of site of each other). The bridges are then connected to the network switch on their respective side. The bridge will act just like the two switches are bridged by a network cable, creating a single network between buildings. The only downside an increase in latency (the time it takes data to go from one side to the other and back), but it's usually minimal over short distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bridge just connects two network segments together. In this case, it's connecting the WiFi segment to an ethernet segment.</p>
<p>Back in the day, ethernet switches were expensive. Hubs did most of the job that we now use switches for. Hubs were dumb, and just repeated everything that came in one port right back out the others. This caused a lot of &quot;collisions&quot; when two computers tried to talk at the same time. This is fine for a small number of devices, but becomes unmanageable at scale. Standard networking practice was to place a network bridge at the uplink of a group of computers. The bridge would monitor the traffic, and only pass traffic that was intended for a device on the other side of the bridge.</p>
<p>A bridge was essentially a 2-port switch. A wireless bridge has one side Wi-Fi while the other is ethernet. They're usually made with a 4-port switch built in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that an extender essentially extends the signal of the current network. So when you connect, it's still the same network. But with a repeater, it's an entirely different network you must connect to. Is this accurate?  </p>
<p>For the bridge, I'm still a bit confused with the high-level aspect of how it works. I read that it connects two separate networks, turning them into one. I've also read that it's essentially just a way to bring a network connection to remote locations, which would be useful for something like surveillance cameras. I'm not sure which is accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a crack at this one, though the terms repeater and extender are garbage.</p>
<p>A wifi extender is wired into to the network in a new location. It simply broadcasts the same wireless network at high power in a new location. Almost any decent versions will allow a client to move between devices to the higher powered signal with very little packet loss.</p>
<p>A wifi repeater receives a signal from a primary device and creates a new wireless network with the same name that allows a connection at higher power in a new location. The devices do not need to be wired into the same network, but typically reduce the available bandwidth massively. These are cheap and while they are ok for home use, I would never use one in a corporate environment.</p>
<p>Edit: I will say new mesh repeaters like Google/Nest, Eevo, and Orbi create quality wireless only mesh connections that work much better than older style repeaters. I haven't looked into how they do that, but I imagine they are a kind of hybrid. I still wouldn't use anything other than wired access points and extenders in a corporate network, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, the terms are rubbish. I think they are trying to determine the difference between an access point and a repeater and aren't considering mesh networks.</p></div>		</li>
