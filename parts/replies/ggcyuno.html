			<div class="markdown"><p>Independent of this debate, study participants are of course free to go get a different vaccine if they choose. They can leave the study group at any time. And due to the pandemic the studies allow unblinding, you can call them up and ask if you received the vaccine or a placebo. They request that you please don't do this unless you have a good reason to (like you're next in line to receive an already tested vaccine), as it impacts the study.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a volunteer for the Pfizer vaccine.  Just a quick question for you regarding this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Fauci sketched out one possible way to balance the obligation owed to people who took the placebo against the need for more data from the trials. Vaccine makers could give everyone who got the placebo the vaccine — while also giving everyone who got the vaccine the placebo. None of the trial participants would know which order they got the doses. The trial could therefore continue to be blinded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't this kind of useless?  At least in the Pfizer trial, isn't it obvious to the vast majority who got the vaccine and who got placebo?  Me and a friend both did it, I had no reaction whatsoever, whereas she had obvious symptoms.  If you give patients both the placebo, and the vaccine, it should be obvious because their body will react to the vaccine.  Am I understanding correctly?  </p>
<p>I just don't think the placebo effect is so powerful that a patient receiving both wouldn't be able to tell the difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Uh, true, but then everyone would be vaccinated, so what'd be the point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be missing something here. Can someone explain this to me? I don't get it. Heres my logic: </p>
<p>2 groups - 1 gets vaccine, 1 gets saline or sugar water or whatever you give placebos. At the end of the trial, the second group is effectively the exact same as someone who did not participate in the trial? Can't you just get some randos off the street? Why do you need THESE specific people that HAVENT taken the vaccine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense, but I don't see a lot of value in maintaining the blind after the second round of vaccinations a year later and its unlikely you could.  The consent form would tell participants they're getting a vaccine, they just don't know when.  After the second shots, they'd know they got it at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the blinding part of an RCT is important, the 'controlled' part is even more imporatant. That's why it got its own letter in the acronym. But if you absolutely had to vaccinate the placebo group, you'd at least retain some use of the groups by preserving the blinding and not introducing differential reporting bias.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it's that the time period between the initial injections and the second blind injections is long enough, you can still compare outcomes to get a sense of when/if the vaccine wears off, and this strategy from Fauci keeps the whole thing blind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the Pfizer trial. They can't stop us from getting the vaccine when it becomes available and have encouraged us to do so. They question here is whether we'll get it early. At least for me, I've been told that I'll be unblinded in February and given the vaccine then if I'm in placebo.</p></div>		</li>
