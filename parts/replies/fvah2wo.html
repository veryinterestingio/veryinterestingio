<p>Whether horses have amino acids that they can’t synthesize from carbohydrates is something I’m not sure of.</p>

<p>I know that ruminants (like cows and sheep) have so many microbes in their rumen (stomach) that many of the amino acids they consume were produced by their rumen microbes. As you might know, microbes are able to make all the amino acids if they have sufficient carbohydrate and nitrogen. Thus, as long a cow eats enough energy and nitrogen, the microbes will produce amino acids sufficient for the cow's survival (though not necessarily optimal amounts, so they do benefit from some dietary amino acids too, even if not strictly necessary).</p>
<p>Horses are hindgut fermenters, so their microbes are mostly behind the site of amino acid absorption (the small intestine). So I imagine that horses are far less able to absorb the amino acids produced by their large intestinal microbes.</p>
