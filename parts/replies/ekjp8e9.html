			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! We assign colors (blue,green,red,...) to light in the visible spectrum, i.e. light with a wavelength between 380 and 740 nanometers. This is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can actually see. Telescopes can see at many different wavelengths, depending on their design (radio waves for example). With the EHT, we observe at a wavelength of 1.3mm and we have to color code the emission based on their intensity somehow. For this image representation we use orange-reddish 'false colors' to represent the intensities across the image. It depends on the orientation of the source if we can see some emission in front of the black hole. For the face-on accretion disk, we can clearly see the central shadow without any emission in front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know why the bottom half of the (which I persume is) event horison more intense than the top? And what's the very faint red line that's &quot;passing through&quot; the black hole at a 45° angle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s explained in <a href="https://youtu.be/zUyH3XhpLTo" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/zUyH3XhpLTo</a>  Its due to the rotation, light coming towards us is brighter. Light going away is darker (which is how they know it is rotating clockwise)  </p>
<p>EDIT: it’s just around the 8:20 mark where he talks about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A related question: why is the center dark? If the black hole is surrounded by an accretion disk, then one would expect matter in front of the black hole to be glowing, and hence make the center of the image not entirely dark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bump. Why is the center still black? I understand the event horizon but towards the viewer is eventually outside of it, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>follow-up question</p>
<p>was the color artificially added? since the pictures were taken on radio frequency, there shouldn't be any visible light colors on it, right?</p>
<p>if that's the case, then how was the <em>actual</em> color determined? is it possible to discover what was the actual color before it decayed into radio?</p>
<p>edit: answered! see above</p></div>		</li>
