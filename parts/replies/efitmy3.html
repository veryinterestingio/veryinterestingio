<p>I think German has a similar exception for their version of going and leaving home. I wonder if any other languages have this exception. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Go&quot; is intransitive. &quot;Leave&quot; isn't always.</p>
<p>This means you can use leave + a noun. You leave *something*. You cannot go *something*.</p>
<p>Then you can always add adverbial options even when you use intransitive verbs. You cannot go *something*, but you can go (or leave) *in some special way* : quickly, tomorrow, home, back, at night, in 5 minutes, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Go&quot; is intransitive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except it's not <em>always</em>. it has a few transitive, copular, and auxiliary forms.</p>
<p>E.g. &quot;go the way I tell you&quot; uses the transitive form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're totally right! But if you said the term &quot;I'm going home&quot; in Northern Germany, instead of, &quot;I'm going to the house,&quot; they will judge you for the Bavarian Southerner freak you are. I have an Opa in Austria but don't really speak German so I could be going off my Opa's view on Northern Germany haha!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! It is idiomatic... meaning, languages have usage rules that are not really rules -- but have grown up with the language to be the practice. Prepositional phrases such as &quot;I get on the bus&quot; vs. &quot;I get in the car&quot; are especially common. That is why it is so good to learn a foreign language IN the foreign country, because then you don't make mistakes like: &quot;I go work&quot; instead of of &quot;I go to work.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
