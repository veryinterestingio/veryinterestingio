			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't identify the cells, but rather the antibodies that those cells make. So it does indicate the presence of such cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that this need to be extended with a comment:</p>
<p>The presence of this certain antibodies manufactured to target the virus does indicated the immune response got to the level of b and t cells. However the lack of antibodies doesn't say that you don't have memory cells of that particular thread stored somewhere.</p>
<p>So not having antibodies in your bloodstream does not mean you're not immune.</p>
<p>Sorry, please correct me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a way to distinguish between memory B antibodies and plasma cell antibodies? I thought not. From what I know (please correct me if this is wrong), there is no direct evidence that the vaccine causes the production of memory T or B cells. Nor is there direct evidence that the virus itself causes memory T or B cell production. Rather, by observing that people who get the vaccine are less likely to get severe COVID, Pfizer/Moderna have deemed it to be effective. But there could still be massive amounts of people who got the vaccine that got COVID, just asymptomatic cases. This would indicate that they didn't produce the memory B/T cells. Not saying that this is what definitely happened, I just don't think there's (direct, ex. identify those cells ex-vivo) evidence yet that either vaccine or virus induce immune memory.</p>
<p>Edited to say that I am hugely supportive of the vaccine, just curious about current gaps in knowledge and what we might learn</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please note that Covid-19 body tests are wildly inaccurate. Many tests are greater than 20% false positives and even worse for false negatives. You should never rely on an antibody test.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A positive antibody test shows someone has <strong>likely</strong> contracted a virus <strong>and shows an immune</strong> response to said virus, but never proves an absolute immunity to said virus.</p>
<p>A negative result shoes someone is <strong>unlikely to have recently</strong> contracted a virus <strong>and shows no immune response</strong> to said virus, and again, does not prove someone is vulnerable to a virus as other immune defenses could be responsible for eradicating a virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if being constantly exposed to tiny amounts, is there any sort of mechanism that cause the immune cells to better be able to contain future tiny exposures, even without involvement of memory t and b cells? in other words, would there be any benefit to being out and about masked and getting tiny exposures through the mask or from touching surfaces that have tiny amounts of covid (vs being completely isolated away from the virus)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I don’t think constant small exposure would help you, if the exposure is small enough that it doesn’t make it past the first defences that you have will also mean it doesn’t give you anything for the future, but big win for your body because you don’t get sick. Also, it increases your risk that you will get sick and then could pass it on. The more we pass it around between people, the more chance it has to mutate and get better at spreading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks, makes sense. let me know if my reasoning is incorrect, but i assume once immune, at that point occasional small exposures that are enough to involve memory t and b cells could be beneficial to keep immunity active? similar to the way that small exposures throughout a lifetime to chicken pox after developing immunity help to keep immunity up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some more or less recent (2010) studies have found that higher doses of virus (or vaccine) tend to produce more short-term T-cells, whereas exposition to less of it produces long-term T-cells.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2010/vaccine-t-cell-1221" target="_blank"><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2010/vaccine-t-cell-1221" target="_blank">https://news.mit.edu/2010/vaccine-t-cell-1221</a></a> [...] Scientists already knew that T cell contact with a large amount of virus provokes development of short-term memory T cells, says Eisen. Chen and colleagues discovered that large amounts of antigen also suppress development of long-term memory T cells. Those cells only develop when exposed to a small amount of the antigen, for a short period of time.  </p>
<p>For example, if you have an infection in the respiratory tract, nearby T cells will be exposed to many viruses and become short-term memory cells. Those cells hang around the respiratory tract, ready to pounce quickly if the same virus re-infects you, but they eventually die off.  </p>
<p>In more distant parts of the body, T cells are exposed to only small amounts of the virus, and some of those cells become long-term memory T cells specific to that virus. These maintain a low level of constant vigilance, in case the virus ever returns. [...]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that’s true! You can get very different responses from cells depending on how much virus/antigen is in the cell’s environment. In my above comment I was thinking the person asking was talking about very small amounts that wouldn’t actually make them sick but could still train their immune system and I don’t think that would work, but amount of antigen definitely impacts how the immune response unfolds.</p></div>		</li>
