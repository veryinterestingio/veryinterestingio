			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason we forge iron an steel but not bronze is that the recrystallization temperature of bronze is below room temperature. You can forge bronze, but it's crystalline structure will just reset. That's one of the reasons why iron and steel are more useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should be made know to anyone after me that steel is just iron with carbon in it. How much carbon depends on the type of steel.</p></div>		</li>
