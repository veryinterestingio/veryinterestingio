			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t matter what they change in them, it will always be true that it’s how they got their flavor. If you’re asking if it’s still the exact same process to make them as it was in 1928, I would assume it’s  changed with the times and more modern equipment. </p>
<p>As far as ingredients, they have seemly added more sugar to disguise the cheaper use of palm oil. In a particular turn of events however, they recently announced that they will soon be releasing not only a sugar free option, but an organic option as well. </p>
<p>So hopefully since tasting my favorite chocolate treat go down in quality over the decades in to a thin grainy, sugary mess; maybe now we will taste it improved at least to somewhat close to the delightful creamy treat it once was. I figuratively have my fingers crossed for good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both would work. Bitter has that sharpness to it that causes the puckering. Astringent has that puckering-bitterness with the added drying effect. Since, this falls into taste, which can be subjective; either bitter or astringent would be the correct word to use.</p>
<p>If one wishes to be pedantic, astringent is specifically linked to tannins. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astringent" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astringent</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well historically beer was more a spontaneous thing. People didn't understand yeast for a long fucking time, and wild yeast is a formidable beast. To tame it they used even more of a diverse set of ingredients to make the drink palatable. Pine needles, peppercorns, tree bark, roots from plants, every fruit in existence because fruit=sugar and more sugar+yeast=more alcohol. We just got away from our roots when we started mass producing beer. I'm quite happy with where we are with beer today. It can only get better :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes for a very pleasant tea. Sorta sweet and very smooth.</p>
<p>I’ve also made cascara cold foam and that was awesome. I just steeped the cascara in milk overnight, strained, and foamed with an immersion blender. It was so good on cold brew and complimented the coffee nicely.</p></div>		</li>
