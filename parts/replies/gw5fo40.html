It is rare because we quench our thirst pretty quickly. For an animal evolved to run down prey on the savannah not drinking too much water is important. </p>
<p>Humans evolves to run for very long distances, we can outrun most other mammals. Key to this is that we can sweat over our entire skin area, making us, in essence, one big radiator. The key to endurance is the efficient expulsion of heat from the organs. Why does this matter? Well, we radiate ourselves by expelling heat in the form of water and salt. So we need water, but not so much water that you die from it. Few people die of this, so is it really a problem? Actually, yes. Every year at least one ironman triathlete and one marathon runner will die of over-hydration. High School football players in the south are also at risk.</p></div>		</li>
