			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the closest answer thus far in terms of why</p>
<p>people keep talking about dynamic range, but I get the sense that is not what the phenmona op is referring to</p>
<p>people need to understand what happens in downmixing to know why this happens: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/hxeshr/_/fz61cy1?context=1000" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/hxeshr/_/fz61cy1?context=1000</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it has less to do with dynamic range and more to do with dialogue typically front and center. Without a center speaker, you only hear it faintly from the left and right channels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of things. Downmixing is probably the biggest factor, but dynamic range as well as dumb TV processing (no you don't have Atmos on your TV speakers, no &quot;virtual surround sound&quot; isn't helping you) are also playing roles.</p>
<p>Essentially, it's a lot of things fucking up the end product. </p>
<p>The takeaway from all of this is that TV speakers are absolutely worthless, and soundbars are not that much better. You don't need fat stacks to have good audio, you just need to know what is worth buying and what isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been a 2 or 2.1 channel guy.   I like Rotel and Adcom amps from the 90s.  You can pick them up for $150 all day on ebay and they're solid.  I don't follow speakers any more but used to find Wharfedales were good value.  I have diamond 9.1s on our min TV. And a 100w bass shaker Amp on the couch instead of a sub due to space limitations.  Bass transducers are the shit. And not just for explosions, they add a lot to music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a thing. You get similar effects when mixing a stereo track down to mono. Depending on how the audio is processed,  you can end up with only the right or left channels of the stereo mix being audible; which literally leaves you with half of the mix playing through one or  both speakers. Or, the channels are combined and you get the full dynamic range of both playing on one or both channels at the same time. This can cause several types of anomalies ranging from volume discrepancies to a phasing effect.  The easiest ways to combat this is using compression to regulate the volume, or listening to the audio as intended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to adjust the volume of your center speaker. I used to have this same issue, and once I did a manual adjustment, things got so, so much better.</p>
<p>For mine, I had to set my center about 8db higher than my other speakers.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, in regards to BF being fine on the Xbox, if it's anything like my PS4, it doesn't use only the center channel for voices, since it's <em>actually</em> using your surround sound the way its supposed to. If the character speaking is slightly to your left, it uses the left speaker, if they're behind you, they use the rear speakers. The center channel still comes into play, but it's not the same as shows that only have voices in the center.</p></div>		</li>
