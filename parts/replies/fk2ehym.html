			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow!  I honestly thought hemp and marijuana were two totally different plants.  I've seen hemp flower before and always thought it would be silly to smoke hemp.  Where can I buy it?  I'm guessing you have to find it locally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is exactly what I used to think until a friend of mine laid it out for me and I started doing some research.  SUper interesting stuff.  You don't have to buy it locally, but there's not a lot online yet due to banking restrictions.  I get mine from <a href="https://legalshempflower.com" target="_blank">legalshempflower.com</a> and it comes by USPS.  Never had any issues</p></div>		</li>
