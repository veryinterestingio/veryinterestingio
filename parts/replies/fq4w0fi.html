			<div class="markdown"><p>You may be describing presque vu. </p>
<p>As this is ELI5:</p>
<p>When you want to remember a word (example: compass) your brain will isolate related words (travel, map, north), and lock away distracting, unrelated words (cows, Hendrix, the pacific hagfish)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our brains are imperfect. So it accidentally locks the word you wanted away with the unwanted words. Compass is now in the same box as those inaccessible, unrelated thoughts, next to Hendrix and the hagfish. You’re left with words like map or north, because they’re relevant and theoretically useful.</p>
<p>Only when you stop searching for a particular word will your brain release the unrelated terms, because they will no longer distract you. And presto! The word you wanted was released and now you can access it.</p>
<p>Edit: I don’t usually do edits like this but since everyone seemed to enjoy that, “jamais vu” is yet another phenomenon in which a word you DO know becomes unfamiliar. Say “clockwise” over and over enough out loud, and at some point you begin to wonder if you’re saying it right because it no longer sounds like a word at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can also happen as you move from room to room. If you are thinking of something in the bathroom and then leave, your brain puts away everything it needs to know about what to do in there, sometimes taking the thought with it.</p>
<p>By going back towards it, that knowledge is released and the thought pops back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that that is because going through a door from one place to another is perceived by our brain as making the place you left somewhere that the information you thought of as where you need to leave that info. As in, that room you left is where that info needs to stay. I don't think I've explained that well. Basically the door is perceived as a place to wipe everything clean and start fresh. Maybe like in a computer game?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a bunch of study in memorization techniques and long term retention and the science basically boils down to this. </p>
<p>The best way to memorize something is to remember it as close to forgetting it as you can. So in other words if you learn a new fact easily today in a few minutes and hypothetically you could remember it for a week you shouldn't review or actively recall that information until it has been nearly a week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But guy is there a way to leverage that to learn things?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes of course. You use a flashcard program but instead of telling the program if you got the flashcard correct/incorrect you have the option to tell the program how hard it was to remember on a scale from 1-4ish. Depending on how hard it was, as well as on how long ago you studied it last and how many times you've forgotten it, the flash card will wait more or less time to review that specific card with you. </p>
<p>Assuming you get it correct every time a program might review a card after a day, a week, a month, three months, six months, a year, three years, until you reach a time greater than the human lifetime.</p>
<p>You can use a program like Anki to make flashcard decks or download other people's decks. This is the best <em>memorization</em> tool but don't forget that is not the same as learning or understanding.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that this is in no way proven. However while getting my B.A. in Cognitive Science and Psychology this was the most convincing argument I ran into. It's called a dynamical system. A simple version of this is boiling water. <del>It is a system where the output is also the input and where the system goes through this cycle to remove excess energy from the system</del> It is a system where excess energy is removed by creating patterns which are sensitive to the location of the energy that is introduced into the system and the magnitude of that energy. If the source of energy is continuous then the process will repeat as the pattern is created. Because of this the structure of the resulting pattern will effect the structure of subsequent patterns. </p>
<p>Imagine with me a big bundle of interconnected wires. But they're special, they produce different outputs based on where you apply electricity and how much electricity you apply to that location. </p>
<p>The idea here is that multiple memories are stored in the same place using the same neurons. To get each memory out you have to access the bundle of neurons at the right place with the right amount of energy to trigger each memory. </p>
<p>So the problem that was described in OP is you know that you should be able to find a memory in a particular place but you are unable to reach it either because something has changed or because you aren't accessing the bundle at the right place with the right amount of energy. </p>
<p>You can later find the memory by discovering the/a new access point or rediscovering the old access point. </p>
<p>It's trippy and it may not be right, but for me it makes more sense than anything else. If anyone would like more detail, just ask.</p>
