			<div class="markdown"><p>I never knew this and it is amazing information. I'd assumed that I always gain a bit of weight when first hitting the gym in awhile because my muscles were retaining water as a response to trauma or something, but this makes perfect sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! The whole &quot;we don't store water&quot; thing was really getting to me. Water weights a thing, and so is edema, and neither can exist without water storage, not to mention the other processes you mentioned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife and I just started a new diet and exercise routine (she's obese, I'm overweight), and I started losing at a rate of 1lb/day, whereas she stayed the same for the past 2 weeks or gained. It defied all logic and reason, but I ventured a guess many times that it was because she was dehydrated going into it. I didn't think I'd turn out to be right.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for this, we were beginning to get concerned enough about it to call our doctor, but this makes total sense! (We're still seeing our doctor though to be safe)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife and I started working out years ago and definitely go through phases. We've found that consistency is the key: keep up the work and don't put a huge amount of stress on yourself if you miss a day now and then. This is what works for us.</p>
<p>Great to hear, wish you both the best!</p></div>		</li>
