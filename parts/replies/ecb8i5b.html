			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be argued to be an artifact of prematureness, baby's heads are disproportionately large because their body's haven't finished developing. That said I'm not familiar with the head to body ratio of other apes, if humans have an unusually large head. I know that we have a larger brain compared to our size, but not the largest of early homo species.</p>
<p>But gorillas for example have a big head because they've a thicker skull and prominent bone ridge across the top of the skull to attach powerfully jaw muscles. I remember reading that you can track when dextrous hands because prominent because you see the cranial crest start to disappear, it's better to use your hands to manipulate and break things then your teeth so it goes away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That really isn't on topic for what we're discussing, though. The question wasn't &quot;why do babies have a certain body shape&quot;, it's &quot;why is it so painful and is it different from other primitive humans&quot;. </p>
<p>Either way - not disagreeing, per se, but your premise also assumes that all biological functions evolve at the same rate qnd are fully optimized for parameters outside of the simple ability to qchieve something. There are plenty of biological changes that happen before others catch up, and plenty that come st the cost of inefficiencies (in this case, pain vs proportionate head size) elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

My first child was but 7 pounds and on time, but my second was  5 pounds and premature at month 9.  My youngest was 13 pounds at 10.5 months (two weeks late, requiring being induced.) His shoulder got stuck during the birth and I ended up with a split pelvic os (the ligament holding pelvic bones together in the front, and have had arthritis in this area since his natural birth 35 years ago.

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a roundabout way the larger skull facilitates childbirth by pushing against the birth canal, a stimuli that drives the upregulation of oxytocin.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is a complex hormone that has been implicated in the bonding between mother and child. It also drives the contractions pregnant women experience during labour, with each contraction getting stronger the more oxytocin is expressed, in a positive feedback loop:-</p>
<p>Contraction happens &gt; baby's large head is pushed against birth canal &gt; pressure stimulates expression of oxytocin &gt; the process repeats until the stimuli (the baby pushing against the birth canal) is gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I see this as putting the cart before the horse. Social species bond and will use many different stimuli to do so.
I see it that we have evolved this feedback loop because of the big heads not the big heads because of the feedback.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is oxytocin administered IV after ceasarian?  Is it to help bring the uterus back to normal size, facilitate healthy clotting, or to help build a bond with the baby since the &quot;love hormone&quot; wasn't secreted the same way/amount it would be during vaginal birth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to start with its important to remember not all of us did evolve into bipeds.
We share our common ancestry with gorillas and chimps who are still essentially quadrapeds.</p>
<p>But being a biped is pretty great. We have a pair of limbs we don't use for locomotion so we can start to do other things with, like pick things up and carry things eventually leading into our use of tools. There's no way we'd have even gotten as far as the wheel or fire without dextrous hands to manipulate the world.</p>
<p>The other major advantage is being a biped is it's super efficient for walking on flat ground. Humans have evolved in the plains where travelling long distances on the flat and carrying stuff with you is super usefull and massively outweighs the losses from childbirth </p>
<p>We are essentially the world's top land endurance predator. Humans can run pretty much indefinitely, we are smart enough to follow prey through the sign they leave and cooperate, carry tools to finish the job and carry the spoils back to our family.</p>
<p>Yes a few more die in childbirth but overwhelmingly we have the advantage in population growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, no, I get that, but in terms of microevolution, in theory, over time, negative traits (in this case, narrow hips that increase risks in child birth) should slowly decrease. In other words, a woman with wider hips should have an easier time in child birth, increasing her chance of survival and increasing her chance to birth a child with the genes for wider hips -- unless I am SEVERELY misunderstanding how microevolution works -- why hasn't this happened? </p>
<p>I get the advantages of being a bi-ped -- I sometimes walk on two legs myself, but I am curious why, if it is advantageous to have wider hips for birthing, why it's not more common? Is there are disadvantage to wider hip bones that directly contradicts the advantages incurred by bipedal locomotion? Or were the advantages of being bipedal so extraordinary that they completely negated the need for any form of natural evolution to improve the race's chances of survival? </p>
<p>Am I making sense? I'm sorry if my question is confusing or stupid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the walking upright that makes it worth it. Humans have more endurance than any other land mammal on the planet. The earliest humans hunted by literally following their prey until they collapsed from exhaustion. Being upright makes travel more efficient (i think) and gives us a sight advantage in all grassy plains</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The advantage is in our gait.  4 legged animals need more energy to go from walking to running than humans, who can jog pretty much indefinitely with only a little more effort than walking.</p>
<p>In addition, humans free up their hands to carry things like a water container and weapons.  These tools also give advantage in a hunt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read somewhere that ideally the gestational period would be around one year, so babies would be bigger and less dependent/fragile at birth. Often the newborn stage is referred to as the “fourth trimester” because they are still in constant need of care around the clock. I also wonder how different full term pregnancies would go currently if doctors didn’t induce after a certain number of weeks. I myself went to 42 weeks before induction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 42 week induction limit is because the placenta starts to degrade at this time and the amount of amniotic fluid reduces. The risk of still birth starts to increase quite a lot after 42 weeks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pediatrician Harvey Karp is a big proponent of the &quot;fourth trimester&quot; idea and proposes a number of techniques based on the idea to help sooth newborns.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not well, at least not currently. The reason doctors try to induce after those 2 weeks overdue is often because of the increased chances of giving birth to stillborn children, something no parent would ever want. The more overdue you are, the possibility of complications increases for both baby and mother whether aware of these complications or not. While we’d like to think that humans have evolved well enough and will continue to evolve to ease reproduction, the fact that we still have overwhelming statistics of breech babies and other commonalities that in the past brought on the death of mother, baby, or both that are now caught by modern medicine, indicates that we are far off from that better evolution we dream of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution is a fascinating but often massively misunderstood topic.
There is no absolute &quot;better&quot; evolved like many people think, humans aren't the end of evolution or some pinnacle, we just are what we are.</p>
<p>When we started to walk upright the difficulty in childbirth was less detrimental then the advantages of being bipedal so it worked out as a net positive for us.
Nowadays we have massively reduced the evolutionary pressure that difficult childbirth brought so babies that were non viable or pregnancys that might've killed a mother before are less likely to today so we have no pressure to be easier to give birth to.</p></div>		</li>
