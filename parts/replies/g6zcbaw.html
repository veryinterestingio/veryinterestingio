<p>It just so happens that serious drug users aren’t the most hygienic people.</p>
<p>Not a dentist so I don’t know how true that is, but it makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While a fun explanation, the real reason is that they heighten dopamine sensitivity, which makes behaviors like eating candy and drinking soda very pleasurable. The increased rate of dental cavities among stimulant abusers is because of increased sugar intake.</p>

<p>Edit: additional factors include tooth-grinding (which is another reason stimulant users eat more sugar—they suck on hard candies like lollipops to prevent tooth grinding), as well as a lowered salivary pH (meaning their saliva is more acidic—an acidic environment dissolves enamel). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5806971/" target="_blank">See this other paper.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was a fan of meth. And you are correct, the drugs themselves are not so particularly bad, directly. It's more the side effects and habits. Side effects, being constant dry mouth (extremely common with meth users and very bad for teeth) and a more acidic/corrosive saliva (especially from smoking it). Habits, of course, being not brushing teeth, eating garbage/sugary stuff (both of these are extremely common for meth users, especially if it is at a point they have become homeless/unstably living), and potential violence causing loss of teeth (getting into fights). That is part of the reason why some people can hide past drug use pretty well (if they avoided all these pitfalls) and some it is glaringly obvious. There are other factors at play, too, and drugs do genuinely damage you to some extent. However, tooth loss, while correlated, isn't as directly correlated as the joke goes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other aspect is that poor Meth users are not usually people who had great dental plans before starting to use Meth. The people I know who got on it had never been to a dentist, meaning their teeth had problems that Meth behaviors exacerbated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did meth for several years and a casual heroin user (mostly pills).</p>
<p>I'm missing one tooth, because the filling fell out and I never fixed it. Bushed my teeth everyday and ate almost normal, when I did eat. Took multi vitamins. Drank lots of water. </p>
<p>That last one is key. The best explanation I've heard is that hard drugs cause the body to enter a state of shock frequently, which causes disruptions in blood flow. The teeth are living tissues and considered extremities by the body.</p></div>		</li>
