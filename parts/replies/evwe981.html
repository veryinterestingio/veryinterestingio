			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t really accurate. While all Buddha’s are enlightened, not all enlightened people are Buddha’s. Buddhahood is the pinnacle of enlightenment and is said to have not been achieved since Siddartha. </p>
<p>According to Buddhism there are several stages of enlightenment called bhumi’s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One does not. Enlightenment is not a goal or trophy, it is the end sum of natural progression.</p>
<p>One who seeks enlightenment does not find it--instead, it is found by those who were not seeking it, but were just living virtuous lives, while being open to matters of the spirit.</p></div>		</li>
