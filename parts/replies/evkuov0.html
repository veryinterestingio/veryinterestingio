			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a spike when the temperature goes up to that level for the first time in a while. Imagine that every month, there are 50 more people in London that will die if the temperature goes over 40 (due to aging or other health issues). If that 40 degree event happens every year, you get 600 deaths. If it happens every five years, you get 3000 deaths. The latter is a much bigger event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like that bit about daylight savings time causing heart attacks. There is a spike on the day the clocks go forward and a decrease the day they get set back. If you zoom out to the week everything cancels out though. The guy was going to have one that week, daylight savings just bumped it up a day or two / going back to standard time delayed it a day or two.</p>

<p>Saw a TED about this, it's the lack of sleep due to daylight savings that contributes to heart attacks. Make sure you get enough deep sleep!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also probably helps that people are used to it and know how to recognize symptoms and mitigate them before something really bad happens. Somebody from Europe may not realize that they’re starting to get sick, or they may not realize just how much water they need to drink, etc.</p></div>		</li>
