			<div class="markdown"><p>The outside of the tooth is dead. That's the part that won't regrow. But inside there is a root that has nerves. That's the part that hurts when you get a toothache. It sounds bad the way it is now, but imagine if you could feel it when you bit down on something or ground you teeth together. And on the flip side, if you didn't have a root, your teeth wouldn't be able to connect to your gums</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha right?! Teeth nerves are unique in that they interpret almost any stimulus as pain. For good reason , guess whatâ€™s right above your upper teeth? Your brain !!! So while the enamel is a dead rock it sits on top of living tissue that is in one of the riskiest spots in the body. Not only do you need your teeth for survival (at least out in the wild ) but any tooth infection can be fatal. Iâ€™ve seen it first hand as a nurse - we have had patients die from infections that started in and around teeth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ugh, I had an acquaintance whose husband was terrified of the dentist. Hated going, it was basically a phobia. Well he developed a terrible pain in his jaw and his wife (my friend) kept pestering him to go to the dentist. Finally he became feverish and agreed to go to urgent care. They gave him some antibiotics and told him, you need to go to a dental surgeon <em>right now,</em> you have an impacted tooth that's infected. He hemmed and hawed and waited on going and unfortunately ended up dying of sepsis. He was in his late 30s.</p></div>		</li>
