			<div class="markdown"><p>Thunderstorms generally cover a lot of altitude. They're massive clouds that billow upwards (because of turbulence). The bottoms of a thunderstorm are close to the ground, yes, but the tops can extend upwards of 40,000 feet (12 km) in altitude. In the tropics, they can even reach 75,000 feet (22 km).</p>

<p>patently false. aviation regulations require aircraft to fly at an altitude high enough that, in the event of engine failure, pilots have a chance to troubleshoot and, failing that, to execute an emergency landing in the safest way possible. 100 feet above the ground does not meet this requirement</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Us aviation administration wields far more influence (over it's area) that other  agencies overseeing other areas. </p>
<p>Tri-engine planes were born out of a flight regulation that made it illegal for planes with 2 or fewer engines to fly across the ocean. That law was changed several years ago and the tri-engines have since died away. </p></div>		</li>
