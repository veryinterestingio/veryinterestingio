			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you want further explanation? What blew my mind, iirc, is that the band-gap voltage is related to how far the silicon atoms are apart in the crystal. That’s more materials science and solid-state physics which is outside my area of expertise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is this whole thing going to become useless if we develop carbon-based electronics? Will they just redesign, or will components that measure stuff using the silicon bandgap just end up being the chunkiest parts of our phones?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that most likely the crystal is quartz, which is grown in a lab, it is pretty much pure SiO2 with no imperfections and therefore fixed distance between the silicon atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add: The signal strength is measured after a bandpass filter which only lets the selected WiFi channel through. You can still have noise in this channel which is the reason why some WiFi devices also show a signal quality. I assume it's some kind of error rate detection (ie where the checksum didn't match).</p></div>		</li>
