			<div class="markdown"><p>And sometimes even if it saves the person, it's not like the movies.  They don't simply cough and then stand up as if nothing happened. </p>
<p>When my dad had a heart attack, my brother tried to save him with CPR.  It worked, sort of.  He survived, but was severely brain damaged to the point he needed full life support.  After a few days,  it became clear he could never recover, so as a family we made the decision to pull the plug.</p>
<p>So yes it can work, but not usually the way people expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's honestly unsettling to me that it isn't taught to high-school young adults. Why is this only limited to the medical profession? I would rather have someone who knows a little CPR save me, rather than nobody, and I believe the most experienced resuscitators would opt to volunteer ahead of perhaps uncertain, inexperienced ones. Just one step toward an ideal society..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your safety supervisor neglected to mention that those lawsuits pretty much universally fail. People can sue for anything. The question is whether the lawsuit will be successful.</p>
<p>Breaking ribs performing CPR is not unusual - it isn't a sign of gross negligence. And people are typically protected by Good Samaritan laws. The worst you can normally expect to happen is for someone to take you to court over it and then lose (probably quickly).</p>
<p>Your safety supervisor doesn't sound very concerned with people's safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad passed away last year from a heart attack. He just backed his truck into the garage, told my sister he was about to pass out, and he was gone. They tried giving him CPR until the ambulance got there, but they were not able to bring him back. Did you feel any pain before you had your heart attack or during? I guess I want to know if maybe my dad suffered or not, I don't know. I wasn't there and I had been meaning to call him for a few days leading up to it but I didn't and still feel guilty about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I hope this is helpful but just wanted you to know, my mom went into cardiac arrest and I did CPR and called 911 and she is okay now. When I asked her, she said the experience of her cardiac arrest was not at all scary or painful. I hope you find some peace and that your memories of your dad are soon a comfort. (My dad passed in an accident &amp; Iâ€™ve always wondered how he felt, so my heart is with you, Cleanplateclub. ðŸ’•)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didnâ€™t have a heart attack, I had sudden cardiac arrest and brought back by cpr. I remember thinking I was about to pass out. Then all I felt was peace. It felt timeless. Up until they brought me back, it was pure peace.
Iâ€™m sorry for your loss.</p></div>		</li>
