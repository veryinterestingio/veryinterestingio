			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, this idea is no longer ascribed to in the scientific community, that we all start off as female in the womb. Instead, we all start off with the same organs, and depending on the hormones present in the womb, those organs either develop into ovaries, etc, or testes, etc.</p>
<p>But the organs that either sex organ originate from can not be labeled as either sex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, you start off with both a müllerian duct (prefemale genitals) and a wolffian duct (premale). The Y chromosome with the SRY gene is what causes degradation of the müllerian duct. A mutation in these causes an XY individual to develop phenotypically as female. There is another condition called Swyer syndrome that happens when the gene is transferred to an X chromosome and causes an XX individual to develop phenotypically as male.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not actually chromosomes—it’s the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. If you have an inactive/broken SRY gene, the individual will not have male sex traits, even if they have XY karyotype</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those chromosomes contain the genes that express the proteins to produce the hormones that signal for male or female development.  In the female case, the second &quot;X&quot; is also a backup, of sorts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear what you're saying but this is a bit semantic. Developmental biologists still regard the embryonic body plan template as morphologically more female-like. It's simplistic and reductive but in an understandable way when teaching differentiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not described as &quot;female&quot; but that the default developmental pathway is female. Everyone starts the same, and the they diverge into female or male if the SRY is present. But none of the embryologists or REI's that I know say that everyone &quot;starts as female&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Internal anatomy 100% starts with two sets of plumbing. External anatomy, well ... it's fair to say that female development changes <em>less obviously</em> from the proto-form than male does, but it changes: </p>
<p>The glans of the clitoris has to bend downward from its original shape, the back of the urogenital folds have to bury themselves behind the labioscrotal folds to become the clitoral roots, their fronts have to grow out to become the labia minora. </p>
<p>Medicine and biology <a href="https://intersexroadshow.blogspot.com/2011/04/intersex-genitalia-illustrated-and.html" target="_blank">have had the same tradition as the rest of us,</a> where basically the peener is the important thing and everything else is window dressing, but there <em>is</em> a lot more to femaleness than just not having a wang, so I think it's just as well the &quot;starts as female&quot; wording is losing ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its true that we start out with proto structures of both male and female reproductive structures in the womb, but the shortcut that we all start as female comes from the following. Without any signals from the Y chromosome, SRY, TDF, and testosterone, the fetus will ALWAYS default to developing into the female. As in, the default is, &quot;this baby is going to be female at 10 weeks unless I get the Male signal at 8 weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>So, yes its oversimplified, but in a sense becoming female is the default, and the path to being male must be deliberate and timely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came to post something similar to this but you nailed it. As far as HGH and growth, that has to do with growth plates. As a child and adolescent the ends of your long bones are called growth plates and are made of cartilage. As long as it stays cartilage you can grow taller. Once it fuses into bone then your growth stops. This happens in adolescence. In some rare cases it happens much later like the former  NBA center David Robinson who grew over a foot after his senior year in high school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Giannis Antetokounmpo is similar to David Robinson in that respect. He was 18 when he was drafted in 2013 and over the course of the next few years he grew roughly 3 inches to his current height of 6’11”. </p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, what would happen if someone was given human growth hormone before the cartilage of their growth plates fused into bone? Would they continue to grow taller or would their body basically say no to it? I understand the ethics of this would be dubious at best, I’m just curious as to what would happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s actually what they use it for.  They prescribe it for children with growth hormone deficiencies that, without treatment, would cause short stature. The dosage, I’m not sure, because the last research I remember said that the medical community isn’t sure if it’s the amount of growth hormone during adolescence that determines one’s height, or if it’s the sensitivity to that growth hormone. This means basically that two kids  could have the same amounts of growth hormone in their bodies, but one could have genetic differences that make them more sensitive to the same amount and grow taller. But, in short, Yes. If you gave a child growth hormone it would increase their stature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might make it grow sooner, but it would also temporarily &quot;dry out&quot; your testicles and lower your fertility and mess with your whole brain-testicle-testosterone connection.</p>
<p>Tried to eli 5 that......not sure if it worked. In order not to add to the fake hype that steroids are evil.... I'll add that after you're 25 most of these effects only happen if you stay on the steroids for a long time without cycling/post cycle process and breaks. Later on the biggest problem is the stress on the liver, so if you do roids you can't do things that stress the liver, like drink alcohol, and if you do both you can really screw things up (even alone the stress on the liver from steroids is real and has to be watched closely and is a key indicator for the cycle lengths). </p>
<p>And you still have to lift consistently, sleep well, etc. It's not completely a free ride.</p></div>		</li>
