<p>Stabilisation of the mRNA was a big thing in the vaccine development, amongst many others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's super small. And if it gets to the brain this answer isn't quite right - the LNP's aren't what cause an immune response, so their presence in the brain doesn't cause inflammation. Microglia do not express the receptors necessary to recognize the COVID spike protein, so the resident immune cells of the brain wouldn't be activated by the vaccine. Free floating RNA *would* cause an immune response in microglia, but free floating RNA can't cross the BBB, so it's a non issue - the RNA entering the brain is inside LNPs that need to enter a cell to release their RNA. Some brain cells might make spike protein for \~24 hours, but the protein won't do anything and will be cleared within a few days during normal cell turnover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thanks. If if finds no cell after several days, the LNP will degrade, and at this point the RNA will be destroyed by the Migrolia?</p></div>		</li>
