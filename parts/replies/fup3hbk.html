			<div class="markdown"><p>With the increase in tool evidence both for all apes and early split our liniage in particular, its increasingly likely the cause of our split from our common ancestor was tool usage; some factor caused us to start using simple tools more regularly then other apes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Erm, we are deeply nested within apes; as in, gibbons, orangutans, gorillas and chimps being sucessive outgroups of the clade that includes us.</p>
<p>It is not just that chimps are our closest relatives, is that we are the closest living relative the 2 chimp species have. They are closer to us than to gorillas.</p>
<p>Also, kinda doubt it. Tool usage would likely be a selected factor with our free hands due to life in the plains, but even Australopithecus-grade hominins were still going up trees, despite the precranial skeleton being almost a miniature of ours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean as in our separation from our common ancestor with chimpanzee's, derived most likely not from plains but from keeping hold of tools.</p>
<p>Other plains adaptions for monkeys and apes all retained using the hands for locomotion, like with baboons, or my point really is that while not impossible that it happened due to plains there is nothing about plains usage that <em>requires</em> walking upright and in all other cases it did not cause it, the advantages to upright are incidental rather then pressured for (e.g. walking upright does give advantages if you happen to do it, but there is not a lot of specific pressure to try walking upright to begin with). Tool usage however does explicitly require walking, even great apes today when using tools often walk two legged for short stretches. If an ape decided to hold onto a tool after use (all apes already use tools), or had a motivation to use tools more frequently it would explicitly force walking, which if continued over generations would heavily pressure and select for better walking. And it actually makes more sense that a walking tool user move into the plains then that an arboreal apes were forced to survive there.</p></div>		</li>
