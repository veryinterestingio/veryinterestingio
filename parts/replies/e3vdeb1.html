			<div class="markdown"><p>They get compensated by unicycles.</p>
<p>Seriously though: I see 3 possibilities: a) the amount of vehicles with &gt;2 axles is so little that it is just noise, b) there are statistics on this and the data can be compensated by substracting a certain percentage, or c) the measuring device has some intelligence, and knows that a certain number of hits within a short timeframe, are the axles of one and the same vehicle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Groups of axles going over at the same speed count as one vehicle. That is why you should only have one lane counting per set of tubes.</p>
<p>This classifies the vehicle into one of 12 classes based on the axle distribution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be compensated.  If you want to convert to vehicle, an axle pair is 0.93 vehicles, based on all measurements in Sweden for a full year. </p>
<p>But, in most cases, you compensate in the models. There is no reason you can't have a model for, say, pavement wear, that is calibrated for axle pairs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They use air because they're more or less &quot;disposable&quot; compared to the ones at traffic lights that need to last several years. The traffic ones are placed <em>into</em> the asphalt by making little cuts in the asphalt and the wires are put in and then the cuts filled back up. The ones OP is talking about sit on <em>top</em> of the asphalt, so they get really beat up and hoses are cheaper than wires in case they get damaged </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I know my electrical stuff I don't know much about tubes or air.  </p>
<p>So making an, I assume, airtight tube, is easier and cheaper than connecting a copper wire. That sounds counter intuitive.</p>
<p>You need some sensor that has a mechanical part to measure air pressure. </p>
<p>I can't Google it right now, but this is a fascinating subject for a Geek like me.</p>
<p>Thanks for the explanation!</p></div>		</li>
