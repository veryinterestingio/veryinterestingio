			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitpick: noise is any interference with a signal. Crosstalk refers to a signal bleeding onto another circuit and interfering with another signal. All crosstalk is a type of noise, but not all noise is crosstalk.</p>
<p>(It might be that crosstalk is the only form of noise that Ethernet engineers are concerned with, especially at the frequencies we're dealing with now. I doubt whether there are many other sources of 500Mhz noise in the typical environment.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My response was already long enough and this <em>is</em> ELI5. But yes. Also, the way the category cables differ with all types of noise is pretty bland... You either shield the cable or not. But there is also no trend in which are shielded and which aren't. Like I think Cat 7 is unshielded but Cat 5e has a shielded version and then Cat 7a is shielded again (I don't have my reference manual next to me). So I just omitted shielding and decided to talk about crosstalk, one kind of noise, because cat cables have an increasing trend of more twists per length to combat this type of noise.</p></div>		</li>
