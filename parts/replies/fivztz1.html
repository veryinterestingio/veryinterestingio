<p>The vaccine is designed to mimic a piece of something on the surface of the virus. So your immune system learns to attack that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Most modern vaccines consist of proteins or other parts of viruses that are produced by bacteria, yeast, or other organisms that have been genetically programmed to produce those substances. For example, you can take the genetic material that encodes for the surface protein of Hepatitis B, express it in yeast, and then purify out that protein (which is how the HepB vaccine is made). Since there's never any actual whole virus, there's zero chance of infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To way, way oversimplify things. Think of viruses and antibodies as the square/circle/triangle pegs and holes that infants play with. Only thing is the virus is much more complicated shapes than simple circle/square/triangle holes. When the body detects an infection it makes a bunch of different shaped pegs (antibodies) and when something new/dangerous comes in, it tries them. Once it learns this weird shape peg goes on that weird shape hole, it's got antibodies to fight that infection. Now you can use a dead or weakened virus to train the body to make antibodies, or you can figure out the protein shapes that the antibodies are going to latch on to and just provide something that is that shape (basically proteins that appear on the given virus). Of course this works better for certain viruses than others. HIV has a ton of problems, one of which is it really doesn't have a lot of stable proteins sticking out of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last sentence isn’t accurate.  There are some fairly complex proteins in the surface that are targets for vaccines.  The problem isn’t the lack of them, but the fragility and changing nature of them.  </p>
<p>The Env with its gp 120 and 41 components are a perfect example.  It looks easy to identify to the immune system, but it mutates rapidly and is coated with sugar molecules, both of which make vaccines nearly impossible to maintain efficacy.  </p>
<p>So it’s not the lack of them.  Rather, it’s the structure of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was discussed on Public Radio's Science Friday last week. Also, i work in this industry.</p>
<p>First, you have to find the target molecule to use in the vaccine (all the above discussion). Then you have to identify a viable animal model to test in. Test in vitro (in a test tube) to see if the vaccine molecule causes the right cellular response. Test in the animal model to determine that the vaccine is safe, not just that it doesn't kill someone, but also that it isn't toxic to the liver, that it metabolizes, and doesn't cause infection. THEN testing continues in order to confirm that the vaccine actually prevents or mitigates risk, ie, that it is effective. Then we come up with a method to scale up production, with approved and audited facilities. Need to validate the manufacturing process. We have Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials that have different protocols for number of patients and such. Need patients for the trials, not to mention tons of money and investment for this science, and regulatory process. </p>
<p>tl;dr A vaccine target must be identified (takes a while); animal model identified (testing required); approval to enter into clinical trials (takes a while); conduct trials (takes a while). By the time we go to the FDA for approval just to test, the Coronavirus may have run its course and no longer spreading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are fast track approval processes though if I'm not mistaken. For something like the coronavirus the FDA knows the timing is important so I'm sure it would get pushed along a little faster than most things.</p>
<p>Ugh we are getting audited by the FDA this week. They are really thorough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What we heard last night at the White House press conference, is that even with all that, we're still looking at a minimum date of <strong><em>next summer</em></strong> for a possible vaccine to be delivered, and that assume there's no false positives, rework or negative impacts during each of the clinical trials phases. </p>
<p>With the current progression of the virus, unless it mutates and puts its own fire out, we're going to lose a LOT of people in the next 16 months, before a vaccine is developed, approved, manufactured, scaled-up and delivered to hospitals and communities that need it most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the difficulty is with mass production -that mainly depends on the money available. It's more about the rigorous testing that has to be done for a vaccine to be approved. The company must show that the vaccine is safe and effective through animal studies and clinical trials which may take years to complete. In the case of the coronavirus this process could be sped up and the vaccine approval could be granted earlier without a full set of data but with a commitment to submit this data as soon as possible. This only happens in exceptional circumstances and I'm not 100% sure what the criteria is. But I think even this &quot;short&quot; process likely would take several months if not a year.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some viruses are not really good targets for vaccines because they are too variable and mutate too quickly. This is the case for Hepatitis C and HIV to an extent (although there are other difficulties with HIV).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why they recommend the vaccine every  year. It's basically for the most common types of viruses for the upcoming period (it can still miss viruses)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does, rapidly. That's why a new flu vaccine is produced every year using the most prominent &quot;strains&quot; found in countries that have their winter during our summer(e.g. Australia), and Australia's(southern hemisphere) flu vaccine is created during their summer using data from countries going through winter(northern hemisphere). This leaves the shortest amount of time for the flu virus to mutate before the vaccine can be implemented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the seasonal flu mutates very quickly which is why every year a new vaccine is developed. The WHO looks at trends in flu infections accross the globe and tries to make predictions every year for the next flu season in the northern and southern hemispheres (I think they are actually having the meeting about the virus strains to be used in the next season right now!). These predictions are then endorsed by the regulatory bodies such as the EMA and the FDA and within a few months manufacturers make the new flu vaccine using the virus strains specified by the WHO (usually by August).</p></div>		</li>
