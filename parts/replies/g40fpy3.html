The navy bought almost all of the white flour in England for provisions and the not-military had to deal with quickly ranidifying ship biscuits made from whole wheat flour stretched even thinner with all of the discarded germ / husk etc that the royal bakeries didn't use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weevils love that oil. Same issue with cornmeal, why germ was removed to increase storage life. Also led to the vast sweet / unsweetened cornbread divide. Fresh ground whole corn wasnâ€™t any real need to add sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brown rice has its applications, but I agree. For the most part, white rice has more uses. I could eat white rice 6 different ways every week. Maybe I lack creativity, but brown rice just doesn't take to as many uses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some varieties of rice like Basmati are aged which changes the composition and flavour and that can't be done with the bran. Saki is also made from aged rice.</p></div>		</li>
