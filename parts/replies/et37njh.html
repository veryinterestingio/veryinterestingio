			<div class="markdown"><p>Iran = Iranian (persian).  They speak Farsi (persian).  Ie, they are not Arabs and never have been.  Shia Islam revolves around Iran and Sunni around Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>On a side note.  The Islamic extremists who have been attacking the west for the last couple of decades are almost exclusively from the Wahābī (Salafi) sect of Sunni Islam.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism" target="_blank">Wahhabism</a> is actively promoted, spread, and funded by Saudi Arabia... and has been tearing the Muslim world apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t speak for them all, but basically yes. Iran is one of the few Shia countries, and it appears the Sunni and Shia countries still have very bad blood.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia for instance, probably hates Iran more than Israel. They’re mortal enemies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's talking about Iran.</p>
<p>Iran and Iraq were at war for most of the 1980s. That kept them both busy concentrating on war efforts instead of growing as nations. When the U.S. instigated regime change, Iran no longer needed to fear Iraq so the nation has grown into one of the most powerful countries in the area.</p></div>		</li>
