			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partially true.  The advice they're giving pregnant woman has changed since my kids were born and they do now recommend exposure to nuts while pregnant.</p>
<p>But you don't pass on an immunity to nuts.  Nuts aren't a virus or bacteria that your body needs to fight off.  If a person has no nut antibodies and eats nuts nothing happens.  The people who have the allergy (like me) are the ones with the nut antibodies.  So if the mother is allergic they could actually pass on the allergy, but not the other way around.  That's also why I can't give blood.  I could actually pass on the allergy to the recipient.</p>
<p>It's actually the <em>second</em> exposure to the nut that triggers the reaction.  With the first exposure the body says &quot;this is bad&quot; and develops antibodies to fight off the intruder not realizing it's benign.  Then when there's another exposure the body overreacts.  I don't know why nut reactions can be so severe compared to other allergies, other than they tend to be systemic because you eat nuts rather than just reacting to pollen that gets in your nose or something.</p>
<p>The not-being-exposed-while-pregnant is part of it but the actual rise in allergies has been linked to our society being too clean.  In countries where people poop in and drink from the same water supply (for example) they don't have any allergies.  Those people's bodies are trying too hard to fight off all the nasty things in their environment to be bothered with anything as trivial as a peanut.  We don't have that problem here so our immune system can sometimes think other things are threats.</p>
<p>So let your kids crawl around on the floor.  Nothing they find and eat will kill them unless you have a habit of leaving razor blades all over your floor, so don't freak out if they find a dropped Cheerio and eat it.  It's good for their immune system.  And stop using hand sanitizers.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, reply from my father:</p>
<p>Flu &amp; other illnesses often preceded the development of allergies. For example, those children destined to get Bronchial Asthma (by their genetics) get full blown asthma after an illness.  Getting food allergies (like fruit &amp; nuts) also is in the person’s genes (DNA), but may not develop unless the immune system (IE. The person) gets a (serious) infection. After the infection, the immune system directs its attacks (via an immunoglobulin named IgE that we all have) at some extraneous, usually innocuous substance (nuts etc) or the person itself, giving diseases like Lupus or other autoimmune disease. We don’t know why some people suddenly activate the allergy gene, while others don’t, but both happen.  Researchers are now searching for a way to turn off the now activated gene to totally eliminate the allergy to foods &amp; inhalants like Ragweed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure.  But I can tell you allergies are an immune system response.  Your body thinks fruits and nuts are as dangerous as the flu and have developed antibodies to fight them off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no background in this, but possibly the nut allergy reaction can be so severe because it’s a larger quantity they are reacting to usually? Like comparing the number of molecules of a virus or pollen to the number of nut molecules I would expect there to be exponentially more nut ones. Like snorting a peanut worth of pollen - that might really fuck some people up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one theory, but it's not the sole cause like you are intimating it is. My wife ate whatever she wanted during her pregnancy, including lots of peanut butter, and our son still has a peanut and tree nut allergy.</p>
<p>There are other theories to explain the meteoric rise in food allergies relating to gut biome, leaky gut, the way we alter and engineer our food, as well as the increase in number of diagnoses of food allergies related to the hightened awareness over the last several decades.</p>
<p>It's true that the recommendation of strict avoidance of allergens has now changed. For example, they now generally recommend that you give you child peanuts/ tree nuts as early as possible, as they have found that not doing so and introducing later (say past the age of 1) can heighten the risk for developing an allergy.</p>
<p>There is conflicting research for whether or not a mother's diet affects in any way what, if anything, their child will be allergic to. Most of the more recent research has found no link actually.</p>
<p>From all of the conversations we've had with numerous allergists, their is no definitive reason for why people are getting more food allergies, including nut allergies. </p>
<p>However we do know that exposing patients to the specific allergen, starting at extremely small doses, and increasing over time can allow the body to create a tolerance to the allergen, and in some cases completely cure the allergy. This is referred to as Oral Immunotherapy, or OIT.</p>
<p>My son is 7 and has been extremely allergic to peanuts since he was an infant. He completed peanut OIT about a year ago and now eats a &quot;maintenance dose&quot; of 4g of peanut s per day. OIT works. My peant allergic son is eating 6 peanut m&amp;ms, or straight peanut butter, Reese's cups, everyday. It's amazing and has changed our life.</p>
<p>He's currently in egg OIT and doing well, he's on 1.5 mL of egg whites per day right now. He is severely allergic to eggs.</p>
<p>We dont know what causes food allergies, including nut allergies, definitively. But we are making breakthroughs in how to treat it.</p></div>		</li>
