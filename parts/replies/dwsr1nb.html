			<div class="markdown"><p>Big snakes such as anacondas and reticulated pythons can go over a year without eating. Even small pythons can easily survive many months with no food. If a big python takes down a large meal, it's normal for it to go three to six months before it hunts again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All snakes have a range they patrol you could say, burrows they use often, game paths they hunt in, basking spots etc, I see water snakes in the smae spots year after year.  They can actually smell and taste there prey in the air with there jacobsen's organ in the roof of there mouth, they can extend there wind pipe out of the bottom of there mouth so they can breathe while swallowing a meal.so big, really perfectly made to do snake stuff?</p></div>		</li>
