			<div class="markdown"><p>A bolus is a single dose of a drug given all at once.</p>
<p>The mrna vaccines give your cells instructions how to make a viral protein, so protein is made over time.</p>
<p>A bolus (normal) vaccine gives premade viral protein all at once.</p>
<p>OP might also refer to the fact that the mrna vaccines are in two doses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. One question, does the presence of a proofreading polymerase in coronaviruses decrease the likelihood of vaccine ineffectiveness (due to variance in the spike protein) in comparison to influenza viruses? Or will we likely be looking at an updated vaccine every year similar to flu vaccines?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the original commenter, but yes. If you serially infected people with sars-cov-2 or influenza, the influenza you sequence after several rounds of infection would likely have accumulated far more mutations than the coronavirus. However, if enough people don’t get vaccinated, there’s a population for this coronavirus to keep circulating through, mutating (albeit more slowly), and possibly eventually overcoming the vaccine induced immunity that protects all of us. This is why it’s so important that as many people get vaccinated as possible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I'm aware mutations will occur less frequently, I just wonder whether or not in practice this will also translate to less of a need for periodic updating of vaccines against new variants, as we see for influenza. </p>
<p>I read a study the other day about the occurrence of recurrent deletions in the spike protein gene in SARS-CoV-2 [<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/02/02/science.abf6950" target="_blank">1</a>], resulting in antibody escape. This is not something that can be corrected by a polymerase with proofreading activity, so I was wondering whether we will actually see a difference compared with influenza.</p></div>		</li>
