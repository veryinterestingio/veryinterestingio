			<div class="markdown"><p>Has anyone done any studies to determine if Iguanas can drink sea water? I've long wondered if their salt glands are what enables them to survive long trips across the ocean while rafting on vegetation. Most animals their size cannot make such a voyage to places like the Caribbean Islands, Galapagos Islands, and Fiji. I wonder if they can survive on sea water for the duration of the trip.</p></div>		</li>
