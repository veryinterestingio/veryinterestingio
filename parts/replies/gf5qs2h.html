			<div class="markdown"><p>With that logic is there a prediction of the length of immunity provided by the vaccination?  Are there different variables that would tend to make a vaccination-based immunity more long-lived?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The early findings are that the Moderna vaccine at least gives a reasonably long-lasting immune response (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2032195" target="_blank">Durability of Responses after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 Vaccination</a>). Pfizer’s is likely the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously it needs to be tested. But there’s certainly precedent for vaccines giving better immunity (e.g. HPV vaccines) and it should be both obvious, and supported by data, that the natural immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is extremely variable and not very predictable (though mild and asymptomatic infections tend to cause shorter, weaker immunity) - whereas, again obviously, vaccines can be more consistent and predictable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that the amount of exposure is an factor in how strong the immunity is, so all the people without symptoms for instance may not build as strong/long lasting a immunity as people with a more severe infection. In that case people with a weak natural immunity can profit from an vaccine. It's a similar in concept as the two dose vaccines.</p></div>		</li>
