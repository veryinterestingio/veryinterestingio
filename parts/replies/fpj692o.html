			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not because karma, it's more complicated than that. Hang with me here:</p>
<p>// before I start, I want to say I'm not here to bash any specific ideology, it's just that there's a specific ideology at play here; all of this applies to almost, if not literally, every ideology //</p>
<p>People all want to think of themselves as highly-moral. Two people can both think they're highly-moral and have very different ideas. We're actually generally fairly obsessed (I'd say) with our moral status compared to that of others (as opposed to, say, being concerned with living up to our own, private morals). This is why all the standard party-line political disagreements center around moral issues: progressives and conservatives have almost no e.g. economic policy disagreements except to the extent they can be translated to moral issues (I imagine someone here would counter that <em>all</em> political policy disagreements are moral in nature, I've heard this argument before, and my response to that is, yes, that's exactly what having a totally empty political life outside of party-line moral conflict looks like from the inside).</p>
<p>Anyway, this is all to say that politics <em>in practice</em> is morality (it need not be, but it is). And one of the party-line political moral signalling issues it the American bee populations (obviously on of many popular environmental advocacy memes). It's primarily a progressive issue.</p>
<p>Reddit being overwhelmingly progressive this explains the recent wasp hysteria: it's merely run-of-the-mill political engagement. People want to engage politically because that's how they know how to engage morally (which is unfortunate; I wish they'd redirect that effort to, say, donating their time to charity), and people want to engage morally because they need to assert their morals against others to feel moral compared to others.</p></div>		</li>
