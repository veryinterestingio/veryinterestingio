			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, mast cells and eosinophils are the main effector cells of allergy, and they are largely unaffected by HIV. So long as one had the allergies already, most of the machinery will continue to work for a while. B cell longevity and memory is an interesting topic though, and I’d be curious to see how long it takes the T cell population changes to affect B cell memory in the context of allergy...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m smiling because I just went over the immune in review for the MCAT and I feel like this is the first time I know what people are talking about lol.</p>
<p>What about formation of new allergies. What’s that process like? I know it’s a hype of hypersensitivity reaction, but the review didn’t have any more details that that on allergies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Step one: B cell recognizes antigen via its B cell receptor (surface bound IgM). Antigen recognition triggers internalization of the recognized complex. The complex is then hydrolyzed with enzymes and efficiently loaded onto MHCII. The B cell then presents the antigen in the context of MHCII to a TH2 cell, and the TH2 cell provides cytokines (namely, IL-4) to induce B cell class switch to IgE. The B cell will also undergo clonal expansion, affinity maturation, and differentiation into short lived plasma cells and long lived memory B cells.</p>
<p>The plasma cells dump bucket loads of IgE into the bloodstream for about five days and then they croak. But those memory B cells are long lived. When those memory B cells encounter antigen the next time around, they no longer need T cell help. They are capable of rapidly differentiating into short lived plasma cells all on their own. Thus, continued exposures to allergen continue to supply the mast cells with IgE from plasma cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Preformed antibodies that recognize antigenic moieties on allergens induce B cell differentiation into tissue-specific plasma cells and memory cells. These cells also undergo class switching to produce IgE which is recognized by mast cell receptors (Fc epsilon receptors). When the same allergen is presented again, the memory cells differentiate into active plasma cells which mount a robust response of IgE release.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, we’re really not sure exactly what causes Rheumatoid Arthritis, Crohn’s and Colitis, Lupus, or any other autoimmune disorder, beyond “lots of things that may or may not be related”.</p>
<p>That said, RA and C/C have a lot of similarities in treatment, particularly Remicade/infliximab and Humira/adalimumab, which are artificial antibodies that inactivate Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and prevent it from signaling to induce inflammation and cell death, among other things.</p>
<p>There’s a great post above this about T- vs B-cells, but TNF-alpha is produced in a bunch of different ways, not all of which are dependent on CD4+ cells (which is what HIV suppresses). So, for that particular mechanisms action, HIV would at worst not make things worse, and possibly show small improvements.</p>
<p>As far as HIV and joint pain and mobility in general go? It’s a known side effect but my understanding is that the mechanism of action is very very fuzzy and may be in part caused by different immune system functionality trying to recover for T cells not functioning as well as they should.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe there is a consensus yet as to the mechanism (or, more accurately, mechanisms) by which HIV infection can lead to autoimmune disease, although the connection is believed to exist. I've seen a number of hypotheses, some of which I present here. I don't personally endorse any of these over another.</p>
<p>HIV only directly suppresses part of the immune system, in that the virus enters and attack CD4+ T cells, which primarily act to modulate the adaptive immune response to exogenous antigen. There are several potential consequences to this:</p>
<p>1) The immune system starts to rapidly produce CD4+ T cells to replenish the population which is being depleted by HIV infection. Rapid cellular growth may lead to a deterioration in the quality/efficacy of resulting cells.</p>
<p>2) HIV infection still leaves behind a sizable population of CD8+ T cells. CD4+ deterioration could be associated with regulatory T cell deterioration, leading to overactive CD8+ T cells, leading to the immune system attacking self.</p>
<p>3) Concurrent infections. Additional infection by other bacteria or viruses can lead to a B cell response that seems to be implicated in HIV-associated rheumatic disease. There is some indication that patients have higher levels of self-reactive antibodies. The implied pathway, then, is that bacteria trigger a normal immune response, but under HIV conditions, B cells that release self-reactive antibodies are more likely to be produced.</p></div>		</li>
