			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to understand that the majority of a person's symptoms in some bacterial/viral illnesses, such as those in an upper respiratory infection, are due to the body's response to the pathogen. Fever and the general feeling of being unwell (malaise) are both triggered by your immune system to help fight off the infection and keep you immobile so that you can save energy to fight the illness. In pneumonia, it is mostly your own body's immune cells causing the lung damage, not the pathogen itself.</p>
<p>As the guy above said, this requires your immune system to recognize that there is a foreign pathogen. In children, their immune system is still developing. So while the body might recognize the pathogen, it doesn't trigger a robust, powerful immune response that often causes damage in adults. However, it is just enough to keep the virus at bay while simultaneously maintaining a high viral load that allows easy spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Children also have a higher number of Lymphocytes than adults. Those are the main attackers of viruses. Adults have a higher number of Neutrophils which fight bacteria. I am not saying this is the reason that they are doing so much better but it could be a reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also that your immune system has several &quot;lines of defence&quot; and it could be that the early lines of defence like mucosal IgA, protease, etc have destroyed enough of the invading pathogen that the alarm bells werent panic-mode turned on. Some local inflammatory cells prob did their thing, mopped up the stragglers, and now your viral load is low and manageable. </p>
<p>The prob happens when your short term innate immune response cant keep up with the viral replication. Your body needs time to develop specific immunity. Which is why young people with vigorous immune systems can eventually recover from most stuff. In the meantime, your non-specific immunity (mucous production, fever, etc) ramps up to try to contain things. So out of nowhere, bam you have a fever and youre dribbling snot like a baby. </p>
<p>Why do people's immune systems react differently. Thats a very very long answer that youd really need to take a genetics and immunology class to fully get but basically immunity isnt a one-size fits all thing. It all has to be built out from your genetics and people vary widely in that regard.</p></div>		</li>
