			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlike mRNA, DNA vaccines have real-world evidence re: greater efficacy and durability.  The Japanese are way ahead in the global effort.  Listed w/WHO in April, two candidates now in Ph1/2 (combined safety/efficacy), they have a gold-standard test to measure Ab titers and also cGMP manufacturing ready to go. Their DNA vaccine platform was licensed from Vical which was acquired by Brickell Bio, a US company that intends to pursue US EUA based on the results: <a href="https://www.anges.co.jp/pdf_news/public/IGiJ94QWoV9U7EIYJybHY6SNv3BxVXRN.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.anges.co.jp/pdf\_news/public/IGiJ94QWoV9U7EIYJybHY6SNv3BxVXRN.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.anges.co.jp/pdf\_news/public/IGiJ94QWoV9U7EIYJybHY6SNv3BxVXRN.pdf</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Articles about it say Pfizer expects to have widespread distribution in Q3 2021. You may or may not personally get it sooner, depending on where you live, their access to vaccines, and how your locality chooses to distribute the vaccines (e.g., they may give priority to people over a certain age first).</p>
<p>And that's just if everything goes according to plan.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We estimate that a median of two months of safety data following the second and final dose of the vaccine candidate - required by FDA’s guidance for potential Emergency Use Authorization – will be available by the third week of November.</p>

<p>That feels low to me for seeing any potential long term effects. What are the typical time periods for observing any potential safety issues?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah. Not when we need it now. When more COVID vaccines are available there will likely be an efficacy vs longevity vs side effect vs cost discussion, but that’s down the road a ways</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, at least it was until recently but not by much. Biontech (the company that actually developed the vaccine, Pfizer &quot;just&quot; provided the manpower for the study and production, probably funding as well) was never far behind, essentially just a few weeks. </p>
<p>Surprisingly enough, they seem to have got it right immediately, which is extremely lucky as they're a small start-up doing cancer research and, grossly oversimplified, just reprogrammed their model to Covid. </p>
<p>Things have been going unbelievably well for them, their Phase I and II trials went without any serious problems or interruptions unlike AstraZeneca who had a few hiccups during their trials (although it's really too early to say if either one is actually better - things have just worked out better for Biontech, at least for the time being). </p>
<p>At the end of the day, Biontechs' biggest advantage might be their ability to crank out crazy amounts of doses compared to AstraZeneca due to technical reasons (the production process of AZ's adenovirus-based vaccines has stupid low yields)</p></div>		</li>
