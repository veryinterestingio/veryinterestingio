			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, you can see one of the charts that we use in the US right <a href="https://aviationweather.gov/turbulence/gtg" target="_blank">here</a> to predict turbulence enroute for the day. It isn't as advanced as the predictive software on our EFBs that allows us to look at individual altitudes, but gives an overall view. It also has PIREPs on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay I'm ignorant af with all this. I know what turbulence is to a degree. Chaotic air movement caused by eddies or other currents. </p>
<p>Does turbulence generally stay in one area? Or does it move like a current?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I encountered turbulence the entire way from Buenos Aires to Miami in December, especially when going up the west coast of South America. Could the mountains meeting coastal areas be a reason?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_wave#Aviation" target="_blank">&quot;Mountain wave&quot;</a> is a thing and can have effects far from the mountains that cause them, too.</p>
<p>Essentially, it starts with wind hitting a mountain range and the air being forced upwards, well into the cruise altitudes of airliners, comimng back down again and the whole thing repeating far downwinf from the mountains that caused it.</p>
<p>One can actually use the upwards part to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlan_Project" target="_blank">gain altitude</a> and fly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Wave_Project#Record_flights" target="_blank">very long distances</a>withou using engines. A lot of that flying was done in the Andes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've done a similar study into this. But in constructing structures near mountains and how winds will play a factor in it. It was really fun and sometimes complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Airline Pilot here. Funniest thing I’ve heard ATC say was after they relayed a PIREP for mountain wave turbulence another pilot asked “where does that turbulence start?” It was a clear day and ATC simply replied “you see those mountains? It starts there.” I died laughing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do commerical airliners actually do this or is it too risky?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly. Also, flying in the noon and early afternoon hours can experience more turbulence, as the ground has time to heat up and create updrafts. If you want to encounter smoother air, generally fly in the early morning or at night after the ground has had time to cool down. There can still be specific circumstances that cause turbulence at any time, though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other replies covered mountain wave, but It’s also fairly likely that some of the turbulence you experienced was due to crossing the intertropical convergence zone, which is an area of essentially constant thunderstorms and convective lifting near the equator worldwide.</p>
