<p>Most of the engine noise of a commercial jet is coming off a relatively fixed plane in cruise flight at close to 4000 RPM.</p>
<p>Helicopter noise is generated from a turbine engine at about 6700 RPM, blades at about 400 rpm, and tail rotor at about 1600 RPM.  Note that all 3 of these are creating noise in different directions.  AND it will depend on the type of helicopter as different helicopters have different configuration of engines (turbine or piston), main rotor blades (2, 3, 4+ blades), different tail rotor blades, etc...</p>
<p>Helicopters are just magical beasts that should confuse anyone regardless...</p></div>		</li>
