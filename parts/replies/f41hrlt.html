			<div class="markdown"><p>Smoking causes something called Squamus Metaplasia... Which means that the cell lining changes from ciliated (with little hairs on top) to Squamus (flat and smooth), making it waaay harder to remove all the particles that we breathe in. The inflammation is called chronic bronchitis, and being it prolonged and continue to smoke will make this changes worse and that's how the cancers come about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Smooth, healthy lungs just breathe it out. Rough, <strong>blackened</strong>, unhealthy lungs can't.</p>

<p>Isn't it mostly a myth that smoking cigarettes gives you severely darkened lungs? I remember horrific pictures of almost pitch black lungs from pigs circulated the internet a while back.</p>
<p>Not to defend smoking in any regard, of course. Just trying to stick to real facts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is anecdotal but I've been smoking for 10 years and it's now at a point where every time I cough--literally everytime--black shit comes out. My mucus is always dark black and if I just clear my throat and cough a loogie it's always black. If I cough a bunch into my sink and don't clean it for a while there's giant black stains that accumulate on the porcelain after the water has evaporated. It takes some serious steel wool to clean up the dark tarry loogies... It's absolutely disgusting.
Tldr: Don't smoke kids!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In medical school cadaver lab I saw that smokers do in fact have black spots on their lungs. People who live in cities (smog) will also have polka dotted lungs with many (if my memory serves me correct they were like 0.5cm or so) black spots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black <em>spots</em> seems totally reasonable. But pictures, that has been going around the internet for ages, have been portraying almost pitch-black lungs from previously heavy smokers.</p>
<p>I think that myth got debunked, unfortunately I'm not in a situation right now to find proof of it.</p></div>		</li>
