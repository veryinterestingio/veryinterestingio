<p>Yes, there are many concerns among professionals in the death care industry here in the UK and also concerns about the virus being spread among mourners, which is why the UK government guidelines published by Public Health England state that &quot;individuals who have symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), or who are part of a household where someone has symptoms, or who are vulnerable to severe infection should not participate in rituals or religious gatherings&quot; (See:  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased/guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased-with-suspected-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased/guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased-with-suspected-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased/guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased-with-suspected-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19</a></a> )</p>
<p>Viewing the deceased is not as common here in the UK as the US, but certainly there will be no kissing or touching of the deceased permitted and any viewings that do take place are private affairs and will be closely monitored.</p></div>		</li>
