			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I will get so hungry I'll be nauseous and then when I finally do get food it makes me feel more nauseous to eat. I have to force myself to unpleasantly slowly eat the food. It really ruins a meal and it's worse if I'm out at a restaurant and for some reason the food is delayed and I start feeling that way. It's like I'm not gonna ask for a refund cuz I got the food, but at the same time damn I would've rather just drank a soylent either way it's not an enjoyable experience anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yuuuup. I've confused a handful of folks by saying I'm extremely hungry for like an hour then when we finally get to food, I eat two crackers and wait 15 minutes. The alternative is eating an entire hamburger immediately and then vomiting so yeah I'll take the crackers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happens to me every now and then and when I feel that nausea my mouth starts nausea watering I immediately start scrambling for anything to swallow. Doesn't really matter what it is anything helps. Putting something in my stomach would make it go away right quick.
This only happens in the morning though for me and if it's too cold coupled with an empty stomach I'll actually dry heave a bit.</p></div>		</li>
