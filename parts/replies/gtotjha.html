			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many luminaries in this field whose work you can read. I'd suggest reading the academic work of Marcel van der Brink, Giorgio Trinchieri, Cynthia Seas, Christian Jobin, Eric Pamer, Ami Bhatt, Shuji Ogino, Wendy Garrett, Georg Zeller, Mani Arumugam, Catherine Lozupone, Casey Greene, Tim Spector, Rob Knight.</p>
<p>Separately, for a more lay read, you could read Rob Knight's &quot;Follow Your Gut&quot; or &quot;Dirt is Good&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
