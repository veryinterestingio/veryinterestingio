			<div class="markdown"><p>Space is riddled with PAHs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are huge, carbonaceous molecules. These molecules have also been found in meteorites alongside simple biomolecules. Those PAHs can help form longer chains relatively easily imo. Silicon forms double bonds on very rare occasions, and is also orders of magnitude less abundant in the Universe. And even if complex molecules could be formed in specific settings, simpler versions would need to exist in harsher conditions. That just isn't happening for silicon.</p></div>		</li>
