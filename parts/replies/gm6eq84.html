			<div class="markdown"><p>Socialism is democracy in the workplace and nothing more. </p>
<p>The worker owns the means of production and votes on company decisions. </p>
<p>There is no capitalist you are generating surplus for. You are getting the full wealth of your labours. </p>
<p>Unions are a less graceful socialism. Unions leverage the entire workforce against the capitalist so that we can have some nice things. </p>
<p>Socialism lite if you will.</p>
<p>Edit: also might I add that no big restructuring is necessary. You can start a co opt right now. The only thing socialism really needs to thrive is to get the same funding opportunities that capitalism does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you sit down to negotiate the terms of employment at a new job the company has a professional representing them. You have....you. If you have a union, you have someone with training to negotiate on your behalf. Are you a warehouse worker or a labor lawyer?</p></div>		</li>
