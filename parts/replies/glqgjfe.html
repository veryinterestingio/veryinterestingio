			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point. Additionally, ashes, the solid byproduct of the burning reaction does melt of course. In the fabrication of metals the resulting thick grey liquid is called scum or slag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right! Weak translation. Scum seems to be a generic designation for the impurities found in the metalmaking process, that is anything that isn't the valuable metal.
Slag might be the scum that most closely resembles ashes, either way the ashes might be split or mixed with other material in the chemical reaction, so there is no exact liquid that could be called molten ash, at least not in metallurgy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, maybe, but not in the traditional sense of having &quot;liquid wood&quot;. </p>
<p><a href="https://woodwoodland.com/can-wood-melt/" target="_blank">This article details that exact scenario. Because the cellulose strings in wood are disorderly and tangled, they would simply break up into less complex materials, like carbon and hydrogen, which could then evaporate or melt at high temps.</a></p>
<p>But at that point, it's no longer wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also note that this process of “burning” in anaerobic environments is called pyrolysis and is used in certain industrial processes for the production of things like biofuels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, while the wood wouldn’t burn much of it would thermally decompose. This is how charcoal is made.</p></div>		</li>
