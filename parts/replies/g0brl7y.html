			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other person replying said, evidence of ancient microbial life in general.</p>
<p>A classic example is in one issue of Nature in 2002, the oldest body fossils ever at 3.5 billion years old were reported. (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/416073a" target="_blank">link</a>) The next page was a paper saying they probably weren't actually fossils. (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/416076a" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>These would still be the oldest <em>body</em> fossils ever discovered, if true. But <em>still</em> papers come out saying they are real, or fake.</p>
<p>There was another recent paper suggesting evidence of life over 3.7 billion years ago based on <em>stromatolite</em> evidence, which are structures of curved rock which form from sediment depositing on top of bacteria, which have gooey extrapolymeric substances that the sediment sticks too. If they're photosynthetic they'll have specific upward, arrow-like shapes as well, since the bacteria use something called <em>phototaxis</em> to move upward toward the sunlight. (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19355/" target="_blank">paper link here</a>, example of a stromatolite <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/EPO/yellowstone2002/workshop/stromatolite/stromatolite_imgs/p7310792_lg.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>, the rock from the paper that they thought was a stromatolite <a href="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mU7DcoU4n6xCYsYdhstpUL-1200-80.jpeg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, a little bit later another paper came out saying they probably weren't stromatolites but rather were shapes caused by very regionalized metamorphism (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0610-4?fbclid=IwAR3U7AKZ9Gs9NY_jlDfcTut6iPJGFhz7smW80iFQQJAuShZsfF5BuYTbUH4" target="_blank">link</a>). </p>
<p>People can and do make entire careers out of arguing this topic.</p></div>		</li>
