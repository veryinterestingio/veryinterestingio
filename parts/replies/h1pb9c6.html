			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, cats, who are not social animals, usually don't make a noise when they get hurt. This also avoids alerting potential predators. Dogs, on the other hand, have their own noise.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thanks for all the upvotes</li>
<li>&quot;social&quot; has a specific meaning. It's not a synonym for &quot;friendly&quot;</li>
<li>&#x200B;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Baby humans make a specific sound when they are hurt. If you hear a child crying, you'll feel the need to make it stop.</li>
<li>Adult humans have a specific sound that means they are hurt. If someone says &quot;ow&quot;, other people around will ask if everything is fine.</li>
<li>Dogs gather in packs with a defined social structure. A dog whines when it's suffering. Other dogs will recognize the sound and try to help</li>
<li>Cats gather only in colonies, no alpha males, simple hierarchy . They don't have a specific sound that means that they are suffering. A cat screaming doesn't automatically make other cats come to help. The cat's scream is more like an aggressive &quot;damn you&quot;. It's used when their paw is trapped in a door but also when they are fighting or threatening another cat.</li>
</ul>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also our previous dog would always yelp at the smallest things that caused her to panic like getting bitten by a flea or of you accidently stepped on her, but when she actually got hurt by running head first into a door there was nothing more than an OOMPH. So it definitely sounds like they do it to alert rather than a physical reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once when I was jogging with my dog, he was having a great time and looked at me with a big smile, then immediately ran into a lamp post. He tumbled over with an OOMPH, then got up and wanted to run again.</p>
<p>Another time I was closing a door and he stuck his leg in the way. He was screaming, whimpering and limping around. I had a massive panic thinking I broke his leg so I ran to get my phone to call a vet. Went back to him as I was dialling and he was happily running around the garden. I get the screaming to get me to stop closing the door, but the limping was pure drama.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Example: I have hEDS, and I‚Äôve dislocated my right knee once, and my left knee twice. I never made a noise during any of them, initially. Later, I cried and moaned, but for the first several minutes following the injury, I was silent and unable to respond to anyone asking if I was okay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be adrenaline. You are initially not in as much pain because of that huge spike and then later when your fight or flight cools down the severity of the pain kicks in. I tore my ACL in a high school football game and was able to walk off the field, a feat I don't quite understand because a few mins later my knee was unresponsive and I couldn't lift my leg....and that was when the pain became unbearable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same experience, tore my ACL in a scrimmage in the middle of fall camp. I was able to walk off more or less under my own power with a bit of support. For such a major injury, it honestly didn‚Äôt hurt that much, I thought I had just tweaked something and that I‚Äôd be back in a few days. Crazy how much adrenaline can block out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's learned behavior. You make noise so your Mom (or whomever) hears you and can comfort you.</p>
<p>My son spent his first four years in an orphanage. When he came to us and bashed his head on something he wouldn't make a noise, or he would make an inappropriate noise like genuinely laugh.</p>
<p>You learn a LOT in your first few years of life. I used to scoff at this idea, but then after we adopted him I read up on it more. Tons of human &quot;normal&quot; behavior is shit you learn around age 2-3.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also making a loud noise when you sneeze is a learned behaviour, and one that's very hard to stop doing once you've started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how the parents normally react. If the parents always get worried, the kid will cry. If the parents always laugh, the kid will laugh. If the parents generally have no reaction, or a neutral reaction, the kid will get up and move on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I KNEW IT! My dad is the loudest sneezer and I have always said there can't possibly be a biological need to make that much noise about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed that the noice you make when you sneeze is a learned sound as well. In America we usually say &quot;Ahh-CHOO!&quot; but I learned from a foreign exchange student from Europe, can't recall where, (maybe Czechia?) they say &quot;Hap-CHEE!&quot;  I am sure depending on where you live they make different sounds, which is kind of interesting to me.  Like what noise would we make if we have never heard anyone sneeze before? It's kind of an interesting thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in psych class we had a section on pain and the mental and social aspects of it. There was some tribe somewhere where it was the custom to laugh with children when they fell (usually children cry but they're not really hurt), to teach them not to associate minor knocks and scrapes with pain and negativity. Turned out those people actually developed extremely high pain tolerance and perceived pain differently. I want to say the example was that the women would give birth unmedicated without yelling or crying, but I might be conflating two stories. </p>
<p>Anyways, I think it's similar to how athletes can learn to ignore certain pains like lactic acid build up, but much, much more deeply ingrained because the stuff you learn at two is foundational to everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was going to say the same thing - it‚Äôs learned and not instinctual.
For whatever reason I learned as a kid to be quiet as possible so I don‚Äôt typically make a sound when I hurt myself - maybe a sharp intake of breath at most.
I have to deliberately remind myself to say ‚Äòow‚Äô if I specifically want someone to know I‚Äôm in pain (eg if they‚Äôre doing something painful and I want them to stop)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was trained to be quiet as well, to the extent that now, it's actually difficult for me to be loud when I need to be.  A sudden, shocking pain can do it but otherwise, I struggle to cry out or yell at all.</p></div>		</li>
