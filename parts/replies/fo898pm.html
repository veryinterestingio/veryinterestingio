			<div class="markdown"><p>That shits the worst, when you ask a serious question, the teacher doesn't answer it, and the class laughs at you. Now you feel like trash and <em>still</em> don't know the answer.</p>
<p>For example, I was a very sheltered small child and we were reading Huckleberry Finn in class. We eventually hit the N-word and I had no idea what that meant. After a few more instances I eventually raised my hand and said &quot;What does n***** mean?&quot; and the teacher just gave me this confused look and another classmate who loved to pick on me went &quot;Just ignore him, he's being stupid.&quot; I didn't know what to do so I just sunk my head down and the class resumed.</p></div>		</li>
