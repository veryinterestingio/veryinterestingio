			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had lasik done and have struggled with dry eyes afterwards. I was told my lacrimal sacs could be clogged so my eyes are not getting enough oils. I ended up having my lacrimal glands expressed. I looked it up on YouTube first because I was curious, that was a mistake. So gross ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What can I do to reduce the swelling after the tears have started. I recently left the Eye Dr's office after alot of tests and examinations and noticed my eyes swollen. I wanted to return to work but didn't want to be embarrassed by the swelling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have severe dry eye syndrome and the advise for treating puffy eyes from that is about the same as for crying.  Gently wash your eyes with cool water to remove any &quot;tear leftovers&quot; and then, lightly massage the skin under the eye (around the bone) from the inside corner of your eye to the outside corner, slowly working outward (should take about a minute).  Repeat this for the upper eye area along the bone just above your eye, slowly and lightly rubbing from the inside to the outside.  For crying, it'd be followed up with a cool damp washcloth (CLEAN) to the eyes.  (For dry, this step would be warm compress.)  </p>
<p>Hope this helps.  Quick question though--did the eye doctor mention that anything that they would be doing would cause this?  </p></div>		</li>
