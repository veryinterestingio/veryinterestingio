			<div class="markdown"><p>Would increasing nitric oxide in blood in the early stages of contracting COVID reduce the risk of clots? I read research early in the pandemic that suggested that higher nitric oxide levels in blood will reduce the ability for COVID to replicate. I understand in my limited knowledge that nitric oxide reduces coagulation. </p>
<p>Bias behind my question: I have high nitric oxide levels and the research triggered bias in wanting to believe. I ended up being asymptomatic without passing the virus to immune compromised household member, which further increased bias into thinking the nitric oxide study might be on to something.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My knowledge on NO is basically that it causes vessels to dilate, which may increase tissue perfusion but I've no idea what effect it has on Covid's ability to replicate</p></div>		</li>
