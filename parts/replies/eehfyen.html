			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  In the case of magnets it is called &quot;Magnetic potential energy.&quot;  In the case of the book, it is &quot;gravitational potential energy.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much the same thing as if you just lifted an object from the ground, giving it potential energy. The gravitational and magnetic fields are really alike and share some properties, so pulling two magnets apart would give them potential energy, that's right</p></div>		</li>
