			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, 100% this. It's not uncommon for second and third generation kids to understand but not speak their parents' mother tongue. Granny will speak to you in Spanish/Ukranian/Urdu and you reply in English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this experience with a local Swedish dialect in central-slightly-northern-Sweden, my mom's side of the family stems from a valley?/canyon? region called Älvdalen where the population still speak a form of old norse due to the isolation they were in before trains, cars, etc</p>
<p>When I was little I would be fascinated with my mom and her relatives speaking in the dialect to eachother whenever we would visit, I could still understand some words but it was mostly just gibberish and I kinda regret I wasn't too interested in learning it back then since the dialect is dying out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's always sad I think, when the kids don't acquire it. I have a friend who understands Somalian but can't speak it for his life. Is there a reason that children don't pick up the language? I heard once about a child with a Korean father and Chinese mother and he refused to speak Korean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not even shortly before. They start to understand quite a bit before they develop the ability to speak. It’s pretty common to teach babies some sign language as they are able to use that to communicate basic needs before they have developed to the point they can form words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the first major step is parsing the langauge as you hear it, being able to pick out nouns, verbs, grammar, and tense. from there it's very fast to learn any langauge even those with inverted structure.</p>
<p>the next milestone is concept-based recall instead of  rote translation, i.e. seeing the word 학생들 (haksengdeurl) and immediately thinking of students rather than translating 학생들 -&gt; &quot;student plural&quot; -&gt; college students.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on holiday in Morocco and became friends with the concierge in the riad. One night we sat up smoking hash and listening to reggae for hours despite my complete lack of Arabic and his lack of English. We couldn't understand each other but we could gesture and act out what we wanted to say slowly picking up pieces of words.  It's an experience i remember quite fondly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i've done a fair amount of travel.  it's amazing to me how english is spoken by so many in so many places</p>
<p>it's also been amazing to me that it's very possible to communicate with people who speak no english at all.  all people seem to share some non verbal gestures for eating, drinking, sleeping etc, then you've got place names that transcend the language barrier....</p>
<p>finally, there are some people who just have an amazing facility with language.  people who take a month or two to learn ancient greek so they read a book written in that language</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, learning languages get easier with practice.  </p>
<p>I majored in Japanese in college, and that was a major pain in my rear that took years to even get passably conversational in.  Later on in life, I started using tools like Duolingo to teach myself the basics of a language a few months before traveling abroad.  The first time it was pretty hard (but still easier than that first language), but for each new language, it got easier and quicker, until, most recently, I picked up enough of the basics of Tibetan in a couple of days from our tour guide to haggle with various street vendors.</p>
<p>The downside is that I also <em>forget</em> the languages a ton quicker now, almost immediately after the trip is over.  Though, to be fair, I actually lived in Japan for about a year, which could have beaten it permanently into my brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is kind of weird. Smoking something seems to have an almost universal gesture, especially illicit substances. You get the eyes that dart from side-to-side, to see if anyone is looking or listening, followed by the putting your fingers to your lips thing. And I shit you not, it has been capped off with a wink plenty of times. I could never enjoy it much in a few places because the penalty was pretty harsh.</p></div>		</li>
