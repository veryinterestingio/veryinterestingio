			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, creationists will often try to poke holes in this theory by highlighting the astronomical odds of life spontaneously emerging by pure chance.</p>
<p>I usually like to contextualize the probability like this:</p>
<p>Imagine you have a coin, and you're told to flip the coin until it lands on heads <em>100 times in a row.</em> Those odds sound astronomical, and in the context of a human lifetime, it's practically impossible.</p>
<p><em>Now</em> imagine that you're immortal, and you've been given 4.5 billion years to flip the coin constantly. The odds that you'll reach your goal are now less slim.</p>
<p><em>Now</em> imagine that there are 100 billion copies of you, strewn out across the Milky Way Galaxy, each on their own planet, and each flipping their own coin. Only one of you has to flip the 100 heads, and you all have billions of years to do it.</p>
<p><em>Now</em> imagine that you and your 100 billion clones are copied into each galaxy in the observable universe, of which we estimate there are 200 billion.</p>
<p>Each one of those 200 billion galaxies has 100 billion copies of you, and every copy is flipping a coin non stop for billions of years. Only one of you has to hit 100 heads in a row.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The odds of winning the NJ lottery twice are 1 in 18 trillion. Yet a woman did it. How could this be? Because the odds of <em>her</em> winning were 1 in 18 trillion. The odds of <em>anybody</em> winning were 1 in 3. She’s only considered special <em>because</em> she won.</p>
<p>Let’s say you start specifying the possible locations for a dart to land on a dart board. You set up four quadrants. On a random throw, the odds of it landing in any given quadrant is 25%, 1 in 4. Let’s specify more areas. Let’s split each of those quadrants in half. Now it has a 1 in 8 chance of landing in any of those areas. Split it in half again, 1 in 16. If you get more and more precise, the odds of the dart landing in any given area will approach infinity (and they’ll approach it exponentially quickly, mind you). Yet whenever you throw the dart, it will land in one of those squares that by itself was considered a near impossibility for it to land in.</p>
<p>Let’s combine these ideas. You have a planet. The odds of life spontaneously forming by chance through RNA is extremely unlikely. Yet provide enough planets, the odds approach 100%. When life forms, it will use its mere existence as evidence of a higher power due to the sheer impossibility of itself existing. What isn’t around to observe itself is the countless amount of life that never came to be.</p>
<p>If you identified a random planet and said “that will randomly generate life” and it does, now that’d be something. But if you look out over the entire universe and pick a planet that has life and go “See?!” because the odds for that particular one to generate life were so low, you’re looking back in time at your data to pick the winner. You’re picking where your dart landed to prove divine intervention. That’s bad statistics.</p>
<p>Which, by the way, we have no idea what the odds of life coming to be by chance at this time are. But there is a flaw baked into the foundations of reasoning going into trying to define the impossibility of it in the first place. Let’s say a religious debater says “X scientist has said the odds are one in a bazillion, so even in our universe we shouldn’t expect life. Given the known age of the universe and other information we can also show that certain proteins could not have formed within celestial bodies outside of our observable universe too.” Well then, you can simply ask them ‘What about other universes?’ For all we know there’s an infinite amount of other universes completely disconnected from us that don’t host life. We were the exception, and since we exist to observe ourselves we again fall into the same fallacy of our unlikely odds.</p>
<p>By nature of the invocation of unfalsifiable rhetoric, you can also debunk it through the same methods. This shows it’s an inherently flawed argument. QED. Re: Pascal’s wager, and other famous thought experiments that follow the same logic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The longer I live, the more I'm convinced that statistics (and statistical research methodology) should be a required subject. I see an enormous amount of confusion, obfuscation, outright lying, manipulation, and exploitation through statistics. Maybe if more Oriole understood statistics and the methods used to create them, we'd have a populace that would be more resistant to the forms of harm currently perpetrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It's entirely possible that there were, although it's also possible that life only arose once.</p>
<p>The last universal common ancestor was probably not the only cell alive at the time. Most likely, it lived within an ecosystem of many other organisms, some of which may have had different biochemistry or even have been rooted in life arising at a different place or time. But none of those organisms have living descendants today, at least as far as we know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this excellent explanation.</p>
<p>The next thing that, at a high level, blows my mind is that it took longer to go from single cell to multicellular life than it took for life to arise in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really know, but out of pure speculation I would think it's a defense against predators, but also environmental factors may have prevented multicellular life from surviving earlier. Cooperation between cells might enhance survival. Multicellular life only arose about 600 million years ago but that's far enough back it's hard to know what was happening environmentally.</p></div>		</li>
