			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but how does the microphone tell that my voice is coming from my throat (and allows it) and that the caller's voice is coming from my phone's speaker (and cancels it)? They're both human voices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The phone is what sends out the caller's voice in the first place and knows it should remove its &quot;echo&quot; from the microphone. If there are unexpected delays in the loop (e.g. using some car's Bluetooth speaker and microphone) this mechanism can fail and the call is garbage, thing that happens every time my mother is driving her car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can subtract the voice signal from the other speaker from the input of your own microphone. Easier said than done, but that's the general gist of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The phone „knows“ what’s coming from the microphone, since it is being played from its own speaker. Therefore it can cancel it out.</p></div>		</li>
