			<div class="markdown"><p>As a follow-up, or eyes don't exclusively use saccadic masking. We also have the capability of &quot;smooth pursuit&quot;. Instead of the &quot;clicking&quot; mentioned by OP it's a smooth motion of the eyes, meant to easily track a moving object. It can easily be observed by instructing someone to follow your finger moving from side to side in front of a their face. It's a common test that police use to check for intoxication, as smooth pursuit is disrupted when inebriated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That extra-long second? Your brain edited time. It ticked while saccadic masking was still active, so it just said, “Well, it was there the whole time”, so that’s what you saw. Now think about how it might have accomplished that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The book Blindsight by Peter Watts has aliens in it that can move during the saccadic masking, and thus they can be invisible to one person at a time, since our brain edits them out.</p>
<p>That book, and The Naked Lady Who Stood On Her Head both really go into how much our brains fuck with us.</p></div>		</li>

If your brain was patching some of that it may give you a blank mirror for that split second.</p></div>		</li>
