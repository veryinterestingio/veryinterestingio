			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a russian speaker, and Russian doesn’t really work like that. Prepositions are still pretty widespread, like with the bottle example that you used. You would say “налил ИЗ бутылки” (poured from the bottle). Из means from, and the sentence wouldn’t make sense without it. Where the declinations do help is with word order. Like “The cat ate the mouse” and “The mouse ate the cat” mean two different things in English, but Russian uses those grammatical endings to make it clear which noun is the subject and which one is the object. “Кошка съела мышку” and “Мышку съела кошка” both mean “The cat ate the mouse” despite the reversed word order. In general, those endings replace the huge amount of helping verbs and other grammatical words that English has, Russian just sticks them onto the ends of words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, those endings on nouns are called cases and is the feature that allows Slavic languages to have basically free word order. In your example sentence, could arrange those three words in any order and the meaning would not change (but the emphasis would, which allows to &quot;fine-tune&quot; how you want to express things on a level that wouldn't be easy or even possible in languages that don't have this).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think in that case actually Georgian would be a better candidate here. Quick disclaimer: I’m not a native speaker nor fluent but I’m learning it at the moment, so I can share some things I found noteworthy.</p>
<p>I’m not 100% sure whether Georgian has no prepositions at all, but if it does they’re extremely rare. For example, if someone asks where you are and you want to reply that you are in Tbilisi, you have these options (for the purpose of this reply I used English, Russian, and Georgian):</p>
<ul>
<li>English: “In Tbilisi.” </li>
<li>Russian: “v Tbilisi/в Тбилиси” +ending which I frankly don’t remember, but you get the point.</li>
<li>Georgian: “Tbilisshi/თბილისში” i.e. the preposition “in” is added to the noun as a suffix.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make things slightly more confusing, the suffix -shi/-ში can also mean “to” (I.e. denoting direction); which one is meant must be deducted from context. Hence you could say “vtskhovrob Tbilisshi/ვცხოვრობ თბილისში” (I live IN Tbilisi) or “mivdivar Tbilisshi/მივდივარ თბილისში” (I am going TO Tbilisi). As you can see, in both cases the noun has the same suffix -shi/-ში which depending on context means either to or in. </p>
<p>There are many more like these, also some that appear composite in a sense. For example, if you would say someone’s place (as in “let’s go to John’s place”), you get: name+genitive ending+tan </p>
<p>Hence, say we’re at Merabi’s place: Merabi+s+tan, i.e. merabistan/მერაბისთან. </p>
<p>In case anyone thought so (like I initially suspected myself): the suffix now looks like -stan, but this is completely unrelated to the Turkish “stan” which I believe means something like country (e.g. Bulgaria is Bulgaristan, Georgia is Gürcistan). The Turkish one is a noun in its own right added to the name of a people (“land of the Bulgarians” etc), whereas the Georgian one is a grammatical construction which happens to sound similar. </p>
<p>This is shown by the fact that only proper names keep their genitive -s ending when -tan is added; “your place” would be “shentan/შენთან”, as you can see without s between word and suffix.</p>
<p>Edit: alright maybe I should have added this as a reply to the comment to which the post to which I now reply replies, but I get it’s sort of clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar in (many) Turkic languages. You just add shit to the end of the word and it changes then meaning.</p>
<p>Ex in Turkmen:</p>
<p>House: Jay</p>
<p>Houses: Jaylar</p>
<p>My Houses: Jaylarym</p>
<p>In my houses: Jaylarymda</p>
<p>I was in my houses: Jaylarymdadym</p>
<p>They were in my houses: Jaylarymdadylar</p>
<p>Were they in my houses?: Jaylarymdadylarmy?</p>
<p>I wonder if they were in my houses: Jaylarymdadylarmyka?</p>
<p>And its not only grammar, we really use it like that.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly that's how tamil works. We don't have any pronouns, but suffixes: none, object marker (I am me, me=object), because of, to/for, in, possession/comparison and calling (like oh hi mark!)  </p>
<p>Also 3 prefixes: here, there and where. Works for here/there/where, this/that/what, him/him(over there)/who, now/later/when, this reason/that reason/why (literally mixing these 3 with the -because suffix)  </p>
<p>Also have gender suffixes and time suffixes and state suffixes and all the fun stuff. I love my mother tongue but I still speak like a foreigner.</p></div>		</li>
