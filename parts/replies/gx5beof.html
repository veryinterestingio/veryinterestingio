			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it really does a whole lot of things. Among others, a branch of the vagus nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles in your throat when you speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does also play a role, however afaik the more important part is vagus stimulation. I might be wrong, though; I am not a doctor. The parasympathetic effect the vagus has on the heart is one of the key factors regulating heart rate. An isolated heart without vagus stimulation would beat at a rather fast 100 bpm so a typical human heart is under constant vagotonus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is correct. Respiratory arrhythmia is mostly dependent on vagus stimulation </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t it be inspiration -&gt; lower inthrathoracic pressure -&gt; greater venous return -&gt; preload -&gt; stroke volume is increased -&gt; higher blood pressure -&gt; heart rate decrease</p>
<p>If what I said above is correct then that would have the opposite effect to vagus nerve shenanigans?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah the greater venous return would directly stimulate a higher heart rate to counteract the different in systemic and venous blood volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is technically correct, it doesn’t apply to respiratory arrhythmia. the most immediate response to increased venous return during inspiration would be increased stroke volume, not the bpm. It’s because preload would increase and this would directly effect stroke volume. The bpm wouldn’t change until this volume imbalance was sustained for a relatively longer amount of time (more than just one respiratory cycle). </p>
<p>However, the vagus nerve modulation during expiration/inspiration would have an immediate effect on heart rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On an ECG readout that a nurse gave me (to keep as a souvenir/reminder that I'm healthy; thought I was having a heart attack but was only having a panic attack.. was age 35) and in the readout there's a section that has some info, and in there it simply reads &quot;sinus rhythm&quot; as one of the notes. I've always been curious as to what that meant. Same thing as sinus arrhythmia? My heart rate <em>does</em> change when I breathe in vs out.</p></div>		</li>
