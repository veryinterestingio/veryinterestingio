			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel fairly confident that Bowie's last album was named after that phenomenon. &quot;Stellar remnant, specifically a white dwarf that has cooled sufficiently that it no longer emits significant heat or light&quot;. That realization made me very sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A White Dwarf is the core of a star with all it's layers shed after it's expansion to a Red Giant. Our own star will undergo this process. The core is white only because of the heat it is emitting from billions of years of degenerative pressure. </p>
<p>Look at when a sword is forged. It's red hot when out of the furnace. This is like a White Dwarf. Eventually, the sword cools to the ambient temperature of it's surroundings by emitting the heat and it stops glowing red at that point. This will happen to the White Dwarf and at that point, as it is no longer emitting any heat, it will no longer be visible and thus become a Black Dwarf</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But, like, what is the core exactly? The sun is plasma, and plasma is what gas becomes when it's super hot right? So if it cools down, is the core still plasma? or Gas? or something else?</p></div>		</li>
