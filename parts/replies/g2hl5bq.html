			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not excess air pressure being released so much as an intentional automatic bleeder that activates on the air tanks to blow accumulated beater out of the tank.  I suppose that is excess in terms of the system produces more than it needs only for direct brake operation, but it's 100% intended to keep tanks from having standing water and corroding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you see thinking of is two different things, a high pressure release that works if the air compressor governor quits working and causes too much pressure for the system to handle, and there are valves at the bottom of the air tanks that you manually operate to drain water, which is mostly about avoiding ice in the lines more than rust in the tanks. The comments above was correct, you release the parking brake by applying air to one system that fills one section of the air brake chamber, the second system connects the brake pedal to the other part of the brake chamber to apply the regular (service) brakes. When you ease pressure applied to the brake pedal this air will release out of the service brake system, it doesn't get put back into the air tanks. When you see a vehicle with air brakes begin to move you will hear this air escaping as they lift their foot off of the brake pedal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah, that is also true.  I was more thinking about people saying, &quot;why does a truck that is just idling next to me make noise&quot; which would probably be more confusing than hearing the air be let out of the system as they start to go, in much the same way as the engine going under load due to some internal process coming on would be more unexpected then it going under load due to pulling away from a stop.  But I suppose you're right that both of those conditions would make noise.</p></div>		</li>
