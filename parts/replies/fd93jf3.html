<p>To follow Raptor503's logic, Japan was forced to attack the US because unelected people led an effective coup to assume the authorities of the president. Never mind that the oil embargo was the result of 5 years of policy towards Japan, directed by FDR, and the oil embargo itself came as a result of Japanese expansion into the south pacific. </p>
<p>No the real villains here are the bureaucrats, who are tasked with carrying out administration policy and are answerable to elected officials, carrying out said policy against..... huh an authoritarian state who was the target of administration policy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The state department did while FDR was out of country.  When he got back and was pissed they told him if he recinded the oil embargo he would make america look weak. </p>
<p>Iirc the man with the plan was dean acheson, senior state official and member of the so called &quot;wise men&quot; cabal post war</p></div>		</li>
