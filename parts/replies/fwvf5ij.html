			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I reading the charts wrong or do they actually estimate total cases to be more than 10 times higher than the official numbers?</p>
<p>Based on what? Even when we assume 40-50% of people are asymptomatic and will never be tested that's still ridiculously high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on your area, a lot of seroprevalence studies are showing anywhere from 4-70x the official account. Those studies check antibodies of a random selection of the population. They are why we can more comfortably believe that the IFR (mortality rate) is between 0.2 to 1%, and not 3+%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The antibody studies come with a false positive rate that is poorly known. Sure, they all try to correct for that, but it's difficult with a new disease that didn't infect most people.</p>
<p>If your test incorrectly labels 10% of the negative samples as positive and you get 13% positive samples, have 3% of the population been infected? Or 5% and the 10% estimate was a bit too high? Or 1% and the 10% estimate was a bit too low?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Geneva (Switzerland) we've had 5000 official cases, but tests estimate that actually 11% of the population were infected - that's over 50000, 10x the confirmed cases. The vast majority of people were asymptomatic or had mild enough symptoms to not get tested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at antibody studies that have come out in the last few months actually 10x is a pretty average number for how many people have antibodies present compared to how many positive tests that same population had. It ranges obviously based on the age of the population, how widely available testing had been, etc but 10x is a good ballpark number.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what I gather from this is, none of the models did particularly well, but as they absorbed and processed data from the ongoing pandemic, the models improved significantly</p></div>		</li>
