			<div class="markdown"><p>I only learned this recently, but the &quot;let stand&quot; instruction isn't there to cool it down, it's to let the heat distribute through the entire Hot Pocket so you don't have cold patches!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not per se. In the Earth's mantle (the huge layer around the mostly metal core and below the crust) heat is generated from the decay of radioactive elements. If enough heat is generated, this mantle could become hotter than the core itself. </p>
<p>Radiogenic heat isn't produced in large enough quantities however. Even if it was, then over time the core itself would in turn heat up too. Hence a cool center as a stable state is impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can it become hotter? If it would be hotter, there would be heat flow to the core and there is no heat sink there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Over a short time the mantle could be warmer than the core, but over billions of years, since the core is only in contact with the mantle (and therefore cannot lose heat anywhere else) while the mantle is in contact with the lithosphere, is in contact with the atmosphere is in (radiative) contact with space, the core couldn't stay cooler than the mantle.</p></div>		</li>
