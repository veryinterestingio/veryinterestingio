<p>Reposted by u/jiggity_gee</p>
<p>So your bowels are like a long train track and your food is like a set of cars on the track. Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.</p>
<p>When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).</p>
<p>Now, all of this goes fucking nuts when you load a bad set of train cars at Point A. The track sensors located everywhere along the track, detect this alien set of cars and sends a distress call to the Supervisor (your brain). The Supervisor wants to handle the situation without having to phone the Manager (your consciousness) about the craziness on the tracks and also wants to make sure you never know it was on the tracks. It has to make a choice now: send it back to Point A violently and somewhat painfully risking tearing the tracks, or send it to Point B as fast as fuck? Depending on where it's located on the track, it'll choose the best route.</p>
<p>Let's use the destination Point B. The Supervisor hits the panic button and puts all the train cars that are on the track (in your body) on overdrive. The tunnels are flooded with water and lubricant to speed all the cars up and get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Cars collide with each other, and previously well formed cars are just flooded with water and lubricant that they are just a soggy, shadowy reminder of their former glory state.</p>
<p>The Media (pain) hears about the car collisions immediately begins filming live the high speed, flooded train cars out of control. They want to knos how an alien set of train cars were put on the tracks and they want someone to pay for such carelessness. The Manager is just watching the horror unfold on Live TV but cannot do anything to stop it, because the Supervisor was deaf and he had not installed a means of communicating with him after hours in the office.</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question.</p>
<p>TL;DR when you get diarrhea, everything gets pushed out, one way or another. There are no passing lanes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you're just reposting this, but I'd love to know why kids vomit more than adults, but adults get more diarrhea.  I always assumed it was because option A was a more riskier gambit for the body, as it's meant to be a one way highway, and that after an evolutionary lifetime (18+ years) of accruing bacteria and a complex gut microflora, the body is like &quot;Eh, just keep it moving, let's get it on the option B fast lane.&quot;  </p>
<p>When I was a kid it was normal to vomit at least 3-4 times a year, even just getting a flu or ate something disagreeable.  Now it seems like it's normal to go 3-4 years without having this happen, even if one feels very nauseous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine you've answered your own question here.  </p>
<p>Babies: Only drink milk, there is no structure in anything they are taking in and their underdeveloped digestive system has less to deal with, so they get diarrhoea all the time. But their simple diet minimises the risk of serious contaminants, so the body assumes it's safe to send the cars on to point B.  </p>
<p>Young Kids: Start eating different foods and also start putting literally everything in their mouths. So not only are they taking in new nutrients the body has little experience in dealing with, but the risk of serious contaminants is higher than ever. Digestive system decides it's better to be safe than sorry and just rejects any cars that look even slightly questionable.  </p>
<p>Older kids: Digestive system is getting used to different foods and is better at assessing the cars that come in and also kid has learned to stop putting dumb crap like table legs and cat turds in their mouths, so the risk of contaminants is lower. Body takes more chances on cars they aren't sure about as they know that the digestive system has gotten stronger and smarter and can handle dodgy cars better.  </p>
<p>Adults: Digestive system is now seasoned pro at not only assessing cars, but also in dealing with the rowdier cars that come through.   </p>
<p>When you were a baby, border control post was just a camping chair with a baby sat in it that let cars through based on whether they were milk coloured, or not milk coloured and the tunnel to the exit wasn't even staffed, it was just a bunch of toddlers with super soakers squirting the cars as they went past.   </p>
<p>As an adult, border control is a military operation with armed guards and search dogs and a special room for cavity searches and interrogations and the tunnel to the exit is staffed with armed guards and scientists who are trained to step in when a car is acting weird and do something to mitigate the damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was backwards for me. I didn't start throwing up until my 30s. I had the flu, food poisoning, and 2 pregnancies. Maybe puked 3-4 times that I remember before my 30s. Now I'm in my 40s and umm kinda nauseas from the phlegm in my throat.</p></div>		</li>
