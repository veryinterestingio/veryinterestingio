			<div class="markdown"><p>Civilian casualties in war aren't some natural, random occurence. They happen because of the decisions of military forces. So you can't expect some specific gender ratio from incident to incedent or from conflict to conflict.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In modern society, risky male behavior post-adolesence is responsible for more male deaths than warfare. Stuff like engaging in crime, picking fights, speeding, racing motorcycles, wrestling alligators and the like.</p>
<p>Testosterone essentially drives men to do stupid shit to prove their masculinity, kills them early, and rebalances the gender ratio.</p></div>		</li>
