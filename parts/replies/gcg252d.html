			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the correct answer, the tone isn't an absolute value its a change-in-value that can be mapped onto singing just like inflection in english.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't think anyone has a problem. It's not really necessary to keep track of any pitch beyond the current syllable - and even that can just be a bonus.</p>
<p>Edit: There is research that suggests that A) tone-deaf people have more difficulty learning tonal languages, but B) people raised with a tonal language tend to have better pitch processing (because it isn't all hereditary) on average - both relative and absolute. Here's a paper: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00120/full" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00120/full</a> . To reiterate though.. I think most anyone who has spent a lot of time in China will immediately say that the native-born people they know who are terrible singers don't have any profound difficulties speaking nor understanding Mandarin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One other thing - &quot;terrible singer&quot; doesn't necessarily equal scientifically tone deaf which I think is important to differentiate. People frequently use the phrase tone deaf to refer to anyone who doesn't really sing that well. This article refers to actual amusics, people who are diagnosed with amusia, not just people who say they're tone deaf because they don't carry a tune all that well.</p>
<p>Particularly since it appears that some people are genetically predisposed to amusia, I'd be interested to know if it occurs at the same rate in racial populations that traditionally use tonal languages vs those that don't (e.g., East Asian vs. Caucasian).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for posting this link! I just realized while reading it that I had never considered the intervals between pitches in language before. I've been speaking Mandarin my whole life AND I have a music degree (I'm even a singer lol), but I literally just realized that my brain has somehow compartmentalized musical intervals somewhere totally separate from pitches in Mandarin and I just spent a LONG time weirdly/slowly sing-saying random words to figure out the intervals. They're all pretty big, at least a minor 3rd (3 semitones), which tracks with the theory that tone deaf people struggle with smaller intervals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still super far down this rabbit hole, haha. I jut found this article: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269190498_Phonological_processing_in_Mandarin_speakers_with_congenital_amusia" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269190498\_Phonological\_processing\_in\_Mandarin\_speakers\_with\_congenital\_amusia" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269190498\_Phonological\_processing\_in\_Mandarin\_speakers\_with\_congenital\_amusia</a></a></p>
<p>They ask Mandarin speakers, both with and without amusia, to discriminate between different tones in Cantonese and to try to imitate them. In short, it sounds like while amusics had a harder time differentiating, they performed comparably in imitation tasks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I know tone deaf chinese speakers. The tones are relative pitches, you don't need perfect pitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, I love this question!!</p>
<p>Short answer: Probably! Mainly because of what &quot;tone deafness&quot; actually is - and I strongly suspect that if you did a full on study, we would find a negative correlation between tone deafness and native tonal language speakers. But also, because if someone mispronounces or mistypes a word in English, you can still figure it out with context clues and so on.</p>
<p>Long answer: This is honestly something that if I had unlimited time and energy would be high on my list of things to research and maybe do a dissertation on, as it sits at the intersection of music (especially music education) and linguistics, which are two of my passions.</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Faux&quot; tone deafness: Some people claim they are tone deaf but they're just not very good at singing. They can recognize a tune and if they're singing a song, they can raise and lower their pitch appropriately but not always correctly (their pitch goes in the right direction, but not necessarily the right amount/interval). Most of these people can match a pitch given enough time and effort. Most of these people can also pick out a wrong note in a common melody (though they might not be able to tell you why the note is wrong or how badly wrong it is).</li>
<li>&quot;Absolute&quot; tone deafness: True tone deafness is pretty rare - I've seen 4% thrown around, but that's not my anecdotal experience (although true tone deaf people probably self select out of situations where they would need to sing). True tone deafness means someone can't match a pitch no matter how hard they try or how long you give them; they can't recognize relative pitch or even identify common melodies (without words, of course), and might not even know if they should change pitch higher or lower to sing a melody. As a classically trained singer, I have only met ONE person I believed to have &quot;absolute&quot; tone deafness. When singing, this person sounded like they were just speaking with a strange inflection (relatively high pitched compared to their speaking voice and very meandering tones). To my knowledge, there's no physiological cause (yet) of absolute tone deafness, but I haven't researched it that extensively.</li>
<li>Absolute pitch and relative pitch: There is data to support the theory that *absolute* pitch (the ability to identify any pitch in a vacuum) is actually learned. We see it with higher frequency in people who are musically trained from a young age, and some people claim to have learned it through intense ear training. People who have &quot;natural&quot; absolute pitch also tend to lose it as they grow older (presumably something to do with gradual physiological changes in hearing). (I'm personally skeptical that this is as innate as some people claim given that the modern pitch system is entirely manmade - so you might have a predisposition toward it, but I don't think you can actually be born with it.) Good *relative pitch* is the ability to find any note given a starting note as a reference point. This is definitely highly trainable.</li>
</ol>
<p>If absolute pitch and, more importantly, relative pitch are both trainable, then it's very unlikely that a person who grew up with a highly tonal language would develop tone deafness. The majority of people who claim to be tone deaf can accurately identify changes in pitch direction anyway, which is the important part of a tonal language.</p>
<p>&quot;Absolute&quot; tone deafness also isn't a physical <del>or genetic</del> defect as far as we know (doesn't mean we haven't found it yet though!), but it would definitely be interesting to see a large scale study on the incidence of &quot;absolute&quot; tone deafness in native tonal language speakers. Might also be interesting to find a bunch of truly tone deaf people and try to teach them a tonal language and see what happened. But again, they could probably &quot;get by&quot; using context and other people's ability to deduce what they meant.</p>
<p>Finally - just anecdotally, I've never heard a native (or fluent, for that matter) Chinese speaker and thought that they might have absolute tone deafness as defined above (literally unable to know if they should go up or down in pitch - so this should be easily discernable after even just one or two sentences). If the incidence rate is truly 4%, then I've certainly heard enough people speak Chinese to have heard this happen at least once or twice. (Obviously, students just getting a grasp on tones don't count!)</p>
<p>Sorry for the nerdy novel - and thanks for the awesome question! :)</p>
<p>EDIT: Went down a rabbit hole reading and there is evidence to suggest some hereditary tone deafness!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another question.</p>
<p>Is there any data that relates tone deafness and accent? I can easily see how a person's non-absolute &quot;tone deafness&quot;(as in wrong amount of rise/fall applied, etc) can be seen as somebody else's accent if they simply travel to another region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know if you speak mandarin yourself, but almost nobody has any trouble speaking even if they are tone deaf.(i.e. they are unable to sing songs in pitch(they always sing off-key) but able to enunciate and speak in proper mandarin since mandarin don't care about absolute pitch but only relative pitch)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This description made the most sense to me. Obviously such a commonly used language can't rely on pitch-perfect pronunciation and hearing. The subjective &quot;constant, rising, falling-then-rising, and falling&quot; make so much more sense, and wouldn't conflict much at all with music.</p></div>		</li>
