			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true now, and truly &quot;recycling&quot; plastic may well prove impossible (ever).</p>
<p>However, there are also all sorts of weird microbes and such that could potentially be used to <em>break down</em> plastics someday.  We've barely scratched the surface of discovering what nature can do, and with genetic engineering who knows what might be possible?</p>
<p>I really think such solutions hold the most promise for solving the plastic mess we've made ... but really I think all we should aim for is just a way to (safely) get rid of our plastic, and not worry about reusing it the way we do with aluminum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually some bioplastics produced by microbes that have similar characteristics to traditional plastic used for packaging and such that can break down in somewhat mesophilic conditions. Also there's bacteria known to degrade plant based plastics in these conditions as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes exactly, and as I said before that is just scratching the surface of what's possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  Doing it all <em>safely</em> makes it much more challenging ... but I don't think it's insurmountable.</p>
<p>Time will tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe instead of making things out of plastic we should just make lego bricks and have others piece them together into whatever they need. That way recycling would be as easy as taking stuff apart and putting together something else.</p></div>		</li>
