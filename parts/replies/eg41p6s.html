			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely true.  That requires parallax and was done in the mid-1600's.  The first really accurate measurement was a radar ping on Venus at closest approach to us.  I think this happened in the 1950's, though I don't recall.  Then, since we know all the relative distances with fairly high precision, we were able to put them in conventional units.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Take this length to be 1 AU, and trigonometry lets us figure out the Mercury/Sun distance and the Earth/Mercury distance.</p>

<p>I was following you until here. How can we calculate the other 2 distances if all we have is the Earth/Sun one? (How did he even have the Earth/Sun one?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He didn't have the Earth/Sun distance.  1 AU is one &quot;astronomical unit,&quot; and it is the length equal the the average distance between the Earth and the Sun.  The thing about all of our units is they are completely arbitrary.  We decide how long a second is and how far a mile is and how much a pound is (is American units).  Kepler basically invented a new unit of length - the distance between the Earth and the Sun.  He had no idea how long that is in miles, but for what he was doing that didn't matter.  All that mattered was figuring out how much closer to or farther from the Sun each planet is compared to Earth.</p>
<p>Now, to get the other two lengths we use the trigonometric relations sine, cosine, and tangent.  Do you know how those work or do you want an explanation?  I'm happy to do that, but I don't want to be too boring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I wouldn't mind an explanation. So, at this, point, all Kepler had was:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the Earth/Sun distance (= 1 AU)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the angle between the Earth/Sun and Earth/Mercury lines</p>
</li>
<li>the angle between the Earth/Mercury and Mercury/Sun lines</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct?</p>
<p>(Though I'm not sure I understood exactly how we got the angles.)</p></div>		</li>
