<p>I was diagnosed ADHD at 49 years old.  </p>
<p>One of the aspects of ADHD is you do not sleep well.  I always sleep really good.  This was a puzzle.  After much thinking and reading about sleeping and falling asleep I figured out what I did is a variation of what sleep researchers teach.</p>
<p>There are 3 aspects to falling asleep and sleeping well.
You need to be physically ready to sleep, you need to be mentally ready to sleep and your subconscious needs to be ready.</p>
<p>Physical readiness.   Lay down in your bed on your back. Put your arms in a neutral comfortable position.   Relax and don't move.  </p>
<p>You are going to be doing some light meditation.  Start by feeling your toes (do not move).  feel how the blankets cover them, feel the weight. pay attention to how it feels.  resist moving (you will have to start again if you move).  after a few seconds you will notice you can not actually <em>feel</em> your toes.</p>
<p>Move up your body to your foot.  repeat the above process.  each time you get a part of your body to a point that you can not feel it you are making it physically ready to fall asleep.  </p>
<p>Yea you have to resist the urge to twitch or move.  This will take some time to master and to do.  the really tough part is your chest as your lungs can not stop obviously. and most people have a lot of problems with their face and neck.</p>
<p>On to your mental preparedness.  while you are working through the physical relaxation your mind can start the mental part.
To do this close your eyes and envision a black surface as far as you can see covering your entire visual field.  Imagine a tiny dot of white in the middle.  expand that dot slowly to encompass the entire field until all you have is a white field of view.
Repeat with a black dot, white dot, etc. until you are not actually thinking of anything else.  </p>
<p>Think of this as washing your mind out from the events of the day.  Once your mind is clear of them, they will stay away long enough for you to sleep.  If you find your thoughts are drifting, keep at it until you are able to clear your mind.</p>
<p>And then there is Subconscious preparation.   Your subconscious is not going to sleep, it will be busy dreaming and maintenance of your body :)</p>
<p>Your subconscious needs to be steered into thinking (dreaming) of something that is not upsetting or negative.  To do this, after you have physically and mentally prepared yourself, close your eyes, take a dep breath, let it out and start to think of something that is fun or something that you would really enjoy.  Winning the lottery, flying like superman/woman, anything that will let you guide your thoughts to an enjoyable spot mentally.</p>
<p>You will be asleep within 5 minutes probably and as you do this more you will find you fall asleep faster and faster.  This is made easier if you have a white noise generator.  A fan blowing in the room, or a radio on low with static playing.</p>
<p>When I fall asleep, I prepare myself all in one breath.  I lay down (now I am able to do it on my side) and take one deep relaxing breath.  I am asleep before I finish my next breath 98% of the time.</p>
<p>For me personally these 3 parts came at different ages.  </p>
<p>When I was 14 I broke my shoulder and did not sleep for 5 days.  I had to force myself to lay perfectly still on my back and not move (it hurt like hell if I did).  I trained myself to not move a muscle when I slept.  I did that till my late 20's.  I would wake up in exactly the same position I fell asleep in.  I can still do it if I try :)</p>
<p>When I was in my late teens, I was interested in mental exercises, and started to see how to clear my mind.  I found this was easier to do just before I went to sleep and was not actually trying to go to sleep, but to explore my mental processes.</p>
<p>The last part was a byproduct of my poor position in life.  I used to hate going to sleep because I would lay there for hours as a kid.  I would hear everything in the house cooling down and creaking.  To get my mind off of hearing those things and focusing on them, I wanted to actively think about something positive.</p>
<p>Coming form a poor ($$ wise) family we never had much.  I always used to think about winning the lottery and how I would use the money.  what my house would look like, what my yard would look like, what toys I would buy, and what I would not do with it.  I kept my mind on positive things and did not let myself think negative things before sleep.</p>
<p>It took a lot of reading and digging mentally to realize these are the same 3 steps taught to people who are having trouble sleeping.</p>
<p>The last part is interesting to me because as a side note I have not had a <em>nightmare</em> since I was 3 or 4.  I remember the last (and only) time I was woken from a nightmare.<br />
I am a semi lucid dreamer.  I always know I am in a dream, and choose to sit back and enjoy the <em>show</em> so to speak.  If I encounter something that is catastrophically bad, I know it is a dream and choose to change the <em>channel</em> so to speak and change my dream to something more enjoyable. </p>
<p>My sleeping well has led to me also being able to wake up about a minute before my alarm goes off abbot 50% of the time.  about 40 % of the time it is 1 - 10 min before my alarm and about 10% of the time my alarm goes off (for about 2 seconds).</p>
<p>I hope that helps   any more questions please ask.</p></div>		</li>
