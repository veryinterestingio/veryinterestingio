			<div class="markdown"><p>As other have said, the trick with small mammals is to heat them up slowly and evenly. You can microwave a frozen hamster and bring it back to life, though a rabbit might too large. The bigger (and more complex) something gets, the harder it is to freeze without disrupting the cells. </p>
<p>Here's a 12 minute video discussing the topic, including an interview with the scientist that invented his own microwave for this purpose: <a href="https://youtu.be/2tdiKTSdE9Y" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/2tdiKTSdE9Y</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's how I used to feed my venus fly trap as well. They won't eat unless the prey moves, so I would catch a fly in a container and put it in the fridge until it goes to sleep, then put it in the venus fly trap. The fly wakes up and starts struggling, so the venus fly trap digests it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a fucking wild ride for the fly. Captured, life slowly sucked out of it, dies, wakes up to the possibility of freedom, nope, captured again, next slowly digested. Good lord, please don't let me reincarnate as a fly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Once put some Bon Chon fried chicken into the fridge. Went to eat it the next day, too lazy to heat it up so ate straight from the container. Underneath the last piece of fried chicken was a 2-inch cockroach. I fucking flipped the table over and ran away.</p>
<p>After 20 minutes of deep breathing exercises to calm myself down and prevent myself from throwing up, I came back to the box and was going to throw it away. I peaked inside to look at the cockroach thinking it was dead since it wasn't moving and in the fridge for a day. NOPE THIS GUY IS BACK ALIVE RUNS OUT OF THE BOX I FUCKING RUN FOR MY LIFE AND BURN DOWN MY HOUSE</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suffered a broken ulna because i grabbed my cutting board and when I turned it over there was a cockroach. Tossed the cutting board into the the fuckin air and attempted to turn and run away, was wearing socks didn't get the traction i wanted/needed. Didn't make the turn, slipped, started to fall backward ... needed to get away so pushed off further propelling myself a little faster downward and landed on my elbow, heavily. Shit fuckin hurt, so bad. I went back into the kitchen and funny the cutting board landed on the counter, but it caught the cockroach as it was scurrying away and smashed the back half of it. I still sprayed that motherfucker for 10 seconds with roach killer and the clorox disinfectant.</p>
<p>Fuck that i hate cockroaches</p></div>		</li>

<p>That makes Diapause, Hybernation, and Torpor and sleep like winter survival methods.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to go further down that rabbit hole... hibernation is for the winter. Estivation is for the summer. In areas that are hot/dry in the summer, like where I live, a lot of amphibians (frogs, newts) go underground in the summer and wait until the winter rains to come back out.</p></div>		</li>
