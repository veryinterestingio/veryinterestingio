			<div class="markdown"><p>To take it a step further to account for radar types, the white light flashlight is the search radar and then once found, you switch the flashlight to a red light and hold it on the person which is like a fire control radar constantly illuminating the target.</p>
<p>As the target, you see the constant red light and you know (your aircraft tells you) that danger is near.</p>
<p>Yesterday, you played the same game and you recognize the same colour red (it's slightly orange) and suddenly you know it's your friend Sam pointing the light at you. This is like your jet recognizing the exact frequency of the FC radar and knowing  which type of fire control system is being used which can usually lead to you knowing what type of missile is heading your way. </p>
<p>This is useful because you might know that Sam has a lazy eye and if you duck to the right at the last minute, you can escape him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of my job in the Navy was to get in contact with aircraft flying too close to our ship.  We had 3 warnings we would read them, each getting more and more serious.  The warning would advise them to change course etc...</p>
<p>Well we had an Iranian aircraft that wouldn’t respond, so they sent up some F-18s to intercept them.  The second they lit them up the guys came over the radio in a major panic “American warship, American warship, changing heading to...”  was kinda funny</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on a carrier deck, it wasn’t uncommon to see Iranian or Russian aircraft flying overhead in the gulf. Matter of fact, I lost countless hours of sleep during the alerts because of it. IMO they were absolutely close enough to either drop a bomb or just nose dive into us. Sometimes we would launch the alerts, sometimes we wouldn’t. Risky business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also how they lock and fire missiles at the radar sight for  SEAD Missions</p>

<p>&quot;The weapons most often associated with this mission are anti-radiation missiles (ARMs), which work by homing in on radio emission sources like radar antennae. &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think throughout history there have been many different ways of locking on missiles and as technology advances so do missile locks. Started I believe with heat seeking, then came flares and limited their use. Something that locks onto radar doesn’t work well against stealth jets. You always have to keep up with whatever your enemy is doing or they have the advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, the concept of being locked on is sort of out dated.in the past you could tell because tracking radar and search radar might have been different frequencies or the number of rate at which you detected the pulses from the radar emitter.</p>
<p>In modern phased, electronically scanned radar, the tracking and search radars are the same thing. So detecting lock might not work anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not necessarily true.</p>
<p>AESAs don't sweep at all, as beam steering is virtually instantaneous. A scan is just a series of repeated looks right next to each other. Unless the dwell time changes between a search look and a track update look, there may be no difference. Even then, there are ways to disquise even that, such as chirp codes, BPSK, etc.</p></div>		</li>
