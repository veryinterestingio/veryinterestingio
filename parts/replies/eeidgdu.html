			<div class="markdown"><p>One problem with negative mass is that a gas made of positive and negative mass particles has no ground state. Since kinetic energy: E = mv^2 is always negative for negative mass particles, for any given state one can think of a lower energy state by giving the negative mass particles a <em>higher</em> velocity. When computing the dynamics, the positive and negative mass particles can accelerate to arbitrarily high velocities without violating conservation of energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Easy to build an example: take two particles one has positive mass the other has negative mass. Both with same amplitude. If you compute gravity they should repel. But repel on negative inertial mass will accelerate towards the source. Therefore, the positive mass flee and the negative mass follow. Both accelerating continuously.</p></div>		</li>
