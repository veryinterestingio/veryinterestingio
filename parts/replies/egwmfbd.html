<p>I am always surprised how bacteria can influence us in ways that were previously unexpected.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about non- drinkers vs moderate-drinkers vs alcoholics? Is there a spectrum in the microbiome population that can be correlated to the amount one drinks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the work has been in patients with substantial liver disease, but there is a bit out there on graded/moderate alcohol use. Data from the American Gut Project show that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/adb.12626" target="_blank">moderate drinkers have more diverse gut microbiota</a> - conventionally, increased bacterial diversity is associated with 'benefit' (big oversimplification!), but this study did find that the specific microbes associated alcohol related disease in rats seemed to associate with human disease. There's probably a lot I'm missing, but as I said I'm not an expert in the field by any means and I should probably be working rather than trawling pubmed...!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828436?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank">In this limited study</a>, an acute alcohol binge in healthy individuals increased blood markers of bacteria and bacterial toxins, and increased inflammation - gut bacteria composition wasn't assessed. However, this more recent trial by a different group - using the same alcohol binge - found no effects on gut barrier function, blood bacteria/bacterial toxins or microbiota composition, but immune cell function was altered. This might be because the patients in this study were less obese and were younger than the prior study, both factors associated with better intestinal barrier function.</p>
<p>There's also broader point to be made here too about alcohol research in general being a relatively small and underfunded field in hepatology (despite its huge clinical importance), largely for political reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your third paragraph you say alcohol increases gut permeability and allows gut bacteria to enter the bloodstream... is that for real? I thought blood was typically supposed to be a sterile (at least, from foreign bacteria) environment. Does this lead to sepsis?  </p>
<p>Do blood clinics take this into account when receiving blood from alcoholics? I don’t believe I’ve ever seen anything related to heavy drinking when donating blood. Lots about monkeys and farm animals but not vodka.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes - <a href="https://www.nature.com/subjects/bacterial-translocation" target="_blank">it's a process called translocation</a>. The blood supply from the intestine goes straight to the liver, which is the main reason why the liver is stuffed with specialized immune cells designed to remove bacteria and bacterial products. In healthy patients, small amounts of bacteria/bacterial products will always get through and are dealt with by the liver. In patients who consume too much alcohol, more bacteria/bacterial products get through into the blood - coupled with diminished liver function due to alcohol, this probably induces liver inflammation and raised levels of bacteria/bacterial products in the circulation. The exact contribution to the disease in humans isn't clear though, and most research here on actual disease mechanisms is in animals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403983" target="_blank">It can certainly exacerbate it</a>, although I think you have to be pretty severely ill for bacterial translocation to be able to exert important systemic effects. We evolved with our microbiota, and human (indeed, all animal) physiology is designed to deal with inevitable translocation (and to prevent it in the first place - the intestinal barrier is an <em>incredible</em> piece of engineering in itself). In fact, although the liver is packed with immune cells to deal with bacterial products, the fact that this translocation is a normal occurrence means that the liver has to balance good immune surveillance with not over-responding to bacteria and causing inflammation inappropriately. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-0348-0445-5_4" target="_blank">The immunoenvironment of the liver tolerates a certain level of bacterial presence as a matter of course</a>. In terms of the role of translocated bacteria/their products in disease, the issue (as I understand it) is less the initiation of sepsis and more the exacerbation of inappropriate inflammation and immune dysfunction. For instance, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2012.02.007" target="_blank">mice lacking any gut microbiota</a> have lower levels of liver cancer than their counterparts that have a microbiota - similarly, tweaking the bits of the mouse liver immune system that specifically respond to bacteria has big effects on liver cancer generation, but only in mice that actually have a microbiota.</p>
<p>edit: messed up one of the refs. I'm also definitely no sepsis expert so bear that in mind</p></div>		</li>
