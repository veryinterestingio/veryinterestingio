			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partially correct; while nerves do function based on action potentials, specific, powerful, and correctly angled electromagnetic fields such as those used in transcranial magnetic stimulation do induce a current which can cause a significant change in polarity of brain neurons above resting membrane potential and will initiate an action potential through the nerve's axon. This can result in movement of the targeted body part or even improved mood. MRIs are powerful but fairly generalized and not angled to target a specific neuron or group of neurons.</p>
<p>Edit: wow, my first gold! Thank you kind stranger! I knew all those unpaid research internships I did in my graduate education where my supervisors often tried to map my brain and/or used TMS to produce movement in me for science would pay off someday!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep I used to work for a medical manufacturer - they let me take an old piece of equipment from the 80s that is the size of a desktop computer. Inside it has two huge capacitors which connect to a cable outside with a wand that has coil of wire in it and a button. Press the button and it dumps the energy into the coil. Kinda like a coin shrinker or coil gun, except here you take the wand and put it over parts of your body. For example it can trigger muscle movements. I think they used to (maybe still do) use it on your head too as a treatment or for doing studies.</p>
<p>Edit: it was called a transcranial magnetic stimulator.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the most Victorian thing I have read all month! Like it's some sort of Van de Graaff thing designed to treat hysteria and the vapours. </p>
<p>&quot;Matron, please bring me the smelling salts, a jar of Picric acid, and the transcranial magnetic stimulator.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of the answer to a separate question though.  It’s definitely true... ions moving through a magnetic field will experience a force it’s just that , as you said, it takes an extremely strong field (applied to the right area) to cause enough force to have a physiological effect.  But more than the strength and location it’s specifically how much the magnetic field varies from one location in the brain to the next to induce a current as opposed to the strength, which is much different than exposure to a constant electric field.  It’s kind of like someone asking why chlorine gas is toxic but sodium chloride isn’t and saying that someones answer that chlorine gas is highly reactive while chloride ions that NaCl disassociates into aren’t.  Then saying that that’s not correct because enough sodium chloride is toxic through causing an osmotic imbalance and strain on the kidney/high blood pressure.<br />
It’s right but it’s a very different kind of toxicity than the original person was asking about.  I think that high magnetic gradients a much different concept than just strong magnetic fields.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114642/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114642/</a> .  I think that this sort of thing is awesome but I think it should be clearer that in order to have a noticeable effect cell behavior you need to have a magnet that is more than just targeted but has a change in the strength of the field that fluctuates over an incredibly small distance since cells are basically diamagnetic, so to influence membrane potential and effect ion movement and protein behavior you need to have high magnetic field presence in one part of the cell your trying to effect and lower in another area of that same cell.  If you want to effect the catalytic activity of a single protein that might use an ion in its catalytic zone you need a magnetic field that fluctuates over the space between electrons in a radical pair.  We can do this with our technology but it’s not something anyone is likely to encounter and it’s very different than a uniform magnetic field which even at massive strengths isn’t going to have the kind of physiological effect you mention.  I want to be clear that I’m not saying your follow up is wrong or anything, just trying to clarify the difference between a strong magnetic field and the kind of magnetism that can cause the phenomenon you mention.  <a href="https://www.brainstimjrnl.com/article/S1935-861X(17)30457-6/fulltext#/article/S1935-861X(17)30457-6/fulltext" target="_blank">https://www.brainstimjrnl.com/article/S1935-861X(17)30457-6/fulltext#/article/S1935-861X(17)30457-6/fulltext</a>  .  From what I’ve read it seems that this is also the explanation for how the coils used in transcranial magnetic stimulation cause depolarization of hyper polarization of nerves to influence action potential frequency, except they rely on the quick pulse of going from zero to high magnetic field exposure, but sustained magnetic fields don’t have much effect.  It seems like newer models are being adapted to maximize that gradient to better target and influence polarization.  It’s super cool stuff and I love your response, I just think it needed a little bit more clarification about how it differed from the scenario OP asked about.  I’m a biologist/physiologist/toxicologist not a physicist though so if my understanding is wrong than please let me know!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They need ion channels to open before they can move. The cell membrane and ion channels are essentially unaffected by the magnetic field.</p>
<p>Also the ion concentration is lower than the &quot;electron concentration&quot; in metal wires, and ions are harder to accelerate due to higher mass. So there are many factors making the brain, or neurons in general, much less susceptible to magnetic induction than metal wires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are, but as an electron weighs 9.1×10−31kg, where an Na atom for example weighs 3.82-26kg, roughly 40,000 times more. This means if both particles have the magnitude of charge (ignoring positive/negative charges), the magnetic field would need to be 40,000 times stronger for the heavier particle for the same movement.</p>
<p>The pull of the magnetic field is easily overcome by other forces keeping these particles in place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not competely correct. Nerves are conductive—they can and do fire in response to magnetic field changes (dB/dt as explained by /u/SeattleBattles). Google peripheral nerve stimulation and MRI. A lot has to do with the physical nature of peripheral nerves - they are long cords that can form loops (imagine both arms resting on belly with hands down touching). The brain doesnt have as much “anatomical loopness” as your peripheral nerves so it does not get this effect as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for mentioning peripheral nerve stimulation, I was about to bring it up. The key here is a rapid change in flux dB/dt that can induce a current.</p></div>		</li>
