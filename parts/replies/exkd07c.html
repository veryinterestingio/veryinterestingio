			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d love to see those drawings (PE here). I can see them not using rebar if it was just a foundation. I know we tend to over reinforce things now, even those pure compression components. Once (I work with DOT) we were demolishing an old bridge over a creek and there was a pier in the middle. Thought it would take a lot to knock over and one nudge with a track hoe and it fell in one piece. There were no dowels holding it into the rock! Poured right on top. Guess they thought there would be enough force from the deck to keep it from moving? No rebar in it when we broke it up too. It really makes you wonder around some old structures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d love to see those! I’m a structural engineer as well, and I love seeing how they did things in the old days. That’s nuts that they didn’t use any rebar and the structure has been fine (I assume).</p></div>		</li>
