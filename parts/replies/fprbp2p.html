<p>It‚Äôs still debated. The latest hemming and hawing is that there are times where the pop is cavitation and instances when it is something else. There‚Äôs also many other similar noises like ‚Äúclicking‚Äù when a joint is tracking wrong like how knee caps can snag plicas when sliding on your femur and other similar examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has fucked up knees because of joint/ligament problems... can confirm. Haven't you ever snuggled someone and their joints crackle a lil haha? That would happen when I would cuddle with my mom when I was little. It's more common in the shoulders/arms because the joints are less stable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The capsule of the knee joint needs to be loose in many places to allow the knee to move freely.
Those folds are called plicae. They can interpose with the kneecap when it slides over the knee joint, causing noise like clicking and cracking, as well as discomfort and pain. That‚Äòs called a plica-syndrome (i know because i have it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like everyone who ‚Äúdebates‚Äù this is too focused on the idea that there is one answer for this. With so many hundreds of bones, muscles, tendons, and cartilage nodes, why would anyone assume that every mechanical sound produced by the body must be from a single source? It‚Äôs bubble cavitation! No! It‚Äôs tendon snapping! Hey guys maybe it‚Äôs both and a couple more...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taken from:  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_joints" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_joints</a></p>
<p>For many decades, the physical mechanism that causes the cracking sound as a result of bending, twisting, or compressing joints was uncertain. Suggested causes included:</p>
<p>Formation of bubbles of joint air as the joint is expanded.[5]
Cavitation within the joint‚Äîsmall cavities of partial vacuum form in the synovial fluid and then rapidly collapse, producing a sharp sound.[6][7]
Rapid stretching of ligaments.[8]
Intra-articular (within-joint) adhesions being broken.[8]
There were several theories to explain the cracking of joints. Synovial fluid cavitation has some evidence to support it.[9] When a spinal manipulation is performed, the applied force separates the articular surfaces of a fully encapsulated synovial joint, which in turn creates a reduction in pressure within the joint cavity. In this low-pressure environment, some of the gases that are dissolved in the synovial fluid (which are naturally found in all bodily fluids) leave the solution, making a bubble, or cavity, which rapidly collapses upon itself, resulting in a &quot;clicking&quot; sound.[10] The contents of the resultant gas bubble are thought to be mainly carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen.[11] The effects of this process will remain for a period of time known as the &quot;refractory period,&quot; during which the joint cannot be &quot;re-cracked,&quot; which lasts about twenty minutes, while the gases are slowly reabsorbed into the synovial fluid. There is some evidence that ligament laxity may be associated with an increased tendency to cavitate.[12]</p>
<p>In 2015, research showed that bubbles remained in the fluid after cracking, suggesting that the cracking sound was produced when the bubble within the joint was formed, not when it collapsed.[5] In 2018, a team in France created a mathematical simulation of what happens in a joint just before it cracks. The team concluded that the sound is caused by bubbles' collapse, and bubbles observed in the fluid are the result of a partial collapse. Due to the theoretical basis and lack of physical experimentation, the scientific community is still not fully convinced of this conclusion.[4][13][14]</p>
<p>The snapping of tendons or scar tissue over a prominence (as in snapping hip syndrome) can also generate a loud snapping or popping sound.[8]</p>
<p>I have terrible knees and can‚Äôt squat nor kneel for longer then a few minutes.  When I stand or straighten my legs out there is a cracking sound and alot of pain.  I imagine I am straining and snapping my ligaments as they catch on bony prominences.</p></div>		</li>
