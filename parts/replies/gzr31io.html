			<div class="markdown"><p>Another major reason for this is pixel count has been largely taken as the sole contributing factor of image quality when there are many other factors that can produce superior image quality with the same pixel count.</p>
<p>Typically 4K 60 FPS capable cameras also have higher clarity due to smaller grain and lower noise.</p>
<p>Then when that 4K video which was taken on a higher end camera is then downsampled to 1080 you keep all of the better clarity.</p>
<p>The 1080p camera most of the time will not have the same clarity since for some odd reason sensor quality has taken a backseat to pixel count in the last decade or two for most but the higher end of cameras.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that's often true, we'd no longer compare 4k to 1080p here, but rather camera quality.</p>
<p>What I think OP is after, is why a video with both 4k and 1080p option looks worse while using the 1080p on a 1080p screen over the 4k option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The long and short of it is : Because we use lossy compression.</p>
<p>We could have lossless compression formats but the files would be HUGE and uncompressed files are mind bogglingly larger than even those. </p>
<p>YouTube and most streaming services uses a very, very, very aggressive compression/sampling algorithm , that leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>It's the primary reason why dark scenes looks like absolute garbage on YouTube even if it looks OK elsewhere (see: any horror movie scene on streaming VS the original), but also the primary reason we don't need gigabit internet to watch a 4k video or multiple 1080p onrs without waiting for them to buffer every couple of seconds.</p></div>		</li>
