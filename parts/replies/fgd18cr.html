<p>At this speed your four character PW holds up for ~60 seconds.</p>
<p>IBM demoed a machine that can attempt 350 <em>billion</em> PWs per second.  At that rate they'll have yours literally as fast as you can blink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah a modern gpu sits at about 5.000.000 try per second, and it’s not hard to build a desktop pc with 4 of those. </p>
<p>Using a 8 digit code of lowercase and numbers (36 symbols) would be guessed in less than 1,5 day using 4 beasty gpu’s. This is without beat tricks like libraries and previous leaks. If it just has to compare it goes waaay faster</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most websites have that, but most passwords aren't being lost to brute forcing through the login portal</p>
<p>They're lost when an attacker steals the database and starts reversing passwords out of it which means they have basically unlimited time and computing power available.  They can pretty easily check billions of passwords per second against each row in the database until they find a plausible one.  Then they take that information and the associated email and sell them as a pair that can likely be used to log in to a wide variety of sites as people tend to reuse passwords.</p>
<p>26^4 is just 456,976 passwords which would have 456,976 hashes that they'd need to be paired against.  For reference, the bitcoin network is currently calculating something like 30 million gigahashes per second, or 3x10^16 hashes <em>per second</em> so your 26^4 would be broken in less than 100 fempto seconds of calculations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a great point that people often don't realize.  The danger isn't so much that someone is going to try and brute force a login screen (which does still happen).  The danger is that they've already broken in and have stolen the hashed password database along with associated data.  Now they no longer have to obey any &quot;rules&quot; of how often and what passwords they're allowed to try - in fact they can distribute it to a whole set of Amazon (or other cloud company's) servers and crack even passwords you'd think were &quot;complex&quot; for for under 100 bucks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is also why some services force you to change your passwords every set number of days.  It isn't to be a jerk - it's protection in case someone has managed to steal the password database.  If your password takes 100 days to crack, and you have to change it every 90 days, your account isn't likely to be broken into since by the time the attacker has cracked your password you have already changed it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It would be broken in less than 100 fempto seconds of calculations... by the Bitcoin network?</p>
<p>Is that really a realistic estimate of processing power available to hackers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should definitely do that too. But there are situations where password hashes are stolen and attackers can try to decode them on their own, bypassing such delaying techniques. If the passwords were so terribly short then it would be too easy to figure out what they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if brute force attacking is only done per account, eventually some accounts will be able to be hit within the first 10 attempts - with 26^4 possible passwords, it would only take 32,000 accounts before I have a 50-50 chance of cracking at least one before the brute force limit kicks in.</p></div>		</li>
