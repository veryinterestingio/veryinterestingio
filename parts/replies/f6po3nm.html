<p>To reinforce it a bit more: if there was no friction, when you returned your legs to their original position, the chair would swivel back to its original position too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>I think your reinforcing statement is a touch misleading.  Here's my attempt:</del></p>
<p><del>If you have your legs out in front of you and turn them to one side, you'll spin the opposite direction. If you return your legs to right in front of you, you'll stop spinning.</del></p>
<p><del>It's the motion that's affected by the change in force, not the position.</del></p>
<p>EDIT: I'm a dunce.  Conservation of angular momentum is a thing.  /u/jimbosReturn is right, read his comment.  Leaving mine up for the sake of the conversation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but it can only take so much per unit of time </p>

<p>Good answer overall, but that part is inaccurate.  The issue is actually static vs dynamic friction.  To keep it ELI5, friction is stronger when an object is at rest than when it's moving.  Think about pushing a heavy box across a carpeted floor.  It takes more force to start moving the box than to keep it moving once it gets going.</p>
<p>To bring it back to swivel chairs, the stronger jerking motion overcomes the static friction and gets you moving, while the slow turn back doesn't generate enough of a reaction force to overcome the static friction.</p>
<p>Also, I see several other comments mentioning the ability to change your moment of inertia which is a factor, but the static/dynamic friction dichotomy plays a bigger roll in all but the swivel-est of swivel chairs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a separate idea.</p>
<p>When you swing your legs to one side, you're generating momentum, and since momentum is conserved, something else must gain an equal amount of momentum in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The chair's bearing has a certain coefficient of friction, which means that it can exert a certain amount of force to keep itself from turning. Momentum is mass times velocity, while force is mass times acceleration, and acceleration is velocity over time, so the friction of the chair's bearing absorbs a certain amount of your momentum per unit of time.</p>
<p>The chair only turns when you break that limit by generating more momentum (and thus exerting more force) than the static friction can handle, and that's when dynamic friction comes into play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If friction allows it, static vs dynamic coefficient of friction makes this effect bigger.  I don't see how it's separate at all since they are different parts of the same phenomenon and both play a role how it manifests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also dont forget about <strong>static</strong> friction</p>
<p>if you apply an impulse and then slowly move back you can do it so it only moves forward due to the energy from moving back not being enough to overcome static friction</p></div>		</li>
