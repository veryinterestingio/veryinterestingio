			<div class="markdown"><p>And just to add to this a little... additional evidence for Earth’s core comes from earthquake data.  Seismic data allows us to tell where the boundaries are between different layers inside of Earth and also gives us estimates of the densities within those layers. That together with data about the compositions of iron meteorites, which are believed to be from the cores or last planetesimals, we can be very confident we know what Earth’s core (and those of other terrestrial planets) is made of.  Also, even though Venus doesn’t have any magnetic field to speak of, it likely does have a liquid outer core.  It is just rotating too slowly to produce a magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

I believe they even detected when the ascent stages of the LEMs crashed back into the moon. </p>
<p>It will be a trip if someday a manned mission visits an S4B crash site, though maybe everything was just vaporized? that could be a cool souvenir hunt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If we find a planet with no magnetic field, a safe assumption would be either that the core isn't molten, or doesn't have enough iron to generate a magnetic field.</p>

<p>That's not a safe assumption. </p>
<p>The core of Venus is molten and certainly has enough iron, yet it does not generate a magnetic field. Initially we thought this was because Venus doesn't rotate fast enough to produce a dynamo effect, but the emerging consensus these days is that it doesn't have a sufficient difference in temperature between core and crust to maintain convection, an essential ingredient in a geodynamo.</p>
<p>It's also not a safe assumption that if a planet <em>does</em> have a magnetic field that it must have iron in the core. Both Uranus and Neptune have strong magnetic fields, but generate those fields within a shallow layer of superionic water, an exotic high-pressure slush that can carry an electrical current.</p>
<p>While the presence or lack of a magnetic field is supplementary evidence, it's really not the best source of information about a planet's core. You can find out much more looking at higher-order gravitational moments, which can tell you about the density of layers in the planetary interior. In fact, this exact measurement is the primary science goal of the Juno mission currently in orbit around Jupiter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's really interesting, how did we find out about this?</p>

<p>A few lines of inquiry come together here. First, just from solid-state physics we have an equation of state that predicts a high-pressure phase of water where the oxygens lock in a crystalline matrix, while the hydrogen ions (bare protons, really) move freely, very reminiscent of the degenerate electron gas one finds inside metals. We finally produced it in the lab 3 years ago in laser-shocked diamond anvil experiments (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-017-0017-4" target="_blank">Millot, et al, 2018</a>)</p>
<p>We know Uranus and Neptune have a lot of water (and ammonia) from density arguments alone - kilogram-per-kilogram in a decompressed state, they're substantially denser than their more hydrogen-dominated larger siblings. We also know from simple thermodynamics arguments that their interiors should be <a href="https://i.imgur.com/I2eqfVY.jpg" target="_blank">in a temperature-pressure range that is superionic</a>...though really deep down, the stratification may be too large, meaning no convection to promote dynamo action.</p>
<p>Finally there's the magnetic field itself. When <a href="https://i.imgur.com/j2pOgGs.png" target="_blank">shown in diagrams</a>, Uranus' and Neptune's magnetic fields look off-center and at a crazy angle too their rotation axes...but what's really going on is just a poor dipole approximation for a field with a wickedly strong quadrapole moment.</p>
<p>That strong quadrapole moment points us in the direction that we're talking about a hollow shell doing the generating here. That seems to fit neatly into our thermodynamic knowledge of these planets and our equation of state - it needs to be generated in a layer deep enough to sustain superionic ice, but not so deep where stratification quenches the dynamo (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103506001680" target="_blank">Stanley &amp; Bloxham, 2006</a>).</p>
