<p>I don’t know why, but I just watched the first six minutes of that. I did not use your cable provider or I’d recall that.</p>
<p>I do remember though from being a teenager that you could press down 2 and 13 at the same time on the cable box (which had three rows selectable with a lever and 12 buttons for 36 total channels) that it would mostly decrypt the Playboy Channel. Another combination gave Cinemax. That was an awesome cable box.</p></div>		</li>
