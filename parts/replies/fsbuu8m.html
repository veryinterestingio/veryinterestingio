			<div class="markdown"><p>I was curious of this question as well. But now I’m thinking surely they feed off the drum track so they know the timing don’t they? There has to be a track somewhere that they play off of, am I correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know one local band who did this, and they just listened to a recording of their song, while playing.. They also recorded the prerecorded song track (separate audio track), so it was trivial to synchronise everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they would almost definitely play with a metronome, but the live playback of all the parts together would be impossible to line up just via the livestream for the musicians themselves because they don't have the feedback loop of the other performances to align their own performance with. The other people performing 'out of time' is way more distracting than just listening to a metronome or pre-recorded version and playing along.</p>
<p>Theoretically you could have computers analyzing the connection delays of each of the performers and feed them each a personalized &quot;live&quot; metronome to end up with a synchronized stream for <em>the viewer</em>, but that is a lot of work coding up some special metronome system, and it doesn't actually allow the musicians to truly play together - just make it look like they are.</p>
<p>It is much easier to just capture all the individual performances with them listening to an old recording or metronome, then later have someone master the timings to sound correct to the viewer. I'm guessing for many of these events they are not even trying to line them up in just a few seconds or minutes delay in real time, but they do it beforehand, then play an aligned version back during the 'live concert'.</p></div>		</li>
