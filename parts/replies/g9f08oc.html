			<div class="markdown"><p>So I get it's a hypothetical situation meant to illustrate the point, but it's making me laugh imagining someone dying of thirst, having all the water on hand and deciding to just brew a bunch of coffee with it instead of simply drinking the water to survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah wrong visual. Imagine walking through the desert, and seeing a starbucks. You have a $10 bill and some change so you run up. It could be a mirage cause you been gone for days, Jack! Nobody's looking for ya! So you run to the Starbucks. ITS FUCKING REAL! You buy a small coffee and that's all your money gone. You chug it and start to wonder if it will even quench your thirst. Your throat burns, you kinda gotta poop, and you start to regret it and feel the need to consult reddit in this hypothetical arc of a story</p>
<p>That's the right visual</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be a pretty high dose of caffeine. What would actually happen depends on the person and their caffeine habits, but you'd be looking at things like rapid/irregular heartbeat, abdominal pain, nausea, muscle twitching, anxiety, delirium.</p>
<p>That's on top of the fact that a decent chunk of people's fluid intake comes from food, which you'd be missing out on.</p></div>		</li>

“Dying of thirst” can be used both literally or figuratively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beer would hydrate you as well. It’s low enough alcohol content that it’s not too bad. During one cholera outbreak in London the first epidemiologist noticed that people in an area were getting sick except for the people who worked at the brewery. That because the brewery provided them with enough beer per day so they didn’t drink the water out of the well where the disease was being spread from. So they were actually better off drinking beer than water.</p></div>		</li>
