			<div class="markdown"><p>Tasmania is not really part of Australia. It’s the younger brother that we sometimes have to include or they chuck a tanty.
Proof. Almost every map of Australia leaves Tassie out. See lack of AFL team. Passport required to visit.
Disclaimer: Tasmania is where I hope to retire.</p></div>		</li>

That comment was about as cubed as wombat shit.</p>
<p>I'm from Tassie, on the mainland now and have been for a fair smidge. She's a tad different but no more than any state varies.
Just because it's not attached doesn't make it apart of AU. </p>
<p>Do retire there though, it's lovely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I stand corrected, Tasmania is NOT part of Australia</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sam you Carlton supporter. It was a joke about the passport. A common joke in the rest of Australia. As for having never seen an Australia map without Tasmania, maybe you have never seen a map? </p>
