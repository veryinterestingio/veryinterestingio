<p>If &quot;occurring by random chance&quot; means &quot;occurring by chance alone,&quot; then that seems like a not-incorrect way to state that you've assumed a nil null hypothesis. And since you didn't correct it, I assume you meant &quot;results&quot; as a fudge for &quot;at least as extreme results&quot;. So that becomes &quot;the probability of at least as extreme results occurring under the (nil) null hypothesis&quot; which is a correct definition of p-values.</p>
<p>In other words, a p-value is not the probability that a result at least as extreme as yours <em>did</em> occur by chance alone, P(H|D). But it is the probability that a result at least as extreme yours <em>would</em> occur by chance alone, P(D|H).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has nothing to do with random chance.</p>
<p>For example, if you're comparing two blood pressure medications and your hypothesis is treatment with medication <em>x</em> will have a greater reduction in blood pressure than medication <em>y</em>, then your null hypothesis is medication <em>x</em> will have no effect on blood pressure compared to medication <em>y</em>. If your p-value of blood pressure reduction between the two groups is 0.01, then there is a 1% chance that you would find the same results if medication <em>x</em> had no effect on blood pressure compared to medication <em>y</em>.</p>
<p>You are testing the null hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not actually sure what you mean by random chance, then. I think I was treating it as redundant.</p>
<p>I'd say if there's no difference in actuality between the two medications, then any apparent effects in your sample are due to randomness/chance (sampling error, measurement error, etc). Deviations of the sample statistic from the population parameter are random errors that make the sample statistic a random variable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also, I don't think this is critical to our disagreement, but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is a 1% chance that you would find <del>the same</del> at least as extreme results</p>
