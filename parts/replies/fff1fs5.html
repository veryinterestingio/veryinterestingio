			<div class="markdown"><p>While u/sxbennett is mostly right, I think their answer can be improved.</p>
<p>From my understanding, <strong>some</strong> allotropes are polymorphs (like monoclinic and orthorrombic sulfur) but not all of them, which makes allotrope not just a special case of polymorphism.</p>
<p>Allotropes are different substances composed of only one chemical element. The difference between these substances is how the atoms are arranged and bonded.</p>
<p>Polymorphs refer only to different <strong>crystal structures</strong> with the same chemical formula and can have multiple elements in them, like the calcite and aragonite already mentioned.</p>
<p>While there isn't a clear boundary between polymorphs and allotropes, there are clear examples that are allotropes but not polymorphs (oxygen and ozone), polymorphs that are not allotropes (calcite and aragonite, and most minerals have polymorphs really) and polymorphs that are also allotropes (like the aforementioned sulfur).</p>
<p>In my opinion, diamond and graphite are a fuzzy example. They have radically different properties, are composed from a single element and obviously have different crystal structures. They're obviously allotropes, but their bonds are different which results in literally opposite properties (brittle conductive graphite x resistant insulator diamond). So should they be considered the same substance, which would make them polymorphs? It's debatable (I believe not, but I don't usually use this terminology).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Their suggestion is;</p>
<p>Allotropes means the different forms of the same element in which the chemical bonding between atoms of the same element is different and may have different discrete molecular units, irre- spective of the state.</p>
<p>Polymorphs means the different crystal forms, belonging to the same or different crystal systems, in which the identical units of the same element or the identical units of the same compound, or the identical ionic formulas or identical repeating units are packed differently.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer. In addition to the polymorphic sulfur you mentioned, sulfur has allotropes that aren't polymorphs as well, made up of rings of varying numbers of sulfur atoms (6 to 20). The orthorhombic and metaclinic sulfur are both made of S-8 rings though.</p></div>		</li>
