			<div class="markdown"><p>This was me in Amsterdam... we tried so many brownies beforehand not really feeling anything so I guess I got cocky. We got slices of cakes and two of us smashed our cakes in a park. We had half and after not feeling anything we ate the entire slice. </p>
<p>Proceeded to go to a restaurant and it hit us so badly then. We were trying not to die and I proceeded to throw up in the jug at the table... not my greatest moment but the experience was so awful, I‚Äôve sworn off edibles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. I got a space cake in amsterdam for my father-in-law. I turned around and lit a joint w my mother-in-law and I hear him asking the budtender how many servings in a cake. I turned around a little worried to find out that he ate an entire 4 serving cake. </p>
<p>He had a pretty memorable night and next day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was the hardest I‚Äôve ever greened out too. I thought I was legitimately going to die on the walk back to the hotel. Pretty sure we knocked out for a good 14 hours after that haha</p></div>		</li>
