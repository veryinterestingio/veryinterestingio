			<div class="markdown"><p>maybe for the Olympics, but realistically they're not going to have the replay system for all schools and all track meets, that is ridiculous. lol</p>
<p>There have been thousands and thousands of track meets with javelin, therefore millions of throws, and only a couple officials (who were not paying attention) got hit, we have to go back to some old grainy footage to get a clip right? So less than .01% risk is not worth paying thousands of dollars for a replay system, let alone staffing it for every meet and every throw. Have you ever watched a high school JV javelin thrower? not really much risk to the official there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>all javelins had to have rubber tips on them, for exactly the reason that random teenagers who'd been using them for maybe only a few days couldn't be trusted to have full control over the real thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s pretty much the case in all sports. Human referees/officials often make wrong calls that are obviously wrong if you watch the video, but lots of players/fans donâ€™t want to use technology to judge a human game. So we deal with the risk of people getting injured or calls being wrong because we know humans are imperfect but we choose to ignore that for the sake of tradition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not entirely because of tradition. It turns out it's not easy to ref a game. Sure we can judge the calls after the fact in slow mo from the press box. With the exception of baseball strike zones though it's pretty hard to replace a ref with lights or something. You'd need to train a machine to know every rule and make decisions about how they should be applied. It's debatable the machine could even do it as quickly as refs. On top of that false positives could stop play constantly which isn't desirable.</p>
<p>However it's worth looking into because eventually  the robot refs could make the human ones jobs safer/easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's hard to get the right consistency of paint that doesn't affect the contestant's grip when throwing, doesn't splatter when it's flying through the air, and marks the ground clearly enough that it can be used to make calls?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You canâ€™t alter the jav itself, that would get into aerodynamics and balancing (the whole thing is only 800 grams and is weighted to balance at the middle.). The field itself is pretty wide and the distance they throw is quite massive. Plus not all javelins stick so they need an exact measurement. After enough javelins do stick then the ground gets ugly.</p></div>		</li>
