<p>Bet taker ledger contain who the person bet on and how much. There are odds on things like fights, so that person simply goes down the list and calculates winning and the ods payout. </p>
<p>Person with the ticket goes to bet taker and settles (or vise versa).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS.  Notice how everyone in Hollywood movies drinks their coffee black with no sugar (tea, too, which is even common to a certain extent in BBC productions for the same reason), and pays the food delivery person or taxi driver with a nondescript wad of bills they fish out of their pocket without looking and never collect change?</p>
<p>A lot of things like that are shorthand in screenwriting because most audiences will be paying attention to the dialogue and other action rather than the background activity.  So most scenes you see of bookies collecting bets like that do not show how tedious the recordkeeping was, because that would slow the action down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>QThose things in movies always take me a bit out of them. The worst offender is when people hang up a phone without saying their goodbyes. Although the one where people leave unfinished expensive drinks along with a wad of cash are bad to, as if a normal human wouldn't just finish the drink fast. I wonder if one day we'll switch to a desire for more realism in movies, or if people are really that oblivious that those of us it bothers will never matter.</p></div>		</li>
