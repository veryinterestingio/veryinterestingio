			<div class="markdown"><p>Different guy, but in my case I started working with local NGO in my home country and continued working abroad. Aid worker is not a profession in itself, we are water engineers, lawyers, social workers, IT professionals, security (usually former military and law enforcement) etc. and the &quot;way in&quot; can different depending on what you do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but usually you can get the necessary experience by doing something like Peace Corp or volunteering with an NGO. Look on the websites of NGOs with local chapters for job openings or ways to get involved. You will obviously need to move to work overseas and most international NGOs are based in DC or NYC so going to those cities and breaking into the field could be a start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways in, and a need for a vast variety of skillsets in the sector. From social workers to engineers, and from doctors to GIS experts.</p>
<p>My background is in international politics. My first jobs in the sector was managing logistics for NGOs in refugee camps, and my second and current job is as as project manager for an NGO tasked with removing landmines and other explosive remnants of war. Although we dont call it project manager, because the whole humanitarian sector is crazy with running our own show in terms of job titles and everything HR really.</p>
<p>While studying for my masters, I started volunteering for a charity in Denmark (where I lived and where I am from). I since worked for a local charity, and used this experience to apply for an international position for a small international humanitarian NGO, and then using that experience to get a position with a large NGO. Jobs in the sector are indeed often posted in all the usual places. But where the job is. Say, if I need an IT specialist in Mogadishu, i would advertise the job there. We generally want to keep as many jobs as possible local, rather than ferry in foreign experts, who leave again and who dont contribute much to the local economy or to rebuilding the community. It would also just be unfair to do, plain an simple.</p>
<p>However for some positions it is often difficult to find a suitable candidate locally. Most non-locals work as project managers, as report writers (donor countries want to know that their many is being put to good use) or as hard-to-find specialists. These jobs are usually the only ones advertised internationally. There are few online resources, with <a href="https://Reliefweb.int" target="_blank">Reliefweb.int</a> being by far the biggest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often it is the other way around. A camp close because there are not residents left in it.</p>
<p>But if a decision is made to close a camp while people are still living in it, then people are either 1) moved somewhere else, 2) they move by themselves, or 3) they decide to stay.</p>
<p>In scenario 1) the local authorities will resettle the refugees elsewhere. Either in a camp, or in a non-camp environment (maybe the get an apartment somewhere.
2) The residents find their own new accommodation. Again they may choose to/ be allowed to rent an apartment somewhere. Maybe they go to another camp. Or maybe they return to where they fled from. This last one is quite common.
3) They decide to keep camping out where they are. Whether the authorities want them to or not.</p></div>		</li>
