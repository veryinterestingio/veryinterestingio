			<div class="markdown"><p>To continue your very good explanation, I would like to add that sounds emanating from the same source have a combination  of those sine waves you mentioned, that is characteristic of that source, and that source only.    The sine wave frequency might change (the pitch) but the relationship stays the same.  In Music, that is called Timbre.  And it's what makes one instrument sound different than another even though they playing the same note.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I want sure about explaining timbre or if that would be a bit of overload :p but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ldzj17/ELI5%3A_In_8D_audio%2C_how_is_the_audio_able_to_sound_like_it%27s_behind_or_in_front_of_you_even_though_there_are_only_left_or_right_outputs%3F/gmavvnw/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3" target="_blank">here</a> is an explanation I wrote earlier!  (It starts off explaining other stuff first)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I don't get is speakers. I get that they move back and forward. That would be easy to do and understand if you played a single note.</p>
<p>But how come you can combine guitars, drums, base, song and lots of other instruments into the same single second of a song? Like how can all those sounds get produced at the same time?</p>
<p>I don't get the physics of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Start from your ear and work backwards. Your ear is only hearing a single wobbling wave (ok, you have two ears, but just think of one). That single wobbling of air pressure contains all the &quot;different&quot; sounds you hear. The more sound sources, a car honk, your tv, a door slam, the more complicated (generally) the squiggles of the sound wave. Our ears are just built to spilt up the frequencies/pitches of the sound and our brains are good at identifying the separate sources (car, tv, door).</p>
<p>A speaker is our ears in reverse. The thing that's controlling the speaker is telling it the (single) complicated wave to make and the speaker is putting that wave out as air pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually you are not off in thinking that way.  Speakers that reproduce real life sound reliably are really hard to make, precisely because there are so many frequencies to reproduce.   that's why speakers have different drivers each reproducing a range of frequencies.   On top of that different parts of a driver vibrate at different frequencies.   </p>
<p>We can go further but it is going beyond ELI5</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My undergrad was an integrated masters in maths and physics.  After that, I went and did a PhD in psychoacoustics.  I'm now a research assistant in the department where I did my PhD, looking at conversations (at the moment, online conversations, which means a lot of time explaining Skype to old folk with hearing loss so we can actually do the study!).  Really, the physicist part has nothing to do with my job :p I just still refer to myself at a physicist or mathematician depending on context.  There are plenty of folk in the field of hearing science that have a psychology or neurology background who would know <em>that</em> the ear separates sounds, but not the mechanism or the physics of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s so interesting. I’m a professor of teacher education and we talk so much about phonology. I don’t have a background in it, apart from how it plays out in the classroom in terms of language and reading development.  I’m fascinated by it all, if for no other reason that I love learning how things work. The more I understand, the better I can prepare teachers for their roles. Do you anticipate staying in research?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, I let a bit of jargon slip by.  The peaks and troughs of individual waves.  If you imagine a wave, say a wave in water.  The peak is simply the highest point of the wave, and the trough is the lowest point.  The amplitude is the distance a peak is above the normal water level.</p>
<p>For sound, this is the air pressure.  As a sound wave travels, there are regions of high and low pressure, compared to the normal atmospheric pressure.  The high pressure areas are the peaks, and the low pressure areas are the troughs.  The frequency is how often these peaks or troughs go past some fixed point in a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, so the amplitude of a sound wave is determined by air pressure? If my understanding is correct, amplitude is loudness, right? So that means air pressure determines loudness?</p></div>		</li>
