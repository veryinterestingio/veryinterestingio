			<div class="markdown"><p>I had it on both big toes for YEARS as a teenager. Finally my mom took me to the doctor and they removed both nails, never to regrow again....</p>
<p>They both regrew and I got it again for years. It finally went away probably 10 years ago or so and hasn't come back, thankfully. It was so damn painful, constantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t bother me and I’ve never had an issue with it but I was advised that if I scratched it (drew blood) then I should contact my GP. It does feel quite strange to touch. Feel like I’m doing an AMA haha</p></div>		</li>
