<p>because it can transfer more energy from the charge to the target.</p>

<p>Also because it has some extra interesting properties- <a href="https://youtu.be/lMLp-W5lfwQ?t=256" target="_blank">for one thing it's pyrophoric</a>, and shatters into a large burning cloud on impact.  That cloud is unfortunately quite toxic, and will spread dust everywhere.  DU penetrators are used against tanks, aircraft and missiles/mortars.</p>
<p>DU is also neat in that it's self-sharpening.  Rather than squashing and spreading out like a malleable metal might, it tends to break along shear planes that produce sharp edges in the direction of impact.  That also lets it travel through layers of armor more effectively, since parts can break off without disturbing the trajectory.</p>
<p>Note that DU munitions are not used nearly as much by the US now.  Tungsten has replaced a lot of ammunition, for PR reasons.  Both are probably similarly toxic heavy metals, but tungsten doesn't burn which keeps it from distributing nearly as much.  Both are very rare in nature, so we don't have a great idea of how they compare to each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With heavy metals it depends almost totally on how it gets in your body.  Unless there were a lot of chemicals reacting with the tungsten, or you were breathing in lots of dust, you won't notice much.  Even if the above were true, the other chemicals and effects of inhaling dust (like silicosis) are probably worse for you.</p>
<p>You can drink a pint of mercury and besides an awful stomach ache you'll pretty much be fine.  However methylmercury -the form of mercury in fish and floating around ocean water- is lethal at about 200 mg orally.  Mercury vapors can cross directly into your blood and cause brain damage.  </p>
<p>Solid metallic tungsten is practically inert.  You don't want to suck on it or anything, but even the dust is so heavy it's fairly hard to breathe in- although once you do, it's basically there forever.  It doesn't have any particularly dangerous forms I know of, it's just one of those general minor carcinogen things.  Not good to eat.</p>
<p>The problem with putting it in guns is that the heat and everything can powderize it and react it with all kinds of organic chemicals.  From there it might be a soluble form, or something much less dense, or much more easily absorbable into the body.  At the scale of a war, the contamination of the water and ground isn't something that can be ignored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, DU rounds are known as self sharpening. On impact most metals will deform into a larger diameter shape. Forged DU however splinters off leaving a point, making it more effective at penetration than you'd expect from just mass, velocity and cross sectional density.</p></div>		</li>
