For instance, using chips implanted in the cortex, some paralyzed patients can already control a robotic arm; conversely, in animals, we can stimulate the brain and paint an image on the visual cortex! </p>
<p>Going back to the topic of my book , <strong>learning</strong> will be a crucial component of brain-computer interfaces: the computer will learn to adapt to a given brain, and the brain will learn to adapt to a given interface. Learning will greatly facilitate the interfacing of brains and computers -- we won't necessarily have to understand everything about the neural code, because the learning brain will do half of the work.</p></div>		</li>
