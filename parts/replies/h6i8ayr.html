<p>One additional note is that the ratio is also affected by the condition of the mother during pregnancy. In terms of conception, the ratio is actually much larger: about 1.5 to 1 but males are much more likely to get miscarried. The more plentiful that resources are, the greater the ratio of male births : female births.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently the science is in question, but you do know that something doesn't have to be beneficial to be real, right? Humans aren't even close to being optimised and there are an absolute shit-ton of things that go wrong with us that isn't beneficial in any way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something I studied. As far as I know it's much more proven/accepted/observed in ruminant animals (deer, cows etc) than humans.   </p>
<p>The logic is that the average number of offspring born to a female is higher than the average for a male. And females are more consistent than males in terms of number of offspring. Males have the potential to sire lots of babies if they're very successful, or none if they're not a great specimen, but even a poor female will generally have a few offspring.   </p>
<p>So if you're in a resource-heavy environment, it's worth it to take the gamble and produce a male offspring, he's more likely to be a great specimen and sire lots of grandbabies for you. If resources are poor, better to hedge your bets with a female offspring. Sure she won't have dozens of grandbabies for you, but she'll at least have a few.   </p>
<p>This system does not really apply to species where both parents generally invest in the offspring after birth (you know, like humans).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The male genome is slightly smaller, the only difference being the Y chromosome which is smaller than an X chromosome. Because of this, a male sperm is also slightly lighter than a female sperm. It is theorized that because of this weight difference a male sperm is slightly faster and more likely to be among the first to reach the egg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The egg is covered by a layer of cells called the corona radiata. The hundreds of sperm that finally reach the egg use an enzyme to break that outer layer. At this point, the most powerful sperm of all that have made it this far is the one that makes it through the barrier. Being first won't matter, being the strongest will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In humans, about 50% of conceptions fail (miscarry) before viability. This study suggests that the failed conceptions skew female, thus causing or at least contributing to the male-skewed gender ratio
