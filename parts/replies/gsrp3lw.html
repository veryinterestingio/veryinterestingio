			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely by luck. Yeast was used for such a long time before we knew how to isolate it or knew it was a fungus. The mold in blue cheese is a bread mold in the genus Penicillium which is the same genus as as the mold that we get penicillin from. Someone probably ate something that had that particular mold on it, and discovered the interesting taste it had. They probably tried adding it to a lot of things and cheese was probably what they felt tasted the best with it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The moldy cheese (made with goat milk) is an important part of breakfast in rural places of Southern Turkey. I didn't like the taste but locals seem to like it.</p></div>		</li>
