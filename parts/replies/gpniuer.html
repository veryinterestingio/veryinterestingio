			<div class="markdown"><p>You’ve listed a lot of numbers here, but if I’m reading correctly, you’re defining a mutation as a harmful allele. A mutation is a genetic change relative to a reference. Circulating SNPs are not really mutations per se, since they’re already in circulation; they’re more accurately described as polymorphismes, exactly as their name indicates. Also note that mutations need not occur at the single nucleotide level; in fact, many common mutations (e.g. slipped-strand mispairing, transposon insertions, various phase variation mutations) span larger regions.</p>
<p>Edit: I should clarify that phase variation isn’t a thing in humans (to my knowledge), but mutations spanning multiple bases (insertions, deletions, inversions, duplications) certainly are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right! I mean, we agree on most of it. I don't really like the term mutation either. OP's question and term. I will defend though that most SNPs are loss of function, rather than gain of function. Most of the time, you mess with 4.6 BB years of earth evolution, you screw it up. We arent becoming X-people most of the time, on acquisition of a change we have catalytically a slightly less efficient variant of an enzyme. So we should rather talk about SNPs, deletions, inserts that run on forever until the coding region is never reached (Fragile X), stops, ribosomal skips, exon deletions (Cystic Fibrosis), and silent polymorphisms. As you say. It's super fraught with loads of data and probs to make digestible in summary form. This is my attempt to do so. I am so tired. We're all variants, and the defined HG38, based in part off Craig Venter, isnt heping terribly. These SNPs are defined by the first one in the gate, at NIH ClinVar. I look forward to when we have enough genomes, to know what matters, what doesnt, and what, if anything is normal or just a circulating variant. Best regards</p></div>		</li>
