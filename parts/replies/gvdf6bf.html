			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, a mutation like “E484Q” just means that the amino acid in a protein (in this case, RBD) at that position in the chain (484) has mutated from E (the single letter code for glutamic acid, an amino acid) to Q (the single letter code for glutamine, another amino acid).</p>
<p>While “better” mutations may be selected for over time, mutations are fundamentally random. Your cells have mutations all the time and they don’t affect you (silent mutations), although rarely they do (like cancer causing mutations in p53). Mutations aren’t inherently good or bad, they’re just something that happens. Just as you don’t turn into wolverine if your cells mutate, a SARS-CoV-2 mutation doesn’t necessarily make it more deadly or affect it at all.</p>
<p>If E484Q (or some other mutation) happens in an active site, or somewhere else the antibodies bind to, then it’s an issue. But lots of mutations are completely benign. If you’re really curious, you can get protein models from Protein Data Bank and model mutations yourself with software like PyMol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The A, C, G and T (or U if it's RNA) aren't the amino acids, they're the bases that code for them.</p>
<p>&quot;Triplets&quot; of 3 bases code for amino acids- so E can be coded for by GAA or GAG, while Q could be CAA or CAG. The ribosome &quot;reads&quot; the mRNA and translates it into protein.</p>
<p>As there are 64 possible triplets, and only 20 amino acids used in proteins plus a &quot;stop&quot; marker for the end of the protein, the triplet code has redundancy- often several different triplets code for the same amino acid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it not be likely that the antibodies you get from vaccines are still similar enough that people still get some form of protection? Meaning the vaccination would not prevent them getting sick, but it would still prevent them from ending up in the hospital?</p>
<p>I mean, obviously the extent to which any of this may or may not be the case needs to be researched, but it's not like existing vaccines are suddenly going to be completely useless, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question:</p>
<p>Would these new mutations potentially kill people who've previously had COVID in a mild way?</p>
<p>Like a new strain that avoids the current antibodies - AND attacks the body in a way that's different enough to cause issues in people that previously didn't?</p>
<p>Am I getting my point across? I'll try again.</p>
<p>I'm thinking most mutations wont change how a person reacts to COVID - so a new wave of a mutated version wouldn't kill an &quot;old set&quot; of previously infected people?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After an infection yes. </p>
<p>But then there may be another resistance to those antibodies, then another infection would be needed etc. </p>
<p>This is why one can get things like the common cold and the flu many several times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm hoping that if we do come across variants that can break through immunity and cause infection, maybe those infections will be mild, essentially just becoming another common cold we get to deal with every 2 or 3 years.</p></div>		</li>
