			<div class="markdown"><p>Oatmeal got it perfect.  IR thermometer guns have a tiny little &quot;solar panel&quot; that responds pretty much only to IR, and the lens or cover pretty much admits only IR.</p>
<p>Measure the voltage, convert voltage reading to temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, no.</p>
<p>The most common wavelength used for TV remote controls is 940nm - and quite a narrow band (generally +/- 5 nm - with no light outside that range)</p>
<p>In contrast, something at body temperature is emitting most of its light at a wavelength of about 10,000nm with quite a lot of spread around that (e.g. the level of light at 9,500nm is probably still 80+% of the peak)</p>
<p>Because of the way the receiver works - it's quite hard to have something sensitive to both light at ~10,000nm and also to light at ~1000nm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong type of infrared.  Remote controls emit light just slightly beyond the range of human vision; objects at body temperature emit light with a wavelength about 10 times greater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, solar photovoltaic panels that generate electricity are made of silicon wafer semiconductor material.  Historically they used the &quot;seconds&quot; that weren't good enough to make chips for computers, but that has been changing.  </p>
<p>Light emitting diodes are semiconductors.  Shove electrons in and photons magically pop out the other end.   Conceptually, photovoltaic panels are the same device but run in reverse.  Shove photons in one end, and electrons magically pop out the other.  Very similar layered construction, similar doping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's some info from Fluke's <a href="https://www.flukeprocessinstruments.com/en-us/service-and-support/knowledge-center/infrared-technology/what-is-emissivity#:~:text=Emissivity%20is%20the%20measure%20of,emissivity%20values%20close%20to%200.95" target="_blank">website</a>. I bet there is some calibration factor that is accounted for when you change a setting on the higher end probes.</p>
<p>There's some good discussion elsewhere on this thread talking about &quot;gotcha&quot; situations where emissivity needs to be considered (shiny objects and such).</p></div>		</li>
