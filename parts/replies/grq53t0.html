			<div class="markdown"><p>That is actually a common myth. Really bad burn does damage nerves so that you don't feel pain, but it's only in very narrow area. Everything around that will be burned to less extent and hurt like hell.
An easy workaround is to burn yourself whole. /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've burned myself bad, and felt no pain or discomfort. I thought it was because I immediately neutralized the burn with vinegar . </p>
<p>I heated up my dab quartz red hot, set the rig down and waited 30 seconds for it cool down enough for me to take the dab. The dab tool was behind the rig and instead of moving the rig, I reached over it to grab the tool. I heard a popping noise and felt warmth, not a burning sensation just a warmth across my wrist. I immediately pulled my arm back and saw a white crescent shaped crater on my wrist. It looked like when you cut a hole in a book, where you could see the layers of skin all uneven on the sides of the burn. I just ran to the kitchen and poured white vinegar on it. For 10 or 15 minutes I just sat over the kitchen sink pouring vinegar on my wrist every couple minutes. </p>
<p>After that, nothing, no pain, no burning, nothing. It took a couple month to fully heal, but it just went from a white crescent shape to a maroon crescent. It resembled a hicky a little bit. It stayed that way for a few months. Now unless I point it out to you or you're staring at my arm, you can barely see the scar. </p>
<p>Whenever I burn myself, I hear the scene from fight club where Tyler says, &quot;You can run it under water and make it worse, or you can use vineger and neutralize the burn.&quot; Someone told me he was talking about chemical burns, not a heat burn, but every time I use vinegar on a heat burn, I don't have any pain or discomfort after. Just a week or two later, I notice the skin is pealing where the burn was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's literally for that specific chemical they were using. They were fucking with lye which is a base, by using vinegar on it you neutralize the base where you can then wash it off just fine.</p>
<p>If you spill an acid on yourself then think you'll save it by throwing vinegar on it you'll just be making it worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a hole in my glove in a high school welding class. I knew it was there, but laid down a very nice stick weld and got excited. Grabbed the piece, and immediately dropped it cause I knew I fucked up. Burnt flesh coated my nose as I threw my mask up. The callous on my thumb was just a hard yellowish white spot. Took like 2 months to heal, and I still have reduced feeling there from 16 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nope, not TIL, as other comments have said, a burn like that will be surrounded by inflamed and burned areas that hurt like hell, and you STILL need to go to the hospital. please never apply this advice irl and please go the hospital when you get burned badly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that a full-thickness (often called 3rd degree) burn is painless, but almost always it is surrounded by an region that is not quite burned enough to destroy the nerves, and THAT part is still very painful.</p></div>		</li>
