<p>I’m very lazy and a big procrastinator. Currently I’ve found myself losing things that are actively fun to do even as motivation for when I finish boring stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite comment about procrastination is that it's its own reward. The instant you've decided you're okay to not do something right now and can put it off the sense of relief is instant.  Any feeling of satisfaction that comes from actually doing a task is usually going to come at the end when you've finished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really good! It also is very obvious if you think about it, but all this time I've thought that whatever the activity I chose to do the procrastinating was the reward. </p>
<p>Now it makes sense why I keep doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer, as far as I understand the science. If it’s easier to put off IN THE MOMENT then it’s what you’re most likely to do. Our brains are very bad at planning for the long term (which is why a strong social net, for example, is a good thing).</p></div>		</li>
