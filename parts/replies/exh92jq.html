			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually did become a musician. I signed a contract with a record label because they heard a couple of songs that I wrote. I spent about two years writing, recording, making videos and performing. I can honestly say that within six months of signing my writing slowed down. And within a year it simply turned into job. The passion had gone. It wasn't about passion anymore and I hated most of the things that I wrote. All I ever heard was we need more songs, again and again and again. When I left I didn't pick up the guitar for 2 years. I finally started playing it again this year and have finally started writing songs that I am proud of again.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is the main reason why I didn't become a professional musician and just play as a hobby.  I enjoy playing music, and knew that if I had made it my career that I would lose that enjoyment.</p>
<p>The advise to work at something you enjoy and that way you'll never work a day in your life is completely wrong.  If you work at something you enjoy, you'll soon learn to not enjoy it any longer.  Such is life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same reason I don't try to become a professional chef. I <em>love</em> cooking, and will happily spend a full day or more on making a single dish. I've been a line cook before, and having an idea of some of the stress a real professional chef deals with has convinced me that I would come to hate cooking if I did it professionally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being a professional musician myself I can confidently say I disagree. </p>
<p>Yes there is a bit of added stress because there are times that I'm &quot;forced&quot; to be creative, and I also have to deal with the dark side of the music industry. </p>
<p>But there has never been a moment in my life where my love for music has been diminished because it became my job.</p>
<p>I believe this issue of demotivation is something that can be circumvented by training your mind to realize that OPs original question is more &quot;mind over matter&quot; rather than a tangible deterrent that &quot;cannot&quot; be avoided. </p>
<p>In short, this issue only exists if you allow negativity to take the driver's seat. In reality, it's all in your head.</p></div>		</li>

<p>this is why its often better to pay friends for help with beer and pizza or even a favour owed, than money. money makes them feel like it was a job, and then they start to value their time like a job, sometimes 20$ for a days work looks worse than 10$ and 10$ pizza even if they can choose where and how to spend that money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They really pushed this method in our foster parent training as a form of discipline. Giving the child a choice - even if it ends in the same outcome - gives them that sense of control that they need.  For example if they don't wanna wear a coat whenever you're going out ask &quot;do you want to wear your coat, or carry it with you?&quot; Either way they're bringing a coat, but it gives them a choice to make. Another thing they said was only offer 2 choices, people don't handle too many choices well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve used this method with teaching middle schoolers. It can be very effective. Sometimes you don’t even have to offer a really shitty option to get them to do what you want, you can just portray preferred choice in a positive light and the other in a negative light. And to top it all off they really appreciate the illusion of choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Give little kids yes or no choices whenever it doesn't matter which they choose, this helps them to feel autonomous. </p>
<p>When you do actually need them to do something, present them with a yes or yes choice: 'It's time to tidy your toys. Shall we put them into this box, or into that box?' (Don't make it a trick where one choice is obviously worse, because this is about developing their confidence in their ability to make good decisions and if they feel you're trying to control them they'll pick the stupid choice, just to assert their independence.) Whichever one they pick, praise them for making a good decision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only in concept.</p>
<p>In reality, everybody had a wage. The difference was that you got paid the same as your slacking colleagues on the same job description.</p>
<p>Only way to get better was to have influence in the Party. If you didn't, there wasn't much motivation to do anything but watch the time go by.</p>
<p>Edit: (for people defending communism) As someone born in a communist country (which put scientific socialism in the school curriculum), I get it.</p>
<p>Capitalism, especially unregulated capitalism, creates egregious inequality. I am all for decent working wages and living standards, but I think the about 30 communist states which failed did so because humans are competitive in nature. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93tR96egox4." target="_blank">I think Danilov summed it up perfectly</a></p>
<p>If you want a good picture of what the Party looked like, watch the Chernobyl series.</p></div>		</li>
