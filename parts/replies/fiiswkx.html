			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, if the tank is sealed at the top and develops a vacuum up there, then the pressure on the bottom is reduced by up to 15psia, right?  I think that subtracts up to 34 feet (or so) from the &quot;height of concern&quot;, depending on how good of a vacuum is at the top of the tank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With high enough head pressure it would, but as the tank drains and the 15 psi vacuum becomes more significant, air bubbles would get into the hole and the liquid would &quot;gulp&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct.  It only works up to 34 feet, one atmosphere pressure.  Any taller than that and, the pressure at the bottom will exceed one atmosphere and water will pour out even if the top is sealed.  If the height is great, the pressure at the bottom will also be great.  There is no limit to the force gravity exerts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really? Gravity has unlimited force? I thought a black hole being a singularity was the limit.</p></div>		</li>
