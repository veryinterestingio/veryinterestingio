			<div class="markdown"><p>I do remember that, and it was really good.   </p>
<p>Although I'd certainly not use it these days given all the intrusiveness Google is upto.   </p>
<p>In fact, I'm doing all I can to move away from the likes of Google.  The only thing remaining is my gmail (Legacy) and Youtube (No competition)  </p>
<p>I'm in the process of moving away from gmail to my own email account and simply using gmail as spam.   </p>
<p>Yeah, Google used to be a great company, now it's employing all the tricks the old establishment used to. </p>
<p>Except this time it knows all your personal details.  Basically tons of shit it could blackmail you with. </p>

<p>Nah, not for me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Settings &gt; search &gt; searching windows &gt; enhanced</p>
<p>Then you can if you want to remove or add to list of folders that are excluded for search.</p>
<p>After doing this I went from a few thousand indexed items to over 100 thousand indexed items.</p>
<p>Also it soemtiems resets after a big update, but windows is wonky that way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only downside to Everything is that it performs searches based on filename/path. It doesn't have any context to your searches, so there's no prioritization logic to determine search relevance and no way for it to search based on keywords that aren't contained within the filename/path.</p>
<p>Still an incredibly useful tool and one that I use as well, but it's important to know about its limitations before relying too heavily on it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are there even any windows tools that have contextual search on files?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, everything can at least also search file content. And you can index more stuff than just file path. So it's relatively capable, and although the search for file content is slow, it's still way better than the windows stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely.  Another thing to remember is that Google doesn't return an instant result of ALL the instances of that search keyword on the Internet, it only returns the top 10 that are currently optimized to the top of the index.</p>
<p>So that is similar to if you search in, say, macOS and Spotlight has indexed the most commonly accessed files.  You search using Spotlight, and the top 10 results show up while it continues to search for other results in the background.</p>
<p>On Windows, it still seems to return a random selection of results that slowly continue to populate and change order as the background searching continues.  I have no idea how they managed to combine file searching and index searching so badly, but it probably has something to do with keeping the APIs backward compatible that are used to do modern searches, so that old software from the Windows 95 days that uses the APIs will still function.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Windows Search can’t find items that are in its own $PATH.</p></div>		</li>
