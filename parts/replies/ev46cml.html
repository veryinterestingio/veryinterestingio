			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a window that was broken and liked to slide half way down.  It was such that if I drove approximately 60 mph a weird resonance occurred where a deafening hum filled my car.  Thankfully the speed limit on my commute was only 55.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pressure release valves (PRV) I used to insert the rubber piece into the vent at my job. The prvs also allow closing car doors to be a lot less strenuous, closing a car door I was told at the factory build up a lot of pressure and the prvs are there to alleviate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We learned this like the opposite way. Thanks to Bernoulli, fast moving air next to the open window has low pressure and it sucks out air from the can. At a certain point the low pressure(thanks to the sucked out air) is stronger than the airflow and it sucks air in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Upvote for shouting out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle" target="_blank">Bernoulli</a>.  It's the same principle that creates sound when air is blown across a flute, or an organ pipe.  It can be disconcerting to sit inside a car that is impersonating an organ pipe.</p></div>		</li>
