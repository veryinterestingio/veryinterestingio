			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically someone with gigantism has A pituitary gland that never stopped being on, way beyond when it should have. Someone who is small, their pituitary gland stopped roughly at the right age, it just didn't give them a lot of height. Turning the pituitary gland &quot;on&quot; once it's finished doing it's growth development job is like saying &quot;let's turn on our gums to grow more teeth&quot;. If you give growth hormone treatment to a developing child who is still growing (albeit at a slower pace than average) you can help that growth along. But once the body is done growing, it's done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! 5'6 adult here with acromegaly (giganticism) from a pituitary adenoma discovered 5 years ago. Not to say that your description of giganticism as being the result of a &quot;pituitary that never stopped being on&quot; is wrong, that's definitely the case for individuals that look like Andre the Giant.... But, it's not the only explanation. &quot;Once the body is done growing, it's done&quot; is not true. As in my case, I had a benign tumor growing on my piruaity glad that made the pituitary act erratically. This behaviour can manifest in different ways. For some, it causes hyper/hypothyroidism. For others, it can increase IGF-1 production and cause a person of any age to start growing again.</p>
<p>It took many years to accidentally stumble upon my tumor in an MRI. Once doctor's determined my iGF-1 hormone were shockingly high, they scheduled surgery to remove the tumor. </p>
<p>The doctor said it had to be removed because elevated growth hormone causes you to begin growing as an adult. For me, it explained why all of my hats got slightly too small and needed to be adjusted over the past several years. It confirmed that my teeth were, in fact, slightly spreading over time... Why my hands had seemingly felt different/bigger as I have been getting older. (I play guitar and started feeling arthritic-type pain in my knuckles and wrist from my grip changing)</p>
<p>TL;DR
Giganticism can come on at any age. The earlier IGF-1 becomes elevated in the body, the more giant-like features the patient will exhibit. Someone like Andre The Giant had giganticism start in utero or in the prepubescent years  causing them to grow abnormally large. Then there's patients such as myself that weren't affected by excess growth hormone until after puberty who are totally average size and shape.</p>
<p>Bottom line: give a body excess IGF-1 and it's going to start growing... The pace at which is grows is heavily determined.by the age of the patient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am worried that your post may invoke some misconceptions in potential readers so I just wanted to clarify a few concepts. </p>
<p>The growth plates of your bones are responsible for increase in height (or &quot;longitudinal growth&quot;). Growth plates close during puberty due to the action of sex hormones. Without open growth plates, bones cannot be made any longer so height cannot increase any further. </p>
<p>Gigantism (not giganticism) is when elevated growth hormone occurs in skeletally immature children. Because their growth plates are still open, the elevated GH (both directly and indirectly through the action of IGF-1) causes accelerated longitudinal bone growth.</p>
<p>Acromegaly is when elevated GH occurs in skeletally mature individuals. Bone formation is stimulated but, because the growth plates are no longer open, the bone is not added as &quot;length&quot;. Instead, in acromegaly, bones growth denser or &quot;thicker&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my kids is on growth hormone therapy. Over 2 years he grew less than a quarter of an inch. X-rays had shown his growth plates were 2.5 years behind. Making him the size of a 6.5 year old at 9. After an MRI showed no pituitary issues, a blood test revealed is simply isn't making enough hormone. He takes nightly injections of the drug Nutropin now and has for the the last year and has grown over 3 inches. I found out that without our insurance and copay assistance, we should be paying $2300 every three weeks for his medication shipment. WITH insurance, $150. And then the copay assistance through Nutropin makes it so we only pay $10 a shipment.</p>
<p>Without meds, his projected height was 5'4&quot; if he was lucky. Now we're looking to about 5'8&quot;ish. I've gotten flack from people saying &quot;oh so what is he's short!&quot;. They don't realize that height is just the side effect we see. But the improvements to his immune system, muscles (hello heart!) and self esteem because kids suck and bully him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend like this but by 26 years old his heart was close to failure. If you force a genetically 5 ft person to be 6ft the heart doesn't compensate so well. Also a problem for anyone over the golden height ratio. I.e. NBA and NFL players dying of heart attacks at 50.</p></div>		</li>
