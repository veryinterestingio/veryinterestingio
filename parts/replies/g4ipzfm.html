<p>Based off the materials I can guess what the experiment was about, but I never did this in high school</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are free and have a spare human that is alive, you can hammer a copper nail into the stomach (below the ribs) and another nickel one into the same stomach. Since one metal is more reactive than the other, it wants the electrons of the other metal. This causes one side to lose electrons and corrode, while the electrons flow to the other metal (thanks to the acidic stomach juices) and up the wire.</p>
<p>It's even stronger than the buzz in the mouth. If you complete the circuit and then put your ears near the ribcages, you can hear a faint sound, akin to a live human screaming after being impaled. I assume it's because the 2 metals that are impaled in the stomach make contact with different layers of the skin that have sweaty conductive sweat, and this may form another parallel circuit in the intercoastal rib muscles but are not strong enough to cause enough contraction to raise the ribs up, so that repeated cycle of up-down causing a percussionary effect resulting in that sound that has now evolved into some sort of humming sound that I can only describe as someone choking to death</p>
<p>Funny how the body works huh</p></div>		</li>
