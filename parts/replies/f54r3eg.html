			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh, this is an ill-posed question. The LHC is a research instrument, so metrics like efficiency are not really defined. Furthermore, the Higgs boson is unstable and will decay very shortly after being created (potentially into two massless photons).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well by efficiency I mean energy put into the reaction / energy value of the mass defect.
Is this not measurable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically everything. Collider experiments are not made to efficiently create certain particles (which anyway decay back into mostly energy very quickly), but rather to enable their creation at all.</p>
<p>In the reaction itself, looking at only the energy of the two colliding protons (or electrons etc.), the amount of energy used for the temporary creation of heavy particles can in principle got up to 100%, but will in most cases be at the few %-level, depending very much on the physics process taking place.</p>
<p>But to enable these reactions and conditions at all, one needs many colliding protons and enormous machinery to bring them to and keep them at high energy. For example, one needs many kilometers of electromagnets to keep the protons on their circular course, which need power for their electric current and cooling. In the end there are many orders of magnitude difference between the several 10s of MW input electrical power of a particle collider (so-call wall-plug-power) and the mass created in the final physics reactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a side question, how can smashing together two Fermions produce one Boson? Where did the Quarks go? Shouldn't their number stay the same? I would have expected you'd smash one Proton and one Antiproton together, or something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is impossible to turn a pair of fermions into a single photon, the energy and momentum conservation laws forbid it. At the very least you can turn two fermions (or massive bosons) into a pair of photons with opposite momentums. This can only happen when a particle collides with its antiparticle. In general, there is a number of conservation laws which must be strictly preserved (energy, mometum, spin, charge etc), but anything which satisfies those laws is possible, even if very unlikely. Any interesting collision would result in at least 3 particles, at high energies usually many more are spawned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was really not an answer to my question. I specifically asked about 1 Fermion + 1 Fermion = 1 (Higgs) Boson. Because that was what OP posted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. The Higgs boson was never seen before (with sufficient certainty anyway) when it showed up in LHC data. It's also possible that particles show up that we don't expect, although that hasn't happened for some time as all recent new discoveries were predicted by theory before they were found in an experiment (theoretical particle physics is ahead of their experimental counterpart in that way).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's basically one of the purposes of these particle accelerators. &quot;The math suggests that if we smash particles together they should create particle X which should do Y, let's give it a go and see if we detect Y happening.&quot; Of course, lots of other stuff also happens that you have to filter out, which is one of the reasons this sort of project takes a lot of work.</p></div>		</li>
