			<div class="markdown"><p>You know I fucked up my breathing somehow during deadlifts and had a whats it called... hernia? In my anus. Like some clotted up vein (which swole up like a bump) that had to be removed because it was ultra painful.</p>
<p>Eversince that I make an effort TO NOT hold in my breath while straining myself. </p>
<p>So I guess my question is: How do you properly breathe during deadlifts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are talking about could be either hemorroids or a rectal prolapse both of witch can happen while lifting since you increase your abdominal pressure by contracting your abdominal muscles for prolonged periods of time in order to lift more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nono it was neither. I went to a doctor thinking it was hemerroid but he confirmed it wasn't.</p>
<p>It was some something with a vein clogging up and he had to remove it :/ It wasn't pleasant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The valsalva technique has gradations based on the number of reps and percent of max exertion based on the weight you are lifting.</p>
<p>A full valsalva (fill cavity with air and hold) is quite taxing and straining and should only really be used for max effort lifts.</p>
<p>As an amateur Olympic lifter, you are better off doing a partial valsalva. Close your throat part way and expel air against the closed throat as you deadlift. A little air will escape and sound like a grunt or a &quot;hup&quot; sound.</p>
<p>The air should be moving towards your throat not further down into your body. Opening your throat a little will force the air in the right direction. Additionally it will let you expel CO2 which is important if you are doing more than 3 reps (so you don't pass out.)</p>
<p>Btw, of you are doing high reps (say normal pushups or low resistance) you should try to exhale fully during concentric. Or if you are really high reps just breathe normally not timed at all to concentric.</p></div>		</li>
