			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Popular videos are cached on multiple servers across the world so that more people can stream them easily. And since ads need to play on every device, the ad video relevant to you would definitely be stored on the server close to you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the important distinction. Caching probably has a lot to do with it. I havnt seen any documentation about having better servers for ads (not ruling it out), but caching due to the small amount of of ad videos vs YT videos would probably have this effect...
Tldr, your neighbour probably watched that ad, but ylnot the same video</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;better servers&quot; are the localized caching servers, usually called CDNs (Content Delivery Networks). Basically server farms that serve smaller regions, so that they don't have to move the data across the data as far (less hops, and less geographical distance). Ads are played for lots of people, so it makes sense to distribute them to CDNs. That random cat video from 6 years ago isn't getting nearly as many views as that ad, so it doesn't get pushed out to the CDN. </p>

<p>However, I'm also guessing YouTube prioritizes bandwidth on their end for ad content. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Better&quot; may be a bad choice of wording, but &quot;optimized for immediate viewing&quot; would definitely still apply.  YouTube has a LOT of videos on it, and Google prides itself in letting you access as many of them as legally possible, but an enormous chunk of those videos aren't going to be regularly viewed, and aren't going to be available close to you/connected on top-tier connections.  </p>
<p>This gets into bandwidth yes, as well as travel distance, but also the types of servers the videos are stored on.  A video that is rarely viewed will be shunted off to a server setup that is more ideal for long-term, low frequency access compared to one that is designed for high-throughput streaming.  </p>
<p>It's a lot more efficient to have 10Tb HDDs stacked up storing rarely viewed videos, compared to running absolutely everything off current-gen SSD and high-bandwidth routers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also can't predict which videos will be popular or viral, but you definitely know which/where ads are sold. There's also far less ads than content, making it easier to push and keep in CDNs. We always push ad assets into the CDN as soon as the ad is flighted, content is only pushed into the CDN when it reaches a certain popularity threshold. </p>
<p>Ads shouldn't be transcoded any differently than video. Both are preemptively transcoded for every device in multiple qualities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, consider what happens when an ad fails to load. You can just load the next best one, charge the other advertiser, and move on. You'd probably complain if YT silently switched you to another video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't, but when you skip an ad, my understanding is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ad you skipped gets more expensive for the advertiser to run since it's undesirable to the user (but would also pay the content creator more when run)</li>
<li>You get subjected to more ads since you need to make up for skipping an ad, eventually transitioning to unskippable ads. </li>
<li>The content gets some score boost for being more desirable to watch than the ad. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also basic logistics. If someone in Russia uploads a new video to YouTube, it will be harder to stream it to rural Iowa 6000 miles away. Meanwhile the local advertisement from an Iowa company being aired to people in Iowa, well that's easy to stream since it's hosted nearby. </p>
<p>Not everything has to be cynical and only about profits. Some stuff is just logistics. Even if magically somehow the ads were free and Google didn't profit from anything, the ads would <strong>still</strong> load faster than the video because of basic logistics and common sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Money is still correct. It’s cheaper to locate data where it’s most likely to be used, so even if the ads were free that russian video is still not going to be hosted in the US.</p></div>		</li>
