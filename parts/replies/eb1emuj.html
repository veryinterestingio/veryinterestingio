			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good answer.  I'd like to add one other thing about inversions, specifically about them preceding/predicting recessions -- it is true that recessions often have followed yield-curve inversions, but the bond market has &quot;predicted&quot; about 8 of the last 3 recessions this way.</p>
<p>I can't find a good chart right now, but this page from the <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/yield-curve-and-gdp-growth.aspx" target="_blank">Cleveland FED</a> has an OK graph -- the second graph, titled &quot;Probability of Recession Calculated from the Yield Curve&quot; -- you'll notice that most recessions have a big spike, but tons of other spikes happened that weren't harbingers of recession.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Assuming you meant to say that, itâ€™s a brilliant way to explain false positives. </p>
<p>Were there any false negatives?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always liked that particular phrasing, yeah.</p>
<p>So, according to the graph that I posted (and the text of the Cleveland FED's article), at least since 1970, an inversion has occurred at some point in the year before each recession.</p>
<p>The thing about &quot;predicting&quot; a recession is that everybody knows that a recession is coming.  There will <em>always</em> be another one in the future.  There have been 8 in the last 50 years.  So, if there's an inversion now, and that's a &quot;prediction&quot; of a recession... does that mean 2019?  2020?  2021?  Because, honestly, if you let anything in the next 3-4 years count as a successful prediction -- well, there's a recession &quot;in the next 4 years&quot; in the majority of years...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't think you are using the term coupon correctly. T bills are zero coupon bonds I believe. That means that they are sold at a discount based on the return and mature to full value.</p>
<p>A coupon bond pays at certain time intervals to achieve a desired return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Treasury bills are for terms of 1 year or less. Treasury notes are what people are concerned about for the inverted yield curve and they do pay a coupon every six months while also having variable pricing</p></div>		</li>
