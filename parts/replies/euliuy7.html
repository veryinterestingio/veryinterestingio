<p>The word is Ineffective. And no they worked just fine. That motherfucker was devastating 300km away from its detonation. </p>
<p>Planners simply saw the greater utility to be gained in ICBM's having multiple warheads that hit multiple targets rather than one massive warhead that could be intercepted or turn out to be a dud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were ineffective in terms of yield and cost in fissile materials compared to destructive potential. For the same cost as a tsar bomb you could make a dozen smaller nukes that were more easily deployed and destroy more infrastructure, even if they were all targeted at the same general area. The massive explosion from a high yield bomb is relatively ineffective compared to its raw power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue wasn’t so much that the single warhead could be a dud or intercepted; rather, it’s that it “wastes” way too much explosive force “over-killing” areas close to the bomb’s detonation point. You can kill way more people spreading out 10 x 200 kt bombs over a given area than by using a single 2 mt bomb centered in the middle of said area. It’s all about maximizing the 5 psi over pressure or whatever psi you’re trying to target.</p>
<p>Btw, if anyone is knowledgeable about how the gamma and x rays from the primary are used to compress the secondary in a modern thermonuclear weapon, I’d love to learn more. I understand the pressures and how they increase to the 4th power relative to temperature, but not so much the relative roles of plasma/FOGBANK and the ablation of the tamper. I’m also curious about the interstage and how it focuses the x and gamma rays. I’d really like to learn more. </p>
<p>Nukes are complicated but fun to learn about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suppose the term here would be 'inefficient' rather than 'ineffective'. </p>
<p>It is extremely effective to do massive overkill, but since it costs resources to do so it is <em>too</em> effective because you could more efficiently use those resources elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>
