			<div class="markdown"><p>The only reason that I didn't mentioning bring was because the nitrogen lasers that I know of use spark gaps measured in millimetres, compared to lightning's kilometres. As a result I'd assumed that the voltage is simply way too high to fall in the sweet spot where atmospheric nitrogen lases.</p>
<p>I think you may have misunderstood my point slightly; I am aware that most plasmas output visible light. I was not highlighting static discharges as an example of this, rather as an example of a naturally occuring plasma that (could potentially) produce a laser. Lightning may also be an example of such but I don't believe so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The required voltage increases as the distance increases, so lasers usually have small gaps in order to keep the required voltages down.</p>
<p>High voltages in gas lasers tend to produce arcs, which greatly reduces efficiency of the system (and it's pretty low to begin with), so there are different methods to combat arc formation, including keeping the distance small.</p>
<p>Obviously lightning is one huge arc, so it's efficiency as a laser (if you managed to contain the lightning in a resonator cavity) would be horrendous, but I believe you could generate some signal among huge amounts of noise.</p></div>		</li>
