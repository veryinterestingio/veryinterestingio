			<div class="markdown"><p>...But it (subjectively) doesnt even rank in my top 10 Leo paintings. I think its overrated like most of the &quot;classic&quot; works and if put money on the fact that most of you dont love it either...because it's not very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's considered special because of use of the technique known as sfumato, which translates to &quot;vanished&quot; or &quot;evaporated&quot; from Italian to English. It's basically the 'soft focus' look of the work. The blending of colours and lines, no outlines and very subtle changes from one colour to the next was a new style and very different from the art traditions of that time and region.</p>
<p>A lot of classic art is famous for being a new style or method and was often mocked or considered rubbish at the time. Some of the reviews for early impressionist art (we're talking Monet, Renoir etc) were scathing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You’re not wrong, but what Italians really mean with that is translated better with <em>gradient</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a recent episode of Nova on PBS that went into a lot of detail about the sfumato and the other techniques that make the Mona Lisa so interesting and important.  The deeply accurate studies of light and how he reproduces the effects of shadows, glare, distance, atmosphere, and sheer fabrics draping the subject.  He came back years later and updated his paintings as he learned new insights into human anatomy and the physics of how our eyes perceive the world.  He used brilliant colors that were often rare for the time period, but he used them in dozens of layered glazes to play on the physics of light and create a sense of depth through the medium.  That effect, in many cases, may be lost to time, as the pigments and oils degrade and the surface just gets dirty.  So we can't even appreciate how great it must have been in its time. </p>
<p>To us cynics, it's a seemingly ordinary portrait.  But to the artist, it appears to have been incredibly important.  And if we respect the man and his achievements, then I think we should recognize and respect the reverence for and effort given to this particular painting.  </p>
<p>It represented all of the advanced techniques and novel ideas that he had about the <em>science</em> of art throughout his life.  It seems ordinary now, because all of those techniques and ideas and themes that became ubiquitous were either influenced by him or independently developed and discovered by other artists around the world in the centuries that followed the work of this master.</p>
<p>And yes, a good story wrapped up in the provenance of a work of art or an artist's life can certainly lend a lot of value from a pop culture standpoint.  So he certainly gets a boost from the &quot;famous for being famous&quot; deal as well.  And in the end, the perceived value of any artwork is never purely objective.  Many brilliant artists, to OP's point, don't receive the recognition and appreciation that perhaps they &quot;deserve.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was also Da Vinci’s final masterpiece - the Walter Issacson biography does an incredible job explaining the extent to which it’s a masterpiece. The painting techniques he perfected over decades; the anatomical knowledge that, at the time, he was the only human alive who knew; and the ecologically accurate and imaginative background settings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God, I fucking hate the Mona Lisa. At the Louvre, it's encased in glass and kept distant by a rail that keeps the sweaty masses at bay. It's so small that you can barely make out the features no matter how close you are. The most poetic aspect is that in the same room, directly opposite from Leonardo's finger painting, is The Wedding Feast at Cana by Veronese. It is seriously one of the most impressive paintings I have ever seen, easily the largest. Despite being so incredible, it is hardly noticed by the troglodytes who pile in just to see that big-forehead bitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it'd still be famous. Just not quite so famous. Almost all of Leonard's paintings have been lost or destroyed. We only have 12 surviving paintings that are widely considered to be painted by him. It's why the newly found Salvator Mundi sold for a record $450 million back in 2017. And now there's some suspicion that it might be a copy made by one of his pupils.</p>
<p>There being so few surviving paintings is unique to Leonardo. Despite dying at age 37, we still have over 100 of Raphael's work. This is compared to Leonardo who died aged 67.</p></div>		</li>
