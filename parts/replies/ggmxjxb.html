			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the drying capacity of the combined machines is typically much less than the washing capacity.  They're only worth it if you have extremely limited space and can't fit two appliances.</p>
<p>An advantage that some combined dryers have is that they can condense the water coming off the laundry and send it down the drain.  This way you avoid steaming up your small living space; conventional tumble dryers can leave condensation dripping down your walls.  There are stand-alone condenser dryers too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dryers are supposed to have a vent to outside the structure. Perhaps those you are familiar with have not been properly installed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crappy machines and crappy results. More expensive ones are just as good as separates. I would still go for separates so that if one breaks you don't have to replace everything. Also helps to wash and dry at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
