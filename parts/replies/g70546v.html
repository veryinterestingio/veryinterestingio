			<div class="markdown"><p>It's honestly not that significant. Every year, there's a report of a &quot;KILLER AMOEBA&quot; that eats brains. Usually in or around the gulf coast (pretty sure there are bigger risks to brains in the gulf region than amoebae, but I digress...). </p>
<p>So anyways, not really a huge deal, happens globally, once or twice per year, someone in the US media hypes a story about it, and then people go crazy worrying about dying while drinking a glass of water, totally ignoring the warm water+swimming+water up nose conditions that yield amoebid infections in the brain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the specific condition to become infected is you need the water to make it to your upper sinuses.  Most people when swimming keep water out of their nose instinctively.  It also seems to be the bacteria only stays in very specific areas of lakes and it doesn't spread very well.</p>
<p>There is very little need for concern with this bacteria as infections are extremely rare.  Unfortunately, treatment is also very difficult so in the extemely rare case you get the bacteria, it is almost always fatal.</p>
<p>Edit: it is an amoeba not a bacteria</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is swimming isn't the only way to get water in the upper sinuses. Sinus irrigation for treatment of congestion is much more common now than it used to be. The kits you buy in stores say to use distilled water but many people don't (because it works better and is more comfortable if you use warm water).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's <em>rarity</em> is what makes it significant. If you read a story titled &quot;Meteorite kills Toddler&quot;, it would be significant because the probability of such a thing is so astronomically small.</p></div>		</li>
