			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it occurred to me when I was watching that National Geographic docudrama Mars. There's a point where one of the characters is out in a sandstorm and was thought to be lost. so I wondered if you were in fact lost in a sandstorm on Mars if there would any practical non high-tech way to be able to orient yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen some more recent studies that point towards Earth having a large moon that is in a relatively stable orbit being the reason that our planet still has a molten spinning core after billions of years.  It's an alternative theory to the old &quot;radioactive materials are the reason Earth still has a molten crust and hot spinning core&quot;... one that makes more sense because the tidal forces from the Earth and Moon interacting with each other does create serious measurable stresses on the Earth.  It also explains why planets in our solar system without large moons are cold and dead below their surface but the more Earth sized moons of Jupiter are still very much warm and seismically active.</p>

<p>Btw.  Earth's moon also has a molten core as a result of the ebb and flow of the gravity pulling on the two bodies.  As a result of this lunar dynamo, once-upon-a-time the moon generated it's own strong magnetic field.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's the wrong question, honestly. If we're hypothetically able to wield that kind of power in the distant future, we might as well just keep an artificial thick atmosphere constantly topped off through the same means we used to create it. Remember the Martian atmosphere was dwindled down to it's present state over many millions of years. In human time spans, that wouldn't matter. As long as we could create atmosphere faster than it's removed, we'll be fine. People are concerned then about solar radiation, but a thick atmosphere itself would shield people on the ground almost as much as a magnetosphere would. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember that on earth we have a strong magnetic field, a thick atmosphere and an ozone layer. Just having one would probably mean you need a lot more of it which may not be comfortable. And who know? Maybe a distant civilization that wields that kind of power thinks that millions of years is painfully shortsighted thinking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An author I know went to the local university and asked one of the professors if it would be theoretically possible to reboot mars with current technology (for his book). The professor told him that yes, definitely, but it would make the planet uninhabitable for quite some time. Basically, what needs to be done is take a bunch of crap from the oort cloud and bombard mars with it, specifically, at a single point, until it reaches the martian core and melts it, the pressure would then do the rest. Or something along those lines.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I wish he'd release this particular book series, it's like 14 books about a guy who finds a crashed alien ship and gets infected with nanobots from its structure and becomes &quot;immortal&quot; and then with all the unlimited time he has, he basically starts an interplanetary industry and colonization project across the solar system, progressively moving forward hundreds/thousands of years whenever necessary for long term projects like the mentioned one.</p></div>		</li>
