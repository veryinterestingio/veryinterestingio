<p>&quot;uranium ore&quot; is about 2% uranium</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One clarification- it's true that <em>most</em> uranium ore is &lt;1% uranium, but most of the ore for the Manhattan Project came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkolobwe" target="_blank">Shinkolobwe</a> in the (then Belgian) Congo. This ore was ridiculously pure, at 20-65% uranium. Some sources say that if we hadn't had this source of Uranium, the Manhattan Project would have been a failure, because we lacked the technology to refine less-dense ore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you see my response in the thread, they definitely had the technology to refine ore of lesser quality — they used some <em>really</em> low-quality stuff (like 0.25% U content) during the war, in their desperation. But they didn't have <em>enough</em> raw material to use it. They used about 3,000 tons of oxide to make the weapons in World War II. They only got 2,756 tons from non-African sources by the end of 1946 — despite processing some 384,000 tons of low-grade ore (and some of that was as high as 30%) to get that amount. </p>
<p>It's possible they could have made use of the non-African sources but the importance of the African sources becomes really clear when you look at the numbers: they got most of the oxide from them, and they needed a lot of oxide.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, fearing uranium scarcity, the US government set an artificially high price for uranium ore from the US Southwest, setting off a &quot;Uranium Boom&quot; that found lots of low-grade ore. By the 1970s, the government had enough uranium to do whatever it wanted with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder for scale how much uranium ore was mined and processed to fuel the insane amount of bombs created during the cold war and after, to this day. I know it has to be astronomical.</p></div>		</li>
