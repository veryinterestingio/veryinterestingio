			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I imagine it having to do with most busâ€™s being cab over engine design, meaning the engine sits under the driver. So to get the pitman arm and the rack and pinion to all line up it needs to be more vertical. In a traditional truck, they are more horizontal than youâ€™d think. The steering rack and pinion and pinion arm are almost 45 degrees from the frame. So equally horizontal and vertical. Also many busâ€™s also have rear axle steering depending on length to help with the extreme axle spread to big turning radius.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering that most busses where I live have the engine at the back, I assume itâ€™s because the driver sits at the literal front, where thereâ€™s physically no room to have a steering column that doesnâ€™t go straight down. Additionally, the driver sits ahead of the wheels, so this is probably easier to connect to the rack and pinion</p></div>		</li>
