			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback off of this comment, I've found out the hard way that multivitamins are not good for vitamin deficiencies. You need to do some research and find the vitamins you need with the highest bioavailability. The vitamin aisle at the store is to make money. They have no responsibility to (as you've said) to make vitamins which are effective. You really have to be your own advocate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly talk to your doctor. Certain deficiencies like vitamin D are fairly easy to correct with a supplement and may have some clinical significance. But your body doesn't need more vitamins that it needs, and most of the time it won't store the excess. General multivitamins are not a bad idea, but they are not necessarily going to do anything. And anything more concentrated than that without a specific deficiency is just asking for trouble (vitamin excess can have side effects).</p>
<p>As a side note, this does not apply to pregnant women or women planning on becoming pregnant (who should absolutely take prenatal vitamins). Certain vitamin deficiencies like folate can cause severe birth defects early on in pregnancy (part of why folate is supplemented in a lot of foods).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The most bioavailable multivitamins are food. Vegetables and fruit eaten in variety.  If your doctor recommends something specific to address a deficiency, then you can research bioavailable versions of that particular thing.</p>
<p>EDIT: Hey downvoters,  the exact issue with the whole supplements industry is they feed on your obsession for quick fix pills. There is no quick fix silver bullet pill you assholes, and vitamin supplements have been shown repeatedly to INCREASE mortality, while diet can DECREASE mortality. And yet you are here brigading on &quot;just shut up and give me my quick fix answer&quot;   Go spend all your money on expensive pee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On that note, magnesium is needed for calcium absorption, but sometimes you can get vitamins without this combination. Sure, you might be getting the calcium advertised on the package, but without magnesium your body won't absorb it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While its true that magnesium is involved in modulating calcium homeostasis they definitely don't need to be coadministered to work. In fact they both compete for the same transport protein to actually be absorbed so coadministration is counter-productive. </p>
<p>You'd also need to be quite magnesium deficient (symptomatic hypomagnesemia) in order to have a serious impact on calcium absorption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun story:</p>
<p>I had nervous twitches, extreme leg pain and numb legs and feet.  I went to a neurologist, and they suggested surgery on my neck (small issue).  I went to the pharmacy and decided to ask the pharmacist about a pill I was taking (for something else) and then told him about my symptoms, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;I got something&quot;  he brought me over the the magnesium, gave me a dosage schedule and told me to try it.  It all went away in two days.</p>
<p>Holy shit, take magnesium and talk to the pharmacist, they know their shit!</p>
<p>Edit: I mistakenly added &quot;take magnesium&quot; when I really just meant talk to your pharmacist.  I didn't really mean to imply magnesium was a cure or anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacists are pretty much god-tier experts at drug side-effect knowledge. You were lucky that the solution merely involved something OTC they could suggest. Their recommendation was getting awfully close to the practice of medicine without a license (not that anybody would try and prosecute that particular issue).</p>
<p>More importantly, why didn't your neurologist order blood work? Ruling out a magnesium deficiency strikes me as one of the obvious initial tests they should have performed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s cool that worked out for you!</p>
<p>As a counter anecdote though, I was having cramps and numbness, and I tried magnesium supplements, at all they did was give me severe diarrhea and didn’t help me at all.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that they can’t be helpful in the right circumstance. But supplements can hurt just as much as they can help, depending on everybody’s individual specific needs.</p>
<p>Just an FYI reminder to everyone out there that YMMV, trial and error, do your own research, etc.</p></div>		</li>
