			<div class="markdown"><p>It's genetic. We call it an android vs gynoid fat distribution. For men, fat allocation prefers the gut region, whereas for women its thighs and buttocks. Someone else made a comment about first in first out being the reason why its hard to lose gut fat as a man, but that's not really the case. It's really because preference is given to midsection fat deposition, so even if you were to burn all of it and gain it back, it would still prefer the gut region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, when a person loses weight, how does the body decide where to get the fat? For example,  some people lose the fat in their stomach first, others in their thighs. So how does the body decide that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer: it's done at random, but fat is replaced based on the body's genetic distribution. </p>
<p>Complicated answer: Muscle tone creates the appearance of losing fat, so that has to be taken into account. The appearance of losing fat can also be affected by how much fat was originally there. </p>
<p>There are 2 forms of adipose (fat) tissue. One is subcutaneous adipose, which resides under the skin and around your muscles all throughout your body. The other is visceral adipose, which stays in your gut, surrounding your internal organs. Visceral adipose is more highly correlated with health problems, though subcutaneous fat isn't great either. </p>
<p>As your body becomes more fit, it selectively targets the visceral fat surrounding your organs as you exercise. This isn't the same as spot burning since you're not working out the abbs to lose abb fat. Your entire body will simply prefer visceral adipose as you become more fit. Fat from the subcutaneous stores are taken proportionately throughout your body. </p>
<p>In terms of why people appear to lose fat from thighs first, it's possible the thighs contain the bulk of the body's fat and so to proportionately utilize fat would be to take more from there. Again, muscle tone etc can offset what you see. But yea, as fat is being lost, fat is also being stored. The genetic distribution tends to determine which areas are the hardest to tone up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add to this that there is an absolute possibilty of accumulating excess visceral fat, which will distend the abdomen and give the 'beer gut' look, so not all of their big belly issues might be genetic. Sugar/alcohol intake can accelerate this type of fat accumulation well past what genetics predispose you to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is 100% correct. This topic has split off into so many threads it’s hard to keep track of where I mention what. But yes visceral adipose can definitely contribute.</p></div>		</li>
