			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, many humans who have domesticated animals also find it similarly unacceptable for the animals in our care to die due to dental issues, and if we can afford it we pay for things like dental cleanings and tooth extractions we do that. I tried brushing my cat's teeth to treat his extremely bad gingivitis. It didn't really work because the bacteria was so well established that brushing and cleaning were not enough to reverse it. We ended up having to get all of his teeth pulled, because the bacteria could travel through his bloodstream to his heart and kill him. His gums are healthy now, and since he doesn't have to hunt or defend himself from predators, he is perfectly happy and safe living without teeth. But if he were in the wild he would likely have died from the bacterial infection, or from starvation/malnutrition when he couldn't hunt and eat properly because his mouth hurt and his teeth were breaking off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS. As someone who saw a cat get 13 teeth removed (it wasn‚Äôt my cat) and who‚Äôs dog has had at least one abscess requiring several teeth to be removed, BRUSH YOUR PETS‚Äô TEETH. If possible, do it EVERY DAY. It is painful for them to have bad teeth, and after awhile they become used to the tooth brush. If your dog is like mine and will bite you, there are these dental wipe things that you can just wrap around your finger and stick into the pet‚Äôs mouth, and then spend the money to get a cleaning at the vet every once and awhile. IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE AND PAINFUL TO GET TEETH REMOVED THAN TO DEAL WITH BRUSHING THEM OR HAVING THE VET GIVE THEM A FULL CLEANING. Also, GO TO THE VET for a full checkup AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR (same with the doctor). Preventative medicine costs waaaaaay less than surgeries and medicine to fix what could have been prevented earlier. If you seem to be getting an infection, don‚Äôt wait more than a week to go to the doctor (I learned this the hard way. Trust me, you‚Äôd way rather take antibiotics than have a toe nail removed)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Humans eat sugary foods that allow bacteria to grow rampant. Animals tend to eat less nutritionally dense foods that doesn't foster bacteria as readily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To expand on this a bit, consider that anatomically modern humans have been around for approximately 200,000 years, but the agricultural revolution only happened approximately 10,000 years ago.</p>
<p>This means that, for 95% of our existence, we ate a diet that was <em>drastically</em> different from what we eat today. Our bodies evolved teeth that were suited to the diet of a hunter-gatherer, and in the blink of an eye (from an evolutionary perspective) weve all completely changed to a totally different diet, that our teeth and bodies are not well suited for. And its not even just sugary foods, either. While it is true that the amount of processed sugar we all eat <em>is</em> terrible for our teeth, our diets were wreaking havoc on our dental health long before sugary foods became common. It actually all started due to the dramatic increase in the amount of <em>starchy</em> foods we ate, starting from when we went from nomadic hunter-gatherers to stationary farmers. Yeah sugar is worse than starch, but starch is the the one that started the war on our teeth.</p>
<p>Anyway, because 10,000 years is basically nothing on evolutionary timescales, our bodies have not yet adapted to our new diet. Not to mention the fact that modern dentistry more or less removes the evolutionary pressure anyhow, since having access to a dentist means that having bad teeth doesnt really affect your chances of surviving and passing on your genes the way it would &quot;in the wild.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Starch is sugar though, right? Or at least it breaks down into that. When you say sugar do you mean processed starches? Of course, I‚Äôm not a chemist, and speaking way above my pay grade here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not quite that simple from what I understand, both are carbohydrates but starches are a lot more complex than sugar and take a lot longer for your body to process. The same is generally true for bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, Im speaking in very general terms, not strictly scientific terms, but essentially, when we became farmers, we started eating a lot more of stuff like root vegetables such as potatoes, and carrots, wheats and grains, that sort of thing. Those things are generally considered to be starchy foods.</p>
<p>Then, much much much more recently, we started artificially <em>adding</em> sugar to foods, which is what I mean when I say &quot;sugary foods.&quot; I mean like a few hundred years ago we started taking sugar cane and processing it into table sugar, and then we started adding it to stuff to sweeten it.</p>
<p>compare either of these to our hunter gatherer diet, which was much more meat, berries, nuts, etc. And yes berries will have some amount of various sugars in them, but its basically zero compared to what we eat today.</p></div>		</li>
