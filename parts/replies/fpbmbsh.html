			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a heads up, while the “fun fact” about fetuses in the womb <em>sounds</em>true, I don’t think it’s entirely accurate. <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=90&amp;ContentID=P02362" target="_blank">Fetuses don’t actually breathe in the womb at all. </a> The lungs aren’t in use until after birth. The fetal circulation bypasses the lungs and gets oxygenated from mother instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultrasound tech here.  By 10–12 weeks of gestation, developing fetuses begin taking “practice” breaths. It's one of the metrics by which we check if a fetus is healthy. They're not getting oxygen from it so much as breathing in and out amniotic fluid</p>
<p><a href="https://joshandrebeccashrader.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/breathing-gif.gif" target="_blank">Check out this clip as an example.</a> The dark pulsing thing on the right side is the heart. The dark curved line immediately left of it is the diaphragm, and the smooth grey area to the left is the liver. We watch for the diaphragm to move to assure baby is taking practice breaths. It's usually more subtle than in the clip, but both baby and the probe seem to be moving around a bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3307429" target="_blank">Absence of practice breathing in a 20 minute time frame is indication that a preterm delivery is emanate.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, thank you. I believe I read it in a book on breath support for singing, but I couldn’t find the source online so I’m not sure if I ever followed up on the source.</p></div>		</li>
