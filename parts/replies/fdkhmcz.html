			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs to be higher up. When you look at it as a function of time, it makes way more sense. Your body runs at a low but constant baseline, which over 24 hours a day slowly burns off a lot of energy. </p>
<p>Think about it like a leaky faucet: If you turn the faucet on all the way and plug the drain, you can fill the sink in under a minute. But then you turn it off and it's leaking a tiny, slow drip. You won't even be able to see the water level changing if you sit there and look at it, but it'll fill the entire sink and start to overflow by the end of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2400 calories is what's needed to maintain weight for a 220lb man. </p>
<p>Still a good example, but for a 180lb 5'10&quot; guy it's closer to 2100 and for a 125lb 5'4&quot; girl it's 1500 calories. This is without exercise. </p>
<p>If you consistently eat at the above calories you will eventually become that weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously a joke but If you're that height and weight you'll most likely be gaining a pound a month eating 1500/day. Small people can have a bmr around 1200 calories making it really hard to actually lose weight without exercise since you cant really run a deficit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention weight, height, and fitness will highly impact calories burned with an exercise like running.  100 calories for 10 minutes or a mile is an easy rule of thumb to go by, but it's going to be different for the 220lb man vs 125lb woman, or for 10 minutes at 7mph vs 8mph</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at it another way, humans are <em>insanely</em> efficient when it comes to running. We conserve as many calories as possible while running as a side effect of our ancestors using persistence hunting to take down prey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was more of a function of being able to cool off effectively while exerting. Most mammals will overheat pretty quickly at a running pace and have to stop and cool off after a while. </p>
<p>Sweating and a lack of body hair is a pretty good adaptation to keep cool while running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's both. The human metabolic system is designed for stamina while doing a light jog or walking. The easiest rule of thumb for an animal is to see where the muscle mass is:</p>
<p>If the bulk of movement muscle is in the legs, the creature is built for stamina.</p>
<p>If the bulk of the movement muscle is in the back, the creature is built for speed.</p>
<p>Leg muscles are well developed for repetitive movement and efficient movement, especially in humans with our flat feet (!this is super fucking rare in the animal kingdoms!) our muscular glutes (the muscle being there allows for long controlled strides to be maintained for a long time. </p>
<p>And of course our stomachs functioning great upright is often overlooked. This is basically so that we can eat and digest while walking.</p>
<p>The human body is designed for walking long distances. It does it well, it is efficient, and thus walking is one of the best exercises for health but also why running is better for losing weight(we really aren't evolved to be good at it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that it's also that bipedal running is far more efficient that quadrupedal running.  I don't remember the exact explanation, but I think the gist of it was that half of bipedal running is essentially falling and catching yourself, so gravity does more of the work than with 4 legs.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Running still burns some of the most calories of any exercise. Being efficient at it just means we’re better at it (and can do it longer), not that we expend less energy relative to other forms of exercise.</p></div>		</li>
