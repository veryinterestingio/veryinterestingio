			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just lakes but any waterway used to transport logs. Floating them was the most efficient way to transport logs to sawmills. Some wouldn’t float and were called sinker logs. It wasn’t until recently that it was economically viable to dig up the sinker logs for milling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saltwater is not better for anything. It's basic. That alone would mean would not last in seawater.</p>
<p>But it's also in almost all cases connected to the ocean where everything evolved, including animals that eat nothing but wood.</p>
<p>Freshwater has relative little life because it is not connected to the billion year long experiment to find ways to eat anything. Logs in lakes can be brought to the surface and used hundreds of years later. Wood in the ocean gets attacked by sealife pretty much immediately.</p>
<p>This is why wooden wrecks in the Great Lakes are intact and clean hundreds of years later, and ocean wrecks, made of anything, are just places for things to grow and become reefs or shellfish bed. There's so much random sealife in random scoops of ocean that the biggest animal that ever lived, the blue whale,  gets all its nutrition from simply drinking seawater.</p></div>		</li>
