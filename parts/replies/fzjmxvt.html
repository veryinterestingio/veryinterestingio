			<div class="markdown"><p>Once I caught a mouse in my aunt's house by getting a box, and some supplies from around the house, and making a small hotel room diarama, put a mouse bed and some junk food in there and Drew a lady mouse on the wall. Everyone was so shook when my stupid joke idea actually caught the mouse.</p>
<p>Edit:
Thank you for the award, I'll use it to renovate the property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My frat had an off campus house back in the day and the trash pile became a problem. When we finally took care of it we found a raccoon den in the middle of it. There was an arranged bed of leaves where the babies apparently slept, a sock laid out with some of their poop on it, and a collection of small trinkets that they had seemingly acquired and treasured. Like an earring and a gym membership keychain ring card if I remember correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite possibly.  My neighbor mentioned mice shortly after they patched mine so maybe they went for him.  I moved out soon after</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, eventually.  Sealing up holes is usually done in conjunction with trapping / poisoning.</p>
<p>Also, if youâ€™re not using a metal paint and use just caulk or spackle they just chew through the old hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copper wool stuffed in the hole then calk on top is the quickest mouse proof fix. Tease it out and you can stuff wool into any thin baseboard floor gap to reduce new holes + calk on top ideally so they can't smell through it either.
Metal wool or those metal scourers can also be used with expanding foam for big holes. They eat through foam alone fast so get a good amount of metal in. For big holes / out of the way spots they nested in there's a special mouse proof calk that they don't like (but it stinks for ages).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. It takes time for them to chew through drywall, so if thereâ€™s somewhere easier for them to go (like in an apartment building) they might leave.  When Iâ€™ve patched mouse holes I stuff them with steel wool and then spray foam insulation â€” that makes an impassable area they canâ€™t chew through.</p>
<p>But generally, if you canâ€™t keep them from getting in from the outside youâ€™ll keep getting new mice wandering in and trying to nest in the walls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in an old house growing up. You could hear the mice scurrying in the walls late at night. One day I went to take my morning piss and had my stream completely stopped my the sight of a drowned mouse in the toilet bowl. Anyways in my brother's closet there was a mouse hole that was literally a semicircular shape maybe about 1-1/4 inch in diameter. There was a baseboard there but my assumption was that there was a knot in the wood that provided a weak point for a mouse to nibble through. However more than just being a knocked out knot there was a sort of bezel formed by the mouse's gnawing.</p></div>		</li>
