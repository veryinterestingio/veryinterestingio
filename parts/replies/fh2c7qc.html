<p>How much erosion does the international space station experience as it moves through the upper atmosphere?</p>

<p><em>&quot;Got a bit of knowledge on this one, this is the topic of my PhD.&quot;</em></p>
<p>This is why I love (some) subreddits and much of the web in general. Just amazing how you can post such a specific, scientific question; and then get such a specific, scientific answer from a real life scientist.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Atomic oxygen (single, non-ion atoms) is the main constituent gas in the upper atmosphere</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really? Why is it atomic oxygen and not atomic nitrogen? Do the relative concentrations of the components of the atmosphere vary with altitude? I guess it would make sense if the heavier gasses had relatively higher concentrations closer to the surface. But nitrogen has a lower atomic mass than oxygen, doesn't it?</p>
<p>I'm sure that the answer to why is &quot;thermodynamics&quot;, but I can't reason out exactly how. Are you able to expand on what factors are at play that cause this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good question. You're completely right that atomic nitrogen would float above atomic oxygen. However, the reason we see so much more atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere is simply because it's much more likely to form.</p>
<p>Atomic oxygen dissociate from molecular oxygen in the presence of the right frequency of UV light, which just happens to be one of the frequencies that the sun emits. Nitrogen would do the same, but its corresponding specific frequency of light isn't as prevalent in the upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>So you're completely right that nitrogen would be lighter, but because of the relatively similar masses, they stay pretty well mixed and theres a whole lot more atomic oxygen than atomic nitrogen.</p>
<p>I hope that helps?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested too. Oxygen has a smaller diameter than Nitrogen, but I don't know that that would matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine it's because it takes a whole lot more energy to break the triply bonded N2 than it does to break doubly bonded O2. It probably also has something to do with the available wavelengths of light needed to break each of those 3 bonds in N2 vs the ones needed to break the 2 O2 bonds</p></div>		</li>
