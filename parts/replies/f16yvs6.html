<p>I'm not sure about general relativity but working with infinitely differentiable 'smooth' manifolds you can get arbitrarily close to flat euclidean space from the above mentioned comment. Then you can have lots of points on your manifold which have little euclidean discs around them covering the whole manifold - which I guess is what we experience in real life.</p>
<p>It's been 10 years + since I graduated from maths though so my reasoning might be rusty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is exactly the point, your little Euclidean discs are also called &quot;charts,&quot; and the collection of all such charts is then an &quot;atlas&quot;. A complete atlas implies you've got a well-defined coordinate system at each point on the manifold that lets you do calculus (locally), and now you're in business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the right answer. As a manifold which locally looks like Euclidean space must be differentiable at any point. So for any manifold which is continuous at any point, containing no gaps or anything, looks like Euclidean space locally. Locally being for any finite amount of space.</p></div>		</li>
