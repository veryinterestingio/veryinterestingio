			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Been to two shuttle launches. The loud crackles and pops like you can hear starting at 0:38 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGJV0P_r1Rs" target="_blank">this video</a> are the real sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a shuttle launch from reasonably close.    It sounded like a really deep ripping noise.</p>
<p>There was a lot of laughter when the sound hit us, because a large part of the crowd had thought &quot;ha, it's so quiet, you can't even hear it&quot;, and then realized it was because the sound was delayed by distance, and all simultaneously felt silly.  Including me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes so much sense to me. I was in a helicopter once and it had hellfire missiles on the side. The pilot fired a few off, I wasn’t expecting it, but the sound I experienced was weird, it was like a pressure rather than a noise. Almost like it was so loud I couldn’t hear it. Never experienced anything like that before.</p></div>		</li>
