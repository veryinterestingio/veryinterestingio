<p>What this means is that sometimes the creditors will give large bonuses to the company's executives if the bankruptcy proceeds especially smoothly and they pull more money out than was expected - which is the exact same reason that anyone gets paid a bonus, because they did a good job and business owners like to pay their employees extra if they do extra.</p>

<p>Yup, there's entire teams analysts of actuaries who do complex analysis of what a bankrupt company can be salvaged for to determine the CEOs bonuses.  If they think a company can be sold off for 50 billion and a CEO gets 60 then obviously he is going to get a nice paycheck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. I would add that most people don't want to work at a company that is going through bankruptcy. The executive team is the hardest to replace in the short term and the most qualified to find a job elsewhere. The bonuses are bribes not to jump ship, and many are structured so the executive gets paid out for reaching certain points in the bankruptcy process.</p></div>		</li>
