			<div class="markdown"><p>It's where my cornea is degrading so it kinda looks like a nipple or mountain, but on a teeny tiny scale. It wouldn't be so bad, but this means the edges of my cornea could eventually get so thin that it falls in on itself, I heard it's very painful. Another thing that sucks about it is that glasses can't correct to 20/20 so I have to get RGP contacts. Luckily I only have it bad in one eye so I only need the hard lense in the one. It just sucks since the eye that has it bad is the one good eye I have since I also have a lazy eye in the other eye. The good thing is that my docter says my bad eye is on the better side when it comes to lazy eyes.</p></div>		</li>
