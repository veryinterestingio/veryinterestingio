			<div class="markdown"><p>The first cell contains some stuff in its cytoplasm (lets call them &quot;factors&quot;), and when this cell divides into 2 cells, they contain different factors in their cytoplasm because these factors were stored in different areas of the first cell (let's say one at the south pole and one at the north pole)</p>
<p>The same happens with each following division until these factors enter the nucleus and turn on/off certain genes that help the cell differentiate into a particular cell type.</p>
<p>This cell type will then start producing signals (different signals according to the genes that were turned on/off by different factors) and will send them to surrounding cells, and these signals will act as factors, tuning on/off other genes into surrounding cells, helping them differentiate into various cell types.</p>
<p>This process leads to countless cell types thanks to countless factors and signals</p></div>		</li>
