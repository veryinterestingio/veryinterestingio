<blockquote>
<p>By assuming a mutation rate anchored to archaeological events (such as the migration of people across the Bering Strait), the team concluded that all males in their global sample shared a single male ancestor in Africa roughly 125,000 to 156,000 years ago.</p>
<p>In addition, mitochondrial DNA from the men, as well as similar samples from 24 women, revealed that all women on the planet trace back to a mitochondrial Eve, who lived in Africa between 99,000 and 148,000 years ago — almost the same time period during which the Y-chromosome Adam lived.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take that with a grain of salt though. From the same article (and this is what I referenced originally):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A separate study in the same issue of the journal Science found that men shared a common ancestor between 180,000 and 200,000 years ago.</p>
<p>And in a study detailed in March in the American Journal of Human Genetics, Hammer's group showed that several men in Africa have unique, divergent Y chromosomes that trace back to an even more ancient man who lived between 237,000 and 581,000 years ago</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mitochondrial Eve is the most recent common matrilineal ancestor of every living human. Mitochondria have a little bit of DNA and are passed down from mother to child with no contribution from the father. If a woman doesn't have any daughters, she won't pass on her mitochondrial DNA. Every woman alive concurrently with Mitochondrial Eve stopped having daughters somewhere down the line.</p>
<p>Y chromosome Adam is the same story except with men and their y chromosome. Only men have ay chromosome which is passed on from father to son and daughter don't inherit.</p>
<p>Neither is the most recent common ancestor of all humans because you're basically cutting the people you're looking through in half. Two people can have a more recent common male ancestor than their matrilineal pedigree and two men can be more closely related than their most recent common y chromosome forefather.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, imagine a woman has a son and a daughter. Each of her children have a son and a daughter. If her son's son has children with both his sister and cousin (extreme inbreeding is needed to illustrate the point as concisely as possible), then the two half siblings' most recent common ancestor is their father, but their most recent matrilineal ancestor is their great grandmother.</p></div>		</li>
