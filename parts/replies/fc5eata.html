<p>As this article describes, given the current rate of depletion, experts believe we could run out of accessible helium in 25 years or so.</p>

<p>That article is pretty out of date (I was actually able to guess the year it was written before opening it based on your description of it).  </p>
<p>Thanks to the free market the helium shortage is more or less a solved problem in the short-medium term. Basically &quot;accessible&quot; in terms of geologic gas means &quot;is easy enough to extract that people can make money doing it&quot;. As the price of helium started to go up helium that had previously not been &quot;accessible&quot; started to become worth capturing, and suddenly people were actually willing to spend money to capture the stuff from natural gas.<br />
Qatar open a helium plant in 2013, are in the middle of building another one (which may be open? It was expected top open in 2019 but was hitting delays) and is talking about building another one. Russia is building a plant in Amur that is expected to come online in 2021.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for sharing! That makes sense and is good to hear we'll have the resources to sustain important applications like MRIs in the near term. It's still fair to say that it's a non-renewable resource, and could become more of a concern on a longer time scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see helium as the poster child of our human wastefulness. It's running out, as you've explained, and needed to save lives, yet we squander it by shoving it in balloons. Even worse, helium balloons are in the <a href="https://www.zoo.org.au/balloons/" target="_blank">top three most harmful pollutants threatening marine wildlife.</a></p></div>		</li>
