Cities like Tenochtitlan certainly seem to qualify, it was larger then most European capitals. Many of the Mayan cities were huge also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s been a while since that book was “big” and I’m not the other commenter. </p>
<p>I think the book faced some criticism because it may have oversimplified certain concepts and glossed over others. </p>
<p>More of a “pop culture” book than a textbook or journal article. </p>
<p>I think that was the “problem”. </p>
<p>Someone may read the book and take it as the definitive authority on the matter when it’s only a piece of a bigger picture. </p>
<p>Like how people read “Freakonomics” and speak on the subject as if they were experts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It made a large number of anecdotal claims that were convenient to the authors hypothesis, but could also be explained, often better, by other factors which were conveniently ignored. Not saying ant of the claims were false, but the selection of evidence, and the intentional way in which the reader was led away from even considering valid alternatives meant that it's generally considered by Anthropologists as regressive, and by Historians as highly biased towards a style of historiography which went out of vogue in the 1940s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CGP Grey is known to have shit sources.  My personal pet peeve is &quot;The Dictator's Handbook&quot; which was the sole foundation for &quot;Rules for rulers.&quot; The book assumes that humans are perfect little rational beings that know their goals, consequences and alternatives. In essence the book view it's agents through the lenses of rational choice theory, which has many applications, but politics is seldom one of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were large cities in the Americas, yes. But they were not nearly as widespread. Just a few here and there that were major hubs for the Aztecs and Incas. There were <em>very</em> few large settlements north of what is now Mexico, for example.</p></div>		</li>
