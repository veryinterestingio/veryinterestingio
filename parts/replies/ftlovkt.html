			<div class="markdown"><p>Should also circumvent some of the installation troubles that Google ran into with their fiber to the masses push. Will be interesting to see how it affects the current world of ISPs.
E: to be clear, I'm not saying this solves all the problems we have in the US as far as fuckery by the big ISPs goes. I'm not saying it will force the ISPs to lower rates in cities dramatically. But it will make getting internet with decent speed and latency a lot easier for people in remote locations which is really important. I also wasn't saying that the only problem it addresses was the difficulties Google had with rolling out fiber. I realize they didn't roll out fiber in remote areas. It does help circumvent the need for figuring out how to run cables which is an important step.</p></div>		</li>

I have a feeling the satellite internet won't be high speed for a while, but if current ISPs can't peddle their way overpriced low speed internet to anyone anymore they'll have to win customers over with higher performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t wait until we have international competition for internet/cellphones. No more telecom monopolies. No more government regulations or spying.</p>
<p>All it will take is one of these companies to offer a $3 per month texting only phone plan or gps transmitter and the rest of the world will have to start competing.</p>
<p>Imagine having a GPS locator on everything - your bike, laptop, backpack, kids, dog, car, cows, boat, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Starlink is not some benevolent act of philanthropy and it comes with real and significant trade-offs for our ability to observe the universe from the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s more complicated than that because not all space junk is equal.</p>
<p>There will be a lot of Starlink sattellites but we will know exactly where they are and they can move if they need to (they have thrusters). They can also drop to lower orbits and crash into the atmosphere to remove them. </p>
<p>The space junk that causes problems are the small pieces. For example small paint chips are undetectable from earth but move fast enough to tear holes in unshielded satellites (they were responsible for cracking the window on the space shuttle). </p>
<p>Now starlink, and every rocket launch, will generate small debris that pose risk. Fortunately, debris in low earth orbit is short lived, unfortunately debris in higher orbits can stick around for decades, and if its smaller than ~10cm there is no way to detect it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I didn't mean necessarily these satellites. More the principle. Once private businesses are capable of doing stuff in space, it's going to snowball. I know you can't stop progress, but I've always lived in a time when there were electric pylons across the landscape, motorcars in the streets, and airplanes in the sky, but space was still largely pristine. It's sad to see this step in the development of space - makes me feel like how people watched the first automobiles and airplanes in wonder, not realising how drastically it was going to change their environment. It's always what happens when private enterprise gets a foothold in a new niche. Musk can put his car into orbit round the sun for PR - how long before space advertising is a thing? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_advertising" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_advertising</a>. Hopefully I'm just being a grumpy git, and it won't happen.</p></div>		</li>
