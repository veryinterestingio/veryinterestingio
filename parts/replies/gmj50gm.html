			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on my personal experience with childhood trauma I feel like what you said was accurate in my case at least. Lol running at a 10/10 stress level all the time, just realized my anxiety levels recently too. It’s felt normal my whole life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh no! I’m sorry. I definitely would try meditating     it can help, and/or take choline. It’s mainly for cognitive development but it does help with memory. I know I suffer from it, and when I take a test my brain goes blank because my anxiety goes sky high. The choline helps me a lot and is actually very low in people’s diet so it’s essential to take it especially with pregnant women (that’s a whole other subject lol). </p>
<p>There’s been studies where people with seizures that have brain damage and taken choline in high amounts had a better rate of recovering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look for a therapist who specializes in somatic therapies for adult complex PTSD (also called developmental trauma). Sensorimotor psychotherapy is one kind. Search YouTube for explanations of the polyvagal theory of stress. Read Bessel van der Jill’s book, The Body Keeps the Score.</p></div>		</li>
