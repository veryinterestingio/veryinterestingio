			<div class="markdown"><p>The detection of snakes is not the best evidence for primate sight development since this feature exists in other mammalian species (with significantly weaker daylight eyesight) and is likely older than primates (youtube cat and cucumber videos). I personally prefer the arboreal theory but I do not doubt better eyesight has advantages in avoiding predators. The weaker sense of smell is a myth (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6338/eaam7263" target="_blank">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6338/eaam7263</a>) and our sense is innately average. Most people just don’t tend to use (and develop) their sense of smell now in the comforts of modern society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During one of my Zoology courses we talked about how one potential reason for primate vision evolving to be so good is because it allowed them to pick out food better against the background of leaves. This is definitely more focused towards colour detection than visual acuity, but I imagine it would also help with detecting poisonous snakes or whatever as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that makes me agree with this (I work in med research but I do not work in this field and have no special knowledge beyond basic undergrad on comparative zoology) is that humans' displayed trichromatism is both rare, energy-intensive, and has downsides such as lowering night-sight acuity and similar (because there's less room for the more sensitive rods). Humans poured waaaay more of our evolutionary energy into vision that would be needed for predator detection, especially as dichromatic or monochromatic vision is generally better for seeing predators - I mean hell, colourblind humans are better at seeing through camo clothing than non-colourblind humans.</p>
<p>We come from arboreal frugivores. It makes sense that we'd evolve senses that could detect fruits and leaves with high precision, and be able to tell ripe from unripe fruit <em>at a distance</em>, vs by smell and taste as some other mammals do.</p></div>		</li>
