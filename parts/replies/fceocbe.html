Second, you've tried to put socks on while fully submerged underwater? I do that at the beach all the time before I walk out on the rocks and it's super easy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the real question is why does OP put his socks on when his feet are wet?  Just dry your feet first.  Now if you step in a puddle or you have leaky shoes you might wonder why it’s more difficult to take off wet socks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is a very strong solvent (disolves things) and a good plasterciser (makes things softer) for cellulose (paper). The later is why water soaked paper dries in a different shape even if you don't load it and why wet paper is so floppy. It is likely that some components of the paper will disolve in the water or at least become more mobile, when it dries up it stiffens again and if bits of the paper have interlocked with the surface it's in contact with it will stay there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And why, when you peel it off, is it totally not sticky anymore? To follow on from /u/meeep08:</p>
<p>So we know that wet things like to cling to other things (technically due to van der Waals forces and surface tension) in effect making them stickier, but the water also acts as a lubricant and a failure point.</p>
<p>Think of, say, a thick jam sandwich made with toast or strong bread. The jam will stick the two slices together, but as you pull the slices apart, it is also the weak link - the jam stuck to one slice breaks away from the jam stuck to the other. Basically you have bread+jam+jam+bread, where jam+jam is the weakest bond.</p>
<p>As the water dries from our paper, it keeps pulling the fibres tighter and tighter against the surface and into every little nook and cranny. Now instead of the paper stuck to the water stuck to the ceiling, it's the paper stuck directly to the ceiling without the weak water to water bond in the chain. </p>
<p>These adhesion forces (van der Waals) rely on heaps of the molecules of paper being super <em>super</em> close to the molecules of the ceiling in order to work. Dried and stuck, it's surface exactly matches the bit of ceiling it is stuck to, like a weird 3D puzzle piece, but anywhere else (like you hand) it just doesn't fit properly and won't stick.</p></div>		</li>
