			<div class="markdown"><p>TRPA1 in humans doesn't sense heat. It is purely a receptor for noxious chemicals. It tells the body &quot;there is a highly reactive chemical here. We better move away from it.&quot; As well as also mediating inflammatory/itch pain. But again, not heat. Everything else is spot-on</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the jury is still out on whether TRPA1 is a thermoreceptor or not. There were a lot of original studies demonstrating it was actually a receptor for cold, but there are conflicting reports showing no such cold sensitivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black pepper also interacts with TRPV1 receptors, but due to a different chemical called piperine, instead of capsaicin. Sichuan peppers have the same fundamental science behind them, but a completely different chemical, receptor and sensation. The molecule is called hydroxy-alpha sanshool and it interacts with somatosensory neurons. Where TRPV1 receptors are associated with pain, somatosensory neurons are associated with &quot;gentle touch&quot; feelings, and blocks them from activating which causes an effect similar to local anesthetics, i.e. numbing sensation.</p>
<p>I didn't know any of this! You sparked my curiosity and I found the answers <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/sanshool-seduction-the-science-of-spiciness" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1576058/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black pepper contains piperine, which hits both of the receptors mentioned. Szechuan pepper is actually unrelated to black pepper and contains a chemical called hydroxy-alpha sanshool, though I'm not sure the exact mechanism by which it causes numbness.</p></div>		</li>
