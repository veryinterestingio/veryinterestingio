			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_vocalization" target="_blank">This was a way more interesting question than I expected at first.</a> Toothed whales (dolphins etc.) have vocal chord analogues in a nasal cavity just inside their blowholes. Scientists literally don't understand how baleen whales make their noises, which blows my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, although Iâ€™m not as familiar with true whales as I am with dolphins, all of the sounds/vocalizations they produce come from their blowhole, they might open their mouth while vocalizing to change the pitch of the sound or for some other reason but otherwise all of the noises they make come from their blowhole....and to use their echolocation they broadcast a series of clicks through their melon(kinda like their forehead) which the sound then bounces off an object, the reflected sound is then channeled back through their lower jaw which is filled with liquid and into their inner ear for processing</p></div>		</li>
