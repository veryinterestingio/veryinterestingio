			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a book called &quot;What If?&quot; by author Randall Munroe (author of <a href="https://xkcd.com" target="_blank">xkcd.com</a> comics) where people submitted crazy or silly scientific questions and he provided in depth, serious answers. You should check it out from a library or just go buy it if you like to wonder about these kinds of things. It's an awesome book.</p>
<p>In it, he answers this question (the object moving at light speed was a baseball this time) and gives this same answer. At that speed, the air molecules don't really have time to move around the object and they would fuse to it.</p>
<p>Edit: This is the book:</p>

<p><a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/20/" target="_blank">This one is the closest to the question in this thread</a>, and deals with how it's impossible to go <em>at</em> the speed of light, and how counter-intuitive the amount of energy gets by just adding more decimal 9's to the end of your 99.999% C</p>
<p><a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/" target="_blank">Here's the original baseball question</a>, which deals with a situation where a baseball is magically, and instantaneously accelerated to near the speed of light the instant it leaves the pitcher's hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The object has to survive both the acceleration and then the contact with atmosphere in hypersonic regime<del>n</del>. It is speculation if this object survived, but it is possible that humankind accidently shoot a armor plated manhole cover up using a nuke instead of gunpowder, reaching at least 240,000 km/h.

<p>Which, by the way, most scientists believe it didn't. It was moving far faster than a meteor entering our atmosphere, it probably vaporized within a couple of seconds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: it's actually six times the escape velocity of earth. Even with aerodynamic forces in play, I'm pretty sure this thing, or what's left of it, is in solar orbit by now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there's really no definitive answer here because the energy you put into the object would scale more or less with the amount of destruction you would cause.</p>
<p>at some point you have enough energy for fusion. for simplicity's sake lets say your projectile is made of hydrogen and launching it causes fusion. each fused atom pair produces 17.6 MeV of energy so about 0.27 pico joule.</p>
<p>if your projectile has a mass of 1g then it contains 1g/mass_hydrogen = 6.022 * 10^23 hydrogen atoms for a total fusion potential of 0.27 × 10^-12 × 6.022 × 10^23 = 1.62594 × 10^11 Joule or 160 Gigajoule.</p>
<p>At 90% c we said it had a kinetic energy of 30 Gigawatt Hours which is 30×3600×Gigajoules = 108000 Gigajoules or 675 times as much as the fusion contributed. And that's assuming a deuterium (^2 H) tritium (^3 H) projectile (hydrogen is the best element for fusion) and the entire mass undergoing fusion when in reality a lot of it would get flung outward by the explosion. (the bomb used in hiroshima only fissioned about 0.7 grams of its payload, the rest was blown apart by this little bit before it could do anything)</p>
<p>So even with our fingers on the scale the actual nuclear fusion with air particles would only contribute miniscule amounts to the eventual explosion which would be just as devastating using non fusionable (fusable??) materials.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That doesn't sound right. Do you mean that it annihilated 0.7 grams of matter in total, as part of its fissioning of the uranium?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the implications of this for space travel then?  If we were ever able to accelerate spacecraft to anything remotely approaching c, wouldn't that expose the to massive damage just from little bits of dust floating about in space?  I can see plotting a course to avoid any massive bodies, asteroids etc but how would anyone be able to avoid the impact of tiny motes near the speed of light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not quite so bad in interstellar space, because the density of material is so low. It does increase sharply with speed though. Firstly, you're hitting more particles per second. Secondly, those particles hit you with more energy. And thirdly, length contraction means the effective density increases, and you're hitting even <em>more</em> particles per second.</p>
<p>If you're in a medium that's got about 1 atom per cm^(2) - which is somewhat above the average - then at 90% of the speed of light you're getting about 20 watts per cm^2 of cross-sectional area of your spaceship. At 99% of the speed of light, that goes up to 200 watts per cm^(2). So the total heat is not absurd.</p>
<p>The bigger issue is that the individual particles have a high energy. So rather than a gentle heating of the front of your ship, you're getting little high-energy particles ramming into it, and potentially penetrating quite far. This could damage electronics and cause tissue damage. It could also produce nuclear reactions that makes your ship a little radioactive. So it's potentially a major problem, but it's not like it's making your ship explode or anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alistair Reynolds' Revelation Space books has them deal with this by having interstellar ships as ~4km long cones with dozens of meter thick plating to deflect dust and particles. </p>
<p>I also believe sometimes they'd basically spike an asteroid onto the front for extra shielding.</p></div>		</li>
