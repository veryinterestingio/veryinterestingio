			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually sleep between 6-8 hours, and 9 hours is my sweet spot. If I sleep for more than 10 hours, I feel groggy. I once slept for 17 hours while on vacation and it felt like nothing was out of the ordinary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several websites you can plug in what time you need to wake up and it will give you several options for a bedtime that will give you the best sleep cycles.</p>
<p>For instance I entered 5am and I got 8pm, 9:30, 11 or 12:30. It factors in 15 minutes needed to fall asleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You right about cycles but I'm not sure if you correctly answer the question, for instance:</p>
<p>Why I feel tired if I oversleep but without breaking any sleeping cycles ? Let's admit I sleep for 8 cycles (of 1h30 each) so 12 hours. But now I feel tired. ELI5</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each REM cycle takes 1-3 hours to complete.  If you wake up during a REM cycle you typically are more tired than if you wake up in the sleep leading up to a new REM cycle. Stimulants can also prevent or disrupt your ability to enter REM which is the restorative portion of sleep. Sleep apnea as well as other conditions also negatively impacts REM sleep. </p>
<p>Not really ELI5 sorry.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In all seriousness, how easy would it be to take sleep data from an app like FitBit, Samsung Health, etc. and figure out one's own sleep cycles? Would it be effective enough to create an optimal sleep cycle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should also add that REM cycles get longer throughout the night, so the longer you sleep, the more likely you are to wake up during REM.</p></div>		</li>
