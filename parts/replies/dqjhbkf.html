			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also useful to note that everything except for Sodium Nitrate/Nitrite and Potassium Nitrate are completely benign, if not beneficial (Sodium Erythrobate, for example, is an antioxidant).</p>
<p>That's not to say the nitrate/nitrite salts are bad for you, but I'm not going to make the claim that they're benign, as excessive levels of nitrates can have adverse effects at much smaller concentrations than any other ion in the compounds listed. :)</p></div>		</li>
