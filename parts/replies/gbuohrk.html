Where does it come from and when did the brain notice it as the answer. How did it notice that this is the answer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s probably not in a particular place in the brain but it is a particular process. Research is indicating that the brain is a statistical prediction machine. It is trying to get us to a state where we can perfectly predict what will happen next because that will leave us with the most amount of resources available to deal with anything unexpected that comes up. </p>
<p>when you’re dealing with a tough problem, basically what’s happening is you’re having a hard time predicting a solution. But your brain wants to be in a state where you can predict what’s about to happen. Often you end up solving a difficult problem when you take a new perspective. That’s called restructuring. </p>
<p>Add a neural level your brain has been in a state where all of its predictions seem to be total failures. Restructuring puts the brain in a state where suddenly it’s predictions are producing far less errors. Our brain has basically evolved so that this ‘Aha!’ feeling is incredibly satisfying (‘Aha’ is a legit science term by the way, check <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=aha+restructuring&amp;oq=aha+restr" target="_blank">Google scholar</a> ). There’s going to be some dopamine involved, but that part of psychology is less my bag. </p>
<p>However I will say that this process of prediction, prediction error, and the resolution of prediction error are probably happening everywhere in the brain. It’s going to depend on the problem you’re trying to solve. I am loathe to admit that the book <em>On Intelligence</em> might be really interesting to you. The guy who wrote it is the guy who invented the palm pilot, and the first couple of chapters are definitely his attempt to claim genius.</p>
<p>Btw - in the real world we hate prediction errors. In the context of ‘play’ (e.g. music, art, movies, novels, sports) we prefer things that are just outside of our predictions. It gives us practice in resolving prediction errors but in a context where prediction errors are not life-and-death. This is why you love that new song that is just a little bit weird (to you) and hate movies that are totally predictable. </p>
<p>I could go on about this all day. I think it’s a really good question, and I actually think it is the foundation of both cognitive and brain development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So we don’t need to exactly know the neuroscience of it, and that’s not where my education comes through. But through behavior alone and knowing that covert behaviors follow the same principles as overt behaviors, we can extrapolate to my above explanation.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it exactly recognizes it as the answer, but more so as the most likely behavior that will achieve reinforcement. Then, once you engage in that behavior, the solution to the problem provides reinforcement aka the outcome you were hoping for. Through trial and error and generalization from other problems that we have solved in the past, we are pretty much trying to figure what has worked before and then working from there through. If the problem is unique, you are likely to get stuck and not go any further. At these points, providing and generating as much relevant stimuli to the problem can help recall and recollect what you have learned that will help you get to the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not much to support the subconscious thought concept, but I would say our brains are pretty good at predicting probability of reinforcement of behaviors that we have experienced before. When you are shuffling through trial and error options, you are likely to feel that reinforcement for solving the problem (aka the realization moment) before you even get the reward through association alone.</p></div>		</li>
