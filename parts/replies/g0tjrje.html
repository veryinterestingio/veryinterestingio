			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI, there’s no way they would put directions on the box that are only safe for 95% of that population. Having 5% get sick from a dose that’s recommended for their age is way too many. The gist of your comment is true, sure, but there’s a huge amount of leeway with the safe dosages of over the counter meds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. I figured the percentile would be higher for medication. My feeling is that the outliers would know that the normal dose would not apply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean that number could still be right, cause the box will not only say an age but also a minimum weight.</p>
<p>So 95th percentile by age, but 99.5th by weight etc.</p>
<p>Plus the leaflet will say that this is only for healthy people with no underlying conditions or further drugs they take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this.  There are very limited studies about the safety of medications in pediatric populations because most people aren't down for &quot;Eh, we're pretty sure this is safe, but don't have a good study yet; lets test this drug on a bunch of healthy 8 year olds and  see if any have side effects.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
