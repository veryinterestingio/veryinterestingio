<p>Never though of it like that. I think you're right!</p>

<p>Uh. I'll take that back. Apparently a brain can shut down, even if just momentarily, to make a post. I hate it when that happens.</p>
<p>Seriously though, by definition, an organ serves a specific function and therefore would never not be working (although it may be at rest or idle.) If an organ is not working, and no longer serves a function, it no longer is an organ. It becomes a vestigial structure, such as the appendix or coccyx.</p>
