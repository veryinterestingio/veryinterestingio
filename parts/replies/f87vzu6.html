But IDK how to use them because 'the world is flat' is a good enough approximation when I'm hiking.<br />
OTOH, if I were dropping GPS-guided bombs or building the LHC, it wouldn't be a good anough approximation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what the scale factor is where you live, but around here it makes a difference of about 2 feet difference for every 10,000 feet traversed.  If you're measuring 50 feet, that's only one hundredth of a foot.  If you're crossing miles, that difference adds up.  I heard a story today from a coworker about how an employee in the past had forgotten to apply the adjustment from GPS coordinates to surface coordinates on a three mile dam that was going to be built.  The contractor decided to use his tape measure before building and noticed that things were about 12 feet from where they should have been in the real world.  The entire project was recalculated and restaked, and the employee in question apparently was fired for cause.</p>
<p>I guess it just matters on how large your distances are and how precise something needs to be.</p></div>		</li>
