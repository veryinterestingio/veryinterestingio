			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in the classical guitar world which never really latched on to Sonatas. Most of the Sonata's I am familiar with in CG repertoire is 3 movements. Come to think of it though, of Beethoven's more famous sonatas (Pathetique, Moonlight, Waldstein, Appassionata) all of these are comprised of 3 movements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, double concertos. Both Bach and Brahms wrote double concertos. I wouldn't say they are my favourite to listen to, and I much prefer the standard concerto over the double.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thanks! I'm looking it up now. There's apparently also a concerto for two orchestras, where the soloist is the second orchestra. Composers are nothing if not inventive!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bach's double violin concerto was the first album I ever owned. There is a lot to listen to but if you can get into it then it is up there (IMHO) as some of the most beautiful music ever composed. </p>
