			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, pretty cool solution for a problem quite unique to their way of operating. In any case, those are for debris on the runaway during take off rather than bird strikes during flight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely for runway debris. Western military flightlines and runways are usually nicely paved, and the personnel do FOD walks. In countries flying Russian surplus, they don't bother with FOD walks because the runway <em>is</em> FOD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with this system FOD is still an issue. A Concorde crashed due to a part of another plane falling off onto the runway. The Concorde ran over the part and that part was thrown into one of the fuel tanks. The fuel tank was not punctured, but a shockwave traveled through the fuel tank, which did puncture the fuel tank.</p></div>		</li>
