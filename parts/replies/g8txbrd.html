			<div class="markdown"><p>Here ya go:</p>
<p>Mushroom drops lil spores which get blown in the wind. </p>
<p>Lil spore guy lands on the ground. Does some magic and starts spreading. Creates what's called a mycelium underground. This is like a spiderweb but underground. This eats nutrients fron the soil and continues to spread.</p>
<p>When it feels the time is right(after its full from eating) it says, lets make some more of us. It pushes up mushrooms to the surface (these directly come out of the mycelium). After they pop open, spores drop out of the mushroom cap and get taken in the wind.</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you do this with any regular old store bought potatoes or do you need to acquire one from a neighbor with their own crop?</p>
<p>I just got into gardening this most recent pandemic season (tomatoes, basil, thyme, and later... lettuce).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Store bought potatoes are usually treated with something to delay their eyes from sprouting.  So they can grow but might take so long to sprout that they might rot instead. Also, potatoes that are not “certified seed potatoes” are likely to have various diseases that will significantly reduce your harvest (but are harmless to eat). Certified seed potatoes can be found at any decent garden store or many places online.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just recently started gardening and read somewhere that most grocery store bought potatoes are sprayed with a growth inhibitor to reduce the likelyhood of eyes sprouting since that is usually unattractive to consumers. They mentioned that it's not always effective so you can try.</p>
<p>I tried soaking a red potato in water until the eyes sprouted, then I was going to plant it. But, the inhibitor must have been strong on this one because it never sprouted.</p>
<p>I couldn't find the original article I read, but here is one that talks about the inhibitor:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those store bought potatoes are grown with basically the same process.</p>
<p>You take part of last year's yield, cut it up, and replant them.</p></div>		</li>
