<p>When you walk from a warm environment, your skin is hot. Your body has pumped blood to the skin to get rid of excess heat. So the air inside feels cold against your hot skin. Even though the inside temperature inside would be warmer then it was before.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah but OP didn't really specify what he/she meant by &quot;feels so different from &quot;normal&quot; cold.&quot; You're assuming they're talking about the flow of air out of a vent, others are assuming the total feel of an air-conditioned room. </p>
<p>If you walk into an air conditioned 65 deg room, it's gonna feel colder than walking outside when it's 65 because the AC room is so dry. It has nothing to do with the outlet temperature of the AC -- hell, the AC could be off (between cooling cycles) and the room would still feel a lot different.</p></div>		</li>
