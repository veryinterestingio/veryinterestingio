			<div class="markdown"><p>Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Longitude-Genius-Greatest-Scientific-Problem/dp/080271529X" target="_blank">Longitude by Dava Sobel</a> for an excellent history of the development of an accurate clock that could be used at sea. It's truly fascinating both from the engineering perspective as well as the personalities involved. And it clarifies that, prior to this development, navigation at sea (at least in terms of longitude position) could best be characterized as a wild ass guess.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how ELI5 this is but here goes.</p>
<p>Say you set sail from Greenwich, England on the Thames heading for America. As you leave, you synchronize your onboard clock with the observatory there. You know exactly where the observatory is longitude-wise since it’s been accurately surveyed. </p>
<p>By definition there are 360° in a full circle. The earth, being round, has the same 360°. And I t takes 24 hours (or close enough) for the sun to be overhead at the same spot on earth. </p>
<p>Now let’s say you’ve been at sea heading west for a week. You watch closely for when the sun is directly overhead, that’s your local “noon”. Because you’ve moved along the surface of the earth, though, your clock synchronized with Greenwich will show a different time. That time difference can be turned into a distance and hence longitude. </p>
<p>If you take 360° and divide by 24 you get 15. So if there’s an hour difference between the Greenwich clock on board your ship and the time that the sun was directly overheard you’ve moved 15° across the surface of the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So figuring out your Latitude is fairly easy (how far north/south you are), at least in the Northern Hemisphere. You measure the angle between the horizon and Polaris (the north star) and that gives you a pretty reasonable value for how for your lattitude.</p>
<p>The hard one is Longitude (how far east/west you are). Pretty early on, it was realized that for every star in the sky, there is some point on earth where that star is directly overhead. Because these locations are predicable (they repeat every sidereal day, aka 23 hours, 56 minutes), by measuring the angles to the stars, and comparing them to the calculated position of that spot, you could work out your location if you did this for three different stars.</p>
<p>The observatory at Greenwich, London was established to measure the elevation angles of the various stars of the Northern Hemisphere as they passed the line that is now considered to be the Prime Meridian (the french originally tried to use their own Prime Meridian based in Paris, but that never caught on). By making careful measurements of these angles, the Admiralty Astronomers could then produce data books (almanacs) that could be used to determine the antipodal location of any one of  the 58 stars that are used for Navigation.</p>
<p>When you were on the ship, you would then measure the angle to one of these stars and record the time that the measurement was made. Then, using the almanacs, you could figure out where the antipodal spot was (ie the spot where the star was directly overhead) at the moment the measurement was made, and then you would draw the circle of position (ie the line where someone would make the same measurement, which is a circle on a round earth). You would repeat this for 2 or more stars, and where the three circles touched, that was your location, in two dimensions.</p>
<p>The hard part of all of this was actually measuring the time accurately. For a significant period of time, the Admiralty was convinced that the only way to do this was by using the moons of Jupiter (and some other observations) as a clock. With a basic telescope, you can observe Jupiter and the 4 Galilean moons, and based on their relative positions (and a corresponding almanac), you can quite accurately determine the time.</p>
<p>John Harrison realized that this was a load of bollocks, and while possible from a stable platform (such as on an island), it was completely impractical to do on a regular basis from the deck of a ship. Instead he built the world’s first Chronometers, time pieces that were accurate enough to be used long term for navigational purposes.</p>
<p>The time from the chronometer could then be used to calculate the position of the navigational stars, the measurements of the angles to those stars could then be used to draw the Circles of Position, and thus the location of the ship could be determined with great accuracy. This accuracy is what allowed Britain to rule the oceans for quite some time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Early clocks didn't even have minute hands. You just guessed based on how far the hour hand was past the current hour. Very nearly the next hour? Probably the last few minutes of the hour. Honestly close enough for almost any practical use of time keeping in day to day usage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a clock from 1735 at home, it was a graduation present. It has one hand for the hours, run by lead weights. Fully &quot;wound&quot; it runs for 24 hours and is after fine tuning the pendulum position relatively accurate. It looses only a couple of minutes per day, if even.
It also has an alarm function, since it was a &quot;maid clock&quot; and maids had to get up way before everyone else back then to cook and stuff. It's very loud!</p>
<p>Edit: added a link below to a pic.</p>
<p>And on a side note, I'm not descendant of  some land baron who has servants and manor houses. My dad who died recently collected clocks and watches his whole life, and we had to sell most to pay off the accumulated debt of his struggling business. So thanks for the positive feedback, and to the others, suck my clock! :)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first mechanical clocks were built for religious purposes. They tolled the hour to call people to church to attend mass. These clocks didn't have faces at all, just bells.</p>
<p>When the clock face was invented (I think in the 1500s) it only had an hour hand that rotated through a full circle twice a day. Keeping a clock like that in tune just meant periodically checking to make sure it reads noon at the moment when the sun reaches its zenith, which wasn't terribly difficult.</p>
<p>It was only a hundred years later that a minute hand was added that made a full revolution every hour. A second hand, which makes a full revolution every minute, was very rare, primarily because it just wasn't needed except in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Our modern relationship with time is a very recent development. The idea that all clocks everywhere must necessarily agree really only dates back to the 19th century, and the idea that measuring fractions of a minute is a needed thing is something that only really grew out of the sciences where such precision was helpful.</p>
<p>Today we consider the timing of things to be very important. If you have a business meeting or social event scheduled for 1:00, that means 1:00:00 on the dot; if you don't start it at that precise second you're either starting early or late. That also applies to things like train, bus and plane arrivals and departures. It's all very modern, very new. For the vast majority of human history, such precision just wasn't a thing. The keeping of time and of the calendar was important for religious and agricultural reasons, but it only needed to be GOOD ENOUGH, not precise down to the millisecond like we're accustomed to today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a 16th century lantern clock with only one hand. </p>
<p>It keeps surprisingly good time, it's only off by +/-5 minutes max throughout the day, so the spacing is off but overall it's pretty good on average. It has a bell, and becomes less accurate the hours with more dings so presumably a quirk of the mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. And people relied on public clocks that were manned by professionals (for a lack of a better word) to keep time and when the clock struck the hour people who had the money for personal clocks would adjust their own to match. </p>
<p>Kind of how in movies you see people hear the town clock start to ring it's bells and look at the pocket watch. I am not sure if the writers mean to be accurate or not but it's displayed in period movies quite often.</p></div>		</li>
