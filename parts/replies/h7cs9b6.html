			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct, one small addition: Sun synchronous orbits can have many different orbital planes with respect to the Sun-Earth line. (To put it in Keplerian terms, in all cases the inclination would be the same, what changes is the longitude of the ascending node.)</p>
<p>The one you're describing is specifically for the case of an orbital plane that is perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line. The area of Earth immediately under the orbit would always be in dusk or dawn. But you're right that the ISS would get constant sunlight this way, that it precesses at the right speed to be in sync with the Sun throughout the year (minus some small occasional corrections) and about the cost of achieving this orbit in terms of delta-v.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general would this give any noticeable advantage to heat management and solar power generation? -I'm imagining it might make for less thermal cycling and a more steady rate for power generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there would be advantages in both terms.</p>
<p>For power generation, since you don't have eclipses, you can get rid of that huge array of big batteries that provide power during the night time. That's a lot of mass that has been saved, which implies a lot of launch costs. The consider that the solar panels are big enough to provide power during daytime AND charge the batteries. With no batteries to charge, they could be roughly half that size.</p>
<p>Regarding thermal control, rather than the number of cycles, I'd be more concerned about the amount of heat to be dumped, which puts constraints on the sizing of the radiators and the capacity of the pumps for the loops of the coolant fluid that carries heat to the radiators. When the ISS passes in front of the day side of Earth, it's fully exposed to sunlight but also to planetary albedo (reflected sunlight) which is \~39% as powerful, and planetary infrared. In a dusk/dawn sun-synchronous orbit, you wouldn't get planetary albedo anymore, which implies less heating on the ISS, so you can design smaller radiators and less powerful fluid loops. You still get planetary infrared which is almost constant (even above the poles).</p>
<p>Another advantage you haven't mentioned is aerodynamics. The solar panels will always be facing the Sun, whose light arrives perpendicularly to the orbital plane. Then the panels will be parallel to the direction of movement, like a shark's dorsal fin. This implies less aerodynamic drag. Of course the ISS would still have to be periodically reboosted, but less frequently thanks to the reduced drag. A similar reasoning goes for the radiators (but perpendicularly to the panels, more like a fish side fins).</p>
<p>The other comment is right about the mission constraints, but that's mostly for Earth-observation satellites, which I don't think is the primary purpose of the ISS. (Okay, there might be some Earth-observation scientific instruments on board.... I'm not quite aware of the specifics).</p>
<p>Also, everything in this comment is specifically for dusk/dawn sun-synchronous orbits. Other sun-synchronous orbits still get eclipses so they don't get any of the advantages I described.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct, the stability of the environment can make the design much simpler. On the other hand though it imposes other constraints which may not be compatible with the mission objectives (e.g. Local time of the point on earth beneath the satellite, time between revisits)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this question is not “sun synchronous orbits.” Most sun synchronous orbits don’t do what the question asks. </p>
<p>The <em>only</em> way to do this (with Keplerian, geocentric orbits—obviously a solar orbit, etc, can do this too) is with one particular orbit, a terminator-aligned SSO—which keeps you right at dusk/dawn at all times. That’s a very specific type of sun synchronous orbit, that gets you some sunlight at all times. There is no way to get darkness at all times. Sun synchronous orbits in general spend time in both light and darkness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>apologies, I did not understand this. Could you explain it in more detail, if not too inconvenient?  </p>
<p>From the top comment in this thread it seems like the way to achieve that would be to sort of orbit the earth in such way that there's light abve you (or in front of you) and darkness beneath you (or behind you) - that's how I pictured the orbit. </p>
<p>How is what you are saying different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Picture the earth in space. As it rotates, part of it is lit by the sun, and part is in shadow. The boundary between night and day is called the terminator. There are two: the dawn and dusk terminators. </p>
<p>If you imagine the earth from the position of the sun, you see only the lit part - daytime. </p>
<p>A sun synchronous orbit (SSO) stays in the same position relative to this picture. The spacecraft moves around the orbit, but the orbit itself doesn't tilt or shift around. </p>
<p>A terminator aligned SSO appears to make a circle around the Earth in this picture. It overflies both the north and south poles in an orbit, and always flies over either the dawn or dusk terminator (which meet at the poles). From our position at the sun, it just makes a circle around the earth. </p>
<p>If you picture yourself on the spacecraft, and &quot;down&quot; to be &quot;towards the earth&quot;, and &quot;forwards&quot; to be &quot;the direction of travel over the earth's surface&quot;, then the sun would always be either on your left or right, depending on the direction of your orbit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about an orbit around earth that is far enough away that it takes 1 year to complete?
Could an object stay in earth's shadow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it not have been on average more exposed to radiation as well in this sort of an orbit, and therefore requiring the station crew to switch out more frequently than they currently do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current crew rotation is not limited by radiation. The microgravity environment is more problematic.</p>
<p>It's likely a polar orbit would come with higher radiation doses, although it's not strictly necessary. The poles tend to come with higher radiation doses at the same altitude. The ISS could fly in a lower orbit to compensate, but that would need more fuel to counter atmospheric drag.</p></div>		</li>
