			<div class="markdown"><p>Flu symptoms typically develop within 48 hours of exposure. There really isn't time for it to <em>be</em> asymptotic because you get very sick very fast.</p>
<p>When I had the flu I was exposed on a Tuesday, felt a slight throat tickle Wednesday night, and by noon Thursday I couldn't even get out of bed to walk to the bathroom. 36 hours total.</p></div>		</li>
