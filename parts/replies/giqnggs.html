<p>We don't even know if that is a meaningful question.</p>
<p>It's important to keep in mind that all interpretations - as different as they are - make things <em>appear</em> random to observers in the universe. None of the interpretations allow the prediction of unique observed outcomes for some experiments. It's either truly random, it must appear random within all knowledge you can gain within the universe, or all possible outcomes will be observed &quot;somewhere&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's true and a good point.  Even interpretations which retain full determinism do not allow us to actually make predictions not based on probabilities.  :(</p>
<p>I am not sure I see how &quot;which interpretation is correct&quot; wouldn't be a meaningful question though, in spite of the above.  Since interpretations take different stances on the ontology of nature, in a sense telling us &quot;how nature behaves,&quot; even if knowing that ontology does not help us in terms of experiments or observations I do still think there is meaning and value in knowing from a philosophy of science standpoint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I was in much the same frame of mind as the op, thinking for example that roulette can be very accurately described in terms of probability, as far as probability will take you, but that if you know the mechanics behind it, you could go a whole lot further (and some clever kids have).</p>
<p>...that was until you described Bell's theorem.  I like to learn something new every day, but I kinda feel like I just found out that the tooth fairy wasn't real all over again :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I admittedly don't understand it, but I grasp what forte2718 is saying. </p>
<p>I also can't wrap my head around it. I can't let go of determinism as my philosophical lens easily, and I can't reject locality without feeling absolutely insane. I wonder what other &quot;nice&quot; things might be violated if a hypothetical theory were to preserve locality and determinism, and what kind of injury to my fundamental understanding of the universe that violation would cause, or even if it would be within my lay understanding at all.</p>
<p>If you say CPT symmetry my brain turns to goo, for reference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Definitely something to think about more. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>
