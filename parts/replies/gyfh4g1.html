			<div class="markdown"><p>We also had some Sahara dust some 2 years ago reaching Romania (not that far compared to the Amazon) but still..my white car was sand-yellow in one day. It is further proof that the sand really does get in everywhere:))</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>imagine for now that sand and sediment from the Sahara and elsewhere blows and flows into and accumulates in the North Sea for millions of years .. then over time the land rises or sealevels fall and that part of piled up sediments ends up exposed in a dry climate producing sand to blow around for millions of years!</p>
<p>To get a sense of scale, there's some 2km average depth to sedimentary layers across all landmasses, and in some areas like the Texas gulf coast, it might be 20km deep! .. sand/silt/dust is always being created from the erosion of all the mountains and rocks, including from hard things like granite and basalt in addition to older exposed sedimentary rocks  .. in other words, deserts form due to climate and weather, and in most areas there will always be enough sand to blow around as long as the climate patterns support the existence of a desert!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean that on the long run, we will see a lot more deserts on earth when mountains etc. erode?</p>
<p>/well, probably humanity will be gone by then, but you know what I mean</p></div>		</li>
