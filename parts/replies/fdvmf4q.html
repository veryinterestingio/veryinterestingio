			<div class="markdown"><p>Anybody who travels <em>should</em> be thinking about it. The charger is usually the most difficult shape to pack efficiently, and the component most dependent on local conditions (outlet type an placement, local voltage and variance thereof.)  </p>
<p>USB-C PD and the new GaN chargers are improving things, but I've always been baffled by how little thought most manufacturers put into this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people buy laptops with no intention of ever using them outside their home, and that seems to be the target demographic of most laptops. On the other hand if you buy a laptop with 6-10 hours battery life it tends to come with a comparatively lightweight and small charger (from my experience with Dell XPS and MacBooks, both having decent chargers)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When your laptop is plugged in, it uses power from the outlet to function and doesn't touch the battery - so once fully charged, the battery just sits there, unused, until the laptop is unplugged. So you basically turn it into a desktop temporarily. </p>
<p>For a cell phone, which will basically charge to full, use some battery, then charge to full again constantly, you might see some reduction in battery life over time.  But in almost all cases, you won't notice the difference before you end up replacing the phone with a new one in a few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for replying!
Follow up question: if my laptop is being used, as you said, like a desktop plugged in all the time, does the battery life improve comparatively or is it worse than using the battery and then charging it? I'm asking this in order to know the best practice with laptop charging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brick (or &quot;line lump) on mine does piss me off though because it requires a three pin cord. So when I want to use an extension cord with it I have to drag up a big heavy extension cord instead of using a lighter two pin one. In the U.S. most three pin extension cords are long heavy duty, outdoor rated ones designed for plugging in a lawn mower or chain saw, two pin ones are short light indoor ones designed for a lamp or charger.</p></div>		</li>
