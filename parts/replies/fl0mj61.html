<p>For beef cattle that aren't breeding stock (they tend to stay on pasture all year round excluding winter feeding), those that eventually go for meat still spend about half their life on pasture eating grass or milk. Even at the feeder and finishing stage in the later portion, they still have forage in their diet. It's to the point that <a href="http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/2017_More_Fuel_for_the_Food_Feed.html" target="_blank">86% of what livestock eat</a> doesn't compete with human use because they are either eating grass, or the portions of the crops they do eat either already have human uses extracted or it's crop residue or such low-quality that we cannot eat anyways.</p>
<p>That's in part why &quot;grass-fed&quot; confuses people so much because people tend to assume &quot;grain-fed&quot; means they are on feedlots all their life eating nothing but grain. That's why grass-finished vs grain-finished are the correct terms, in part because their lives are pretty much identical up until the feeder stage. Grain-finished is typically more efficient (energy, greenhouse gas, or money-wise) at that stage because the cattle have different dietary requirements that grass alone doesn't really handle.</p></div>		</li>
