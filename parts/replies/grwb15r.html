			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the worm distracts your immune system by giving or something else to focus on.... The worms exude an immune suppressing cocktail of compounds that calm the immune system (precisely so that the immune system does NOT attack the it). I didn't know they tried this worth tapeworm, I knew about hookworms tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My RA actually works like that. I don't think &quot;enjoy&quot; would be the correct word, but whenever I get any sort of sick, my joints feel absolutely great. </p>
<p>This actually happened after receiving my first COVID vaccine. Was urged to stop RA meds for some time before and after receiving the shot, and not once for the following week did I experience any RA symptoms. Was really cool to have such an immediate sign that the vaccine was indeed working and my immune system was working correctly for once.</p></div>		</li>

Some people definitely forget this isn't askscience.</p></div>		</li>
