			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer, I do have an issue with the radiating pain bit.</p>
<p>What your definition is describing, is referred pain. Pain felt <em>at a site different from the injured area only</em>, because of an anatomical link. So the pain in your tooth being felt in the ear, or cholecystitis causing pain at your right shoulder.</p>
<p>Radiating pain is pain felt <em>both at the primary site and secondary site</em>, which would be the pain of acute appendicitis being felt in the lower right abdomen as well as around the umbilicus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought that appendicitis first presented as a pain on the lower right side. Until I had it in February.  For over a day I just thought that I had a bad case of indigestion. I was in the hospital awaiting surgery before it was clearly a sharp pain in the traditional area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct about the referred pain. Just like trigger points/knots in muscles where if you press on them, the pain is felt elsewhere. </p>
<p>Radicular pain is often used to describe pain along a neurological pathway. For example, people who have burning/numbness/tingling in the arms or hands often have impingement upon their nerve</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. Another example of radiating pain would be sciatica which causes pain from the buttock down the leg and/or a disc herniation causing pain from the neck down the arms or low back pain down the legs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty cool and I realised that despite my biomed background, I never thought much more than the pain receptors and the whys and wherefores. If national health institutes across the globe taught more stuff like these it would help a huge amount during the triage process.</p></div>		</li>
