			<div class="markdown"><p>It says they're not always flat. Sometimes it grows in columns. Snowflakes will grow in columns or in flat plates at different temperatures flipping back and forth as it gets colder. They know it happens but they don't know why. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's already pretty ELI5, here's the relevant quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Libbrecht started his observations with the thinnest, largest platelike snowflakes, which form around -15°C in high humidity. Some of these snowflakes are about as sharp as the edge of a razor blade. &quot;What I found in my experiments,&quot; Libbrecht says, &quot;is a growth instability, or sharpening effect.&quot; He noticed that as a snow crystal develops at -15°C, the top edge starts to develop a little bump of a ledge, which gets sharp at the tip. Basically, the corners stick out a bit farther toward the moist air, so they grow faster. And a cycle begins: &quot;As soon as the ledge gets a little bit sharper, then it grows faster, and if it grows faster, then it gets sharper still, creating a positive feedback effect,&quot; Libbrecht says. &quot;In the atmosphere, it would just get bigger and bigger and thinner and thinner, and eventually you'd get a really nice, beautiful snowflake.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good find, relevant article. </p>
<p>Key quote: Libbrecht can't yet fully explain the underlying molecular mechanisms that produce the sharpening effect or exactly why different temperatures lead to sharpening on different faces of growing snow crystals. &quot;But,&quot; he says, &quot;this is a real advance in snowflake science. Now you can explain why the plates are so thin and the columns are so tall.&quot;</p>
<p>ELI5: We don’t know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im curious too. That article seems to just be observational data and nothing theoretical so there isnt really anything to ELI5. It basically ends with the scientist saying he doesnt really know why. Although interestingly it states not all snowflakes are indeed flat. </p>
<p>Chemically speaking (I'm studying chemistry in school) my theory would just be a certain temperature gives the molecules just the right energy (or speed) to take the snowflake disc shape and maybe lower temperatures are too slow to make the shape and higher temperatures the molecules are moving too fast. </p>
<p>idk though this is interesting</p></div>		</li>
