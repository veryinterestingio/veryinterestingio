			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question - if these systems work, then are they really out of date? Aren't they just old? It's like the NHS using pagers - they might be old but at least they work. Or am I misunderstanding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more about how easy it is to integrate with other systems and how much it costs to maintain or upgrade legacy systems. If a company is using software that was made 20 years ago it's extremely unlikely that the software is compatible with a modern operating system. I've seen companies that maintain an old windows 95 machine in their office because their inventory software was never made compatible with newer operating systems.</p>
<p>Now say that company wants to set up a new feature to automatically email order information to their customers when they check out. They need to either find something that can already talk to their super old software (unlikely) or upgrade they inventory software to one that can communicate with modern technology (expensive).</p></div>		</li>
