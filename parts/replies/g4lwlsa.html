			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a family member who is very successful in business but over the years has had a fairly high turnover of employees. His biggest flaw as a person and an employer, and the thing which results in the most employee resentment towards him, is his need to ‘steal credit ‘ like you describe. He needs to feel he initiated any good thing his employees do or make etc. Many many times he’s ruined someone’s passion for a project by simply constantly ordering them to do the things they were gonna have to do to complete the project. And if someone does get ahead of him and completes something without him ordering every step of it he makes them explain in detail the process, the decisions, the resin for everything. It drives people absolutely bonkers and most can’t take it for very long. Those that do stay long-term are the ones that fully see what’s happening and flip it one more time back on itself and make him responsible for every next step, they never try to jump ahead of the guy, never initiate something without him ordering it first, they let him take his credit but make him work for it lol.</p></div>		</li>
