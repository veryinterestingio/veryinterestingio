			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if the pulmonary inflammation (and then some!) could facilitate alterations in alveolar tissues that develop into neoplasms. Like, instead of latent viral proteins or DNA prompting oncogenesis, the cellular damage from the primary infection and immune hyper-response alters DNA and leads to oncogenesis with viral particles being absent? But idk, I just recall the descriptions of autopsy results from suspect covid mortalities and think that there <em>must</em> be medium-longterm sequelae after (metaphorically) having your lungs scrambled and deep-fried.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This will be true of other lung infections, and following traditional logic probably worse with bacterial pneumonia. The effect is almost certainly smaller than gene disruption or years of latent infection. Probably by a lot. Smoking tobacco generally takes decades to produce lung cancer, and it only occurs in a minority (10-15%) of smokers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with that logic. Certainly after superinfective pneumonia, if respiratory failure secondary to emphysema doesn't take them first then some form of pulmonary malignancy could potentially be their next major health risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is no different than any tissue damage though... yeah... damaging tissue damages some cells in a way that damages genetic material without immediate death.  Yes, it’s possible, but the likelihood is astronomically low in any one cell.  Worrying about covid because of this is like worrying about any case of rhinitis for the same reason... or avoiding any form of direct sunlight forever.  Our cells and our DNA get damaged and we have a ton of mechanisms that repair or kill those cells depending on how extensive.  To be considered a mutagen or carcinogenic it needs to cause massive amounts mutations or very specific mutations that we know are oncogenic.  There is no reason to expect covid-19 is more carcinogenic than any other viral infection. It’s not like HPV for instance.  Some people probably will develop cancers they wouldn’t have without it but the same is true for any cold or influenza virus or even paper cuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Too add an area of my novice-expertise working in clinical ID-Liver : some virus can portend increased risk of cancers without integrating into the genome for little known reasons - suspected to be cumulative damage. Hepatitis C (HCV)and HIV both increase the risk of hepatocellilar carcinoma (HCC). HIV is weird in that it doesn’t integrate its DNA into hepatocytes and if well controlled doesn’t really directly damage the liver. HCV is assumed to do this just through damage, turnover and fibrosis of the liver, but we are starting to find that even people who had their Hep C caught earlier and cured of the HCV still have rather stark increased risk of HCC, even in the absence of cirrhosis or sever fibrotic change.</p></div>		</li>
