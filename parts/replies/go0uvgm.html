			<div class="markdown"><p>The vagus (meaning &quot;wandering&quot;, like vagrant) nerve takes a long detour around the body, and is significantly longer than it needs to be. Half a billion years ago the vagus nerve evolved to carry information around the cardiovascular system and into the gut, and looped around the gills of the creatures halfway between fish and reptiles that eventually evolved into true reptiles (and then birds), or proto-mammals, then mammals, and then us. We no longer have gills, but this absurd loop of nerve still exists to control an organ we haven't had for about 500,000,000 years. It never got in the way <em>too much</em>, so it stuck around. It doesn't connect to the adrenal glands because those evolved far more recently (perhaps with primates), so there's a separate nerve connecting those which runs parallel to the vagus. Because of its weird design and the huge amount of faculties it controls it's behind a lot of weird physiological quirks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the unusual thing about the vagus nerve being so long is that it's a cranial nerve, meaning it originates in the brain. Most cranial nerves stay in your head and neck area (for special senses like hearing, vision, taste, also for muscles in your face and tongue, etc.). But the vagus nerve &quot;wanders&quot; all the way down into your torso, innervating a ton of organs, as mentioned above.</p></div>		</li>
