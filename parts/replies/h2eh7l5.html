			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess people have lined up different parts of it. I have seen an oddly large number of papers of evo-devo biologists messing around with alligators, something about their relation to chickens and snakes letting them study limb development.</p>
<p>Anywho, you can do it and we can figure out if we should submit this to the NSF! <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=Alligator%20mississippiensis" target="_blank">American Alligator</a> looks like a mess, but a solid chunk of the genes are in there. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=Alligator+sinensis" target="_blank">Chinese Alligator</a> seems to be of pretty similar quality, so just line up the scaffolds and we are off to the races!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i don't know anything about genetics or biology, apologies.</p>
<p>Does this mean that if you had two e.g. mammals with the same number of chromosomes that the sperm of one and the egg of another could form an embryo?  How closely related would the animals need to be to form an embryo?  How closely related do they need to be to form a <em>viable</em> embryo?</p>
<p>What examples of things could cause something to fail as an embryo?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the same number of chromosomes, it's which genes are on which chromosomes. You have two copies of each gene, one from each parent. When cells split, the chromosomes first line up in pairs, such that each pair has both copies of the same gene. If they can't line up in gene pairs, then cell division can't happen.</p>
<p>Let's say mammals have a gene that dictates hair color and a gene that dictates eye color. In mammal A those genes are on chromosome 1. If they're also on 1 for B, then A and B might be able to produce offspring. If the eye color gene is on 1 for B but the hair color gene is on 3, then it becomes less likely. Have you ever zipped a zipper and skipped a tooth on one side? Depending on the severity of the skip, or the quality of zipper, it will come apart much more easily than without skipping. More skips means less stability.</p>
<p>Horses and donkeys have different numbers of chromosomes, but those chromosomes all have similar blocks of genes, making it fairly simple to line them up as analogous pairs. There is some &quot;skipping&quot;, so their offspring (mules) typically can't reproduce themselves, but the mule is often very healthy and robust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the chromosome count that matters, but how similar the genes and structures of the chromosomes are.  Them both having 32 chromosomes just implies that they are likely quite closely related.  But if they've both got 32 chromosomes but wildly different genes, viable offspring may not be possible. Or if the genome structures are not very compatible, it can lead to non viable offspring.</p>
<p>I believe a horse has 64 and a donkey has 62, but they are able to produce offspring, and those end up with 63 chr. so clearly the lack of that one chromosome is not a breaking point here.</p>
<p>But even if 95% of genes are identical, it's still entirely possible that the absence of a key essential gene in sex chromosomes could prevent development.  I believe in a lot of these kinds of animal crosses, it's not uncommon for one sex to be more viable than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since it hasn't come up yet. There are generally 3 different definitions of species:</p>
<p>Sexual reproductive capability - Animals that cannot create a viable offspring (generally the offspring must be able to reproduce itself as well)</p>
<p>Behavioral - Animals that wouldn't mate with each other by choice (I suspect both alligator types would fall under this definition)</p>
<p>Genetic - the actual genetic differences between animals. Easier to spot in animals like humans and monkeys, who have different chromosome numbers. Plants (especially angiosperms) tend to go completely bonkers with this one---some don't care about chromosome count.</p>
<p>Morphology (appearance) used to be one way to describe species, but it often breaks down, take dogs for example. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to note that &quot;species&quot; isn't really a thing that exists, except conceptually speaking.  That's why there are so many definitions - because we humans ^((ok, some of us)^) like to apply order and logic to areas of the universe that might not necessarily follow the categories we like to invent for purposes of organization.</p>
<p>I mean, we can obviously say that individuals ^(for species that reproduce sexually) are different, and that populations of individuals tend to be more similar to each other than other populations of individuals, but there's not always a clear line between where dissimilarities become &quot;too big&quot; or similarities become &quot;too small&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
