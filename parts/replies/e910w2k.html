			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the most confusing part is that the UK is a country, but also it's constituents are countries. I think a good way to put it is the constituents are effectively countries due to their history of being separate nations and having different laws, but are represented internationally as the UK. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scotland at least existed as a separate country until both it and England were ruled at the same time by the same king (King James I and King James VI). Wales arguably never existed as an independent country having been conquered by the English in the 1200s. Both have their own parliaments/assemblies and some institutions like NHS or education are run by these parliaments. This is called devolution, and is about removing powers from Westminster, in England, so that local issues can be dealt with locally. It's similar to the approach to state and federal laws in the US.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, it wasn't a choice, they were conquered. But they act like countries without borders between them.</p></div>		</li>
