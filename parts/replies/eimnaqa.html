			<div class="markdown"><p>Got into some googling about both of those points, turn out we cant make fire without other  gases like methane or oxygen ( duh!)  but... my real intentions in this question was to ask if we can do it intentionally in some way ( is it possible to intentionally break gas giant atmosphere to make it habitable for humans ), like idk nuking them for isntance?  And the other point, was naive, turns out  that its obviously few states before rock solid ground, like liquid for example.</p>
<p>So again - and answer for this question is worth gold award - can we intentionally turn gas giant to habitable planet by getting hydrogen and helium out or burning it in any way, even sending other gases there. ( and possibly how lond will it take to burn so much )</p>
<p>Also sorry for my english its not my natural language.</p></div>		</li>
