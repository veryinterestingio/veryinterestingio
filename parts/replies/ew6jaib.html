<p>i think sea urchins fit that description more - at least oysters' insides look like food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a theory out there about the eating habits of societies. Basically, you look at the most readily available sources of nutrients based on effort vs nutrients vs other benefits (IE herbs for flavour), and you can predict whether people will eat insects kinda thing. </p>
<p>This holds true today - we have plenty of food, so even shitty fast food burgers are made with &quot;100% Angus beef&quot; and &quot;hand-picked tomatoes&quot; or whatever. It's almost shameful to not eat the best cuts of meat, and at least 50% of the edible parts of the average cow are sold as basically waste product for dog food. </p>
<p>One of my favourite stories from school is one of our cooking instructors asking what's in Bouillabaisse (a fish stew from the south of France). One person said it's made with fresh seafood from the market, only the finest cuts served in fancy restaurants. The real answer, of course, is that it's a traditional way to get rid of off cuts, leftovers, and whatever you don't think you can sell anymore. </p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that some group of hunter gatherers going into a new area would easily find some known foods, and be able to hunt a few animals with known strategies. If that's enough to feed them, great! But if it isn't, they'd start figuring out what the most efficient foods are. That means tasting the red berry growing in huge numbers in the area. Get sick? Try that slime in the water. Not filling? Dig for roots. Etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nature has built in the bitter taste on a lot of things.  Or maybe, rather, nature gave us the taste buds that detect bitter.  A lot of the most poisonous things out there smell bitter sweet or bad.  I remember weeding the garden and this one plant stank so bad.  And I got a headache.  Later I was looking at a rabbit group on fb, and this lady had fed the same thing to her rabbits thinking it would be okay.  Eight out of ten rabbits died - the lady laid out all the stuff she has fed her rabbits and asked which weed it was.  Turns out it is Hemlock - looks a lot like a wild carrot plant.  In addition, I remembered just by observation before I even weeded the thing out of my garden that the leaves of the plant were perfect.  No bug holes.  Why are no bugs eating it?  And the headache I felt from touching it - turns out it can soak into the skin.  It’s pretty narly and noxious stuff.  Plants fascinate me - this one is just crazy bad and not even a native species to North America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a legend in China that rats gave the gift of rice to man. So maybe trying what the animals are eating was common? Also in various Chinese cultures rats also divided heaven from earth, and released man from a gourd so he could populate the earth. So maybe they just like rats?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I.e. caffeine is quite safe for us, but it's very toxic for dogs. I'm sure the reverse is true with some other compounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure the reverse is true for <strong>many</strong> compounds. Dogs are basically garbage disposer 1.0, particularly back when they were more expendable. Their digestive system is an absolute marvel. When I was little, my dog escaped the yard, and lead us on a wildness goose chase... so he could eat some rotten old fish from the neighbor's garbage. No idea why, we gave him plenty of food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the dogs also had to find out one way or another. They don't just magically know what's edible and what isn't either. So they're working with much the same base info we had. Taste, smell, etc. Only their senses are much better.</p></div>		</li>
