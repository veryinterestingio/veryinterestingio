<p>My husband loves Tang (for some reason I'll never understand), he always buys it at the Arab grocer we go to for food. It's a separate trip from my regular store I go to for my weekly shopping, so I figured I would be nice and buy some Tang from the regular store. He took one sip and refused to drink any more stating it didn't taste right and didn't look right and was an inferior product all around. He dug his empty canister out of  the trash to compare labels. The one I had purchased was made the US and the one he likes in Saudi Arabia, same product but apparently super different from one another.  </p>
<p>Carry on. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Very probably difference in sugar. In the US they use HFCS in most soda which tastes horrible to people who weren't raised on it. Google about why Mexican Coke is so popular where people can get it - they use real sugar in Mexican Coke (I heard) which makes it taste better than US Coke (I tried it, it does) for most people  ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much Coke anywhere tastes better than America's because of the real sugar. I've lived in Japan and the Philippines and I used to love Coke in both countries. Cigarettes are very different as well. Same companies but different local ingredients and laws. I've tried Marlboro Reds from said countries as well and they taste so much cleaner than America's (I've since changed my lifestyle and no longer drink Coke or smoke Marlboro Reds but I'm sure it's still the same).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find a source at the moment as I am on mobile, but I heard an NPR news story maybe a few weeks ago that said the &quot;real sugar&quot; label actually does not mean cane sugar, as many people think. </p>
<p>From what I know, it  likely comes instead from sugar beets, which are a much more common crop than sugar cane due to the climate and care required for sugar cane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tang is a powdered mix so they don't use HFCS.  First ingredient is sugar.</p>
<p>You may or may not be right in general but definitely not in this case</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was raised on Saudi Tang as well, and if he's anything like me then that awful (to you) Tang flavor tastes like sweet sweet childhood to him. It's like the US chocolate vs UK chocolate thing. We love the things we got used to during our childhood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just have a dislike of anything &quot;Orange&quot; flavored (except orange tic-tacs). I was raised on equally disgusting powdered sugar beverages of a variety of sorts, and they all taste like sweet sweet childhood to me too.  </p>
<p>Currently I poison myself with a variety of crystal light &quot;just add water for instant cancer&quot; packets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did the same i worked in a factory that made cottage cheese and dips for chips and stuff. We made our name brand stuff then all we did was switch the labels over and made the exact same product zero changes for 10 other brands. Then you go to the store and you can see that all of the dips you made the name brand is $2 higher than the store brand off name shit but its the exact same product for $2 less after that I never bought name brand again. Sometimes you can tell when it's not made the same but most the time its the exact same shit.</p></div>		</li>
