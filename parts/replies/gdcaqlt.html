			<div class="markdown"><p>I can control the muscle that keeps them open. If I flex it and breathe normally, the membrane moves in and out with each breath even with really gentle pressure. </p>
<p>It sounds really cool if I hum while I do it. </p>
<p>As soon as I start getting something like a cold or the flu the tubes get clogged the ability goes away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also buy things that you put in your nose and then you blow through to inflate a (calibrated, not play/toy) balloon, which opens up the tube to help it drain. It gives you calibrated resistance to the process.</p>
<p>If you leave tubes blocked long enough ears can get damaged, and surgery to open the tube isn't certain to fix even the drainage issues, let alone any hearing issues that arise as a result of the ear being blocked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>according to the wiki link, your ears not popping can lead to complications, so i think it's the opposite.</p>
<p>that said if you blow your ears like a troglodyte it does hurt like hell, so maybe it's that? i honestly know not, am not a doctor.</p></div>		</li>
