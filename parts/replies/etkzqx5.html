			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. When you're bored you get a little sleepy/inattentive. When this happens you usually start breathing more slowly, taking in less of that sweet sweet oxygen. Maybe your even slouch a little, putting pressure on your lungs a bit, making it less free to accept air. Your brain reads that &quot;oh dear, we're not taking in enough oxygen, implement emergency response,&quot; and so we yawn. Take in that big surge of oxygen and proceed as normal. Sometimes those yawns wake you up enough to start breathing normaly, other times you stay in that slightly sleepy state, and you'll continue yawning until you fall asleep or wake up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It certainly could be. Your brain is thinking &quot;Hey we're still awake&quot; while you're lying in bed while your body is already winding down. This could be caused by doing something mentally stimulating but not necessarily physically enduring, like playing games or watching an exciting action movie, too close to going to bed. Your body has started going to sleep, relaxing, breathing less heavily, while your brain thinks we're up and at em. That conflict can certainly make sense to thinking you need more oxygen when really you're just trying to go to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>[Indeed, in 2012 at least](<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnevo.2011.00007/full" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnevo.2011.00007/full</a><br />
). It is argued several times in this article that we would not yawn because we 'need more oxygen'.  </p>
<p>I know this ELI5 and not ELIaPhD, but there are several points being brought up that may indicate a lack of oxygen does not play a role in yawning, that I couldn't resist to just leave out:    </p>
<ul>
<li>The first study to attempt to debunk the oxygen theory actually comes from 1987, which mentions that we are unable to manipulate our own oxygen and carbon dioxide levels by our yawning frequency. The same study also claims that even after exercise (doubled breathing rate), yawning frequency was not affected in both experimental and control conditions.   </li>
<li>The actual article did research and after yawning, we actually seem to be breathing slower. We aren't breathing deeper either after yawning, to compensate for a 'slower' oxygen intake. This mechanism would argue <em>against</em> the hypothesis that yawning helps to supply oxygen.   </li>
</ul>
<p>TL;DR: It's debunked, but remains popular belief.</p></div>		</li>
