			<div class="markdown"><p>I would have to hunt it down. I don't remember the name of the episode or what season it aired. I watched it years ago when it was a new episode.</p>
<p>Edit:
Here is an article talking about it. It includes the name of the segment, etc so you can look it up.</p>

<p>I searched for mythbusters infrasound and this was one of the first links.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. Thank you!</p>
<p>So would it be safe to assume that, one can theoretically make a location/home “haunted”, by just getting a device to emit this frequency? </p>
<p>Also, are there any physical reactions the body gives off to this save the eerie feeling?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is actually pretty tough to generate things that low - most speakers can't do it (since there is no point in making a sound no one can hear).  That said, yes, you could make a house &quot;feel&quot; haunted by pumping in 18.9 Hz tones - people would feel the room was &quot;off&quot;.</p>
<p>As for physical reactions, nothing due to the sound itself but there are all sorts of physiological reactions to fear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Superb, if you don’t mind further questions, what are the use cases for frequencies this low, considering the fact that it is inaudible to humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not too sure about this claim. I've seen lots of speakers that have a frequency response as low as 15 hz. Additionally, the rated frequency responses for speakers aren't absolute, but usually indicate the frequency range that doesn't suffer noticeable distortion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! Hello!</p>
<p>Well this got me thinking. I've seen many products, specially headphones, announcing that their frequency can go up to 30 000 hz and 10 hz or lower. </p>
<p>Does this mean that they are scamming us? Selling us something as &quot;very good&quot; but that only rises the price because we can't actually listen to it? </p>
<p>Would them be just a normal pair of headphones (20hz-20 000 hz) but more expensive?</p>
<p>I didn't mention any name as I don't know if I can say brands here or that would be taken as spam.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent answer op, but I’ll add to it that the human eye has a resonant frequency at 19hz. So not only are you perceiving a sound you can’t hear, but your eye jelly starts to vibrate which can cause some visual artifacts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can go the other way too. In school, we took a signal generator and turned the frequency up higher than anyone could hear, then jacked the amplitude up all the way. We would turn the speaker on and people got uneasy but couldn’t quantify why. It was also too high of a frequency to locate the speaker in the room so you just would feel bad and irritable. Neat experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Signal generators are fun - one of the guys in my electronics class figured out what the &quot;end of class&quot; tone was, and would sometimes play it a couple minutes prior to the bell so we had more time for passing period</p></div>		</li>
