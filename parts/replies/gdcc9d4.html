			<div class="markdown"><p>But nobody said they have to play a 10 fps video at 24 fps, thatâ€™s a conscious choice, so why would they do that?  They could pretty easily just duplicate frames to get it close to the right frame rate for playback if the playback system is forced to 24.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frame rates that slow destroy the illusion of movement, it would take the viewer out of the element, better to speed it up a little and keep the audience engaged.</p>
<p>Duplicating frames wouldn't be that easy, either. And the heat from the projector on the film at a slow speed likely played a role as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because film projectors and cameras were 100% <em>mechanical</em>.  If you wanted to project film that was shot at 10 fps and you don't have access to an antique projector capable of displaying 12 fps, then you're going to see that film at 12 fps.  You can't just &quot;duplicate frames&quot; of film without going through an expensive and laborious process - and duplicated frames at that rate would not look good anyways, as it would introduce very noticeable jerks in the motion.</p>
<p>Even when much of that film was converted to video, the conversion process requires running it through a film projector onto a screen that the video camera can shoot, and if your converter can only mechanically display 12 fps of film, your video is still going to look sped up.  This is a process called <em>telecine</em>, and even when doing a newer film with 12 fps, the conversion is not perfect because 60 is not a multiple of 12, resulting in a more subtle jerkiness in the conversion.</p>
<p>It's only relatively recently with advanced computing and storage that it's practical to digitally scan those old films, which makes a mechanical projector capable of 10fps unnecessary, and which can interpolate them nicely into 12 fps.</p></div>		</li>

<p>60 is an integer multiple of 12.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is talking about frame rate, and that definitely plays a part but there's actually more going on than just framerate. Our perception of what looks &quot;normal&quot; for film has two other very large components - shutter speed and shutter angle.</p>
<p>Shutter speed is how long each frame is exposed to light (how long the shutter is &quot;open&quot;).</p>
<p>Shutter angle is how long the shutter is closed <em>between frames.</em> This isn't something most people think about, but until the advent of digital cameras, there was always a certain amount of time that passed between each frame - &quot;lost&quot; time, if you will. It was required because there had to be a space between each frame of physical film or you would just have one long smear from the beginning of the reel to the end and it wouldn't be anything we could perceive as motion.</p>
<p>Those two values are related to each other and both play into the extremely important addition of <strong>motion blur</strong>. The lack (or insufficient amount of) motion blur is a large part of what gives things shot &quot;on video&quot; that weird look. (I'm referring to the time before we started having global shutters that simulate a shutter angle, like we do now.) Each frame is captured one after the other, with no space in between like we're used to seeing. It's also why 60fps film seems &quot;wrong&quot; if you're not used to it - the interframe time is too short, and there's only half as much motion blur.</p>
<p>All that is to say that the same effect is at play in old films in the opposite direction - when shooting at 10-12 fps with a 180-degree shutter, there's way <em>more</em> interframe time than we're used to, and it looks weird, even if you correct the framerate. Especially if you correct the framerate (i.e. do a 3:1ish pull-up) because you've added more frames but not decreased the interframe time, so your brain doesn't know how to process the &quot;motion&quot; it's seeing-but-not-seeing.</p></div>		</li>
