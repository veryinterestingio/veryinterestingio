<p>How are you assessing certain intelligence qualities without going down the criticism that befalls a lot of this research with anthropomorphism (big criticism of Jane Goodall is what comes to mind)  </p>

<p>Great question! It is very difficult to compare the smarts of different species, or even individual animals, without conducting experimental direct comparisons. For example, in my research, I compared cognition in non-social carnivores (leopards and tigers) to social carnivores (lions and spotted hyenas) by giving individuals of these species the same task and comparing their performance. I gave multiple individuals of each species a puzzle-box that required them to pull on a rope to open the box and get a food reward. I measured how long it took them to figure out the task and whether they learned/remembered the task solution. Significantly fewer leopard and tigers were able to figure out how to open the box compared to lions and spotted hyenas. These results indicate that lions and spotted hyenas are better at figuring out a solution to a novel problem, but that is all we can say. It is possible, and perhaps even likely, that there are cognitive tasks for which leopards and tigers would outperform lions and spotted hyenas. </p>
<p>Some researchers compare brain size of species, and there have been experiments with puzzle-boxes comparing performance across a wide range of species. The aim of this research and much of my research is to try to figure out what cognitive abilities are useful to different species and why…how do these abilities evolve? It is not to say one species is superior to another, but that species encounter different challenges and have evolved different cognitive needs to meet these challenges.</p>
<p>Tldr; direct comparisons of species’ performance on ‘animal iq’ tests is one way to compare ‘smarts’. Another way is compare specific regions of the brain across species. For example, neocortext to whole brain ratio is often used as a measure of cognition because problem-solving is housed in the neocortex.</p></div>		</li>
