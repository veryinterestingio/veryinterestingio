<p>It would be nearly impossible to sum all of it up here.</p>

<p>u/Chicksunny, if there's one takeaway, it's this: all of this is more complex, and far less understood, than just &quot;more serotonin/dopamine/... = more happy&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah definitely. Its so damn complicated that after so many decades of research we still have no clue/only scratched the surface of how our brain works. Serotonin receptors have influence on dopamine release too for example</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure now but isn't dopamine also associated with Parkinson's decease because it affects our motor function as well? At high school, I remember learning about it in my psychology class. Really interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, dopamine dysfunction is central to Parkinson’s disease. In fact, many of first behavioral / medical studies on dopamine aimed to understand etiology of the motor dysfunction in Parkinson’s as well as other symptoms in the disease such as cognitive impairment e.g. memory, concentration and from there, these studies gave rise to studies that looked at the the role of dopamine in concentration, attention, sleep disturbances, and more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. There aren't that many different types of neurotransmitter but each have a load of different receptor types. So dopamine talking to one neuron can send a different message than dopamine talking to another neuron. Lots of neurons involved in movement use dopamine, like you said. So dopamine has a lot of different and somewhat separate jobs in the brain!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of neat, although it does add a layer of complexity to the problem, I suppose.</p>
<p>Are we any closer, to your knowledge or in your opinion, to reevaluating and addressing dopamine levels in adults that have been medicated for decades with SSRIs based on 30 year-old neuroscience?</p></div>		</li>
