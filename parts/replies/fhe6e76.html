			<div class="markdown"><p>I recommend checking out thetruesize.com which gives you an idea just how much that map inflates the size of certain countries.</p>
<p>Move the US 48 a bit north of Russia and they look bigger than Russia, for example. Movie India north and it gets bigger than Greenland. Move Greenland south and you see it's smaller than India. Canada including its frozen archipelago is only a bit bigger than the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an alternate map which I forgot the name of unfortunately that aims to reduce distortion based on hemisphere and rather give up on some other forms of distortion. It's used a lot in Universities because people get tricked into thinking Africa, South America and Australia are tiny and insignificant because they've been staring at a Mercator projection their whole life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no way to project a spherical map on a flat surface without stretching or tearing parts of the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a mathematical reason behind this called the Gaussian curvature.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3tdW9l1690" target="_blank">Here's a video</a> explaining that concept as well as the Euler spiral, which is mathematically the closest a flat surface can map a sphere. As we all know, 90% of modern math goes back to Gauss or Euler.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It isn't just close, it's an exact mapping.</p>
<p>However, it's also technically not a flat surface as you end up with a line of infinitesimal thickness, so it's one dimensional (a line, not a plane).</p></div>		</li>
