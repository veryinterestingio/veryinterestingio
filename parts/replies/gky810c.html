<p>Sure, but African-Americans have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4157456/table/T1/?report=objectonly" target="_blank">50-60% prevalence of L1 variants</a>, so in context of this discussion of the disproportionate population-level impact of Covid on African-Americans that distinction has fairly limited relevance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, the G1 variant positions have near perfect linkage disequilibrium. So the percentages in the table you are referencing cannot just be added up. Second, for the G1 and G2 variants to lead to nephrotoxicity, you are thought to have to be a homozygous carrier of either one of the alleles (or a compound Het). This is due to the clear dosage requirement of toxic protein buildup, but also the hypothesis (albeit a thin one) that the G0 variant actually offers some protective effect. So only approximately 33% of African Americans carry a risk allele, while only 13% (the homoyzgotes) are actually at risk for APOL1-associated nephropathy. And, because of the incomplete penetrance of the disease, only a subset of those will actually develop a clinical manifestation.</p>
<p>It is important to note that, within America, many African Americans are decedents of slaves. Slaves were largely imported from west Africa. So, to some degree, African Americans will have higher than expected allele frequencies. But it's also true that certain Cameroonian populations, for example, have near-zero allele frequencies at these positions and many Pakistani and Dominican populations carry the alleles through admixture at at least relevant frequencies despite not being labeled as African Americans. So it holds true that analyzing the actual genetic ancestry of an individual, rather than just labeling them as &quot;African&quot; is important even within the USA if you want to accurately hypothesize why they have developed a nephropathy.</p></div>		</li>
