			<div class="markdown"><p>We can't even get people to do that half the time - kids and some adults often need to be sedated or at least medicated to help them relax enough to allow us to give them nasogastric tubes, which are basically the human equivalent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short reply to you since it's the only one that mentions the human larynx: when water enters the larynx (going &quot;down the wrong pipe&quot;), the larynx can contract involuntarily to seal the airway and prevent further water from entering further down. This is called laryngospasm, and is why drowning victims are unable to call for help. </p></div>		</li>
