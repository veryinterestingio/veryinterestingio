			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially brass. I learned this when I aquired a grandfather clock. When handled with clean gloves the brass weights basically maintain a finish that looks like gold. If you just touch them with bare hands they start to look like every other piece of brass you ever see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^this.  I played a brass instument in marching band, and all the laquer would be absolutely demolished on our instruments by a few months.  On really sweaty days you could actually end up with a greenish sheen on your hands/body where the corrosion rubbed off on you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  </p>
<p>I run a manufacturing plant in the steel industry and we have product lines where employees can not touch the product with bare hands due to the oils and contamination causing the metal to oxidize</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you media blast a car body it starts to rust immediately. If you touch the bare metal it’s noticeable in hours. You really need to wipe it down then spray it in epoxy as soon as you’re done blasting or you’re just creating problems for the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole scratch test thing throws people off because things can also be extremely brittle and wear away. The Water Jet Channel was able to cut through diamond using grit lower on the scale just fine. A molecule fired fast enough of just about anything is enough to &quot;scratch&quot; Diamond. Its moreso to quantify hardness and not a steadfast rule about damage resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I make diamonds at work. Can confirm, we throw out damaged diamonds all the time. </p>
<p>To be more specific, we make diamond inserts for oil rig drill bits. They go through all sorts of different rock while drilling and definitely get worn down and worn out. We have a bunch that have two different layers of diamond mixtures. The top layer will drill down so far and its designed to wear out and the second layer is much harder to go through the tougher rock further down. Super interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also worked at a place that made cutters for rigs. (Before COVID got me laid off)Small cracks, chips and all kinds of little things impacted how fragile the diamonds are. It was always weird to me that I could take a diamond disk and just snap it with my fingers.</p></div>		</li>
