<p>This is a huge part of what people don't understand. It's outdated, but banks that run billions of dollars a day <em>rreeeeealllly</em> don't want to update to a new software and have a glitch. </p>
<p>Porting a retail point of sale over to a new system causes issues every time. Imagine a database with millions of transactions a day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right. I worked at a company that had billions at stake, and had DOS from the 1980s or 1990s still.  It is in a very highly regulated industry and the laws are insane and change from state to state, so all those business rules are written into the code.</p>
<p>I think they actually tried to write it in newer code, but they went to a few very large companies to do it but they all turned it down. Tens or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of coding, they all said, &quot;Nah, fuck that.&quot;</p>
<p>It's one thing if you have a few hundred thousand dollars or a hundred million, but when you get up to 50 or 100 billion dollars, and there is a glitch.... You can say &quot;oops&quot; with a few hundred thousands, but not with 80 billion dollars. Nobody is going to be understanding.</p>
<p>That is one reason why smaller companies can be more mobile than big companies. And, there is nothing that big companies can do about it. If <em>you</em> were the CEO of the big company, you'd have to play it safe, too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it is also that smaller company are more wiling to licenses than develop by themselves for e.x there is only one company that does most of the software for most banks in iceland</p></div>		</li>

Pretty much a PR nightmare for a bank. IIRC these were related to updates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newer programs are usually built on top of packages built by other people, and those packages are built on yet more packages. Each package is meant for a more general use case than whatever this specific program needs it for, meaning it's more complicated than it strictly needs to be for this purpose. And the more complicated any program is, the more opportunities there are for error or exploit.</p>
<p>It's generally a tradeoff between efficiency/security and capability, where the more dependencies you have, the more capable your program is at the cost of space efficiency and exploit protection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked in a trading position until a couple years ago, we were still getting orders from some counterparts by fax. It’s not always about the banks systems or the other banks. Sometimes it’s some intermediary that’s stuck in the last millennium.</p>
<p>Basically the two day transaction period is to make sure everyone agrees on everything, including CTF/AML systems and compliance for riskier customers and recipients. However, in some cases it’s because sometimes it’s hard to get a hold of whoever is supposed to receive on the other end.</p></div>		</li>
