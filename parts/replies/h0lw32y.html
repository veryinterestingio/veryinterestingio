<p>First of all, yes, it moves, but it moves in some abstract degree of freedom, kind of the way that temperature &quot;moves&quot; periodically with a period of one day.</p>

<p>Looking at a sound wave is a good analogy. No particle of air is going up and down (or back and forth due to it being a longitudinal wave). If you tracked a single air particle, it's just moving in a line. What has a wavelength is the distance between high/low pressure. </p>
<p>In electromegnetic waves, what is &quot;moving&quot; is the intensity of the E&amp;M fields. It's not a motion through position.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So does this mean that with both sound waves and electromagnetic waves, there actually IS a &quot;squiggly line&quot; shape, but it's the disturbance in the &quot;medium&quot; that &quot;moves&quot;?</p>
<p>(With the actual medium with sound waves being air or whatever, and the &quot;medium&quot; of electromagnetism being just the electromagnetic field and not some universal ether)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hmm, I'm not sure about this. If you looked at the air in front of a speaker, they are not all traveling in a straight line out from the speaker. It's not emitting a wind.</p>
<p>When the cone moves backwards, there are definitely air particles that move into that space of negative pressure, moving backwards towards the speaker. When the cone then pushes out again, some of those particles will switch direction due to the incoming high pressure wave.</p>
<p>That said, it's true that any particle in particular is following a fairly chaotic motion, and the waves of pressure are only visible in their amalgamation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree -- with a longitudinal wave, the particles should move back as well as forward. The single particle moves forward in a straight line, then strikes another particle (propagating the wave) and rebounds back to its original position (or thereabouts). Like a Slinky.</p>
<p>I don't think the metaphor is unsalveageable, but I don't think it's quite so straightforward, either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that you have an old style CRT scope, what you're looking at is an analog representation .. of the plate voltage field across the CRT tube. Which has a linear relationship with the input voltage (there's an amplifier between), which for a signal from a  microphone then has a linear relationship with the position of the transducer surface. Which is moved by air pressure, usually the difference in pressure between the back and front sides. The pressure waves are real, but unlike water they don't go up and down.</p>
<p>Scope traces are two dimensional, signal x time. The third dimension, dot intensity, is very rarely available to control or used for anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main confusion with sound waves is that they're always represented as transverse waves, because its easier to depict, when they're actually longitudinal waves. So rather than the squiggly up and down movement, they're actually doing a forward and back movement. Think about a speaker moving in and out, essentially the same thing is happening to the air molecules along the length of the waveform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many people’s confusion is that they think the visual graph shows the shape of the wave.  But it doesn’t.  The graph graphs some properties of the wave (like intensity over time).</p>
<p>Sound is a compression wave moving forward and outward.  There isn’t any “up and down” movement.  (Unless we’re talking about resonance or strings vibrating, maybe.)</p>
<p>If I keep punching the wall, my fist is only moving forward and backwards.  If you graph it by intensity, it will have the up/down peaks and troughs but that’s not the real shape of the actual wave or the real movement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's true when using Maxwell's equations too, right? The fact that Maxwell's equations didn't obey Galilean Relativity was one of the main drivers that led to Special Relativity being discovered in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You've got this so backwards.</p>
<p>The physics isn't happening <em>because of</em> the math. The math is our best description of the physics.</p>
<p>Take newtonian mechanics, or any classical theory, for example. Beautiful mathematics. Yet we now have better, relativistic and quantum mechanical models. The physics of what is actually happening didn't change, our understanding and the equations we wrote down did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I added some responses. The main thing is that we choose what we want to call a photon, and we specifically chose to define photons (more or less) as things that exhibit sinusoidal oscillation. Someone else pointed out that in some contexts we’re actually talking about wave packets, which are coherent bundles that have a more definite position, rather than extending across the entire universe, and those aren’t strictly sinusoidal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no. A sine wave is a mathematical concept. A photon isn't a sine wave, but it can be closely modeled as one, which is useful bc of Fourier analysis. So the sinusoidal nature is purely from our useful description.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right, that's what I'm saying. Physics isn't just people doing a bunch of maths, it has to be guided by observation.</p>
<p>You would only ever really say one of two things about sine waves in physics:</p>
<p>&quot;I have observed that this thing maps out a sine wave as it moves, I better use that as the starting point for my model&quot; </p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>&quot;I've observed something behaving in this other way, so I'll begin my model like this... Let's follow through the math, oh I have sine waves! <em>does this prediction match observation?</em>&quot; If yes, the model has some credibility. If no, start over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spot on! </p>
<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the elegance of models and forget they are just that: models. There’s a book called Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray by Sabine Hossenfelder that I’ve had recommended to me but haven’t had a chance to read yet. Apparently it is pretty good and addresses this topic.</p>
<p>All that aside, thanks for the nice explanation :).</p></div>		</li>
