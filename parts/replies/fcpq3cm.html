<p>I believe that original Xbox games had an emulator profile created for each one and they did some offline conversion process to change from x86 to PPC instructions.</p>
<p>To run 360 games on Xbox One I believe they switched to having a single emulator that runs the 360's OS and transcodes instructions in real-time. The release of new BC games is trickled through a process that involves thoroughly retesting the game and patching any emulator issues.</p></div>		</li>
