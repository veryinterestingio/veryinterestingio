			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this analogy! Any idea if grapefruit-flavored seltzer water (containing no juice or added sugars; only carbonated water and “natural flavor”) would have the same effect? My MIL is taking cholesterol meds that say not to take with grapefruit, but she has recently started drinking flavored soda-water since she misses actual grapefruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Id imagine this would be totally fine. The natural flavors in seltzers are usually a handful of aromatic compounds that contribute to the flavor without any of the hundreds of unnecessaries, like coumarins. They might contribute to the bitter flavor or grapefruit, but I’ve never had a seltzer that was bitter. Also, iirc the threshold volume of grapefruit juice is relatively high, something like 500 mL, before pharmacokinetic (what your body does to the drug) changes are significant. This is by no means a green light for her to drink grapefruit juice, but most docs just err on the side of caution and just say 86 the juice altogether.</p></div>		</li>
