			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree,  I'd love to see a true comparable Oxford number,  which it surprises me they haven't generated and publicised for PR purposes given they must have the data to do that.  On the severe infections metric the Oxford study actually did better (0 vs 1) and again I'm surprised that also isnt being made more of by the Oxford people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might be that they don't want to start an argument. In the sense of &quot;Our efficacy is 70%. We would like to emphasize that our used method of determining efficacy is more reasonable than what <em>they</em> did. With <em>their</em> sloppy method, we would be at 95%, too.&quot;</p>
<p>If the focus is to simply provide a working vaccine, saying yours is 70% effective (efficant?) is entirely sufficient. If you believe that another vaccine is labelled slightly misleading, but it's probably approximately same effective, there's no real benefit to conflict now, you can still pick that apart later. (This is twice true in the current climate of science being doubted for populism reasons. You don't need to add science picking itself apart over semantics and methodology to that.)</p>
<p>Or maybe the scientists collating the data simply went with their own approach, without paying heed to the details of how someone else did it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But for the purpose of selling the vaccine, wouldn't they risk countries skipping their vaccine because Pfizer advertises a higher efficacy? I get that right now everybody is basically scrambling to get any vaccine at all but it might not be the case once supply is more widely available no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not sloppy, it's just a different criteria.  There's a range of criteria that can be used to test for vaccine efficacy.  Starting with infection (called sterilizing immunity) which is what it sounds like Oxford was testing.  Pfizer and Moderna tested for symptomatic immunity,  J&amp;J sounds like they tested for immunity from moderate disease.  Further down the line would be severe disease and lastly death.  These aren't illegitimate or sloppy criteria, just different data points.  Yes this does make comparing the efficacy difficult, Moderna's vaccine may also produce 70% sterilizing immunity, but we don't know yet because it hasn't been tested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given there were a few sloppy practices by the Oxford team, eg giving different placebos in different parts of the world and not getting as diverse a study group, I imagine that they wouldn't want to get into that argument.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely if you really go into the details, a direct comparison will be moot anyway. Given all the details in how the studies are conducted, how efficacy is defined and patient populations it likely won’t be meaningful to compare vaccines head to head.</p>
<p>More importantly, every medicine is approved in its own merit. It is thus very little benefit (scientifically) to spend the resources comparing with others. And it opens you up to a lot of criticism/fights that you also don’t want to spend your resources on. In most jurisdictions direct comparisons are subject to strict regulation in patent law and pharma law. It costs a lot of money and does not benefit the patients.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin comparisons make great headlines in media.</p>
<p>So companies and health authorities will do their best to avoid direct comparisons and media will work hard to compare and write catchy headlines.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>In the US at least, new medications are approved against the current standard treatment. So if you are testing a new blood pressure medication, for example, the control group is a current blood pressure medication. You have to show your new medicine is somehow better than what's currently available. Maybe it has better outcomes, or fewer side effects, or is easier to administer (e.g pill vs injection). The U.S. FDA won't approve a new medicine that is strictly worse than existing treatments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually never appropriate to compare efficacy across studies due to variability in study design. In this case there are glaring differences in primary endpoints, but there can also be differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria, study duration, locations, etc. To fully understand the efficacy data you must analyze the full study. This is why &quot;peer review&quot; is so important in the pharmaceutical/ medical industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any factors that CAN be compared? I'm thinking of something like &quot;tested positive for COVID 19 infection after receiving the vaccine&quot; or not.  I'm guessing that some portion of actual infections might not be tested and confirmed, and the testing can have false negatives, but shouldn't something like that be straightforward enough to compare?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  Comparisons between different products must be done in the exact same study to even be able to claim a statistically significant superiority or equivalence.  I mean, you can, but it is really worthless.</p>
<p>Another thing nobody is mentioning here...one is a traditional vaccine, the others are not (mRNA vaccines).  Personally, I am waiting for the traditional vaccine, maybe just an overabundance of caution due to the new mRNA versions being approved so damn quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Efficacy was calculated by using the specific test group VS control group but each vaccine did their tests using different test groups. All groups were subject to different degrees of the disease which can influence the math on this efficacy. They were done in different countries for example.</p>
<p>We really can’t compare efficacy between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 70% is also on symptomatic cases though. Not on positive PCR results. So they are actually quite comparable, although I did not look at the specific criteria of each study to determine 'symptomatic' cases. </p>
<p>In their first report on the phase III study, they (oxford) also mention asymptomatic cases, presumable based on just positive PCR results. But here the efficacy was much lower, something like 25%. Now they have a newer analysis out, where they show better results, but that I haven't read yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd note however that it can be discussed what <em>symptomatic</em> meant in the study. Did the person cough 3 times in a day, was positive to the PCR, and was labelled as symptomatic? As far as I've understood from the paper, they were quite generic about the symptomaticity that qualifies, except of course for more severe symptoms like how short breath. I've not found however a frequency for the symptoms, so I don't know if the same <em>symptomatic</em> patients would have been tested if under the Pfizer's cohort instead of Oxford.</p></div>		</li>
