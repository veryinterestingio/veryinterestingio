I had a buck scare the shit out of me once because he fell off the doe (if you've never seen a buck cum before, treat yourself it's hilarious) and start squealing like he was being murdered instead of the usual grunt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not necessarily. If no one's made the suggestion yet, it's better to have someone explicitly correcting run-on sentences, even if it brings a slight risk of introducing confusion over less vs fewer. Run-on sentences can significantly impact readability; less vs. fewer is honestly useless pedantry in most contexts, especially internet forums.</p>
<p>Now if they were being a dick about correcting English while not possessing flawless English themself, then I'd be more inclined to agree, because that's just obnoxious.</p></div>		</li>
