			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the extra testosterone present in women with PCOS means a larger amount of sebum is produced, hence breakout. Going on birth control pills when you have PCOS tends to lower testosterone, though not always. And it can thus often clear up your skin a bit. I'm not sure why the chin particularly. Could be partly your own physiology, or it could be that hair is being stimulated to grow there, as often happens with women with PCOS, and the combination of hair and sebum means more pimples. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) causes an imbalance in certain hormones in your body - mainly <em>androgens</em>. These androgens (male sex hormones) can cause symptoms such as hirsutism (hair distribution in a male pattern, such as upper lip, chin, abdomen, etc) and acne. The acne on the chin/jaw is likely due to increased androgen stimulation on the follicles that would result in the male facial hair pattern seen in PCOS (typically the chin/jaw). Effectively, this would also stimulate nearby sebaceous glands that would work to lubricate those hair follicles. At this point, the pathway is the same as the comment to which you originally replied (pore blockage).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! I think there was just a TIL about how our faces get oily because the pores are still producing oil that would’ve lubricated our facial hair (just like head hair). Soo that leads me to think that where faces get oiliest is where we used to have more hair—or in this case, where the body <em>thinks</em> there should be male-typical facial hair due to excess T. Or maybe this is just my runaway brain ??‍♀️</p></div>		</li>

<p>As bacteria grow in the pore, your immune system fights back, so the pore ends up with dead bacteria, dead white blood cells and fluid.</p>
<p>Hows that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not too different to a regular pimple except for the depth of the pore it forms in. Theres natural variation and in the case of a blind pimple its just a very deep pimple that doesnt have a clear path of pressure release to the surface of the skin, so they build in pressure. Theres also more nerve endings deeper in the skin, thats why they're so sore.</p></div>		</li>
