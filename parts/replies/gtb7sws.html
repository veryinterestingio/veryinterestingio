			<div class="markdown"><p>but for the type of work they do (clerical, administrative or customer service), they tend to be already well paid (at leas the DMV).  So it is not the employees, it is the employer making that decision.</p>
<p>Average DMV worker makes just shy of 50k for a job that they can get right out of HS (no training), and most of the workers are custumser service that are normally under 30k per year jobs.</p></div>		</li>
