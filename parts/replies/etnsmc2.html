			<div class="markdown"><p>Those black emissions from your candle are unburned hydrocarbons being released and polluting the air. Same as rolling coal in a diesel. Sorry to dissuade you with facts.</p>
<p>Today you learned, black smoke is unburned hydrocarbons as they are released into the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The components that make it up are water and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Because it is an imperfect reaction, you'll get some carbon monoxide and carbon too, so the only thing that will coat your walls is carbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife developed a passion for candle making about a year ago and was cranking them out like crazy. In addition to giving many away as gifts, she also loves keeping them lit in the house. When I upgraded my computer's GPU the other day, requiring me to open up my case for the first time in a long while, I noticed a thin black carbon film covering all of the internal components, particularly the fanblades. Some research online indicates that this is almost certainly the result of the candles perpetually burning in my office.</p></div>		</li>
