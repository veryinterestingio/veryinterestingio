<p>51, 225.1 Gm</p>
<p>52, 450.3 Gm</p>
<p>53, 900.7 Gm (and we have now passed Jupiter)</p>
<p>54, 1.80 Tm (terameters - 1000 Gm)</p>
<p>55, 3.60 Tm</p>
<p>56, 7.20 Tm (and we are now 2.2 Tm past Pluto)</p>
<p>57, 14.4 Tm</p>
<p>58, 28.8 Tm (and we are now further than the furthest a man made object has ever travelled from earth - the Voyager probe currently around 22 Tm from Earth)</p>
<p>59, 57.6 Tm</p>
<p>60, 115.2 Tm</p>
<p>61, 230.5 Tm</p>
<p>62, 461.1 Tm </p>
<p>63, 922.3 Tm</p>
<p>64, 1.84 Pm (petameters - 1000 Tm)</p>
<p>65, 3.68 Pm</p>
<p>66, 7.37 Pm</p>
<p>67, 14.7 Pm (our paper is now over a light year thick)</p>
<p>68, 29.5 Pm</p>
<p>69, 59.0 Pm (the distance to Alpha Centauri)</p>
<p>So in less than seventy folds of a piece of paper, it is now over 4.24 light years thick, and has reached the next closest star to the sun.</p>
<p>That is 4.011 *10^13 km</p>
<p>Or in base numbers 40,000,000,000,000 km</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't argue with the maths... If it takes 69 folds of a piece of copier paper to get to Alpha Centauri, then that's how many it takes...</p>
<p>70 folds would have you double the distance away which would just be absurd.</p></div>		</li>

When I was approaching the end of your first post I thought to myself “awe man, I wish they would keep going, this is fun to read” and then you came through like a champ. Spend your weekend knowing some random dumbass on the interwebs appreciates your posts!</p></div>		</li>

<p>You what now?</p>
<p>edit: I have literally never heard the phrase before. Where I'm from fag is a pejorative term. I'm genuinely curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possibly worth mentioning that in British English a fag is a cigarette.</p>
<p>Fag packet' maths is what you do when you are out on a building site and need to do a quick calculation and don't have any other paper to hand.</p>
<p>The American equivalent would probably be a napkin, but I don't think I have ever known British builders to be clean enough to have used a napkin...</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the other hand, I have done plenty of math on cigarette packs!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're on a building site, you just write on a piece of construction material that will get covered up anyway.  If you ever tear your house down to the studs or the floorboards, you'll likely find all sorts of things written.  Most frequent I've seen are phone numbers and simple calculations.  No need for a napkin, just write on the wood.  2'6&quot; + 3' + 7'9&quot;= 13'3&quot; or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say it didn't matter, but you do have to be able to cut it in half each time, and at some point, it can't be called paper anymore, so that actually is a relevant question.</p></div>		</li>
