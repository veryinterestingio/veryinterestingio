			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot the negative part of the AC wave, which in your analogy would be a hole on the ocean side which empties the tank everytime the wave goes back.</p>
<p>So you put a one way valve (diode or rectifier) so waves can only fill the tank but can't empty it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I considered only the half wave rectification. Using the analogy a full wave rectifier would actually transform the valley of the wave into another peak, doubling it frequency of filling. The half wave rectifier would not empty the water tank actually ðŸ˜Š.</p>
<p>Thanks for the remark!</p></div>		</li>
