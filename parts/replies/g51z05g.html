			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it all boils down how you define being German in the end. If you look at today's composition of all the inhabitants of Germany you are right. If you look at the composition of the people that consider themselves German it will be different. In the end it depends on the definition which shows you that it is a social construct.
I myself am only &quot;half&quot; German. Still I consider myself a German having lived there all my life. Others might disagree.</p></div>		</li>
