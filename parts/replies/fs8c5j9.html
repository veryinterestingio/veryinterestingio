			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question, do animals 'know' what eyes are, what they do, that they're the 'window of the soul' in that it's where most of us feel like our consciousness resides behind?</p>
<p>Why do they choose eyes to look at? Presumably it gives an advantage knowing what a potential predator can see, but does this display some sort of empathy, or ability to imagine the world from another individual perspective?</p>
<p>I guess it's not easy/straight up impossible to answer questions like these with creatures we can't ask questions to understand what's going on in their heads, but have there been any studies into this sort of thing regardless?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting point. I feel like if they have some form of individual intelligence they would. </p>
<p>You're entire life is from the perspective of the two spheres on your upper face, at face value (pun intended) I think most animals are aware that the head is the &quot;control room&quot; of other creatures.</p>
<p>A disproportionate amount of animals in a fight/flight situation respond by rapid scratching to the head/face aswell.</p>
<p>It's all speculation of course, but very cool to ponder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am guessing they know the head is the control room of other creatures (and themselves) mostly because instincts, for example even we as kids when thirsty go and drink water, even without anybody teaching us that the incomodity we felt was due the need of drinking water.
Even if they don't know what those spheres do, their organism do and they have that info in their dna, that the head and limbs are important and that maintaining eye contact is a sing of weakness that is used either to make valuable connections with others of their species or to search for empathy.
Of course we don't know (or at least I don't) if they understand more about that than what we guess.</p></div>		</li>
