<p>By analyzing the interplay between these forces, a team of biologists led by George Koch of Northern Arizona University calculated the theoretical maximum tree height, or the point at which opposing forces balance out and a tree stops growing. This point lies somewhere between 400 and 426 feet (122 and 130 m).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's what I found, but I didn't get into context so I don't know if it applies to all trees or just one type in particular.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extremely difficult. </p>
<p>The more the tree grows, the more minerals and water the tree requires from the soil. It would need a giant root system to keep up with “overgrowth”. </p>
<p>Aside from that, trees’ “stem cells” (= meristem) tend to stop dividing at some point so the “acquire-consume” balance does not break. If we make them divide over their limit, the external parts of the tree would starve and die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Maximum lifespan&quot; is probably not the right way to think about sequioas (or many other plants and some animals, for that matter).  For humans, we have a sort of general concept of &quot;maximum lifespan&quot; based on our innate physiology.  Our cells can generally only divide a certain amount of time, out health declines with age, and our odds of dying increase as we get older.  Even if you keep people from dying of this or that specific cause, you don't expect them to live indefinitely.</p>
<p>But with many plants, there's not a clear reason to expect this.  They don't always lose vigor with age.  Their cells don't have specific limited numbers of times they can divide.  Their odds of dying are not related to how old they are.   </p>
<p>And many kinds of plants reproduce vegetatively.  Giant sequoias don't naturally, but redwoods do.  As do many other types of plants.  From the point of view of these clones, they are still in a real sense just a continuous outgrowth of the parent plant...and they can be tends of thousands of years old.  Pando, a famous quaking aspen clone, is 80,000 years old.  Some seagrass clonal groups are thought to be 100,000 years old.  Such things don't have a preset maximum lifespan, they live however long they live.  </p>
<p>Giant sequoias are, in practice, limited in their lifespan because they don't spread via cuttings and the original trunk can't live forever due to structural reasons.  But there's no particular reason to expect there's any sort of innate limit on how long its tissues could live, or how long you could propagate it if you took a cutting, rooted it, and started a new trunk.</p></div>		</li>
