			<div class="markdown"><p>The airboat tours in the Everglades seem to have little effect on alligators themselves, and they definitely spur interest in the unique ecosystem and the animals that live there. Some airboat tours feed the alligators to encourage them to come close to the boats, which is obviously bad for alligators because then they associate people/boats with food and that can lead to more negative alligator-human interactions. Airboat tours/airboats in general also carve up the landscape, creating trails throughout the sawgrass that have changes on the hydrology of the system (although I’m not an expert on that). Overall though, the airboat tours that don’t feed the alligators and stay on previously established trails have little effect on the alligators.
I’m not sure about fights between alligators and crocodiles in the Everglades and South Florida…from what I’ve seen the two species just coexist. This is not to say that they do not cross paths with one another, because they do, but they tend to prefer slightly different habitats—alligators prefer freshwater and crocodiles prefer saltwater (although alligators will venture into saltwater to forage). I can tell you for sure that they do not mate with one another and I would highly doubt they would even attempt that.</p></div>		</li>
