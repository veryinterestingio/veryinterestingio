			<div class="markdown"><p>It is so disappointing &amp; aggravating to me that anyone would not like a higher frame rate, if all the other factors were taken care of.  I think people are just unfamiliar with it, plus it wound up being <em>associated</em> with the cheap look by soap operas, so they reject it mindlessly.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This rejection is mostly down to conditioning. Around the 1930's it was basically unanimously decided that something like 24FPS was to be the standard for shooting movies. There were two main reasons for this. First, it was to keep filming costs low. Higher framerates were achievable even back then, but they were not used because film was expensive. Why devote 60 frames for a single second of footage when you can get away with 24 and it still looks great? </p>
<p>Secondly, the invention of the Vitaphone process. Basically, the audio for the movie would be recorded simultaneously onto a record. And then that record would be played back alongside the film projector. A standard 41cm record playing at ​33 1⁄3RPM was slow enough to perfectly synchronize with exactly 24FPS. This made filming and capturing audio much easier to manage. These were already pre-existing audio standards as well, so not much had to change about that technology to implement it. It was a perfect solution. </p>
<p>So for decades, 24 for film was the standard. And for the most part, it still is. Even if other factors are accounted for it's important to note that higher framerates for movies are generally frowned upon (see: The Hobbit). I think this is just because we're all so used to it, that anything higher just feels very strange. It's not because people see it and associate it with &quot;cheap soap operas&quot;, it's because it just looks wrong. What I find strange is how this doesn't translate at all to video games. I can see a very noticeable difference between 30fps and 60fps in video game, and 60fps is something I always prefer. It just seems very odd to me that when it comes to movies and TV, I prefer a much lower framerate, while with games, higher is always preferred.  </p>
<p>E:<br />
I suppose the difference with video game framerates is because both video games and movies/TV have different expectations. You go and watch a movie, you know what kind of &quot;feel&quot; to expect from it. It's already been established that it's probably going to be 24FPS. You expect it to be 24FPS. You know what it should look like. But with a video game, lower framerates are attributed to crappy hardware. Even when I was a kid and I hadn't played very many video games, when I saw frames skipping and the whole game felt choppy because I was getting 15FPS, I knew something was wrong. It felt broken and unplayable. I guess that's because a video game is something you're directly interacting with, while a movie is something you are just sitting back and watching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for all the info!   That was educational. </p>
<p>The “generally frowned upon” part is what is so frustrating to me.  <em>I’m</em> being deprived of superior cinematic experiences because it’s <em>unfamiliar</em> to other people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher frame rate looks unnatural because your eyeballs see motion blur.  Wave your hand in front of your face.... it blurs.  fast movement without a blur (high frame rate) seems unnatural because you spend your entire life experiencing motion blur.  Taking that away is jarring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fast moving objects on screen are still blurred by our eyes, regardless of frame rate. When you wave your hands in front of your face, they’re blurry, despite the universe being near-infinity frames per second, not 24.</p>
<p>The reason it’s blurry is a phenomenon known as “persistence of vision” and it has an effect on everything we see. Screens don’t magically bypass that. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing unnatural about high frame rates, quite the opposite. Watch a youtube video of someone doing something live on camera... high FPS looks great. Game shows and other &quot;unscripted&quot; TV shows would probably also benefit from a &quot;live&quot; look.</p>
<p>The problem is reality can often be jarring when you want a cinematic experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it had to do with video compression. High frame rate digital stuff tends to look like the moving objects in a frame are sort of cut out/have a weird outline when I look at them compared to the background. But not all high frame rate video looks like that to me.</p></div>		</li>

&quot;It must look (and be shot) like shit so that when the commercials come they look amazing and they don't change the channel&quot; xD
he then pressures the newcomer ex-live-theater skilled actor to act worse to match the level of the other terrible actors x)</p></div>		</li>
