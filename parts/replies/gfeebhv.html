			<div class="markdown"><p>You're describing a field of view phenomenon which isn't anything to do with visibility in fog.</p>
<p>Fog reduces your visibility because individual particles are reflecting light. If you put your hand in front of your face, you can still see your hand because there's only a few fog particles between your hand and your eyes. When you try to look at something very far away in the fog, there are so many particles relecting the light that none of the light from that object gets to you so you can't see it.</p>
<p>When the fog is ahead of you, you are looking through a lot of fog particles; it looks impenetrable. When you are in the fog, you are looking through less of it at objects near by you, so you can see better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it seems like the answer to this is basically &quot;because when you're in the fog, there's less fog in front of you&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect that the one way glass effect contributes.  When you are outside a fog bank, you're often in sunlight, while it's dark in the fog.  This means that the reflected light overwhelms the light coming out of the fog bank much more quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does but they're keeping it simple.  Instead of blinds, we have water droplets of tiny size suspended in air and up close you can see things through them, but get back a ways and there are more of them between you and the object you are trying to view.  I feel like I understood them.</p></div>		</li>
