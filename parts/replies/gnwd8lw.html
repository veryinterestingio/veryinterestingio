			<div class="markdown"><p>The public alerts via WEA (<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/wireless-emergency-alerts-wea" target="_blank">Wireless Emergency Alert Systems)</a> are not including a countdown to when shaking is expected to arrive. There are a variety of reasons for this including uncertainty in in the travel time of earthquake waves through the rock between you and the earthquake and the fact that even the early &quot;P&quot; wave that triggers the system can be damaging when close in to a large earthquake.</p>
<p>Technical users and licenced app developers can incorporate countdowns that are calculated assuming a average travel time for the &quot;S&quot; waves that are usually the first arriving damaging waves and your distance from the origin or &quot;hypocenter&quot; of the earthquake. The <a href="https://earlywarninglabs.com/mobile-app/" target="_blank">&quot;quake alert usa app&quot;</a> does provide a countdown to subscribers.</p>
