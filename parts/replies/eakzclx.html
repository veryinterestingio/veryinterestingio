			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently although hammerheads' eyes are quite sideways facing, they have  &quot;have outstanding forward stereo vision and depth perception&quot;, according to this article I just found: <a href="https://www.livescience.com/5921-hammerhead-sharks-360-degrees-stereo.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.livescience.com/5921-hammerhead-sharks-360-degrees-stereo.html" target="_blank">https://www.livescience.com/5921-hammerhead-sharks-360-degrees-stereo.html</a></a> </p>
<p>I was just imagining that more of a gap between eyes increases the parallax effect (and therefore depth perception), and this article seems to provide evidence for it. It seems that hammerheads have &quot;the best of both worlds&quot; when it comes to field of view, and depth perception...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like moving in opposite directions would be conducive to maintaining the same sized visual field. If you imagine their field of view as a hemisphere that rotates with the axis pointing in the edge of the direction they're looking, as one edge pulls back the other would move forward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have been clearer, they move <em>independently,</em> not necessarily in opposite directions to each other. The question is how does the chameleon perceive these two separate visual inputs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>chameleons actually binocularly fixate targets when they are hunting; but when they are 'looking around', the eyes fixate independently. they might have different visual modes, or maybe they have a single fused visual field like ours but are able to tolerate or use 'confused' (diplopic) images better than humans (we aren't good at it at all - the eyes compete and suppress one another in diplopic situations - maybe chameleons don't have strong interocular suppression? i don't think anyone knows..).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I sense though that we are capable of turning off this suppression at the cost of singular focus... I.e. when you space out you can definitely let in a peripheral panorama. Surely in the same way chameleons have evolved physically, they have also developed the ability to independently process sensory input from both eyes. Maybe even clearer than ours. Stereoscopic vision has a lot of drawbacks— focusing takes time and is a sensitive operation, and out of focus fields create a lot of distortion (double vision).</p>
<p>Another question I’ve always had: before humans had a cogent understanding of quantity and conservation, how did we perceive depth? Was it just more approximate? Dogs very clearly use frames of reference to gage distance (anybody who owns a dog knows that it works until it hilariously doesn’t). I assume early humans were subject to a similar rate of error as our brains developed the ability to process depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And they’re completely independent of each other. I’m no expert but I assume they would not get a full picture like a human would, unless both eyes are looking at the same thing. The reason we see one image is because our sight line overlaps, looking opposite or different directions would allow the same FOV. Still wanna know how exactly it would look in their minds</p></div>		</li>
