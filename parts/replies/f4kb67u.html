			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a doctor or scientist, but from what I’ve read, caffeine doesn’t cause anxious thoughts (so it doesn’t cause anxiety), but affects your body in much the same way as anxiety: increased heart rate, shaky hands, more alert, etc. If you are already anxious, it can make you more aware of your anxiety (e.g., noticing your increased heart rate, which is due to both caffeine and anxiety), which can then make your anxiety worse. </p>
<p>If I’m going into a situation where I might be anxious, I go without caffeine. I want to be able to ignore my anxiety, and caffeine makes that tough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have general anxiety but do get it during most social events. I'm starting to wonder if coffee is making things worse. I'm always tired I tend to have a strong coffee prior to any meet up in the hope that it'll give me more energy to socialise, but after a bad experience yesterday I'm starting to think that maybe coffee is making things worse. Fatigue and anxiety is a tricky combo though, treating one always makes the other worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look into taurine supplements as a possible work around.  It's a nonessential amino acid that helps with nitrogen exchange at a cellular level and gets rid of jitters and a lot of anxiety.</p>
<p>That's the real reason it's in energy drinks</p>
<p>Great for muscle recover after hitting the gym too</p></div>		</li>
