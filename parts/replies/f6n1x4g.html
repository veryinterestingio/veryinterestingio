			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re not wrong, but also not exactly right either. Most legitimate zoos and aquariums exist to harbor animals that cannot adequately care for themselves in the wild due to disability or having been born in captivity. </p>
<p>The real answer should be sanctuaries instead of zoos though. They provide enrichment in a safe environment approximating natural habitats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny part is that you mention medicating them to deal with their &quot;enslavement&quot;, but, really, &quot;pampering&quot; is probably a better term.</p>
<p>You would think that removing all stressors from an animal's life, like needing to hunt for food, would make their life easier, but it ends up that animals have evolved to expect a certain amount of difficulty in their lives.  Some animals would get stressed out by not having food, but it turns out that the ones that <em>wouldn't</em> are more likely to be stressed out by an <em>easy</em> access to food.</p>
<p>An animal in a zoo is like being born a trust fund billionaire.  Sure, some of them will be perfectly happy, but others of them will be bored out of their minds and act out on that.  You could release the animals, but then you'd be causing a lot of stress to the animals that were perfectly fine.</p>
<p>So, since happy animals tend to be a major priority for most well run zoos, animal enrichment is a big deal.  The zoos won't feed the animals any less, but they will attempt to make it more interesting for them.</p>
<p>I can't say the same thing for a lot of billionaires' kids...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a “dancing” animal in a zoo hit the front page. Everyone thought it was cute and that it was dancing along with the person, when it was really dealing with zoochosis. Really sad how me put animals in captivity with absolutely nothing to do.</p></div>		</li>
