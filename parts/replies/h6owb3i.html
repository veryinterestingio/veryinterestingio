<p>At home I don't need to care if someone next to me wants to use the bathroom, I don't need to care about making noise, taking off my clothes. My eye doesn't have to be watching my valuables.</p>
<p>This is the problem with planes and buses. Over the 7 hours of flight, you are CONSTANTLY moving as if your head is on a swivel. &quot;Does this guy have to move?&quot; , &quot;Is that kid going to shut up?&quot;. </p>
<p>First class on planes is severely underrated.</p></div>		</li>
