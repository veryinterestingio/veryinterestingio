			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he may have wanted to know the origin of the money itself, rather than the authority over how it is spent.</p>
<p>The money itself comes from two basic sources.  Taxes and borrowing.  Taxes, of course, comes from all manner of activity - corporate earning, individual income, tariffs on imports, duty on exports, etc..</p>
<p>Borrowing comes from one source - government bonds.  Anybody can buy government bonds, but the vast majority is bought up by sovereign nations, banks and hedge funds.  For instance, in 2015, the Federal Reserve Bank held about $2.5 trillion dollars in federal bonds.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank (also called &quot;The Fed&quot;) is not a part of the U.S. government.  It has a special place in our system.  Other banks and families own shares like on the stock exchange, but those shares are not publicly traded, and you need special permission to own any of those shares.  When Chase bank, for instance, bought out JP Morgan bank, they had to get special permission from the other FED owners to obtain JP Morgan's shares.  </p>
<p>And most of these FED owning banks and funds are owned by various other banks, funds, and individuals.  At this point, you can equate the sale of bonds with borrowing money.  There's not much functional difference between the two.  So this pyramid is formed with the government at the top, borrowing money from a few sources, who are owned by a lot of sources, who are owned by a lot of people.</p>
<p>The FED, on the other hand, holds another very special place in our system.   They are the only bank authorized to create money from nothing.  From their perspective, they are the ones who produce money, and then sells it on the open market.  From the perspective of the rest of us, they print money and buys stuff with it - like bonds.</p></div>		</li>
