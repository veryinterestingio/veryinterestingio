			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true, but a little misleading I think. The problem is not just that industrialized factory farms are horrible for the environment--it's that raising cattle requires a huge amount of space, water, and food. Factory farms are actually more efficient in this respect then organic ones because they use fewer resources per cow (of course, this comes at the expense of the cattle living in deplorable conditions). So even if we got rid of industrialized factory farms, we would still have a huge problem because cattle farming takes up a huge amount of resources, and would take up even more if we only used organic, free range farms. This is a real and present problem--a lot of the land being cleared in the amazon, for example, is being cleared by cattle ranchers. So we can't just get rid of factory farms--it just seems true that consuming meat as we currently do (no matter how it's farmed) is completely unsustainable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, cattle country (central MO) chiming in here to clarify something about land use and pollution specifically. When we talk about land used for raising cattle, specifically on the smaller end of the production scale (think family farms, 25-200 head) it tends to be discussed in a way that suggests that land used for raising cattle is exclusively good for that, the same way that a shopping mall that takes up 50 acres is used only for the shopping mall. </p>
<p>The truth is more complicated than that. Most small-scale cattle grazing operations are probably about 60/40 cleared land and natural land. Pasture not being actively grazed is amazing habitat for local wildlife, as is the wooded portion of a farm property. Feed lot/sorting lot/ operations areas notwithstanding, the bulk of acreage a 100-1000 acre cattle farm takes up is actually mixed use. Cattle coexist quite well with the natural environment if a farm is managed well, and these operators have a vested interest in managing it well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact still stands that cattle take in <em>way</em> more water and food than they provide humans that consume them.</p>
<p>Excuse my ignorance, but how much of the US beef production is from family farms? Even though those farms might be beneficial for the local wildlife, they are still more damaging to the Earth than plants grown for human consumption. Notwithstanding other places in the world that dont have restrictions or regulation. </p>
<p>Raising beef is proven to be expensive, wasteful, and detrimental compared to plant based food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to counter this point. It is actually spot on but there exist a very small portion of small-scale farms that do work out very sustainably. When you operate at small sizes you don't need to push the limits of productivity. And with that you can do away with pesticides, hormones, and fertilizers. I'm using my parents farm as an example.</p>
<p>Most of the cattle food is grown on the land. Pasture land cannot be used to grow crops but cattle can graze all day long. That's a highly efficient use of that particular type of land which is prominent in Canada. Additionally, our poop does go back on the land to fertilize the crops we sow.</p>
<p>Yes we still need fuel for the tractor and various equipment but my dad manufacturers his own biodiesel using waste products from the animals produced (fat). Only works in the summer due to its higher freezing point but it's a sustainable energy source.</p>
<p>On top of all that it's just us and a hired farm hand that are able to still fulfill all the duties of the farm, provide adequate living conditions for all the animals and provide special care when needed, and feed the local community which means less food miles.</p>
<p>I'm saying it because my dad preaches it so much. There is room for more sustainable farming if people wanted to do it. It is a lot of work but the opportunity is always there if someone wants to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some things that could be done to clean up the process, but, in the end, that's kinda like claiming there's such a thing as &quot;clean coal&quot;.  The process of raising beef on this scale can DEFINITELY be made less bad, but I don't know that it can be made good.  Kinda splitting hairs, there.  But I think it's a hair worth splitting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many chemical fertilisers are safer than &quot;organic&quot; ones. Home fertilisers for &quot;organic&quot; gardeners are far worse than anything used on a conventional farm, particularly as there are many restrictions for using them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would they be better? They're still made up of the same molecules as many other fertilisers, and often more toxic, such as many manures as the NPK ratios are impossible to properly control, whereas a synthetic one allows us to completely control the ratio we need.</p>
<p>Here is a good starting point: <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6cd5/meta#erlaa6cd5s4" target="_blank">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6cd5/meta#erlaa6cd5s4</a></p>
<p>This also has records of previous farming seasons, showing that organic fertilizers generate more run off:

<p>The entire organic vs conventional &quot;debate&quot; is garbage made up by obnoxious hippies who don't actually study relevant parts of hydrology, biology, or soil sciences. Some &quot;prime organic&quot; methods are already used in most farms, they weren't invented nor coined by &quot;organic farmers.&quot; Manure can be used to avoid fertiliser costs, but it also has the downside of far less control over synthetic ones, and has additional run off and nitrogen loss. Virtually no nitrogen remains in pretty much ANY fertiliser after about 30 days, as it's a volatile molecule in most forms.</p>
<p>The biggest downside of &quot;specifically organic&quot; farming is organic pesticides, almost all of which are far more dangerous for non-targeted organisms than synthetics. Copper-based ones are particularly bad.</p>
<p>TL;DR organic fertiliser is mostly wasteful and contributes far more nitrogen waste than synthetic, organic vs conventional doesn't really exist except in the heads of people trying to make money off of laypeople who didn't study relevant fields of science, and most viable &quot;organic&quot; practices are already used in conventional farming. The advent of genetic manipulation and precision agriculture allows us to farm better now than ever before, further reducing waste.</p></div>		</li>
