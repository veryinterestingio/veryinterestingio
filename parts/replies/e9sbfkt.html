<p>It's not good to breathe in fumes from these things, unless an area is properly ventilated, it really isn't good for broad usage.</p>
<p>Hand sanitizing, sure.  Lots of surface area where it evaporates quickly, not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify: Endospores are bacteria that form said spores to survive extreme conditions. They are dehydrated capsules of very thick walls and DNA, and a few maintenance proteins. Little more. Once the spore finds a suitable environment to grow, it sprouts back into a bacteria. If you want to read up: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endospore" target="_blank">Wiki page for them</a>. The scariest example of Endospores is Bacillus anthracis, also known as Anthrax. It's more common cousin, B. cereus, is responsible for ~5% of food poisoning around the world.</p>
<p>In the case of a spillage of spore formers, they use 10% Bleach to clean surfaces. The bleach needs to be in contact with the spores for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>To sterilize tools, they use Autoclaves. Autoclaves heat things up to 121 degrees Celsius for 15-20 minutes, using Superheated Steam. Endospores can survive for hours in 100 degrees Celsius.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the healthcare setting Alcohol is most certainly NOT the preferred surface disinfectant for fomites.   Alcohol has limited use in hand hygiene and skin disinfection, but is ineffective for small unenveloped viruses and endospore forming bacteria.  Most skin disinfection for large incisions uses CGH , alcohol may be used for minor procedures ie injections bur for open surgery you need something better.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For surface disinfection the CDC (2003 guidelines) recommends that alcohol is not used for disinfection of floors and large surface areas due to the risk of explosion and fire.  Seriously if you use alcohol to disinfect a large surface area you are going to have a really big bang.</p>
<p>In terms of disinfection alcohol is good against bacteria (both gram negative and gram positive) large enveloped viruses, and mycobacteria.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Alcohol is not good against endospore forming bacteria, small unenveloped viruses, and fungal spores.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the biggest problem however is the rapid evaporation rate, alcohol on a surface evaporates rapidly, often so fast that the disinfectant has evaporated before the required contact time to disinfect has been attained.  In English: it dries too quickly.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the US almost no hospitals use alcohol alone for surface disinfection, there are products that use a blend of alcohol and quaternary ammonium compounds often in ready to use wipes.  One of the challenges of these products is the damage they do to plastics and vinyl.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember that it's a continuous process.</p>
<p>The reason why 70% evaporates slower overall is because even if all the alcohol evaporates off very quickly, what you're left with is the 30% that was water.</p>
<p>In other words, 99% rapidly goes away; 70% rapidly becomes &lt;20%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.</p>
<p>the reason for using water is that isopropyl alcohol, in and of itself, it not effective as a surface disinfectant.</p>
<p>Isopropyl alcohol NEEDS H2O in order to facilitate the reaction called &quot;hydrolysis&quot;, whereby water is used to cleave larger molecules into smaller parts, thus breaking apart 'things'.</p>
<p>70% isopropyl alcohol is considerably better as a disinfectant than 90%, specifically because 90% makes the lack of water a bottleneck [rate limiter] to the hydrolysis reaction</p>
<p>70% is actually the ideal ratio of isopropyl alcohol to water to facilitate surface disinfection</p>
<p>90% is better just as a solvent, and if you want some concentrate to water down later, or people who just don't know any better (= a lot of people)</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>for the doubters</p>
<p>Overview.
In the healthcare setting, “alcohol” refers to two water-soluble chemical compounds—ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol—that have generally underrated germicidal characteristics 482. FDA has not cleared any liquid chemical sterilant or high-level disinfectant with alcohol as the main active ingredient. These alcohols are rapidly bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic against vegetative forms of bacteria; they also are tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and virucidal but do not destroy bacterial spores. Their cidal activity drops sharply when diluted below 50% concentration, and the optimum bactericidal concentration is 60%–90% solutions in water (volume/volume) 483, 484.</p>
<p>Mode of Action.
<strong>The most feasible explanation for the antimicrobial action of alcohol is denaturation of proteins.</strong> This mechanism is supported by the observation that absolute <strong>ethyl alcohol, a dehydrating agent, is less bactericidal than mixtures of alcohol and water because proteins are denatured more quickly in the presence of water</strong> 484, 485. Protein denaturation also is consistent with observations that alcohol destroys the dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli 486, and that ethyl alcohol increases the lag phase of Enterobacter aerogenes 487 and that the lag phase effect could be reversed by adding certain amino acids. The bacteriostatic action was believed caused by inhibition of the production of metabolites essential for rapid cell division.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Define rapid....</p>
<p>Many ready to use disinfecting wipes have between 35 and 60 percent alcohol, they have a required 2 to 3 min contact time to produce disinfection.  Most evaporate in 20 to 40 seconds, disinfection is not attained.</p>
<p>For rubbing alcohol to attain disinfection you typically need at least 30 seconds of contact time and most evaporate before attaining 30 seconds unless you flood the area.  the higher the alcohol content the faster it evaporates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So actual question regarding bacteria disinfection. Using 70%, 91% etc to clean out my glass pipe with hot water &gt; 140F (60c), since this cleaning procedure leaves no smells, residue, stains etc behind, is this safe to say that I've killed a majority of the bacteria inside the glass pipe (my bong)? Just because it appears sparkling clean after it's all done, doesn't mean I took care of the left over bacteria. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat kills bacteria, 60 C is a slow pasteurization it takes about 30 to 40 min at that temperature, at 70 C the kill is much faster 2 to 3 min and more complete, as long as your pipe is glass it will withstand that temperature.  If you want truly sterile then 120 C for 30 min will give you medical grade sterile and no cuties in the bong.</p>
<p>Bacteria may not be your biggest issue, viruses and espeacilly respiratory viruses are going to be a bigger challenge.  The easy to kill large enveloped viruses (HIV, HBV, HBC, Influenza) will succumb to the same heat and alcohol as the bacteria, small unenveloped viruses (Norovirus, Coxsackie virus, HAV) will survive the alcohol and need at least 3 min at 70 C to deactivate.  </p>
<p>You are correct that sparkle does not equal sanitary but if it is not clean you can not disinfect.  An alternate would of course be not to share your bong with anyone, but that is probably not fun.</p></div>		</li>
