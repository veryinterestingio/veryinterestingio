			<div class="markdown"><p>As a follow-up, why are antibody titers used to check vaccination status on other viral diseases? I know someone who has had antibody titers as part of an employment screen (they work in healthcare). I think they were specifically checked for antibodies to one of the hepatitis viruses.</p>
<p>Do some antibodies keep being produced? If so, what separates those antibodies from the ones that stop until an infection is about to happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, it's easier to do a quick titer blood test to check new hires for immunity rather than having them track down their vaccination records (which are most likely not all in the same place). And some people have actually had the disease rather than the vaccine (mostly just chickenpox these days).</p>
<p>If you're not exposed to the antigen, over time you body will stop producing antibodies because it's a waste of resources and energy to make antibodies you don't need at the time. The rate that it fades depends on the person and the disease.</p>
<p>Titers allow us to know how much antibody levels have dropped over time. Hepatitis B titers are commonly tested for in healthcare workers, and it's very common that that titer to have waned. Take me for example. I got four Hep B vaccine doses by the time I was 5. When I started working in healthcare at 23, my titer was nearly zero. I got 3 more doses, and about 6 months later, my titer was over 300 (for reference, the positive cutoff is 12). Now, three years later, I got it checked again, and I'm back down to 19. Obviously my immune system would respond quickly if I were to be exposed to the actual disease since it will remember seeing it before, but it's not working to produce excess antibodies when the antigen isn't present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, some antibodies keep getting produced. I'll try to keep this simple. So there are two main classes of antibodies: IgG and IgM. IgM antibodies are larger and better at targeting an active infection as they can bind to multiple targets at once. Your body only makes these when it recognizes an active threat. IgG antibodies can stick around longer, sometimes indefinitely. Think of them as the scouts. They are much smaller, target specific proteins or parts of a virus or bacteria, and serve mainly to be an alert system. When they find a virus or bacterium to stick to, they act as a tag for the body to recognize the presence of the threat and rev up the immune response. But they only stick to what they were designed to detect. So they recognize repeat intruders, things you've been exposed to before. </p>
<p>The main problem is that only <em>some</em> viruses cause antibodies that stick around long term. In general, your body is really good at recognizing threats and neutralizing them. So it doesn't need specific antibodies to every single virus or germ that you ever come across. Ain't nobody got time for that. So it only keeps significant numbers of IgG (scouting) antibodies around for more serious threats. I don't know if we have any idea why it chooses some viruses as dangerous enough and not others, that is above my pay grade ;) but basically if something is a serious threat then it may keep some IgG around just in case. Hence why sometimes we can check for immunity by checking for IgG antibodies. Hepatitis in particular is often screened for with antibody titers because we can tell what stage of infection or remission or recovery the patient is in by looking at the number of IgG vs IgM antibodies present.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the main reason we cannot screen for everything like this (including covid) is that we need enough data to understand whether this is an infection that causes long-term antibodies, how long after exposure we can find those antibodies (6 months? Lifetime?), and whether or not the presence of antibodies indicates immunity (is IgG amount enough to prevent infection completely or just make infection less serious). How much antibody is needed to prevent infection? Is any amount ok? If someone is immune now are they always protected? We know these answers for some viruses like HepB that have been researched extensively for a long time but we don't know it for everything. It's not the same with every virus so <strong>even if we can find the antibodies present, we don't yet know what they mean.</strong> </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the antibodies that are produced during initial inoculation are “stored” in memory B cells within the germinal centers of the lymphoid tissues. Their role is to store these antibodies long term until they encounter an antigen again and kick on antibody production to acutely fight re-infection. </p>
<p>There will always be some leaky antibody presence in the sera from these memory B cells for something you’ve either encountered or been immunized against. Very sensitive antibody tests can determine whether someone has received vaccination, which is often a requirement for employment in the healthcare industry.</p>
<p>However, this is different from neutralizing titres, which is difficult to deduce what level of titre you would need to remain immune, especially as more time elapses from the time of inoculation.</p></div>		</li>
