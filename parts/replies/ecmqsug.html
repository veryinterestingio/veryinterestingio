<p>There are two such values, and we label one <em>i</em> and the other -<em>i</em>. It doesn't matter which; they are perfectly interchangeable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically imaginary numbers do exist they are just located above the standard number line. in reality the number line is more like a number field that occupies a 2d grid.</p>

<p>This is very misleading, you're basically just pushing the problem into the next dimension. The more correct albeit less &quot;satisfying&quot; answer is that you can define a number system to have as many dimensions as you like, real numbers happen to occupy 1, Complex happen to occupy 2, you could make up any way to define them in any higher dimensions, some of the ones that happened to be useful we just gave names. notable examples are the ones that live in 1,2,4 and 8 dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fundamentally the issue with 0, independent of dimensions is that a/b = c should be the same as a = c*b (a,b,c can be any dimensionality) people like having division being the opposite of multiplication</p>
<p>If we decide to allow division by 0, that makes b zero so a = c*0 </p>
<p>now many people like the rule that anything times zero should be 0, which makes a zero so 0 = 0*c</p>
<p>Now if you recall, c was the answer to the original multidimensional equation so since anything times zero is zero, we still don't know what c should be since no matter what c is the equation 0=0*c is true</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of a rectangular map as the 2d number plane, where your value is given by the distance and direction from the center point of the sheet. The further east you move, the more positive your value gets, at a rate of 1 value point per mile. North gives you imaginary number i ppm, west gives you -1 ppm, and south gives you -i ppm. If you started at value 2 (2 miles east of center) then multiplying my i “rotates” the map so you stand 2 miles north of center at value 2i. A second multiplication gives you -2, which checks out cause you would be 2 miles west of center. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eli5 but from the other direction: mathematical concepts like “imaginary numbers” are super important when it comes waveforms and things that rotate, and imaginary numbers are a key ingredient in making math easier for those waveforms and rotating things.  The whole “square root of -1” and “rotating the number line” thing are key features in making imaginary numbers applicable to waves and rotations.</p>
<p>“Dividing by zero” has no useful (and direct) applications without first adding other concepts; dividing by zero is thus undefined (without first knowing more information)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The square root of negative one is fine because it's like finding a whole new shape and color of Legos to build with. Division by zero is less fine because it's a Lincoln Log, so you need to do a lot of work to get the Lego pieces you had to fit together with the Log.</p>
<p>It boils down to defining a value and checking if that value can cause logical inconsistencies. It turns out that the square root of negative one extends our number system without much fuss while division by zero brings in issues of infinity.</p></div>		</li>
