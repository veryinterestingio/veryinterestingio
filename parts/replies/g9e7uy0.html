			<div class="markdown"><p>Appreciate the link especially. We have a (retiring) faculty member who talks a heavy game over pronunciation, notably for the <em>posadasii</em> species, but I wasn't convinced even he was pronouncing it correctly because he tends to ignore ethnic pronunciations. I'd have expected if I were to have something named after me there'd be an attempt to pronounce my surname at least somewhat naturally followed by &quot;i&quot;, but it sounds like there may be no truly correct way.</p></div>		</li>
