			<div class="markdown"><p>For a really cool example of the thermal conductivity and &quot;feeling&quot; of hot taken to the extreme, check out this video of an engineer demonstrating the properties of the thermal tiles used on the Space Shuttle:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9Yax8UNoM" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9Yax8UNoM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9Yax8UNoM</a></a>.</p>
<p>Heat won't flow from Low temperature to High temperature by definition, but the rate at which it flows from High to Low can certainly vary considerably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite science videos out there, and it's been around for many years. I always find myself asking if I would ever have the guts to pick that glowing tile up, even knowing full well it's safe if grabbed properly on the edges. It just goes completely against the brains basic instinct to reach out and put your hand on something that is obviously very hot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why touching an object made of metal feels a lot colder than touching something made of wood or most plastics, even when theyâ€™re all present in the same room at the same temperature. The metallic object conducts the heat out of your hand more efficiently than the wooden or plastic object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat capacity and heat conductivity are different though, right? They're undoubtedly related, and very similar, but a little different. </p>
<p>One is how quickly something transfers heat, the other is how much heat is required to change the objects temperature. </p>
<p>Aluminum happens to have both a low heat capacity and a high thermal conductivity. So the total amount of heat released as it cools is low, <em>and</em> it gives off that heat very quickly, meaning it's lost a lot before you even have time to grab it. </p>
<p>Once the oven door opens, it's already cooling down and losing heat the the fresh room air you've introduced. But if you could some how grab it at that instant, if you were the first thing it lost that heat to instead of the air, it'd burn you a bit. Not that bad but it wouldn't feel good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true for simple heat transfer by conduction, fluid mixing, and radiation.</p>
<p>I don't think it's true for other things we sometimes describe colloquially as &quot;heating&quot;, though.</p>
<ul>
<li>Electromagnetic fields.  Magnetic induction can be used to heat things progressively hotter without regard for the temperature of the source emitter.  Similarly, you can concentrate a bunch of lasers on a spot to heat it up above the temperature of the source emitters.</li>
<li>Stored energy.  Chemical changes (eg a bonfire) often produce higher temperature than thermal trigger (eg a match flame).  Similarly, nuclear chain reactions often output more heat than you subject them to in order to initiate them.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's true for <em>heat</em> transfer generally, as opposed to the transfer of other kinds of energy.</p>
<p>The examples you list are examples of energy transfer/release through mechanisms other than heat transfer, so of course they're not bound by temperature: temperature is the driving force for <em>heat</em> transfer, but of course energy transfer can be via other means.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's making very good points explaining how temperature is different from heat and all that good stuff, and here I come along and gum up the works by mentioning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_temperature" target="_blank">negative temperature</a>. Negative temperatures cause energy to move into something with a positive temperature, regardless of how hot that positive temperature is.</p></div>		</li>
