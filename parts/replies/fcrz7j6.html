			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a noticeable difference looking into an aluminum vs. silver coated mirror?</p>
<p>EDIT: I just googled and found this tidbit, so thought I'd add it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at the slopes of the lines from 400 nm to 700 nm - silver varies from 80% to 95% reflectance, while aluminum stays between 90% and 93%. So yes, a primarily red image will be slightly dimmer in aluminum than in silver, but all images are slightly reddened (the blues are suppressed more heavily than the reds) in silver, whereas aluminum gives a more faithful representation of the colors. (Plus primarily blue images will actually be darker in a silver mirror than an aluminum mirror.) For everyday use, it's easy to compensate for a darker image (just light up the room more), but not so easy to compensate for an image that has the wrong colors.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a broad spectrum dielectric mirror, you'd see an image that might be higher quality, though you'd struggle to see any visible difference in brightness.</p>
<p>With a narrowband mirror - one that reflects only a limited range of wavelengths - it would look similar to looking at yourself through a colour filter.</p></div>		</li>
