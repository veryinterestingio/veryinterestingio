			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally a correct answer. When other people tried to give an answer, they use examples like Koch Snowflake. But indeed there are fractals that have 0 length, for example Cantor's set. Fractals are usually defined as subsets of R^n with non-integer Hausdorff dimension. And one of the properties of Hausdorff dimension is that if you measure it with any higher dimension you get 0, and if you measure it with lower dimension, you get infinite. For example Koch snowflake has Hausdorff dimension around 1.26, so if you measure its length (dim 1), you get infinity, but if you measure its area (dim 2), you get 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting (and kind of confusing). I'm sure I don't understand, but I wonder if are there also equations for objects that fall between dim 2 (area) and dim 3 (volume)? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is misleading, but what he/she means isthat Hausdorff dimension is the real number where the “measure” of the set is positive but finite. Here is an ELI5: Draw a 1 inch square on a sheet of paper. What is the square’s volume? What is it’s length?  Well it is flat, so it’s volume is zero. It is two-dimensional so it’s length is infinite. The reason why the square is two-dimensional is that the two dimensional way to measure its size (i.e. it’s area) is positive and finite. Hausdorff dimension does that for real numbers not just integers, and of course I’m oversimplifying quite a bit. </p></div>		</li>

This allows your phone to have one antenna that can pick up multiple signals (wifi, bluetooth, cell) without needing multiple large antennas sticking out of your phone.</p>
<p>There's also research into using fractal analysis to detect breast cancer in mammogram images. It was discovered that breast cancer cells replicates in a fractal manner, and thus fractal analysis has better accuracy than other methods.</p>
<p>Fractal methods have also been used to estimate the carbon capture of forests as well as the mass of galaxies (both of which can be modeled as fractal structures).</p>
<p>There's also research about how heartbeats can be either fractal or multifractal, and what that means about the health of the patient (but I forget the details of this research). </p>
<p>The math behind fractals was initially developed for dealing with commodities data, so fractal analysis has use in economics, finance, and data.</p>
<p>Edit: if you've ever taken a basic calculus class you've encountered functions with singularities that run off to infinity, with no tools to get any meaningful information about the singularity. Fractal analysis can tell you the size of those infinities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fractals don’t have to have non-integer dimensions (their Hausdorff dimension or whatever dimension you choose just neeesa to be different from the space of the ambient dimension in which the object is embedded). I also don’t see see how saying “because they’re fractals” answers the question in any way. </p></div>		</li>
