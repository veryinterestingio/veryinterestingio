			<div class="markdown"><p>Isnt there a theory or something called heat death where eventually everything will just get too spread out and have low energy to the point where everything stops interacting and the universe just kinda simmers into nothing? Is that predicted to happen that far ahead of now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Off the top of my head (so take it with a grain of salt), stellar formation is going to go on at a slower and slower pace for tens of billions of years.  From there, white dwarf stars will continue their merry existence for trillions of years.  After that everything goes pretty cold, but black holes continue evaporating for an unimaginably long time.  Then you have the true heat death of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're mixing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip" target="_blank">Big Rip</a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe" target="_blank">heat death of the universe (also called Big Chill)</a>. In particular, the Big Chill doesn't need the universe to expand to happen, it just needs the universe not be able to extract work from the available energy.</p></div>		</li>
