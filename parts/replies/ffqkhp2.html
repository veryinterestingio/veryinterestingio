<p>All viruses contain either DNA or RNA however, so those can be sequenced and if the sequence is different enough from all other sequences in a database then you have yourself a new virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So true! I work in a pretty large clinical lab and we would never confirm a new species of anything based on our clinical tests, which include molecular PCR testing. Once a new species is announced, we would follow up with hundreds of clinical tests on different samples of that species before we even get a basic idea of how it reacts in different individuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All this being said, this particular coronavirus almost certainly did not come from that lab. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This virus doesn't share a lot of its genetics with the SARS virus that that lab was using.</p>
</li>
<li>This virus is far more likely to have come from a bat (it shares a lot more of its sequence with a bat coronavirus than with SARS) and gone through an intermediate host to become infectious to humans.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not hard at all. You can amplify a sequence using PCR primers with one nucleotide swap and generate a new sequence in 90 minutes. Molecular biologists do this all the time with lentivirus’ to do mammalian cell line research or gene therapy research. If you’re curious about that this is a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentiviral_vector_in_gene_therapy" target="_blank">good starting point. </a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I think for families of viruses that infect different species, there are analyses/correlations of the virus' proteins coat with the species it is known to infect. When a mutation jumps species, they can look at the total set of proteins in novel virus and see how similar it is to known viruses that infect ducks or pigs or bats, etc.</p>
<p>----EDIT---</p>
<p>Here's an article describing how the SARS virus was traced to chinese horseshoe bats

<p>--EDIT2----  </p>
<p>In my original comment I indicated the protein coats of the virus were analyzed. The paper above actually discusses analyzing the RNA payload of the virus and its variants and the species they infect.  These are not exactly the same thing as the RNA payload does more than encode the proteins of the viral coat, but the proteins,  the variations in the protein sequences, and how the variations allow the cross species jumping are a major part of the RNA analysis</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least with zoonotic flus, you could think of them in terms of physical similarities easing transmission: pigs have similar respiratory tracts to humans, wet membranes in the lungs that are hospitable to similar viruses, so that 'swine' flu has an easier chance of making the cross-species jump than 'bird' flu and then, as a reservoir, mutating to transmit human to human.  </p>
<p>Avian flus are really deadly, they kill around 50% of those infected, including healthy adults who usually aren't at risk for flu complications.  BUT when a human gets infected by an avian flu, the virus doesn't easily spread human to human (it could, and this is the big worry).  With pigs, these viruses tend to be more at home in our lungs so that human to human transmission does occur and because these are all novel viruses, we don't have the natural immunity to fend them off and the results can be unpredictable.  So then there's some concern that pigs could catch a bird flu, it mutates, and then humans catch the same virus in a form that can transmit human to human.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suppose I should have tacked on the question...&quot;and would such a set of possible changes relate to the novelty of the virus re its likely mortality-morbidity and r0 in human populations in the wild?&quot;. I guess, is there a way to predict how deadly a potential viral mutation might be, should it occur?</p>
<p>It seems that, from such a data set, you could model some type of expected pandemic factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some broad generalizations here.</p>
<p>Birds are the natural reservoir for most influenza viruses. Other species may be infected.</p>
<p>The influenza virus is a segmented 8 fragment RNA genome. This means two things: 1) the RNA polymerase that influenza uses to replicates is pretty terrible at making copies -- meaning that every infected host actually has a small &quot;cloud&quot; of sequence variants inside them. Some of them are viable. The vast majority are not. One or two may make the virus more transmissible, more virulent, etc. These minor population variants are a problem and could arise almost anywhere. So influenza &quot;drifts&quot; a lot. 2) if, say, a pig, were to get infected with two influenza viruses at the same time, those 8 RNA fragments can shuffle like a deck of cards, making a new flu virus. &quot;antigenic shift&quot;.  This is a more dramatic hit.</p>
<p>Swine are more susceptible to influenza than humans, for the most part, which is why swine flu is concerning. Swine herds can act as giant bioreactors for the virus, increasing the likelihood that a virulent, human-transmissible strain emerges.</p>
<p>Not all avian or swine flu have higher virulence.  Those that do are usually designated &quot;high pathogenicity&quot;.</p>
<p>These are the ones that keep most infectious disease epidemiologists up at night.</p></div>		</li>
