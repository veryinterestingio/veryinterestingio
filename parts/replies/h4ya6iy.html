<p>Its been a while tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ethanol mix has an impact on octane, but it is a separate dimension. Some states allow, or require, certain ranges for ethanol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most will allow for premium octane fuel to be ethanol free. Older vehicles made before ethanol was widely used in fuel have gaskets and seals that may fail or won't last as long when exposed to ethanol fuel. (Especially classic cars)</p>
<p>Ethanol also breaks down into water if it sits in the gas tank for a long period of time, like over winter. This is why if you own a lawn mower or other garden implements that run on gasoline it would behoove you to buy ethanol-free fuel for all your small engines. Water also gets into your fuel through humidity in the air, so another good technique is to always store your implements topped off with fuel to minimize the surface area of the fuel in contact with air inside the tank.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Shame he blew it up.... He was going to sell it to me for a steal.</p>
<p>Oh wait... Maybe a good thing it blew up <em>before</em> he could sell it to me...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Petro took over all (or most) old Sunoco location, and kept the Ultra 94.</p>
<p>That meshes with what I thiught: Ultra 94 has ethanol. That's why my friend wouldnt touch it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Chevron/Texaco is the best.  Something about Techron really gives your engine an extra boost, albeit slightâ€¦.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad works for a major pipeline (he's worked there for over 40 years) and used to deal with fuel mixtures and additives for all major fuel companies. They all use the same fuel pretty much and add their own additives. Most oil companies even use the same holding tanks, however Chevron has their own.</p>
<p>In his opinion its all the same shit except Chevron, theirs is slightly better than the rest and have their own holding tanks. Also he seems to thin techron actually works.</p>
<p>I would believe him as he used to be in charge of injecting DRA into fuel for shipping. Essentially they use extremely long petrol chemicals to limit the turbulent flow in petroleum pipelines.</p>
<p>After testing they have figured out what the optimal mixture is to reduce tumble and power consumption on the pipelines, interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, and that detergent makes a significant difference.  It keeps your cylinders cleaner, reducing mechanical resistance, increasing power and efficiency.  Itâ€™s not just the raw energy content of the fuel that matters.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I drive a little hatchback and listen to every word my mechanic says in regards to caring for it. He won't work on it if I abuse it, I would feel bad if I did abuse it and it sounds expensive to be hard on it anyways ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		</li>
