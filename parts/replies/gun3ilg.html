			<div class="markdown"><p>The PS2 got most of it for free. The chip that ran the PS2 controller was the same chip that ran as the PS1 CPU. They still needed to get other connections made, but much of the hardware was in the box available for use.</p>
<p>Otherwise they switched architecture too far for the other systems to emulate. </p>
<p>Nintendo has had a few platforms where they didn't change architecture just updated to faster, newer chips so most (but not all) games worked. They also have used an emulator for significantly older systems, but it was still hit and miss for what worked easily and what had problems.</p></div>		</li>
