			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants have chromosomes. Can plants have trisomy too? Don’t we share like 98% of our DNA with a banana? Legit question I’m really not trying to troll. I’m probably just too high right now, this reads like a shower thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A term you may want to look into is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploidy#Plants" target="_blank">Polyploidy</a>. Polyploidy (extra chromosome sets) is often a stable condition in plants. Humans have taken advantage of it to create new cultivars, and it is the reason some of our fruits are so big compared to their less-selected counterparts. Polyploidy can also lead to new species of plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants have often more copied of chromosomes to be begin with (e.g octaploid) so it works a bit differently. And no, we don't share 98% with s banana, at least not me ;p (more like 60%)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants do reproduction differently from animals.  I'm not sure if extras of a single chromosome cause trouble for them, but it's common for them to have more copies of their genome.  While animals always have two copies, plants can have as many as they like.  Broccoli, cabbage, Brussel's sprouts, and cauliflower are genetically identical, and their differences are from the number of copies they get.</p>
<p>EDIT: Broccoli and all those are variations on a species and all diploid and I don't trust my memory anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably thinking of Kenny the white tiger, who doesn't have downs syndrome, he's just so inbred that he has several pretty extreme birth defects. All white tigers are inbred, but the ones you see in zoos don't have those visible deformities like Kenny does. Many white tigers don't survive very long because of those genetic problems.</p></div>		</li>
