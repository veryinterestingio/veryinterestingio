<p>It's also easier to block up (coagulate) a small road than a big one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cut my arm really badly on the razor-sharp broken neck of a wine glass that someone had left in a large box i was rooting through. Although it didn't hurt i knew i'd cut myself deep because of the 'hot' sensation. I didn't look until i was in a place where i could clean the wound. When i did look, the gash was about 1.5mm deep and at an angle. That doesn't sound like much, but that's about as thick as the skin on my arm is, and i could see all the different components of the skin. The cut revealed 'layers', and they were as follows:</p>
<p>A pink layer, which is my outer skin (the bit that's mostly waterproof and keeps everything inside)<br />
A red layer which contains a few capillaries (the small minor 'roads' which the original commenter was talking about)<br />
A white layer which contained a lot of the fat that's stored in the skin for insulation<br />
And a darker red layer where the skin is connected to the muscles beneath.</p>
<p>Seriously, it was <em>amazing</em> seeing the different layers. There was barely any blood. And it didn't hurt because all because there aren't many nerves there and they were severed anyway. I cleaned it and put a plaster on it, then two hours later i cleaned it again and put a new plaster on, then two <em>more</em> hours later i got home, cleaned it with TCP to prevent infections and put a butterfly stitch across it. :) There's a small amount of pus which has formed but i just dab it with TCP every time i get out of the shower and apply a new dressing. I likely won't have much of a scar, and if i do it'll just be a small lighter-colored curved line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, your knuckles and the back of your fingers.</p>
<p>I have sliced those open way too many times while peeling potatoes. And just about every time there's very little or almost no blood. In fact I tend to take about 5 minutes to even notice it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It surely is just dumb luck. When i cut my palm, it bled quite a bit even though the cut was only about 2mm long (it was also about that deep, though, which is deeper than the skin). It was jagged and nasty, but too small to show off.</p>
<p>When i cut the underside of my arm on a broken wine glass that someone had left in a storage box (dickheads!), there was barely any blood even though it was as deep as the skin and about 1cm long (thankfully it was razor-sharp glass so it wasn't a gouge or anything, just a clean slice). I could see the layer of fat beneath the first two layers of skin, and the darker layer beneath that which is the foundation of the skin.</p>
<p>As for scar tissue: my colleague at work has a huge burn scar on his arm, and when he's working super-hard (showing up all the other assholes) his scar will split and the skin just beneath it will bleed. So yeah scar tissue doesn't bleed, but it does have regular skin beneath which holds capillaries still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what i did yesterday. :) I cut the skin on the underside of my forearm on a razor-sharp piece of glass from a broken wine glass neck that some <em>dickhead</em> had left in a box of gadgets at work.</p>
<p>The cut was - i kid you not - about as deep as the skin. I could see the pink epidermis bit, the darker bit underneath where all the capillaries are, the <em>white</em> bit where all the fat is (!!), and the red bit where the skin connects to the muscles beneath by these fiber-like things. There was a thick drop of blood from where i'd sliced the capillaries, and the deepest part of it obviously had pooled blood, but seeing the different colors of the layers was just amazing, especially the white bit where the were no capillaries at all.</p>
<p>There surely isn't a lot going on in some parts of the skin. But actually i was really fortunate because (thanks to my whitey-snow-white-poodle-shite complexion) i can see that there're some very small veins very close to the two ends of the cut, and some much larger veins about an inch away. If i'd nicked one of them, i woulda needed to visit a doctor. As it was, i just cleaned it and put a plaster on, then did the same again two hours later, then replaced the plaster with a butterfly stitch after having a bath. I might not even end up with a scar.</p></div>		</li>
