			<div class="markdown"><p>This issue, often referred to as coffee staining, is also a large area of problems and research for ink-jet printing technologies. Just in place of being wiped away the carrier (usually solvent) evaporates faster at the edges. As the edge is &quot;pinned&quot; for the most part, the fluid travels from the center to the edges to replenish the drop there, carrying with it the pigment.  </p>

<p>Pretty interesting and neat stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shape of the particulates in the liquid greatly affects how much they are drawn towards the outside edge through that action (is it capillary action?) I read an article about a decade ago that found that spherical particulates did not do that as quickly as more ovoid shapes, and they were speculating that the shape of red blood cells was partially to make it more mobile in the capillaries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I haven't looked at that particularly but it would cetainly make sense. You want a shape that is easiest to move with in a flow, a cup shape on both ends would certaily do that. I almost imagine it would &quot;pin&quot; it in the flow as moving in any way other than stationary relative to the flow would have large amounts of resistance.  </p>
<p>All my very limited knowledge comes from a short insight into inkjet during one of my university modules, But it really is fascinating how the smallest and simplest things such as dropping a slution onto a substrate has these incredibly precise and microscopic phenomena occuring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're close. The solvent evaporates fairly evenly across the exposed surface of the solution. What differs at the edges is the solute that is against the floor has the least access to the solvent so has the greatest chance of adhering to it. As the solution adjacent to the adhered solute evaporates more of the solute finds its self without any solvent between it and the already adhered solute so in turn adheres to it too. This process cycles until there is no more mobile solvent left whereupon a thin residue of the solute is left in the centre of the concentrated ring of solute.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens in old paper that has experienced a partial wetting. It causes brown tide lines to appear adjacent to where the page remained dry. The solute in this case is the degradation products of the aging paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit to this, there’s more surface area for a given volume at the edge because the drop curves down there. This is why it evaporates faster there.</p></div>		</li>
