			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes a lot of sense, in some countries, like Italy for example, I notice ferries are a lot more common. Especially in ports such as Naples, and also Palermo or Catania in Sicily, and Bari on the west coast. A lot of ferries go to Malta and North Africa from Sicily and I imagine you need bigger sized ships for cargo, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turkey doesn't own many islands. In total, there are 500 islands vs Greece's 6000.</p>
<p>Most of those are not inhabited, though. Also, the 500 islands are not many. Italy, for example, you'd say they have at most 10 islands, but in reality, they have 450.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of Norwegian ferries can be traced south through Europe. After worn out by Scandinavian standards, they end up in the UK, then before they are completely dead, they mold away in the Mediterranean..</p>
<p>Source: I work with satellite communications, and I can trace our customer ships as they change owners..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fun answer would be yes , with added sniffed surveilance cameras :p</p>
<p>Sadly its more boring.
We're a rather big player, and if the ferrys changes owner, we're a likely supplier for the buyers maritime communication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a ferry from Genua to Palermo and all of the signage on the ship was in Norwegian. Even the little day-lockers were with Norwegian writing. </p>
<p>I also took a ferry from Genua to Olbia, same story. Corsica as well. </p>

<p>In hindsight it was probably stupid connecting as who knows what they could have planted on my phone and laptop.</p></div>		</li>
