			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of surnames in English and an occupational name isn't the most common. The oldest and most common surname are derived from a given name. They may be a first name like William, a patronymic name like Johnson, matronymic like Marriett, or a clan name like O'brien.</p>
<p>Other types of surnames include place names like towns or geographic locations, like Hamilton or Hill. Another is personal characteristics like Strong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes, but they’re not “Nordic names” they’re British names and that type of name is called a Patronym. </p>
<p>Johnson, Nixon, Dixon, Adamson, Davidson, Mason, Paulson, Jameson etc etc</p>
<p>Since English and Nordic languages are both Germanic, with a very strong shared history, it stands to reason that the way they make a name that means “son of” is basically identical.</p></div>		</li>
