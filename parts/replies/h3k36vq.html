			<div class="markdown"><p>oh wait but doesn't adding something cooler reduce entropy? Shouldn't it be the opposite if you were to say the rapid expansion of air is what causes the vibration when expansion is proportional to temperature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the air expanding is what causes the “vibration” or “shock wave” or “sound wave”.</p>
<p>It is like thunder, which is caused by lightning rapidly hearing the air, which then rapidly expands. That rapid expansion pushes all the air around it like a shock wave.</p></div>		</li>
