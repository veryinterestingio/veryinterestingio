			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in the old testament there's a description of how to induce an abortion if a woman was believed to have had an affair. It prescribed making a tea from barley. There is a fungus that grows on barley that can cause a miscarriage/abortion. As you said it was not reliable so the bible verses basically kind of leave the result as God revealing if she cheated or not and whether she be punished or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, they’d take unwanted infants out beyond the city walls and leave them for wolves. The founding of Rome is actually grounded in this. Remulus and Romulus were abandoned infants, but instead of being eaten, they were taken to a den and nursed by a she-wolf. One thing led to another, and eventually most public buildings in the US started mimicking Roman architecture.</p></div>		</li>
