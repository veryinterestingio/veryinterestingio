<p>This only really applies to typical office settings. There’s A LOT of wasted time in offices.</p>

<p>there's been tons of studies but i believe the median is something like the average office worker getting paid 40 hours only really does 10 hours of work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the guy you asked, but I'm someone who wastes at least half his day on Reddit.</p>
<p>I'm an engineer, and my job is to either fix machines as they break down, or upgrade them while they're not in use.  Sometimes I'll also have to design or program some new stuff.  I'd say about half my days are: I spend an hour doing the daily checks, then spend three to six hours maintaining other machines, designing a new production line, re-writing some code to fit a new part, whatever needs doing.</p>
<p>There are some weeks where I'll be here 12 hours a day babysitting a machine to make sure we meet a customer deadline.  There are definitely other days where I finish my daily checks, then just kill time for the other seven hours if there's no emergency.</p>
<p>So, it varies.  In all honesty, I probably do about 30 hours of work per week on average, but I still need to be there on-call in case anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>If I had my way, I'd just be on-call or work-from-home for one or two days a week and ask one of the other engineers to do my daily checks.  I live about three minutes from the facility, so if anything goes wrong I could still be there within ten minutes.  But it'd be nice to just not have to pretend to be busy for a couple hours of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you cut hours, work output will likely decrease. Not 1:1 but it probably goes down. I’m not arguing that long hours are better, the gains in productivity may be pretty marginal when you’re going from 40 to 41 hours, but I do think there are gains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's hard to say definitely. In my environment and in 2 others that I'm familiar with, Friday is already often &quot;wasted.&quot; Then you account for places that allow employees to leave early (with or without &quot;making up&quot; the hours on other days), and it doesn't help productivity. </p>
<p>I've noticed with different teams at different places, the time tasks take is really determined on when the task &quot;should be done.&quot; Need it done by the end of the week, but it'll only take a day to complete? You'll have it by the end of the week. Need something done by the end of the week and it'll take the whole week? You'll have it by the end of the week. Having a shorter week could very well make it easier to prioritize work over wasting time to get things done on time. Additionally, now that these people will (in theory) be working \~32 hours, occasionally needing to work extra hours Mon-Thur won't be too bad. </p>
<p>Granted, this also does depend on the field... I really can't imagine EVERY office has the same amount of wasted time. So if every place did this, I could imagine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, actually.  Most studies point to performance actually decreasing after about 6 hours of repetitive work per day (even with lunch/breaks), and after about 3 days in a row.  Most people who work in an office know about the 2:30 slump.</p>
<p>Which is why it's also kind of a bad idea to call for a 4x10 work week to become the new normal.  Usually, working a 10-hour shift is barely more productive than working a 6-hour shift, but costs the employer almost twice as much.</p>
<p>So most people who do repetitive work (customer service, manufacturing, retail, etc) are probably at their least productive on Friday, particularly in the afternoon.</p></div>		</li>
