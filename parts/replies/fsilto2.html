			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I was trying to say with that last paragraph. The body's inflammatory reaction to the bite helps to prevent infection (though it's not always effective). At the very least, it speeds up the immune response, allowing the body to produce an activated immune response</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's an often quoted &quot;factoid&quot;, but I've never seen a source for where this comes from. Everyone points to someone else (if at all), but that source just points elsewhere.  I did another search and stumbled upon <a href="https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2019/10/03/has_malaria_really_killed_half_of_everyone_who_ever_lived.html" target="_blank">this article</a>.  It's focused on Malaria instead of all mosquito borne diseases, but that accounts for the majority.  It estimates it at 4-5%.  Even at current estimates of up to 2 million deaths annually (malaria), it's dwarfed by deaths due to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-does-the-world-die-from" target="_blank">cardiovascular disease and cancer</a>.  Obviously malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases held a higher percentage in the past, but there was also a substantially smaller global population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the time you've noticed it, the itch is just the residual inflammatory cytokines that need to be used up. The body does a great job creating an exponential response to a tiny bit of irritant (allowing for fast response times), but it leaves a lot of leftovers, which is why the bite might last for days.</p></div>		</li>
