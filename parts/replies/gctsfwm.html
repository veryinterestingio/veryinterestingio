			<div class="markdown"><p>Whether something is in the public domain depends on a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the date of publication. <a href="https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain" target="_blank">This is the most concise chart of it that I have seen for the United States</a> and as you can see it is pretty complex! And that is separate from whether a publisher has decided it no longer wants to enforce copyright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was (part of) the response I got: </p>
<p>&quot;You do not need to seek permission for re-use of material over 70 years old for up to 5 articles or figures - re-use is only subject to acknowledgement. Beyond this limit please contact us.&quot;</p>
<p>I suppose that's just the policy of that particular publisher.</p>
<p>E: and for the sake of accuracy, it was a 1933 paper :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 1972, a distant relative wrote a genealogy of our family history. I have a copy of the book, but it is no longer in print. I want to find the publishing rights and get it to my family's non-profit organization. They organize our family reunions, provide scholarships to local kids and do come other charity stuff. A lot of people would like to get the book, but it's hard to find now a days. I would love to get it and have it available on Amazon so it can be ordered as needed. The problem is he is dead, I think it was published through a small local company that no longer exists because I can't find anything on them, and I have no idea who the rights would get passed down to.</p>
<p>I've read briefly of similar issues where they are called Orphaned Works, there is no longer a clear owner and the law never set up to fix this issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is typically limited to the hard sciences in general, and physics in particular.</p>
<p>It's rare to have a social science paper there. I did my undergrad in physics and used the arxiv all the time, but now my PhD is technically in Business Administration (focusing on Operations Research and Decision Analysis, so more quantitative stuff), and there is no central preprint server. Most articles don't get a preprint at all.</p>
<p>EDIT: To be clear, it's the PhD I'm currently in the process of earning, I don't have it yet.</p></div>		</li>
