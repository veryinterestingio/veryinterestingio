<p>It’s rather a risk assessment that has concluded that the potential benefit from the vaccine outweighs the potential risk.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe the general assumption is that herd immunity happens around 95% (take measles in the US as an example) but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was different from disease to disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Herd immunity is different between diseases.  At an abstract level it depends on the &quot;R&quot; or reproductive rate.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a>, influenza has a <em>Herd Immunity Threshold</em> (HIT) of 33-44%, whereas measles is 92-95%.</p>
<p>Measles is fantastically contagious (R0 of 12-18), whereas influenza is less so (R0 of 1.5-1.8).</p>
<p>For Covid-19 R0 estimates are in the 2.5-4 range, meaning 60-75% is the HIT.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's very different from disease to disease. As a general model the herd immunity threshold is at (1-1/R0). R0 is defined as the number of secondary infections that arise on average from a single primary infection (IE: how many other people will the average person pass the disease on to when they get the disease).</p>
<p>r0 is very disease dependent. The measles is <em>very</em> high (R0 = 12 to 18). Influenza is pretty low (R0 = 2). These numbers are further affected by environmental conditions. R0 will generally be higher in areas of high population density. They might be affected by the season or the climate of the area the disease is spreading in as well.</p>
<p>So herd immunity thresholds can range from like 95% (R0=18) on the high end to 50% on the low end (R0=2).</p>
<p>SARS-COV-2 is on the lower end. When we're all socially distanced <a href="https://rt.live/" target="_blank">R0 is under 2 in most places</a>. Meaning the virus will start to die out at about 50% of the population infected. With no distancing the number was estimated to be in the 3-4 range in most cases. Meaning the 66%-75% of the population needs to be infected to reach herd immunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The percent required is tied to the r0 of the disease, specifically an immunity level above  (<em>R</em>0 − 1)/<em>R</em>0 . So an r0 of 3 (where one infected person is likely to infect 3 people) = (3-1)/3=2/3rds or 66.6%. At this level of immunity, one infected person is liable to infect one other person and the disease continues at that level. Any lower and the infection spreads, and higher level of immunity and the infection will decline over time. So if we can reduce the r0 through public health measures, the percent required for herd immunity will be lower as well.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not really what the evidence points to.  There is not evidence that immunity is long lasting is not the same that there is evidence that it is not.   There are very few examples of reinfection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no universal standard because it's all about risk/benefit ratios. If COVID had a 90% fatality rate, we would accept a way higher risk of adverse events than what we'll accept now. Relative to therapeutic medications, vaccines have very, very, very low thresholds for being deemed &quot;unsafe&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, because you're giving these medicines to healthy people the bar is pretty high. That's why cancer drugs can get accepted with terrible side-effects: better than dying.</p>
<p>Basically, you want the severe side-effects for vaccines to be very low, like 1 in 100,000 range. And even then if you're vaccinating a few billion people it still adds up. Problem is, there no way to find out without actually vaccinating a few hundred thousand people.</p></div>		</li>
