As with any pain, it's always an indicator that something is not right, and you should not do what causes the pain. Pain makes us averse to do things that will put our survival in jeopardy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not exactly, but you can choose not to do it again. Learn from the experience and fear it, it happens. But our bodies have a wonderful way to counteract that too, powerful feel-good hormones for our brand new baby, and sex that feels very good (evolution is not taking birth control in consideration yet, and it does fail from time to time or we forget to use it at all, being stupid while horny happens too). After all, it's all about keeping the species alive and reproducing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So with dental infections/abscesses the pain is because the infection collects at the end of the tooth (apices) in a space where the ligament attaches the tooth to bone. Unlike skin that can expand the infection builds against tooth and bone, creating a lot of pressure. All of this makes the nerve which enter the tooth from the root apex... real unhappy to put it lightly. When you get a pimple on the gum and it pops (sinus tract) it usually makes it feel better because the infection has tunnelled through the bone and the pressure is released. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, if it’s still a “pimple” it’s an abscess, if it’s popped it’s a sinus tract. Probably not gonna kill you, probably just gonna hurt a ton, but untreated for a long time can lead to some nasty complications.
Ie: if it hurts please come in and get it fixed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had an accidental vertical root fracture from biting down on a tortilla wrong. It developed into an abscess which delivered some exquisitely intense pain. I would fantasize about using a chunk of metal to just knock the tooth out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Abscesses from root fractures can be nasty. My mom had the same thing and she said it was so bad she was close to using needle nose pliers to get it out herself.
Note: I’m not encouraging this. Please for the love of god don’t do DIY dentistry.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Turns out that the massive number of nerves inside of teeth have almost no evolutionary advantage at all. They're a vestige of how teeth came to be formed from biological history. Unfortunately, we haven't had enough time to lose tooth sensitivity because it rarely causes someone to not reproduce as much.</p></div>		</li>
