<p>It is unclear why men and women are affected, but an intriguing possibility is an X-linked gene that creates the ACE-2 receptor, which is exploited by some coronaviruses to enter cells. </p>

<p>China has the largest population of smokers in the world, about half of chinese men smoke while only ~3% of women do. The percentages shift depending on the age group and urban/rural setting, but overall men are smokers. </p>
<p>This is more likely the cause as it fits with the other data showing comorbidities increase the chances of complications.</p>
<p>China also has a pollution problem in the urban areas, which also increases the risk of complications.</p>
<p>LE: It might also just be a statistical artefact due to men outnumbering women in China. We'll find out once we have access to high quality data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am seeing counter arguments saying that 80% of people who get this virus experience mild symptoms and dont report it so are not included in the death rate. So the death rate is much lower. Is there any evidence backing this? Its all over the news subs when people argue that this is nothing. </p>
<p>Also what about the argument that these types of virus dont spread when it gets warmer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, there is no evidence to suggest it is spreading in such an asymptomatic way. Most countries can barely test everyone who reports being sick, let alone a statistically viable sample to test this hypothesis. It’s not impossible that it’s the case, it’s just there is no evidence for it whatsoever. </p>
<p>That said, that would make the situation much worse for the 20% who do show symptoms, since that would make getting the virus almost a certainty. </p>
<p>To put it in perspective, 4 out of 5 people you know would be fine. 1 out of 5 people would not be, and they would get it from those 4. With 7.7 billion people on the planet, that would put 1.54 billion in the damage window with a much higher chance of contracting the virus. The less fatal the disease, the more it can spread, the more people it can affect, and ultimately the more people can die from it. </p>
<p>But again, there’s no evidence to support this conjecture at this time.</p>
<p><em>update</em> from BBC Seoul correspondant Laura Bicker</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Daegu, 1900 Shincheonji Church members have been tested for coronavirus. </p>
<p>1300 had symptoms &amp; 600 did not.</p>
<p>Among those 1300 with symptoms, 87.5% were confirmed with the virus .  </p>
<p>BUT out of the 600 WITHOUT symptoms, 70% were confirmed with coronavirus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not clear if that 70% will never show symptoms - it has long been suspected that individuals are asymptomatic for the first few days of the infection. Monitoring with agressive testing over the next few days will hopefully resolve this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are starting to see cases that aren't linked to any known carrier.  1 in the UK reported today.  6(?) In the US (lost the news report so might be wrong on the number).</p>
<p>The US will be an interesting case as there's a huge financial disincentive to visiting the doctor with what might be fairly mild symptoms, so you'd expect a higher number of undocumented cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. This 80% thing is all over the news subs from republicans trying go call this a democratic hoax to harm Trump. Its really annoying. </p>
<p>So if 1.154 billion get the disease and the death rate sticks to 2% that would mean 30 million dead. I would think the death rate would go up due to the healthcare system being overwhelmed. I would think it would be likely deaths from other issues would go up due to an overwhelmed healthcare system. </p>
<p>If 80% were asymptomatic wouldnt this increase the likelihood that the virus mutates since its spread so widely?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>South Korea (high of 55℉ in Seoul today) has 2300 cases and the Philippines (91℉ in Manila) has 3 cases, and no currently infected population. The Philippines has twice the population and roughly the same amount of travel with China as South Korea. </p>
<p>It's very likely not going to sustain over the warming months.</p></div>		</li>
