			<div class="markdown"><p>In the world of poop, there is a lot of variability that is all considered &quot;normal.&quot; That includes transit time, number of voids per day, and all the stool properties (color/smell/texture/density/hardness).</p>
<p>On top of any intrinsic/biological differences between people, these are all affected by a lot of outside factors like what you ate and how hydrated you are, and they're also affected by other internal things like stress.</p>
<p>So when you combine all those things, you get a really wide tolerance of conditions before we consider something to be abnormal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting, thanks. Would it be normal for some people to have a transit time of a day or less? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a camp director who won the &quot;least poops in a week&quot; (5 days) contest he invented with only 2-4 poops in that time.</p>
<p>Is that normal??</p>
<p>For comparison, the winners of most poops and runners up would get 14-17 voids</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More accurate to say anywhere from 12 hours to 4-5 days could be considered normal depending on the person's unique physiology and what they ate. Shorter than 12 hours and it's getting to the point where nutrients might be starting to get lost and longer is getting to the point where a bowel impaction could begin to form.</p>
<p>Also, there is no problem unless there are symptoms or other noticeable disease processes occuring related to or caused by the abnormal digestion time. If you are on the borderline of one of these ranges it really doesn't matter unless it's showing up in your blood work that you are deficient, or you're feeling constantly tired, or you have abdominal pain, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this near “12 hour” thing occur in folks with chronic pancreatitis?  </p>
<p>One example I have for myself is Lucky Charms... since I started having issues digesting foods, I noticed if I eat lucky charms I don’t break the dyes down much anymore so if I eat a large bowl of it, within 12-16 hrs, I have the goofiest aqua-green shade of poo.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>If corn is any indication, I'm passing most meals in 12-16 hours</p></div>		</li>
