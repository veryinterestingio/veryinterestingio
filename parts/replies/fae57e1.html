<p>Hexagonal Close Packed</p>

<p>I'm confused by the diagram on that one; it looks like there are three atoms just floating around, holding hands in the middle.  Are they not bound to any others?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lines are just there to help give you an idea of where the atoms are located in 3D space. They have no relevance when it comes to actual bonding. What's represented is called a &quot;<a href="https://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch13/unitcell.php" target="_blank">unit cell</a>&quot;. They represent the simplest depiction of what is actually a repeating pattern and help us visualize the crystal structure.</p>
<p>For example, the &quot;layers&quot; of HCP crystals repeat in an ABAB pattern, whereas FCC repeats in an ABCABC (<a href="https://depts.washington.edu/matseed/mse_resources/Webpage/Metals/metalstructure.htm" target="_blank">shown here</a>). But this is more difficult to visualize and intuit than a unit cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, when you're starting to learn about these, you should think about the face-centered cubic turned on a corner (so one corner points directly down, the opposite corner directly up).  Once you do that, you'll see how closely related FCC and HCP really are.  The difference is that the layers alternate in a 1-2-1-2-1-2... pattern (HCP) instead of 1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2-3... (FCC).</p>
<p>As for your question, they're just as close to each other (and those in the other layers) as the ones in the top and bottom layer; the diagram at the bottom is more representative, it's just easier to see the unit cell in the top diagram.  In fact, for a pure metal, it's entirely arbitrary which one you choose as the top.  HCP is called what it is because it isn't physically possible to pack the atoms more closely.  It's a little hard to see this in diagrams, but if you don't mind getting some materials, a set of styrofoam balls (uniform size) and a little glue works wonders.  Glue together a few flat layers of 6-10 balls each and see how they stack together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first thing you need to appreciate about metals is <em>none</em> of the atoms are bonded to each other, anymore than they're bonded to all the atoms in the metal. That's why I say residual nuclei in a sea of electrons. They have nearest neighbours, the number of which are specific to their arrangement, and next nearest neighbours and so on, but the idea of discrete bonds is incorrect for metals.</p>
<p>The diagrams are somewhat exploded to make it easier to see. Imagine you have several sets of the FCC arrangement, and the atoms are all brought as close as they can get. Now shear through it, and you get HCP.</p>
<p>BCC isn't close packed, unlike HCP and FCC. That's a consequence of and partially reinforces it's partly covalent character. </p>
<p>HCP is close packed in two of three layers, basically the two layers of hexagons are close packed, but the three in the middle aren't and this is what gives rise to the inconsistent properties of HCP metals. If you look at the arrangement like that, we refer to the veritcal axis (hexagon through triangle to hexagon) as 'c' and the three basal directions (centre of hexagon to the outer of hexagon) as 'a'. HCP metals with high c/a ratios tend to be strong and brittle and poor conductors (titanium and beryllium are good examples) and low c/a ratios tend to be more metallic (magnesium is an example)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Body Centred cubic metals have a degree of covalent character which makes them stronger, harder, poorer conductors and have higher melting points. It also means that special processes such as thermomechanical processing to refine the size of their crystals has much more effect on their mechanical properties (strength, toughness, ductility)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if I'm understanding this right, this is why there's all kinds of crazy things people do to iron and steel to get wildly different properties out of it, but I rarely hear anything similar about other common metals/alloys like bronze or aluminum? I'm more familiar with the biological side of things, where carbon is similarly versatile because of its chemical properties, and I've wondered if there was something analogous with iron in metallurgy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Iron has three allotropes at normal accessible conditions on earth.</p>
<p>At low temperature the allotrope <em>Ferrite</em>, which is BCC is the stable phase. It is capable of dissolving vanishingly small amounts of carbon - at most no more than 0.06%.</p>
<p>Above 911C at zero carbon and falling as carbon is added to the steel to 723C the dominant allotrope <em>Austenite</em>, which is FCC is created and that can dissolve up to 2.0% carbon.</p>
<p>Above 1493C at zero carbon, iron becomes BCC again up to its melting point and this is called <em>delta-Ferrite</em>, but serves very little practical purpose except for preventing impurity embrittlement in welds in Austenitic stainless steels so we'll ignore it for now.</p>
<p>You'll notice the huge, huge difference in solubility of carbon between Ferrite and Austenite. Then if you read what I said before about less space between atoms in FCC iron (Austenite) than BCC iron (Ferrite) you'll not understand how that works.</p>
<p>Basically, while the atoms are in general closer together in FCC iron, they have much much bigger holes in the arrangement of atoms at very specific spaces, so they can hold more carbon in between those atoms without massive distortion (which means huge amounts of energy to do).</p>
<p>So, if I take a piece of BCC iron, and heat it up to the FCC transformation, I can dissolve carbon into it. Then I quench it into water, and the atoms want to transform back to BCC, but all that carbon in those spaces between atoms stops them moving. The structure tries to reconfigure and instead ends up undergoing the Bain shear (named after a prominent ferrous metallurgist) which is the only thing it can do.</p>
<p>That shear adds enormous elastic stress to the structure. And elastic stress means you have to overcome it to deform the structure. Congratulations, you just hardened some steel by quenching :-)</p>
<p>This transformation isn't actually that unique. We call it Martensitic (after Martens, another prominent ferrous metallurgist) and it occurs in many alloy systems, but none of them are so well controlled, easy to do, or readily available as with steels.</p>
<p>Now, you have a hardened, strengthened piece of steel. But if you put to much carbon in it, it's <em>so</em> strained that it's incredibly hard and strong, but brittle. The strain that gives it strength also stops it plastically deforming.</p>
<p>So now you want to temper it. Tempering gives heat energy to the fully hardened, trapped structure to let some of that carbon react with iron to form very fine particles of iron carbide, and leave a lower carbon material. Take it too far and you're back to the steel you had to begin with (but fine grained because all this transforming puts in new surfaces that help new grains grow smaller and faster).</p>
<p>That's the simplest explanation I can give.</p>
<p>Suffice to say we've been writing metallurgical textbooks and research papers on the complexities of this transformation for 150 years. The martensitic transformation is just one of many different transformations available to steels. It's not inaccurate to say that the control of this transformation is without shadow of doubt the single most important technological advancement in the history of humanity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iron is different. Iron changes crystal structures with different temperatures, which gives you all kinds of interesting properties you can do with heat treatments. Furthermore, steel is essentially iron with carbon impurities that take the flexibility out of the crystal structure by filling in the space a bit. Different percentages of carbon can cause different strengths and brittleness, as well as other impurities like magnesium and phosphorous. </p>
<p>So while iron at room temperature is a BCC crystal (ferrite), when you heat it up past a certain point (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austenite" target="_blank">austenite</a>), it will change crystal structure to FCC. Then if you keep heating it up, it goes back to BCC. Then if you keep heating it, it obviously will eventually melt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many metals undergo thermal allotropic transformations. Not all of them lead to such spectacular changes in solvation of a readily available interstitial element (carbon), which is of the type of solute atom that leads to greatest change in mechanical properties, at such readily available temperatures, which also undergoes a hysterisic retrograde transformation.</p>
<p>Basically, you can't pin so great a range of structures so well in metastable conditions in any other alloy system as you can iron-carbon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But just because you don't necessarily hear about it doesn't mean other materials aren't versatile. Though, perhaps, not to the same degree as iron.</p>
<p>For example, nickel is used as a plating to make things shiny, but it's also used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superalloy" target="_blank">superalloy</a> when you really need something to stay strong while hot (e.g. jet turbine blade). Titanium is used for submarine hulls because it's strong and light weight, but it's also used in golf clubs because its Oops, low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus" target="_blank">Young's modulus</a> lets you hit the ball further.</p>
<p>But iron.. it's just the way it is. The way it alloys with different elements, the way its microstructure changes with heat/cooling.. luck of the universe, I guess. It's beyond me to really explain WHY but I think, just as carbon's chemical properties sit just right, same with iron - its properties are just right so that all these things end up happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Titanium has just over half the Young modulus of steel and about the same as copper. It's that its modulus is <em>low</em> that is responsible for the trampoline effect/ high CoR in golf club faces. Low density and E, high yield strength and poisson's ratio effect of texture are what do it for titanium.</p>
<p>Wait 'til you find out how much better nitrogen is at doing carbon's job in steel... ;-) </p>
<p>We talk about iron being the universal engineering element because it is the universal engineering element. If it were another, we'd talk about that instead.</p></div>		</li>
