			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but it takes a lot of work (in that it’s a taxing mental process)! The more ways you have to bring up a certain memory, the more likely it is that you can recall it. </p>
<p>If I asked you what you did for your last birthday, you might think, “it was my 21st! I went to a bar of course!” Or you might think, “who did I hang out with?” or “what kind of cake did I have?” There’s a bunch of ways to bring up that one specific memory. </p>
<p>So one way to increase your ability to retrieve info from your LTM is to build a lot of different connections to that memory right when it’s happening. That’s why when you meet a person at a party, you’re more likely to remember their name if you say, “oh my uncle’s name is Joe too and he’s hilarious like you!” than if you just say, “nice to meet you, Joe.” The more connections, the better your chance at remembering it later. </p>
<p>Another way is just to practice. If there’s a certain memory you really never want to forget, think about it a lot. The more you actively think about it, the less likely you are to forget it. But that’s just for specific memories - it’s not really feasible to do that for everything in our LTM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve also heard that when you remember a memory, it is a new memory of that instance the way you remember it at that point.</p>
<p>So if you recall your 21st birthday every year for 10 years after, you have 11 different memories of your 21st birthday, each susceptible to misremembering. Now Each time you recall that birthday, it is a composite of accurate and inaccurate events. </p>
<p>It’s wild. Never trust an eye witness account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like to point out some slight inaccuracies there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get this: our LTM is limitless. Everything is in there. That’s why sometimes you’ll be walking down the street and smell a certain food and suddenly you’re transported back to a meal you had 15 years ago. It’s in there, it’s just a matter of being able to access it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to imply that everything we experienced is stored as some form of veridical representation, but it is well established that engrams/ memory traces are subjected to various forms of transformation (e.g. memory updating, integration, decay). It is plausible that LTM is limitless, but that's practically untestable, but the notion that &quot;everything is in there&quot; is certainly not well supported.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(If you want the specifics, memory is largely stored in the hippocampus, which is pretty close to the middle of your brain.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly. Hippocampus is required for initial encoding of declarative memory, but it is well documented that consolidation reduces hippocampal dependence. </p>
<p>Current established theories mostly postulate that memory representations are distributed across the cortex over time. Regardless of whether you prescribe to the standard consolidation model or the multi-trace/trace transformation, it's misleading to state that memory is &quot;largely stored in the hippocampus&quot;</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>LTM is limitless in that there's a no hard drive to run out of space, but it is bounded by the fact that memory is driven by novelty and ability to differentiate, with interference being the limiting factor. The smell of the type of cookies your grandma made triggers a strong memory of your grandma's kitchen because the smell is novel and your grandma's kitchen is novel. If you ate those cookies in 1,000 kitchens, you wouldn't be able to remember all of them based on the smell because the smell would have lost its novelty. </p>
<p>Similarly, if you ate 1,000 meals in your grandma's kitchen you wouldn't be able to pair all of the scents with your grandma's kitchen -- it's her special cookies (and probably some limited subset of others) that primarily make you say &quot;that smells just like grandma's kitchen.&quot; There would be another group of meals that you would also be able to recall with additional context (&quot;remember what we were eating when we were at grandma's and the candle fell over and lit the table clothe on fire?&quot;) although it's entirely possible, as you note, that two memories would get mixed and you'd have no way of knowing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There absolutely is though, it's just presumably big enough that it <em>won't</em> run out of space during a lifetime. If you lived literally forever then it would run out of space at some point, or maybe overwrite old memories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you create synaptic connections when you learn things. After awhile, if you don’t use that information anymore, your brain might decide to terminate that connection because it’s not needed. Soooo... information <em>is</em> lost over time. Synaptic connections weaken and eventually die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that’s a legit argument. The thing is that we don’t really have ways to test how much is actually there. Theoretically, it’s all there. The evidence for that is that people can recall things that they haven’t thought about in years. But there are lots of things that people can’t remember - is that because the memory itself is gone, or the ability to retrieve just isn’t there? We don’t have a way of knowing. But it’s pretty compelling when people bring up “long-forgotten” memories, especially if it’s of something  mundane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the issue is that if it wasn't stored at the time, it's gone forever. Given how much of the world we filter out to prevent us going insane, it's easy to see how little of our experience we actually remember. A lot of our memories are being &quot;filled in&quot; with what the brain expects would be plausible, and such false memories are a massive problem with things like eyewitness testimony. While it's true we might store memories we didn't expect ourselves to store (like the smell of one kindergarten teacher's perfume, when you sometimes forget the password you've used to login for the last 3 years), and some memories might be locked away down obscure pathways that don't get triggered without very specific cues, it's just not even remotely true that <em>everything</em> we experience is stored permanently, awaiting the right sequence of reminders. It just seems that way because of the fact we do sometimes have those funny random memories that get triggered by smelling the same perfume decades later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah memory is definitely an interesting aspect of our brains and many of the mechanisms are largely unknown. Those long forgotten memories may also not be exactly how it happened, memories can be distorted or even completely made up! I'm very curious about the far future and what we learn about the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But savants that can perform incredible mental feats like, for example, being able to remember minute details of a city after a brief view and then being able to draw an incredibly detailed recreation on paper. There seem to be some people who do have the ability to remember quite a bit of what they experience(in certain contexts), if not everything. Whether they're stretching the limits of the human brain, or whether they're just able to access to memories better than the rest of us is unknown. We know incredible things are sometimes possible. We're not sure how.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are studies indicating that information is never stored in LTM memory to begin with. These are often done in research where a participant is asked to focus on a single attribute of an item/object, but then cannot recall other attributes of the item/object after a short period of time.</p>
<p>I am not perfectly familiar with this research, though I can link references if anyone would like. I would presume the reasoning would be something along the lines of; if the information presented can't be recalled at any future point after presentation, why claim it was stored in LTM? I believe new theories incorporate the brain's ability to filter unnecessary information prior to storage in LTM.</p></div>		</li>
