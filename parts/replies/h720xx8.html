			<div class="markdown"><p>Have any sources for that claim? I've read reputable sources saying Sputnik is very effective, including US news agencies. </p>
<p>Not trying to say Putin isn't basically a dictator, but the vaccine seems to be legit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was that Lancet study which says it was about on par with the Pfizer vaccine. Which is well possible.</p>
<p>The problem is that there are multiple vaccines called &quot;Sputnik-V&quot; and it is not clear at all which version has been used/tested. This has been called out multiple times by multiple countries that use this vaccine - that what they got in the boxes is different from what they ordered or what other countries have. And Russia isn't forthcoming with documentation.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean the vaccine is bad - but it is really difficult to judge its efficiency when the Russian government is intentionally obfuscating the situation for political reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are three versions of the Sputnik vaccine:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Two component full version “Sputnik V”. Two different adenovirus vectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One component version “Sputnik Light”. Only the first component of “Sputnik V”.</p>
</li>
<li>Dried version which requires no cooling. It was developed for places where no fridges could work and logistics are too complicated, but nobody saw it.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, I have read some reputable sources, and as far as saw, the efficiency is not the same, it is slightly lower than Pfizer or mRNA vaccines in general, but only slightly.  </p>
<p>Then again, the term &quot;efficiency&quot; is a bit flung around freely. It can be total prevention of infection, or it can be reduction of symptoms in case of infection... So on and so forth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be good, but as far as I know, they aren't able to produce the batches reliably to confirm with good pharma standards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik, the main issue with Sputnik is actually production standards, not the vaccine. To import to EU, for example, specific criteria at the production facilities need to be met, and since Sputnik is produced in a hell lot of different places, while ensuring each batch is truly produced at the given, say, approved facility, it's a massive bureaucratic nightmare atm to figure out. </p>
<p>Plus documentation from trials follows guidelines that slightly differ between, say, Russia and EU and would need to be made to compliance, which is yet another bureaucratic nightmare.</p></div>		</li>
