			<div class="markdown"><p>There was no uniform rule, but most TSA agents insisted that they observe the laptop screen change in some manner -- presumably proving you weren't faking them out with a static image.</p>
<p>It was a silly requirement, and it didn't last long. TSA tweaked the rules pretty frequently back then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, there were actually laptops that advertised a feature that allowed them to quickly boot up into a simplified OS, enough to convince the TSA agents that it was a real computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, what would really happen is you would open, turn it on, the screen would light up (even the “light black” screen), they would say OK and you would close it and stuff it back in the bag.
Because the sleep technology was crappy then, and you hadn’t allowed it to fully boot, the laptop would be on in your bag and when you pulled it out, it would be the temperature of the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back then I forgot to take my laptop out of my bag and place into another tray.  A stern TSA agent took me aside for a one-on-one inspection.  He was swabbing it with some kind of weird paper to, presumably, see if it was a bomb and in my nervousness, I say &quot;Man, that's some CSI shit!&quot;.  He turned around and deadpanned:  &quot;Naw, that's some FBI shiaaat&quot;.  He was cool</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Institutional inertia and irrational loss aversion work pretty well as explanations, too.</p>
<p>You run no risk for being the guy whose name does not appear on a memo authorizing change.</p>
<p>But if something goes wrong, you'd better believe that the people who slipped up will deflect blame from themselves by digging up some memo with your name on it authorizing a rational shift in procedures based on a detailed cost-benefit analysis. Better not to be the guy with his name on the memo.</p></div>		</li>
