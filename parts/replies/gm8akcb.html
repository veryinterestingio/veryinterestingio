			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually there is valid scientific concern about giving these vaccines to children.</p>
<p>First children have very low rates of adverse effects from covid-19.  It's unclear where covid-19 is more dangerous to them than other childhood viral infections.</p>
<p>Second, unlike all traditional vaccines, mrna vaccines express viral epitopes in host cells, leading to concerns about increased immunogenicity and higher rates of autoimmune induction in people with immature immune systems: ie children.</p>
<p>The combination of low risk from covid 19 and legitimate unknowns regarding behavior of these new vaccines in children means the risk reward ratio is not there to justify use.</p>
<p>Very careful clinical trials have to be conducted to push down the age range into adolescents and then children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my thinking too....we should be vaccinating against people for whom the disease is known to be dangerous.  It doesn't appear to spread well or be particularly harmful to young children, so the best strategy is to immunize the spreaders of the disease and not subject the kids to experimental vaccines.  </p>
<p>I'm more than willing to take an MRNA vaccine.  If the science says it's safe to give it to my kids I'll give it to my kids too.  But if we can control the disease without needing to give this stuff to kids, I think that's a positive thing.  </p>
<p>My guess is the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is going to get approved for children long before phizer or moderna's vaccine will.  That's a much more traditional type of vaccine with more history behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would making host cells produce a small part of the virus via a vaccine be more dangerous than making host cells produce all parts of the virus via a real COVID-19 infection?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) what usually hurts people the most in covid-19 infections is the host immune reaction.</p>
<p>2) a vaccine dose induces an intense amount of expression of the selected viral epitope along side additional immune stimulants in the local area where the vaccine is administered.  To the body this looks like an extraordinarily severe virus infection.</p>
<p>3) unlike the virus, the lipid nanoparticles will indiscriminately put the rna into a different spectrum of cells than the viruses' natural targets.  For example, nerve cells.</p>
<p>4) When you have the above happening in a young person without a mature immune system, there's a valid worry that the immune system may get confused and start recognizing host cells for attack (eg nerve cells).  This happens on occasion with virus infections and can precipitate serious autoimmune conditions.</p>
<p>5) in children where covid-19 rarely ever cause any issues, one would worry that the harm in the risk of severe autoimmune reactions can outweigh the benefit of protection from a mostly harmless cold.</p>
<p>6) the above is a valid worry not an established fact.  The immune system and it's interactions with vaccines are extraordinarily complex to the point that no one can predict what would happen.  This is why one has wait for very careful clinical trials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While not unsafe per se, the dosage typically needs to be lower for children. Take for example Tylenol, the amount an adult takes is more than a 5 year old.</p>
<p>Typically they approve vaccines/ drugs for adults 18+ first, then do studies with different dosages for youths 12+. Then children, and finally infants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. The pneumavax vaccine has a high dose because it's intended for seniors with a weak immune system. If someone younger who is on immune suppressants for some reason (and thus has a <em>slightly</em> weakened immune system) is given the vaccine that higher dose will hit them like a truck. Still better than getting such though.</p></div>		</li>
