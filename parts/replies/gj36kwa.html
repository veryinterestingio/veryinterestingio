			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/talrogsmash is right that the reintroduction of wolves caused a trophic cascade in Yellowstone's ecosystem that included a boom in the bird population, but I'm pretty sure they're wrong about it being because of deer eating from bird nests.</p>
<p>As I've always understood it, the deer would normally eat the little sprouts and saplings of trees, and because the wolves ate the deer, more trees were able to grow. In addition to literally changing the course of many brooks in the park (shrubs near the waterside that would normally be eaten weren't, therefore the water's edge stopped eroding at its previous rate), these trees provided natural habitats for more birds as well.</p>
<p>The only mention of birds on Yellowstone's page about the reintroduction of wolves only references them in reference to the increase in trees.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about, say, Koalas?  They eat strictly eucalyptus leaves which are even toxic to most other animals.  I understand the tolerance to the toxins, but they're still basically leaves.  Where are they getting their fats, carbohydrates, and sugars from?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has replied to you, so:</p>
<p>Everything is derived from the eucalyptus leaves. Carbohydrates, sugars and fats (or, well, the building blocks of fats: <del>amino</del> FATTY acids) are all contained in eucalyptus leaves. Koalas also don't need that much fat, as they have low body fat. Koalas just have to eat a ton of eucalyptus leaves to fulfill their survival needs. </p>
<p>This is normally fine, however, as koalas don't really have any natural predators. Some animals may prey on koalas, but koalas are not the primary food source for those animals. Additionally, eucalypse leaves have a very high water content (they're 55% water), so koalas can subsist solely on the leaves for hydration and don't have to worry about finding a typical water source. As such, it's possible for them to spend all day eating.</p>
<p>EDIT: Amino to fatty</p></div>		</li>

<h1>Koalas are terrible animals</h1>
<p>Koalas  are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to  body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A  brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present  a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the  koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their  feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food,  they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal  that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the  likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally  to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have  almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to  think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are  awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking  satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value,  koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike  their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any  mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh  plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have  teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their  lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their  mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break  down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when  their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by  starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being  mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest  milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey  needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to  eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it  doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut  flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins  nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually  fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on.  This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to  start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have  needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from  incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some  areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped  by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their  precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem  to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female  regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag  them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the  brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid  in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should  they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in  special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.</p>
<p>Tldr;  Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They  look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why it is that these  things bother me---it just makes me picture a seven year old first  discovering things about an animal and, having no context about the  subject, ranting about how stupid they are. I get it's a joke, but  people take it as an actual, educational joke like it's a man yelling at  the sea, and that's just wrong. Furthermore, these things have an  actual impact on discussions about conservation efforts---If every time  Koalas get brought up, someone posts this copypasta, that means it's  seriously shaping public opinion about the animal and their supposed  lack of importance.</p>

<p>Non-ecologists always talk this way, and the problem is you’re looking at this backwards.</p>
<p>An  entire continent is covered with Eucalyptus trees. They suck the  moisture out of the entire surrounding area and use allelopathy to  ensure that most of what’s beneath them is just bare red dust. No animal  is making use of them——they have virtually no herbivore predator. A  niche is empty. Then inevitably, natural selection fills that niche by  creating an animal which can eat Eucalyptus leaves. Of course, it takes  great sacrifice for it to be able to do so——it certainly can’t expend  much energy on costly things. Isn’t it a good thing that a niche is  being filled?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This applies to all herbivores, because the wild is not a grocery store—where meat is just sitting next to celery.</p>
<p>Herbivores  gradually wear their teeth down—carnivores fracture their teeth, and  break their bones in attempting to take down prey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's  pretty typical of herbivores, and is higher than many, many species.  According to Ashwell (2008), their encephalisation quotient is 0.5288  +/- 0.051. Higher than comparable marsupials like the wombat (\~0.52),  some possums (\~0.468), cuscus (\~0.462) and even some wallabies are  &lt;0.5. According to wiki, rabbits are also around 0.4, and they're  placental mammals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again,  this is not unique to koalas. Brain folds (gyri) are not present in  rodents, which we consider to be incredibly intelligent for their size.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If  you present a human with a random piece of meat, they will not  recognise it as food (hopefully). Fresh leaves might be important for  koala digestion, especially since their gut flora is clearly important  for the digestion of Eucalyptus. It might make sense not to screw with  that gut flora by eating decaying leaves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because  eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to  ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains,  they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's  an extremely weird reason to dislike an animal. But whilst we're  talking about their digestion, let's discuss their poop. It's  delightful. It smells like a Eucalyptus drop!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being  mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the  lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marsupial  milk is incredibly complex and much more interesting than any  placentals. This is because they raise their offspring essentially from  an embryo, and the milk needs to adapt to the changing needs of a  growing fetus. And yeah, of course the yield is low; at one point they  are feeding an animal that is half a gram!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When  the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances  like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly  clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the  necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey  begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea  (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to  slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he  needs to start developing his digestive system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humans  probably do this, we just likely do it during childbirth. You know how  women often shit during contractions? There is evidence to suggest that  this innoculates a baby with her gut flora. A child born via cesarian  has significantly different gut flora for the first six months of life  than a child born vaginally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of  course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She  may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are  riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or  higher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chlamydia was  introduced to their populations by humans. We introduced a novel  disease that they have very little immunity to, and is a major  contributor to their possible extinction. Do you hate Native Americans  because they were killed by smallpox and influenza?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This  statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities  koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being  seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will  simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she  fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost every animal does this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>which  brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than  average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to  protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An  animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I  fucking hate them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Errmmm..  They have protection against falling from a tree, which they spend 99%  of their life in? Yeah... That's a stupid adaptation.  </p>
