			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>Sometimes the opposite happens, which is what OP is asking about.</p>
<p>The Trauma does not get recorded, but certain triggers within what should have been recorded still elicits a response like they either feel that they should have responded to the traumatic event, or exactly how they did respond.</p>
<p>Then, with long-term, repeated, trauma; you can get active dissociation triggered by smallish details or events that manifest in various ways. From the affore-mentioned same/opposite reaction, to drastic personality shifts; in any of these manifestations, the sufferer doesn't remember what had happened after the trigger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My PTSD was caused by a traumatic, non-combat-related military event, yet my memories of it are very segmented and feel as if I'm remembering a movie that I saw once. As if the memories aren't even mine, but a story someone told me that I really related to. I'm glad my trauma isn't a 4k memory. Fuck that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine were very movie like. Please seek an EMDR trauma therapist. That shit will disappear quickly, but it will take some time with a CBT therapist the other side of it to get right.</p>
<p>Worth it. Life changing. Let me know if I can help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Experimental about 8 years ago only approved in Europe. Watch the show Wilfred for a good or decent description. Basically lights with hypnosis. Tries to unlock things in your brain locked. However the treatment allows you to view it relive it and process it.</p></div>		</li>
