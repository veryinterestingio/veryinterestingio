			<div class="markdown"><p>Although candles CAN create quite a bit of soot, which you inhale when in a badly ventilated room, like in your house. This effect is largest when you blow out the candle (as you can clearly see from the smoke emerging from the wick).</p>
<p>You can largely deminish the smoke formation by extinguishing the flame in the molten wax itself, f.e. by bending the wick over into the wax with a used match.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, that isn't smoke when you blow it out. It's vaporised wax.
You can actually relight a candle by holding a flame to the top of the the stream of vaporised wax &quot;smoke&quot;, and the flame will spread down the stream of vaporised wax and relight the candle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Will try this sometime, but I'm pretty sure there is some &quot;smoke&quot; involved as well, as there will be a lot of sooth when you let the smoke touch any object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know for sure, but I'm confident you'd exhale more water than you inhale.  If you were to inhale that much from a candle, you'd probably deprive yourself of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question. I've seen some people reuse candle wax and that it works, but a long time ago I saw that supposedly that wasn't possible because the was is burnt in the first run. How is this possible if the wax was burnt? Or there may be some wax leftover from the first burn?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the shape of the candle, some runs off before it burns.  If the candle is wide, there's a good chance that it'll all be able to burn.  If it's skinny, some will spill over the side, which you can collect and burn later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh so the thing that drips is wax too. I don't know why I had the concept that the thing that dripped to the sides wasn't wax because all wax in a candle &quot;burns&quot; in the first burn. I guess I had a huge misunderstanding somewhere when I saw that video or comment or whatever. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>
