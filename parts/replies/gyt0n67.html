			<div class="markdown"><p>lignin is an organic polymer that makes up the key structural component of plants, where it not only gives mechanical strength but also plays an important role in transporting water and as a defence against disease, where the lignin can function similarly to the platelets in animal blood; it forms a scab like structure around infected or wounded areas to protect the plant from further damage</p></div>		</li>

They keep piling up and up, then one day lightning strikes, and an entire region of dead dried out wood gets violently incinerated in the extremely oxygen-rich atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Aside from the thousands of years bit... That's what's happening in the forests around Chernobyl.  The hottest areas of radiation killed off the microbes crucial to breaking down leaf and bark litter.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That theory is disputed, and is probably not correct. It's true that lots of coal was formed during the carboniferous period, but <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/9/2442" target="_blank">a lot of that organic matter appears to come from non-lignin sources</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No the equation is what we are taught in grade school.  Oil comes from dinosaurs.  Even pictures in science books were showing that.  Iâ€™m 36 years old and Remember learning that oil was from dinosaurs. Hell I just found out now that it was plankton that is making up most of the oil.  I mean not much we can do except to learn as we go.</p></div>		</li>
