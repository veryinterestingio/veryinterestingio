			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally yes, there are certain use cases for it though. Its used for decompression stops (when appropriate) or for use in a rebreather. </p>
<p>It is dangerous though, a friend of friend died from O2 toxicity after a mistake on a dive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I like the implication that firefighters do worry about it a little bit.</p>
<p>&quot;Shit! Fire at Dr. Killall's underwater lair. Which way should I orient my tank!?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ignoring barotrauma and the benz water pressure has a significant impact on air consumption.  Let us assume your lungs inflate to 6l so each breath is 6l of air.  Now you experience 1 atmosphere of pressure for every 33' of water column so at 66' you are under 1ATA (air above the water) + 2 ATA (water column, 33'/2) = 3 Atmospheres of pressure.  That means your lungs now hold 6l x 3 = 18l of air had you been on the surface so you are now consuming air at 3x the rate had you been on the surface.  Now that is overly simplified but holds true in general.</p></div>		</li>
