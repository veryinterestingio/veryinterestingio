			<div class="markdown"><p>This. A lot of people believe that stretching/rolling is doing some structural change to muscles... But muscles are strong and pliable, so most normal physical manipulation of them does nothing to them structurally but move them around.</p>
<p>Certainly rolling something over them or stretching them gently won't physically modify the structure of the muscles themselves.</p>
<p>Instead muscles are very responsive to neural signals. They both send a lot perception signals and respond to signals by either contracting or relaxing.</p>
<p>So, for example, during a stretch, the muscles will detect the stretch and tense in order to prevent damage. After the stretch stops, the muscles then react by relaxing (maybe because of opponent process theory). And when you stretch and get more flexible it might be because your body is habituating to the stretched position and no longer tensing as much as to protect against damage.</p>
<p>Scientists now believe neural is a much bigger part of stretching/rolling/massage than physical/structural changes to the muscles.</p>

<p>Edit: In terms of non-muscular effects of stretching/rolling... Some claim they do something called myofascial release. However, there are few good quality studies. The high quality experiments seem to confer some short term physical benefits, but the overall mechanism of these benefits is not well understood and there are not many studies on the topic: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3718355/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3718355/</a> So until I read more studies, I would call myofascial release a theoretical treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point you're not explaining is that a lot of those stretching and foam rolling modalities are there to lower cns activity, from there the improved mobility can be used in strengthening  exercises in order to maintain that range of motion and decreased pain. Your muscle may be tight because your Cns is telling it to be tight, But you forget to mention that the Cns is telling it to be tight either due to micro trauma from exercise or muscular imbalance. So strengthening the muscles in a balanced way after doing something like stretching or foam rolling is fine if it allows you to reach ranges of motion in your strengthening exercises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree. We’ve learned it would take about 30 minutes with a static stretch to barely begin to lengthen muscle tissue. </p>
<p>As for rolling, there isn’t enough force to break up adhesions, and if you were to generate the appropriate amount of force you could potentially damage the tissue you were trying to “stretch” or “loosen up” in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you’re telling me that the knot I feel in this muscle, here, does not change by physically massaging it, but that by massaging it I’m telling the CNS to let it release, and THEN it breaks up and relaxes?</p>
<p>That no amount of physically motion around the area can change it unless the CNS sends the release signal to that specific part of the muscle?</p>
<p>Then why don’t knots release in our sleep?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a licensed massage therapist, this is definitely true. Also massage encourages increased blood flow to the area and promotes circulation in general. Bringing more blood to an area= bringing oxygen and other nutrients carried in the blood to your muscles helping them recover better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the person/situation, but the simplest answer is it's probably not actually going away completely, so when you continue doing the actions causing the knots/adhesions/trigger points they tend to come back in the same spot, or at least in the same muscle. It can take multiple massage sessions to treat stubborn ones!</p></div>		</li>
