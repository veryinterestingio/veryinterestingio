			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds don’t have to! They’re one of the most successful lineages on the planet. They’ve survived multiple mass extinctions and are doing quite well even now. Birds are adept hunters covering every niche, from insects, fish, small mammals, and other birds—they have speed, dexterity, and flight on their side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't every species alive part of &quot;the most successful lineages on the planet?&quot; It's kind of the point of evolution.</p>
<p>Edit: Should we say that a species is more successful if it had remained relatively unchanged for a longer time, or if it has evolved more over time? I can see both ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fossil records show us a &quot;species&quot; only lasts 1 to 2 million years at the longest, before going extinct and replaced by something else.  Even if the replacement is extremely similar.  But regardless birds as a whole are one of the most well off linneages. Birds are actually considered a sub group of reptiles that survived the dinosaur meteor 70 million years ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could base it on number of species, which would make birds much more successful than say Nautiloids or Horseshoe crabs.</p>
<p>Of course it's completely arbitrary where you make distinctions between groups of species so it's not that useful. Maybe there can be an epic showdown between protostomes and deuterostomes can decide which is best :)</p></div>		</li>
