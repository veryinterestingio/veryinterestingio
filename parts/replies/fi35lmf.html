			<div class="markdown"><p>But what is the wolf equivalent of cats' ancestor? Can they all trace back to a tiger or something? This also makes me wonder if wolves -&gt; dogs is as neat as they say. The wolf ancestor was probably not the same as today's,  right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unlike dogs, which have been bred into a myriad of at-one-time-useful shapes, cats never had a wide range of uses. Eat mice, job done. Indeed, <em>dogs</em> were bred as ratters.</p>
<p>Other than the inbreeding with domestic dogs and the extinction of many species, wolves wouldn't have been much different in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the quiz/comedy show QI (which I don't trust greatly), dogs have a genetic feature called something like &quot;slippery genes&quot; where they naturally diverge greatly in breeding.  All other domesticated animals have weight ranges between breeds way smaller than dogs do (which is &gt;30:1).  Cats are maybe not the best counterexample, but if we could change the weight of sheep by a similar amount, we would have huge fuckin' sheep making a lot of meat.</p>
<p>Edit: the heaviest sheep is the Suffolk, weighing up to 400 pounds.  The smallest is the Quessant, but I can't find weight figures.  The Suffolk is up to 80 cm tall while the Quessant is limited to 49 cm, so the Quessant is theoretically (scaling with the cube of height) about 92 pounds, a ratio of 4.3:1.</p>
<p>Going back to cats, Maine coons go up to 25 pounds while Singapuras go up to 4 pounds, a ratio of 6.25:1.</p>
<p>Dogs are very different.</p>
<p>Edit: forgot to ask my question.  Are cats more similar than dogs because they've got one role, or are they more similar partly because of genetics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgot to ask my question in my other reply.  Dogs are supposed to have &quot;slippery genes&quot;. Are cats more similar than dogs only because they've got one role, or is there a genetic role?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dogs ancestor would have been very similar to a wolf, and there was probably a lot of inter-breeding between many generations of companion dogs and wolves, because the dogs advantage to us was to protect us from other wild animals like bears and cougars/ saber tooth cats. It needed to be large and aggressive to do that. </p>
<p>A domestic cats ancestor would have been similar to a... normal domestic cat. Because its use was to control rat and pest populations and tigers and lions aren't exactly keen on chasing rats.</p></div>		</li>
