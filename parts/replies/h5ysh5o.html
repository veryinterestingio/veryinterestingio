			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of astronauts have only been in space for minutes or less than a day. The main thing is they usually have another job: test pilot, pilot, engineer, biologist. We could go on for days with examples, but they’re put up in space to do a job and it’s funded through different things. Bezos paid for a joyride.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Shepard took control of the spacecraft twice for brief periods; his flight plan called for him to manually position the capsule for retrofire, and he corrected a slight pitch problem on the positioning of the craft in one instance. In the second, he took control for a brief period during reentry of the capsule's attitude.</p>
