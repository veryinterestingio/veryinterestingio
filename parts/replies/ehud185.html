			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it keeps starting and stopping movement since you only take one step at a time, so it's also measuring forward and backward forces.</p>
<p>Really everything but your head moves quite a bit when you walk unless you're looking at something in your hands (which is only stabilized to match your head.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hip pocket is the best place to count steps with a phone.</p>
<p>A chest pocket or anything else that is dampened more, like a big winter jacket makes those shocks less pronounced.</p>
<p>But if the software is good enough it can still notice those steps.</p>
<p>You can install one of the countless apps from the app store that shows you the raw data from the accelerometer and see how miniscule the acceleration has to be for the numbers to change.</p>
<p>Either way, your whole body is moving up and down when walking, unless you are a bird. (in the bird case it would count steps by the acceleration and deceleration of the birds head in direction of movement, whereas in humans it notes the up and down movement)</p></div>		</li>
