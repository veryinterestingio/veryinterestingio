			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was on lithium I was constantly, urgently having to pee. Now that I'm off, I still get nervous before appointments or movies, etc. when I struggled to hold it while on lithium. Is that amount of preventative peeing gonna have an effect, or only if you did it like daily?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm afraid I'm not really qualified to answer that question sorry. I've no clue about the act of lithium on the body over time, and whatever residual effects it may have on the bladder or other things, I think seeing your doctor if you're worried is a good starting point. They can point you to other sources of information, too, like therapists or physiotherapists (depending on where you live there are specialist physios who deal with that area specifically).</p>
<p>Weak muscles can get stronger, and you can rewire your brain, so if you're a healthy adult doing pelvic floor exercises and other things (maybe like meditation/mindfulness, counselling or whatever if you're still having a bit of anxiety over the peeing) should help theoretically. The human body has incredible capacity to change or get better, it's just not something that is a one-and-done thing, you often have to work on it. But like I said talking to a doc is better than listening to some random person on the internet :)</p></div>		</li>
