<p>Is this layery-ness the reason that they tend to be brittle and break in clean straight lines?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For single crystals, yes. I'd guess that commercial magnets don't have very large grains so they'd be a bunch of tiny (10s of microns?) crystals in different orientation so a crack wouldn't have a single plane to break through. The alignment with the magnetic field might re-align this to some degree, but in my experience magnets break in whatever direction they want, not parallel or normal to the magnetic field. The crystal does contribute to the stiffness and ability to deform without breaking, so Nd2Fe14B (and ferrite for that matter) is probably just more brittle than most materials you see and when a crack starts it'll continue roughly straight in whatever direction it was going instead of deforming the material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnets work by having free electrons all spinning the same way. Neodymium adds more free electrons and the specific ratio of neodymium to iron to boron that they use is especially good at getting a lot of these electron spins working together.</p></div>		</li>
