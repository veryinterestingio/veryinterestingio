			<div class="markdown"><p>Not waves in the air. Ultrasonic waves coupled though liquid. Air (gas) is compressible and a poor way to transmit significant energy. Water is for all intents and purposes is incompressible, thus more of the mechanical energy generated by the toothbrush is delivered to the target. The higher the frequency (ultrasonic) the shorter the wavelength thus can cause mechanical fluctuations of the liquid with suspended abrasive grit (tooth paste) into smaller nooks and crevasses, such as the narrowing chasm between your gums and teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do ultrasonics even exist in the consumer market? In the office we use them for scaling and things but as far as I am aware, only sonic exists on the consumer market due to cost, ease of use, etc. An ultrasonic used improperly could and would cause major damage.</p></div>		</li>
