			<div class="markdown"><p>So is this interpretation correct?</p>
<p>The photons ARE passing between the atoms of the medium, but the electromagnetism of the light causes the electrons of the atoms to generate their own electromagnetic field, which because it is oscillating regularly due to the lights waves, creates electromagnetic waves that interact with the light waves in such a way as to reduce their overall speed? If, through superposition, the heights of two interacting waves is the sum of two contributing waves, then are lights interactions (interference) with matter always guaranteed to be destructive rather than constructive? Meaning why wouldn't it be possible for lights interaction with the matter to hypothetically increase its speed? Obviously light speed is already the maximum, but is that the reason why? Why couldn't it experience constructive interference? Or am I misinterpreting the relationship between superposition and the resulting speed of the wave?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For this explanation, you really need to drop the notion of photons altogether. Trying to have any sort of understanding of why this is happening from the perspective of particles will prevent you from having a true understanding of what is going on. A good thing to keep in mind in general is in reality, there is no such thing as a &quot;wave-particle duality&quot;. There are only waves, but we can treat them as particles under <em>certain conditions</em>. This is one of the conditions where we cannot treat the wave nature of light as a particle. If that's at all confusing, consider Newtonian mechanics against General Relativity. General Relativity is always the case, but under some conditions (standard everyday earth conditions), Newtonian mechanics does just fine. </p>
<p>Because the two composing waves are moving at different speeds, there are alternating times of constructive and destructive interference. It isn't just one or the other, and in fact it's that principle that allows the superposition wave to travel at a speed different than the two composing waves. If they were always constructive or always destructive, that would imply that both waves were moving at the same speed, and thus the combined wave too would be moving at the same speed. Please see the first video I posted to have a visual understanding of that. </p>
<p>As far as possibly increasing the speed of light, the best I can tell you is physics says no. I don't have a good grasp on the effects of phase velocity on group velocity (Composing wave effects on superposition wave), I'm simply aware of the phenomenon. Not taking into consideration the limit of the speed of light, I would be inclined to say that it seems like it could be a possibility, however that fundamental limit is there for a reason. I highly encourage checking out that first video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, thats a great explanation. I watched the first video and that's what inspired the question about increasing its speed because they showed an example where the resulting wave was faster than the comprising waves. But I'm also better understanding what you were trying to explain with regards to photons. I forgot that photons don't actually &quot;exist&quot; independently. They are the result of the points where the electric field and magnetic field interact correct? </p>
<p>Sorry to ask so much, Optics was one of the things I never studied in physics (it just didnt interest me as much as the other options). But now im kinda goin down the rabbit hole. </p>
<p>On these images below, which displays where the &quot;photon&quot; occurs?</p>
<p>Is the &quot;photon&quot; occuring where the two waves cross?</p>

<p>or is it at the peaks?</p>

<p>Or is the entirety of the wave's interaction the photon?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are in fact man-made metamaterials with a negative index of refraction, with interesting results. Phase velocity can be increased beyond what the material normally supports, but the light speed limit is never broken.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each type of atom responds differently to different wavelengths of light. In general, there are three responses to incoming light - absorb, reflect, refract/pass through.</p>
<p>In the case of a transparent material, all visible wavelengths of light pass through. For glass specifically, ultraviolet light is absorbed by the atoms.</p></div>		</li>
