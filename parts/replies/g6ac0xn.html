			<div class="markdown"><p>Butterflies come from the constructing of blood vessels in your intestine, because the blood is sent to more important areas to help you fight a stressor. The same hormone that causes this construction also causes your anal sphincter to relax. So your intestine has slowed down on pulling the water out of what you are digesting, but your anal sphincter muscle is more relaxed. This results in you wanting to use the restroom, and more water being in your poop</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this all the time and I fucking hate it. I get extremely anxious in new situations and it just makes it worse because i have to make sure I'm near a toilet. The first week of my new job I had to shit on the side of the road every morning because there aren't any toilets on the way. </p>
<p>I've tried lots of things to help with the anxiety but to no avail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert but I believe so, it’s your body getting ready to fight or flight. In your case, empty the bowels so your body doesn’t  have to expend energy on digestion. Some people feel nauseous, which is emptying the stomach, digestion again.  Like the top comment says, your body doesn’t feel digestion is necessary as it prepares to fight or run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. The body’s response to adrenaline includes a relaxation of the muscles around the anal sphincter. Nausea is caused by the upset of the equilibrium of the good bacteria in your stomach</p></div>		</li>
