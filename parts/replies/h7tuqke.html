			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually skin prick test for 3 different things - I think egg, egg white, and raw egg. I think most of the proteins responsible are in the white (my daughter reacted to all the skin pricks). She can't have scrambled egg, fried egg, boiled egg, poached egg, omelette, quiche etc. Those are probably the things we have most often but other things include homemade meringue, lemon curd, mayonnaise, homemade bread coated foods if egg has been used to bind the breadcrumbs to the food. My daughter does tolerate egg in fresh egg pasta (shop bought) but probably wouldn't if it was homemade - a lot of shop bought foods are like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can use just yolk to do homemade pasta. You might wanna add another yolk to replace the liquid worth of a white, but the yolk is the holds stuff together part. The flour can have enough protein.  Thatâ€™s weird though I thought mayonnaise was yolk only as well. </p>
