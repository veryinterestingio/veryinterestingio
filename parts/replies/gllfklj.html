			<div class="markdown"><p>the immersiveness of a binaural recording depends on how similar their recording mics are to your individual ear/head shape</p>
<p>some people will have a more immersive experience than others because the natural shape of their head and ears lines up better with the mics that were used</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this not something that could be made to people's preference, and 'faked' using sound filtering?</p>
<p>EG record it with microphones in a ring to capture the source, then filter sounds from 'behind' different to ones in front, etc.  </p>
<p>Could this not be used for games/movies and processed in realtime, and calibrated for the individual person's headphones &amp; ears?</p></div>		</li>

<p>t that's why 2 ears are nice).  The way you tell is more trained than an actual knowledge.  The sounds you hear from behind are always very slightly muffled, but your brain recognizes them as sounds it's heard b</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if that is why my laptop speakers are able to project sound as if it is coming from behind, at least in some games. Maybe they use that muffle technique?</p></div>		</li>
