			<div class="markdown"><p>Your &quot;random_static.gif&quot; is probably bad. I mean, it's technically possible that it's just a super weird coincidence, but I just created a random image on my computer and it more closely resembles your picture of the TV.</p>
<p>Most likely your &quot;random_static.gif&quot; is a picture of perlin noise or something similar. That's not really random. It's a type of noise that is designed to give you some sort of pattern. It's so you can randomly place skid marks on roads or natural terrain or something like that. Truly pseudo-random noise looks more how you would expect.</p>
<p>To create a random noise picture in linux with imagemagick, try the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>dd if=/dev/urandom bs=512 count=512 of=tmp.dat
convert -depth 8 -size 512x512 gray:tmp.dat tmp.png</code></pre>
<p>That's really random static. It looks how you would expect. If you don't trust pseudo-random numbers, you can replace /dev/urandom with /dev/random but it will take a lot longer and I can guarantee it will look identical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WAIT. I remembered some other vague detail about the fact I'm trying to remember. It wasn't to do with a single image of static, but that you can perceive motion in the static. Like bugs flying around the screen. I'm sure there was some technical reason for it, that it wasn't just a trick of the brain finding patterns in randomness but there was in fact a pattern.</p>
<p>This is driving me nuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TV's produce a picture by scanning in horizontal rows. Any vertical bands would require a strong signal that is a harmonic of the screen's width. Any horizontal bands would indicate a signal with a wavelength longer than the horizontal rows.</p>
<p>White noise doesn't have any dominant frequency at all, instead it's made up of noise at every frequency of about the same amplitude.</p>
<p>I'd say that second sample is a very different kind of random signal.</p></div>		</li>
