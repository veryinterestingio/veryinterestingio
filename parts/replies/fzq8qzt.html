There is no need to worry about handling an extremely large amount of connections being made at this moment. As time passes by, we can imagine that more quantum nodes will be connected to the quantum internet. But remember, quantum technologies will also become more mature and more powerful,  which will generate sufficient entangled particles to handle the extreme scenarios you mentioned. (Wenji)</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> For point-to-point communication, creating entangled particles is not too hard. Commercial companies can already make sources of entangled photons for example. The bandwidth is still fairly low but it may not be a big technological leap to faster bandwidth. However entangling multiple quantum nodes for a real quantum internet is still a great challenge and for now the amount of connections will remain fairly small. This is exactly why a lot of efforts must be made now to improve the technology and prepare for large demands in the future. (Gary)</p></div>		</li>
