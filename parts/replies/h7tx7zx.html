<p>Here’s one of the articles about it if you would like to read more. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much strength would it need to have? Is it comparable to say, a MRI scanner unit? How many Tesla (or Gauss) would it need to produce in order for it to have a sufficient magnetic field, or even as strong as on Earth?</p>
<p>Do we even have the current technology for it?</p>
<p>Sorry for asking all these questions, I’m so curious :D</p>
<p>Edit: according to Wiki regarding the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_(unit)" target="_blank">Gauss</a> scale, Earth’s magnetic field is about .25-0.6 G, and in its core 25 G. A refrigerator magnet produces a similar amount, a MRI produces well over that with 3000–70000 G.</p>
<p>Hmmm. With the distance at the L1 point, would a satelite that generates a magnetic field comparable to that of <del>a refrigerator magnet suffice… perhaps an iron magnet, or a neodymium one?</del> I’m not well versed in these mathematics and physics.</p>
<p>Edit: should’ve read the article. <strong>At the L1 point, a 1-2 Tesla, ie. a 10,000-20,000 G dipole magnet</strong> should suffice. So something like a loudspeaker magnet/the core of a 50/60 Hz power transformer should suffice. A safer bet might be a modern <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium_magnet" target="_blank">neodymium</a> magnet. Yup, seems like we do have the tech for it, nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this idea. This set up would also eliminate the loss a atmosphere at the planet's poles. The magnetic field lines are eminating from the satellite, not Mars. Mars would just need to be in magnetic eddy? shadow?</p></div>		</li>
