			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely not, due to incompatible microbiomes. Their little germy friends are tailored to their bodies, and the large volume of grass. They probably wouldnt benefit us at all. Would be pretty sweet though. Eat nothing but flavored grass chunks with added vitamins and minerals, never be hungry again, and get SUPER JACKED</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would absolutely trial this though. Imagine summer comes along and you started working out too late? Not with the patented Horse Gut Diet! Alter your diet for just 3 months and come out strong enough to Fred Flinstone a Smart car and lift it out of it's parking spot on the way out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also their digestive system is designed for it where ours is not. Look up ruminant digestion and you'll see they usually have very different intestinal layouts. It's a big difference from us compared to say gorillas, where chimps are closer to ours, just as example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses are hindgut fermenters just like gorillas (and humans) are. So while rumen bacteria from a cow might not be a good fit for us, possibly the large intestinal bacteria from gorillas or horses might be. But we don't really have large enough large intestines to house sufficient numbers of these bacteria to rely much on them.</p></div>		</li>
