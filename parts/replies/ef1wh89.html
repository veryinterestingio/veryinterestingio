I already read you three stories, it’s time to go to bed. I don’t know why. No, you can’t eat out of the dog’s bowl. Why are your pants off? Where did you get that? For the love of god, just go to sleep.</p>

Then you can wake up after hours of sleep feeling like you just ran full speed into a wall, in addition to wondering exactly where the fuck you are for the first 5-10 minutes you are awake, because you have been dreaming for the real-time equivalent of days on end.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I did a sleep study about a year ago which also tracked my positions. IIRC, 70% of the time I was lying on my back, 7 % on one side, 13 % on the other side, and 10% face down (rough figures from memory).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep studies are awesome in every way except for the fact you can't fall asleep 90% of the time. They hook up all kinds of pads to you to measure movement, oxygen levels, sleep state, respiration. Then they also video tape you, with someone actually watching you all night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good news is that insurance companies are more willing to pay for home ones (cheaper, and actually can be more accurate) so you don't have to sleep in a hospital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? That sounds like something you should discuss with your doctor. Maybe there is something to fix that?
Ive heard of a device to prevent you from rolling onto your back. (some ppl apparebtly only have apnea when lying on their backs). Its like a bump or a tennis ball you strap onto your back which would be super uncomfortable to lie on. </p></div>		</li>
