			<div class="markdown"><p>Please correct me if I'm wrong at any stage but what I'm hearing is the body's immune system is the one that is doing the majority of fight once you are infected with Covid19. </p>
<p>So what can one do to make sure their immune system is in good condition in the unlikely case they are actually infected? Besides being in complete lockdown and taking every precaution to never contract the disease in the first place, what else can we do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know any specific ways to Boost the immune system besides eating well, getting sleep, exercising and reducing stress.</p>
<p>Maybe supplements work, maybe another redditor has better, more specific advice for how to strengthen it, but these are the things I've been working on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make sure your diet has plenty of Vitamin C (Ripe Bell Peppers, Peas, and Citrus are good sources), and make sure you get plenty of Vitamin D (exposure to about 20 minutes of sunshine a day should be enough).  Supplements may help, but good diet  is considered a better source.</p>
<p>Wash your hands.  Seriously, hand washing will protect you more than just about anything else.  Sanitize surfaces that get touched a lot.  I went shopping this morning.  I have hand sanitizer in the car, and the first thing I do once I open the door is sanitize my hands.  When I get home, I wash my hands well first thing.  Then I go and use a Clorox wipe to sanitize all the surfaces I touched, including the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read, zinc can be helpful in reducing duration of infection. </p>
<p>Also, Echinacea extracts has been shown to have wonderful effects with Rhinoviruses (incidence of rhinovirus caused cold and reduction of illness time) <em>and some</em> effects with coronaviruses (although not many cov virus studies exist with echinacea).</p></div>		</li>
