			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Thank you for doing this AMA!</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve heard multiple times now that solar energy is not really sustainable because the raw materials (like mined minerals, sand, etc.) and industrial processes to required to produce photovoltaic panels have a great energy (most likely non-renewable) demand and ecological footprint that doesn’t actually “pay for itself” with time. And than there’s an additional issue in case it’s connected to the conventional power grid. They say that other more traditional sources of energy, like hydropower, aside from the initial environmental impact to build a plant, are actually much more “sustainable”. So is this true? And if so, are there currently ways to fix these issues regarding solar panels?</li>
<li>What are some exciting clean energy sources or technologies we should be looking forward to see in the future?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy required to make a solar panel is generated by the panel in about 1 year and the panel lifetime is about 30 years, so it is 96.7% carbon free. As we go to 100% renewables, PV becomes 100% carbon free.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For existing nuclear, if it requires subsidy, we should close the plant because it will result in greater CO2 than if we use the subsidy money to replace the plant with renewables:</p>

<p>If it doesn't require subsidy and it is otherwise safe (and that is key), it can stay open until natural retirement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The IPCC consider <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8PxCeMG" target="_blank">a smaller value</a> for nuclear (12)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IPCC does not advocate a single value. It advocates a range of 4-110 g-CO2/kWh. This is the only value/range stated in the actual text of the IPCC (2014) energy assessment (as opposed to in a table). In fact, the value of 12 that you cite comes from one person and is not a universally agreed upon number. The value of 66 is from a review from one study and is close to that of a second review, where the mean was 68. Both means are in the middle of the IPCC estimate. The value of 12 is an outlier. In any case, Lifecycle emissions are only a portion of total nuclear CO2 emissions, which are provided in Table 3.5 of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/NuclearVsWWS.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/NuclearVsWWS.pdf" target="_blank">https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/NuclearVsWWS.pdf</a></a></p></div>		</li>
