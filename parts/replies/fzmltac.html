			<div class="markdown"><p>I certainly agree with you on most of this (though I don't know much about THC processes), especially regarding solvent getting trapped in an extract when it gets really thick. I just want to clarify a couple points though: structurally, acetone is very closely related to isopropyl alcohol, but isn't <em>technically</em> its ketone. Acetone is also still a polar molecule/solvent, but it's less polar than IPA and since there isn't a hydrogen on the oxygen, it doesn't interact as strongly with water/molecules with alcohol groups (through hydrogen bonding). All of which make it a much better solvent for organic/largely non-polar molecules like what you find in the plant matter.</p></div>		</li>
