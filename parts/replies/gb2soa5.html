			<div class="markdown"><p>This thread made me realize that the only scars i have that haven't vanished are ones in flexible areas ( i have one in the foldy skin on the side of my knee abd a small one right on my wrist bend). Any i get in flat areas will vanish completely after a while.</p>
<p>I assume scars in flex areas stay due to their constant aggravation but is the vanishing of scars otherwise just another genetic lottery + self care thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer about that, but I do know from experience that massaging the scars can help &quot;soften&quot; them a little which makes them more pliable and less raised. I have had a lot of surgeries in the past year and a half and scar massage has helped a lot with how bad the scaring has been. It's a very good no cost therapy for healing scars over time. (Though it does work best on fresh scars. It's done nothing for a knee surgery scar I have that's 15 years old)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well once they've had enough time to form you can't really get rid of a scar<br />
The substance that makes up scar tissue is the same stuff that you find in bones. Collagen is responsible for resisting forces caused due to stretching</p>
<p>It has to be pretty resilient to do it's job</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That being said, I don't see how we may not be able to find a cure to scarring in the future.</p>
<p>I'm not a doctor so please take everything I say with a grain of salt!</p></div>		</li>
