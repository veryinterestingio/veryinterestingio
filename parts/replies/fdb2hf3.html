<p>(edit: Just so I don't look like a dummy later, OP originally said for experiment 2 to leave the objects out in the sun. He fixed it, and all is well now.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do this demo with my physics students. I have them put one hand on top of their desk (which is plastic resin), and the other on a metal leg of their chair. Then I ask them which one is colder, and they always tell me the chair. I ask how they could be different temperatures if they're in the same room, in the same air. Then we measure the temperature of both, and explain how it's just conducting heat from their hands more quickly. It's a great way to start teaching about conduction and heat transfer!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also different amounts of nerve endings and different amounts of blood vessels, fats, etc in different parts of the bodies, so some are more sensitive than others. There is a creature that was created for demonstrating this called a homunculus (not to be confused with the anime creatures), it is the human body but each body part is in proportion to how much sensing it does in the world rather than normal human proportions. They looks like this:<br />

<p>⁠Leave a block of wood, a piece of metal, and a plastic object out in the sun for a while, so they end up being the same temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think those will result in the same temperature.  Transferring ambient heat results in objects with the same temperature after some time, but adding an external source of radiation invokes additional factors.  Each material has a different rate for converting sunlight to heat, and each radiates heat away at different rates as it attempts to stabilize down at the lower ambient temperature.</p>
<p>I think I'd place the objects in an oven at very low heat (~50° - 60°C) for about an hour.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Though to your point, I <em>do</em> notice this when my house is colder than I like (my wife likes it cold).  Wood on interior walls and cabinets seems warmer than marble countertops.</p></div>		</li>
