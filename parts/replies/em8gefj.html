<p>Hell I mean drinking beverages that are too hot is linked to an increase in cancer, but only drinking cold beverages for the rest of your life is not a rational response to that. If you're not careful you'll spend more time taking precautions than actually living your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it's not like he can't live without cracking his neck. Something like looking both ways at traffic isn't even comparable.  You crack your neck the wrong way one time, and pop, down with the stroke ya go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't live like that... Normal motions are enough to make me crack all the time, and if it's normal motion the risk you're talking about simply doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Intentionally making a normal motion to crack is harmless. The crack itself carries no risk it's perfectly normal.</p>
<p>Your statement 'crack your neck the wrong way one time' is just not thinking. The force required to 'drop you' is way way more than normal motion can produce.</p></div>		</li>
