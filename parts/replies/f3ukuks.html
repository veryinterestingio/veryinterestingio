			<div class="markdown"><p>I am by no means an expert, but I can try and explain a little more. The profound effect that drugs like DMT can have on a person stem from the experience you have while on them and that experience can change you as u/Elocai pointed out. Just as a car crash can cause some people to rethink their lives and radically change their perspective, DMT can do the same thing. </p>
<p>However, i feel it is important to point out some of the possible whys behind it and play a little devils advocate. First, one of the reasons traumatic things like car crashes can be so changings is because they flood your brain with bunch of different neurotransmitters. Your fight or flight response gets kicked into major over drive and tons of emotions and thoughts run through your mind as a normal bodily function of a high stress event, while simultaneously you are consciously thinking about heavy topics like death and life. Drugs like DMT can do similar things artificially, by flooding your brain with neurotransmitters but brought on by the drug you ingested. </p>
<p>Now, most people will tell you how their eyes were opened on DMT, but traumatic experiences swing both ways. You can also be plunged into the deep dark depths of depression. Bad trips are a very real thing and you should be very careful before taking any kind of drug.</p>
<p>On a personal note: i have tried many drugs, LSD, shrooms, ect. Not DMT but it is on my list. But I am also relatively emotionally stable and was just looking for a fun time. I carefully read up on the risks of the drugs before taking them and ensured I was as safe as I could be while still taking a mind altering substance. I would not look to things like DMT or LSD or even shrooms if you are looking for a way out of depression or other mental illness. I have several friends who I have told that taking psychedelics would be a very bad idea because they were in a bad place mentally and the drugs would only make that much worse.</p>
<p>I can say that therapy and, if needed, prescription medication, should be attemped first and given a good bit of time to kick in, like 6 month to a year. These methods, especially therapy, are very effective given time and offer you the best chance to dig yourself out of the hole you find yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can agree on everything you said. Also DMT wise, didn't tried that so far, but the others.</p>
<p>Also had once a very dumb/stupid trip that I can just describe as annoying. So yeah it doesn't work allways, but when handled well it can be a great tool, and if handled bad it can be a very damaging tool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re seriously considering something of the sort - there are psychiatrists that specialize in therapy that involves psychedelics. Doing psychedelics on your own have just as much of a probability of something going wrong (things happen out of your control that send you spiraling) as they do going right and having a positive impact. </p>
<p>Doing these drugs in a controlled environment with doctor-guidance basically guarantees a constructive experience. </p>
<p>But IANAL, so I don’t know state-to state laws on this and where exactly it is legal. I just know it exists and that the published results are promising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I did this for the first time last week. I was with a doctor and a psychiatrist and I went through a &quot;guided hallucinogenic experience&quot; and it was profound. I still need more treatments, but I am already experiencing some lasting improvement to my mental health I feel.</p>
<p>My next session is planned for the 31st.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer because it doesnt try to explain a relatively under studied and explainable process in physiological or chemical terms, just how experience can change people</p></div>		</li>

<p>I never wanted to imply that drugs can replace shool or education, I actually highly encourage to do that first in high dosages, if possible.</p></div>		</li>
