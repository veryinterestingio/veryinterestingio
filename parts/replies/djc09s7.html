			<div class="markdown"><p>This is me to a T! I've been living like this since I was a child (it used to be debilitating) and only recently in the past few years or so have I been able to control it and I do the exact same thing you do. Seems like such a silly thing to be anxious about really but it's amazing to read this post because I always thought I was the only one and had a hard time explaining it to people. Thanks so much for sharing your story :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It took a lot of time to figure out something that simple. I first thought i had gotten astma or something, but the doctor told me my lungs were fine. The person i went to talk to about it among other stuff never said anything about that, he gave me some breathing excercises but i always tried to take breaths trying to take full breaths. I thought if i could just manage to learn to take &quot;full&quot; breaths then i would be ok. But that isn't how it works. </p>
<p>Like you said, it feels like such a silly thing to worry about. I hate that other people has to go through it but it feels nice to not be alone, because like you said it was very hard to describe to other people. Have a nice day :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have a similar issue... It's very much tied to anxiety. I start feeling like my yawn isn't &quot;ending&quot; and I need to catch up on the lost breaths. Then I kind of hyperventilate for a few seconds. It's the worst! For me it happens most when driving. ?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really sucks. But like i said, what I've found is that the best way is to just remind yourself that your breaths are fine, you dont need that fulfilling breath. Then if you want or can, think of something else while you breath. </p></div>		</li>
