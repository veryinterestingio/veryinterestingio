			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> Sensodyne has another advantage... some people (myself included) have some kind of allergy to SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and/or stannous fluoride (the new antibacterial ingredient replacing triclosan, which has been observed to disrupt the endocrine system).  One or the other debrides skin off the inside the mouth (gross not gory; dead skin sloughing off like a sunburn).  Many big brands have switched virtually all their lines to stannous fluoride but Sensodyne has some lines of just plain old sodium fluoride-based toothpaste.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong> Wow.  This really blew up and seems far more common than I thought. Thank you, kind strangers, for the recognition. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> Others have noted and I should share here that not all Sensodyne toothpastes are SLS-free and the <strong>Pronamel Fresh Mint</strong> in particular is both SLS and stannous fluoride-free.  Here is a comprehensive <a href="https://www.sensodyne.com/en-us/products/product-results/sodium-lauryl-sulfate-free-toothpaste/" target="_blank">list</a>.   </p>
<p>Also, for those who cannot afford Sensodyne there are alternatives (thanks to /u/jim_deneke and others) such as Oral B Pure series.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've added a remark about SLS but SLS has been used for years in toothpaste.  <em>In my case</em> it wasn't until Colgate switched all their toothpastes to stannous fluoride that I began having this issue—<em>specifically</em> sloughing, I do not get canker sores.  I'm sure there are groups of people sensitive to one, or the other, or both in combination, or neither.  Also of note, I have eczema and possibly (but not medically diagnosed) Sjogren's Syndrome... the former is dermatological and the latter is a type of autoimmune disorder.  It's possible that persons with dermatological or autoimmune disorders may be hypersensitive to SLS and/or stannous fluoride.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, my dentist told me to try sensodyne a few years ago, and I've been using it ever since and not nearly as bothered by cold things anymore like I was. She never said to stop so I haven't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is fine when used for its intended purpose. It is not fine as a substitute fir going to the dentist regularly to find out if you just have a little harmless sensitivity or if you have a cavity. Also, sensitivity is usually a sign of gum recession, which you need to stop if you want to keep your teeth. I’m a hygienist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have some gum recession. I haven't gone to a dentist for longer than I'd like to admit and finally went last week. Have to go back a few more times for deep cleanings. One of my front left teeth like towards the top is really really sensitive. Also the back of my front teeth don't feel smooth anymore. Almost feels like sandpaper. Not as exaggerated as sandpaper but the closest comparison I could think at. Is that enamel loss? Is there something dentists can do for the back of those teeth? I'm supposed to go back the 23rd but I can't wait. Whatever is wrong with that front tooth needs to be checked out. If it's not a cavity, I don't know what is. Sealeant probably should be used, but I'll leave that up to my dentist. The good thing is he said all things considered my teeth are in decent shape. He said I have about 15% bone loss. Will get my regular cleanings every 6 months going forward after they fix any issues I have now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have what seems like permanent gum recession around some of my upper molars because of those fucking razorwire metal bands that ortho uses to anchor back there.</p>
<p>Seriously, fuck ortho and fuck the American preoccupation with cosmetic dentistry.  Ugh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it’s safe. It’s not a permanent blockage of the pores in the teeth.  It takes about 2 weeks of use to take full effect.  </p>
<p>On the other end of the the teeth the pores are the inner tooth tissues and nerves.  When fluid moves inside the tubes, the nerves are stimulated.  Air movement, hot, cold, and sugars all cause the fluid to move in the tiny tubules.  Since nerve stimulation in teeth is only sensed as pain, any stimulation will by uncomfortable.  </p>
<p>Block the tubes with the potassium nitrate crystals, stop the external forces from moving the fluid in the tubules and stop the nerve stimulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I use it and have for years. I have one tooth that if I don’t use gets super sensitive. I did product testing awhile ago on two toothpastes and after a week or so brushing with normal I could tell it didn’t work the same. Checking ingredients definitely showed that active ingredient did its thing.</p></div>		</li>
