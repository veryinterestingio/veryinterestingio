			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, because I didn't understand what it meant either, I'd like to quickly explain tidal forces. Gravity weakens over distance, so the near side of the moon is being pulled toward the earth with slightly more force than the far side of the moon. As the moon spins (or used to, from our perspective) the force would have been pulling harder on the face of the moon spinning away, and weaker on the face spinning towards us. The net  force becomes a torquing motion to counter that rotation.</p>
<p>Tidal forces are also why you'd be spaghettified in proximity to a black hole: The near side of you would be pulled in so much harder than the far side of you, that your body would be pulled appart by the difference. Between planetary bodies, this distance from an object that will pull things appart is called the roche limit. If a moon enters its' host planet's roche limit, it will be ripped appart and transformed into a planetary ring.</p>
<p>It is this force that is responsible for tidaly locking orbiting objects to each-other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also true of the earth.  The side of the earth nearest the moon is experiencing a slightly higher pull on it than the center of the earth, and the center slightly high pull than the far side of the earth.  I believe these forces are perpendicular to the axis with the moon, and that is why we are able to accurately calculate tides in the oceans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An also interesting thing is when you realize that the tug of the Sun on the Earth is the same amount as the Moon tugging on the Earth (if it weren't it wouldn't be a stable orbit). (EDIT: This is incorrect. Actually, the tug of the sun is 180 times larger!)</p>
<p>So, why aren't we experiencing equally strong tides from the sun (or the galactic center for that matter?!)</p>
<p>The reason is that what actually matters is the <strong>difference</strong> of the pull that the two ends of the Earth experience. The Moon is much closer, so the Earth's diameter is a sizeable proportion of that distance, meaning the gravitational pull still drops off quickly. The sun is way farther, so the drop in gravitational pull from one end of the Earth to the other is teensy, and even much less when it comes to the distance to the galactic center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the subtle tidal forces you mention have any effect on a perfect sphere? Because I know that in the example of our moon, the moon is a tiny bit egg shaped, and it's fat bottom is the part that has naturally locked facing earth. (<a href="https://sciencing.com/moon-round-20233.html" target="_blank">Quickly googled source.</a>)</p>
<p>The tidal forces would have much less to latch onto with the Earth, since thanks to active wind cycles, water cycles, and a lot of liquid surface... is nearly perfectly round. Nearly all of our oblate-ness comes from a little bulge around the equator, which wouldn't come into play with tidal forces that are in the same plane as the equator.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The moon is also acting to slow the earth's rotation, moving farther out in its orbit in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another fun fact:  long ago the moon was much closer to the earth, and the earth was spinning faster.  We have examples of 300+ million year old coral fossils that show growth rings, much like tree rings.  These <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/fossilized-coral-calendar-changes-leap-day/471180/" target="_blank">coral fossils show</a> that the earth at that time had 420 days per year.  In the time since, the moon has slowed the rotation of the earth as it gradually moved farther out in its orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's simple conservation of angular momentum, not multi-body gravitational effects. As the area of nebula that would form the system collapsed, the random motion of the particles of the nebula averaged out in favor of of the direction of the net angular momentum. As the nebula continued to collapse (the radius decreasing), conservation of angular momentum meant that the rotation velocity increased - eventually to the point that the sphere flattened into a disk. That disk is where the (vast majority of the) major bodies formed, so they inherited its angular momentum, lining them all up in the same plane, orbiting in the same direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine that it means for every 2 years it has 3 days, or vice versa. A bit of googling tells me that it has a year of 88 days and a day of about 58 days (in Earth terms), so that sounds about right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm as much a terminology pedant as you, but in this case &quot;dark&quot; is referring to it being unseen, not unilluminated.</p>
<p>This is similar to the controversy over calling Africa the &quot;Dark Continent&quot;: originally the term referred to it being unknown and mysterious, but now many people assume that it was a racial thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dark (adjective)</p>
<p>1. with little or no light. &quot;it's too dark to see much&quot;</p>

<li>
<p>(of a person) having dark skin, hair, or eyes. &quot;both my father and I are very dark&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>served or drunk with only a little or no milk or cream.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. (of a period of time or situation) characterized by tragedy, unhappiness, or unpleasantness.</p>
<ul>
