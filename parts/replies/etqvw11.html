			<div class="markdown"><p>Only sometimes are there agreements in place. More often, countries decide visa policies unilaterally. One of the considerations in setting visa policy might be balanced reciprocity, i.e.: What are the other country’s visa policies, how are they likely to respond to changes in your own policies, and how will they impact your citizens/commerce/national interest?</p>
<p>Sometimes reciprocity is a significant consideration, and sometimes it is not at all. Sometimes visa policies are negotiated, and sometimes they are not. (In fact, many countries have laws that establish frameworks for visa policy according to certain metrics, like fraudulent application rates, and this leaves limited room for negotiation.)</p>
<p>The strongest determinant of visa policy — regardless of the country setting it — is the likelihood that the nationals from a visiting country will respect the terms of their visas and return home in a timely manner.</p></div>		</li>
