<p>We won't. There's bound to be species that have already been lost to the fossil record</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. But the OP was asking what was the peak population which is more difficult to answer. The peak number of species seems to have occurred around the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous but species is not the same as the number of individuals. Species numbers declined towards the end of the Cretaceous but did numbers of individuals ?</p></div>		</li>
