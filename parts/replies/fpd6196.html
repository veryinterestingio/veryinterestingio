			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it is a hangover.  I think it is drug “withdrawals.”  Also the stimulant helps your body produce seratonin and norepinephrine, which your body is missing by morning.  You, like me, are dependent on the medication.  I have been taking the same dose of Adderall for 20+ years.  The only thing that changed for me is I have switched to the slow release, which evens me out even better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Exactly this. I also tend to regret stuff I said on days where I forgot to take my meds, because I think fast and I don't take time to think about what I'm saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Wasn't medicated until I was 19, but had been dealing with it since I was around 13 or 14. Was kinda weird to realize that 90% of the dumb stuff I did or said as a teenager was related to the fact that I had no short-term memory and couldn't think straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I always explain it to people is without my meds my head feels like a car radio set to scan. It'll play something for a little bit, then change to something else.</p>
<p>With my meds it picks a station and stays on there until I change it myself.</p></div>		</li>
