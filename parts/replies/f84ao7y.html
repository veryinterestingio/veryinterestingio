<p>It goes away on its own, but it’s hard not to overeat when eating makes me want to eat more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Next time try eating just bacon and eggs. No carbs. I bet you’ll notice a significant difference. </p>
<p>Eating carbs (especially a lot of carbs like cereal, oats, or biscuits and gravy) spurs the body to release insulin to handle the sugars that those carbs are broken down in to. Since you have been fasting for 8 or more hours, the new sugar may be a shock so your body goes into sugar overdrive. Then the sugar levels in your blood drop (maybe a bit too much), which spurs hunger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same way, as soon as I start eating it makes me hungrier and hungrier. I had to switch to intermittent fasting to keep my calories down. Now that I only eat from 12p to 8p it's much easier to keep my intake reasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This generally depends on what you eat. </p>
<p>Sugars, refined carbohydrate and some fats may stimulate ghrelin and suppress leptin (the hormone which makes you feel full) in some people.</p>
<p>Whereas protein and fibre do the opposite.</p>
<p>This is why junk food is addictive, and why you can have a &quot;second stomach&quot; for dessert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like he said, ghrelin is stimulated by multiple things, in this case the taste of food and having an empty stomach probably sent ghrelin release into overdrive since you went so long without food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 50's and 60's there were diet pills, not only prescribed but available over the counter and any drug store. These &quot;Diet Pills&quot; were simply a small pill form of methamphetamine. Called &quot;Crosstops&quot; these pills helped many a person lose weight. I believe they were made illegal in the late 60's.</p>
<p>Today you have Meth, with meth you get to lose weight, teeth, home, family, sanity...........</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some chemicals do that, but not withiut many other effects. Stimulants, like Adderall or Ritalin, and possibly even caffeine, can suppress appetite. However, they also have other effects that make them generally unsuitable as weight-loss drugs. There has been a study suggesting that a protein found in coffee (even decaf) is actually a better appetite suppressant than caffeine, but this is pretty recent, so it needs more study before we can be sure its true, and there hasnt been enough time to turn this finding into an approved medication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such an important aspect of dieting for the first time if you're hooked on junk food. For me, if I ever dip back into junk food, the first night of me going clean the ghrelin/blood sugar goes off the hook for like an hour or two, but if I don't give in it goes away. It might come back a little bit later but I make it through that first night without giving in, my body gets in check soooo much easier for the next few nights.</p>
<p>It's just funny though because that hungry feeling is so ... primal if you will. It feels so weird to say 'no, fool, you just ate.'</p></div>		</li>
