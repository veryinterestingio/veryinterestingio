			<div class="markdown"><p>Many WW2 minesweepers were made out of wood. Several of the famous ones that survive were John Wayne's personal yacht, with the hull being built out of 3&quot; Oregon Pine, and Jacques Cousteau's RV Calypso, which was built by the same company. At the time, almost 300 of the wood hulled ships were built in the US and given to the UK under the Lend-Lease program during the war.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens if a fish with a magnetic field, like a shark swims near or into one of the mines? Does there need to be a certain amount of weight before they're triggered? Is there any basis in fact to the minefield scene in Finding Nemo?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mines in Finding Nemo were contact or &quot;hertz horn&quot; mines, which are discussed in some other comments. Since typically these mines are detonated when the horns are deformed, if they were moored in close proximity the overpressure from one mine detonating might set others off, as depicted in Finding Nemo, though this would probably have been deliberately avoided irl.</p>
<p>Sharks and other marine life don't have a strong enough biomagnetic field to set off magnetic mines - though if the mine were triggered by an electric field instead, presumably some organisms are capable of generating large enough electric fields - and some magnetic or other &quot;influence&quot; mines can be calibrated to even detect certain types of ships because their sensors are so sensitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Influence mines also use several influences, so even if a magnetic signature were detected you would still need to satisfy acoustic, pressure, etc. as well to register as a valid target.</p></div>		</li>
