I do a trial with 200 people, 100 in the test group and 100 in the control group. In the test group, 1 person has a heart attack while in the control 2 people have heart attacks.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's a little different, since your example is actually true, instead of withholding information or context. Like, a drop from 2% to 1% actually <em>is</em> pretty amazing. Also, it's more a quirk of English that people can't disambiguate between a percentage drop that's multiplicative or additive. I wouldn't fault a commercial for that.</p>
<p>Killing 99.99% of germs that were preselected is <em>very</em> different from killing 99.99% of germs from a realistic environment. It's like saying a machine has 100% reliability, when it's only 100% reliable in unrealistic conditions- not cool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your example mathematically proves the exact opposite of what you are claiming, because you don't know what you're actually talking about. You're conflating risk and rate.</p>
<p>For your claim to be accurate, everyone involved would need to be forced to have a guaranteed heart attack. If 2 out of 100 people have a heart attack, then the rate of heart attack is 2%. If the drug lowers the rate from 2% to 1%, then that rate has been halved and thus you have empirical evidence that the risk was lowered by 50%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reality is they kill 100% of microbes they come into contact with. It's basically the microbial equivalent of a nuclear bomb, but 1) they can't guarantee that it'll reach every single bacteria, and 2) quite frankly, our monkey brains somehow think 99.9% percent sounds less fake than 100%.</p></div>		</li>
