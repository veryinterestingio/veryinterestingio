			<div class="markdown"><p>I fell out of a canoe into some pretty fast moving water while it was snowing one time way out in the middle of nowhere.  Scared the absolute shit out of me.  </p>
<p>The first thought I had was, &quot;Holy shit, I'm gonna die&quot;.  Then I remembered watching Bear Grylls jump into water in the arctic and other cold places.  </p>
<p>Remembering that instantly brought me out of the panic.  Started remembering everything he always said to do.  Swim diagonally across the current.  Get your bag that's floating.  Grab a rock to pull yourself ashore.  Strip off the wet clothes.  Start doing calisthenics to get your blood moving.  Move uphill (above the flood lines) to find dry wood.  Get a fire going.</p>
<p>Having even that tiny bit of second hand knowledge from watching a TV show is what stopped me from panicking and saved my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Sweden in a city near me they have am annual swimming contest in the river in the winter. Due to it being moving water it's usually around 1C (33.8 Fahrenheit). Though they only swim 25 meters and straight into a sauna afterwards. :D</p>
<p>I've personally swam in this kind of temperature water for about 2 minutes and was completely exhausted afterwards. The initial shock is insane as well and without the ladder to hold onto I can imagine it being very difficult. Especially if it's not even on purpose, but for example falling overboard.</p></div>		</li>
