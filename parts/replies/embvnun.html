			<div class="markdown"><p>This is no longer recommended.  NIST (written by the same guy who came up with the original rotation standard) explicitly recommends AGAINST rotation unless there is a known compromise.</p>
<p>Turns out forced rotation encourages bad habits (namely simplistic password reuse, simple passwords, and writing them down in insecure locations) in most individuals and makes the net security weaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;change every 90 days&quot; rule, combined with environments like hospitals where you have a large # of different accounts that you may not sign in to every day, leads to immense #s of passwords being forgotten and reset, written on sticky notes, or otherwise used insecurely.</p>
<p>Given the # of password compromises caused by &quot;reset my password&quot; services, I'd bet money on the hypothesis that &quot;change every 90 days&quot; policies cause more security breaches than they prevent. Unfortunately it's legally mandated(*) in the US.  </p>
<p>*) Like many &quot;hipaa practices&quot; in US healthcare, it's questionable whether this practice is actually required by the letter of the law. However, risk management lawyers tell us that it's mandatory and we don't have a choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One hundred percent this. I log into countless systems, not all on a regular basis and they all have different dumbass criteria that mean the passwords I use have to be different, and be changed constantly. The end result for some systems is I basically have to reset my password every. Single. Fucking. Time. I. Log. Fucking. In.</p>
<p>I’ve told these idiots this is stupid, but they are idiots, so it won’t change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately lawyers, compliance officers, banks, and insurance companies are really slow at following developments in computer science and security research. My IT department knows full well about the NIST recommendations- but we are audited twice a year by external auditors that don't understand, don't want to talk about, and get really bored by such matters. They want to be able to check a box that says &quot;regular resetting of passwords.&quot; If they can't, they will write us up on their report. Eventually the unfavorable reports end up with some overzealous VP and I find myself explaining to a board of trustees how come we're not following recommended procedure to keep our data safe...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the idea.  </p>
<p>Best security policy is to change 100% of your passwords as often as possible to a very long string of unintelligible letters, numbers, and characters that are all unique per-account.  </p>
<p>Obviously that's virtually impossible, but some companies for you to change THEIR password every once in awhile so bad actors have to at least try a little.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually that's a bad practice unless you're using a password manager. Why? Because it gets people in the habit of using related passwords, such as: hunter1, hunter2, hunter3, etc.  </p>
<p>In that situation if an attacker is ever able to crack the hashes for your old passwords, it can very easily put them on track to guess your latest password in only a few tries.  </p>
<p>Obviously not everyone does this but some people do, so by enforcing company policies that force password changes often, they are encouraging some employees to use consecutive passwords just so they can remember them, which reduces security for those employees.  </p>
<p>Obviously in the case of known breaches or a notable period of time (6mo or so) it's good to force password changes to address the issue, but every 30, 60, 90 days or whatever doesn't significantly increase security and can potentially reduce security for some users.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I've seen at least one other person mention, password managers are a good idea. They can usually generate random and complex passwords that are virtually impossible to guess by chance, and since they store your passwords for you, you can generate a new password for every account (so that if someone were to get access to one account on one site, they couldn't use that password to get to other accounts you have). Just make sure you take the time to create one very secure password for the password manager itself</p></div>		</li>
