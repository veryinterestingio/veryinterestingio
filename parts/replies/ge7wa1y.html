			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other comment said, a narcissist wouldn't be able to resist being a narcissist. In fact, the only reason they are seeing the therapist is because they are already so amazing they just need the validation of someone that specializes in mental issues. </p>
<p>They're so smart and they're going to be so impressed with how adjusted I am! I'm going to be the best session they have all week and they're going to look forward to seeing me next time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! They tend to present because they are experiencing difficulties with regulating their mood, interpersonal issues etc. But they expect reinforcement that their environment and peers are the problem and they are not receptive to self help techniques or behavioural therapy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If narcissists hit rock bottom it's possible for them to be able to acknowledge at least some of their weaknesses. Similar to when people that struggle with addiction can have an eye opening experience by hitting rock bottom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were worried about that you are already not one.  That's empathy.  Everyone should be self aware rhat perhaps they are discussing themselves too much or trying to dominate the conversation too much.  Everyone has a need for attention That's normal, however if it's excessive and constant That's a problem</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real question is why would a narcissist seek therapy? They generally don’t. Unless it’s to have a captive audience...in which case their personality disorder will quickly become apparent to the trained therapist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that it’s usually for another issue. They’re having troubles at home or at work because the other people are being <em>difficult</em> or bullying them. When really, its Mr Narcissist who is the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once met with a work therapist for some family issues and my ex wife met me there before hand but ir wasn't a couples thing (I know you know where this is going haha)</p>
<p>She talked with her in the lobby for maybe 30 seconds then in the meeting mentioned how mt wife was so clearly a narcissist.  I never met with her agains for talking about my wife that way.</p>
<p>Looking back she was dead on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that she was trying to help, it just sounds like she was incredibly blunt about it.</p>
<p>You don't specify the family issues (which is fine, you don't need to), but your wife is a part of your family, so it doesn't seem like an out-of-bounds subject for the therapist.</p>
<p>But man, sounds like that therapist needs to learn to ease into things a bit.</p></div>		</li>
