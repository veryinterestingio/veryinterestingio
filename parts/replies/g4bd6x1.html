			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this first time when I was a kid (about 6-7 yo). I told parents. They didn't know what's that so they took me to physician. The physician sent me to the psychiatrist because she thought it's weird a kid is speaking of blood taste in mouth and that I'm either some sociopath and future murderer or maybe I'm suicidal or whatever. Psychiatrist didn't find anything weird obviously. Seems like even some doctors don't know this.</p></div>		</li>
