<p>So I know what to deliver and how fast I can move it, but knocking on doors and getting stuck in traffic can never be accurately estimated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed! And to add to that, you need a receipt from each customer. (Simulating that the hard drive writes the position of each file.) So you take your truck and unload that one, massive 1000 kg package and get a single receipt. But for those 1000x 1 kg packages you need to drive to 1000 different places and get 1000 receipts.</p></div>		</li>
