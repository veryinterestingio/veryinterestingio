<p>I have a gas cap sensor on my GTI. I also currently have an evap system CEL. Depending on the humidity, my cap sensor will throw, followed by the CEL I typically just freaking cleared from the last time. But it could also be my purge valve at this point, so... lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have a gas cap sensor.</p>
<p>You have a computer that can determine that an evap (fuel vapor emission management system) leak exists, and that it didn't happen until right after the fuel level reading increased significantly. The logical conclusion is that the gas cap was left loose. So, the programming throws out a gas cap warning. Problem is, these systems rely on the readings of sensors, layered with computerized human logic. And there are always gaps and nuances in the programming that can have unintended effects.</p>
<p>If your gas cap is always tight every time, you have a different problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my dad went from &quot;grease monkey&quot; just <em>knowing</em> what were the usual culprits and fixing that, to him and I having to sit down and diagnose what trips each sensor and what's the most likely case, fixing/patching that before trying again. Car forums were a godsend in the early days of OBD2</p></div>		</li>

<p>Got there, she had her keys in her hand, but the battery in the clicker was dead.</p>
<p>I put her key in the door and turned it...</p>
<p>Also had a customer accuse me of installing a steering wheel lock in their car. For free. She had never twisted the wheel with the key out; I push off the wheel to get out.</p></div>		</li>
