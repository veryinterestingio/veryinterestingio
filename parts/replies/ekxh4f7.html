			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought visualising in flashes is normal? For me, in order to imagine something is a constant effort of maintaining the visualised image in my mind, it constantly fades away. Can people actually see in their minds the way they see reality, or at least, like dreams? Because I do see dreams, and they are very vivid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's normal to have a minds eye, for some this is very elaborate. For some it are flashes.  And for some others like myself it's 95% black.</p>
<p>The way your minds eye works is by the same part of the brain that works with your actual sight.</p>
<p>And only 1 in about 50 have aphantasia so it's not very common, but for people with aphantasia it can be a real eye opener that you think differently. (i actually just joined reddit as someone sent me the link to this post)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope not weird. My dreams are like splices of various “films” ( not actual movies but concept) all mashed together like the editor was high on something. </p>
<p>Rarely will a dream have a followable plot line.</p>
<p>Now daydreams...I have full control over that and man it is some fun stuff!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, same here. But I realized pretty early on I had a vivid imagination because people assumed I was lying when I told them about my day dreams/actual dreams. But I know some people like me in this regard so it's not that uncommon I'd think. I think there is just a selection bias going on in this thread of people sharing similar perceptions.</p></div>		</li>

Are you saying people imagine and daydream the same way people dream? </p>
<p>...I always thought it was like reading a lovely book. An inner monologue painting a word picture (without any real pictures)...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I read a lovely book, particularly fiction, it starts as just words, but as characters are introduced, and personalities are expressed through dialogue and details, it quickly evolves into unique voices for dialog and narration, and it doesn't take long before I'm hearing them, pretty plainly. It's not quite from the same &quot;place&quot; as hearing with my ears, but I *do* hear them. Sometimes I've caught myself saying the next bit of text or dialog out loud, with the same affectation I had assigned the speaker, and being surprised because of course that came through my ears.</p>
<p>Descriptions of places/things starts to paint a picture as I go and it's not always some crystal clear photograph, but the better-described it is the easier it is for me to picture it. I'd say color comes in first, and sometimes motion as characters participate in a &quot;scene&quot;.</p>
<p>It's not everything I read and not every time, even for things I enjoy, but for very well-written pieces that I also thoroughly enjoy, it can build up to little movies in my head that I find myself half-acting out after awhile. Those are also the works that I remember for years afterward and sometimes quote pieces of. So I guess I'd say it's not just some mental reflex for me, and more of an ability that I can exercise if fed the right information in the right context.</p>
<p>Edit: I should probably add that daydreaming is easier and definitely full-movie like for me, when I slip into them fully. Of course there's a spectrum from &quot;distracted&quot; to &quot;lost in thought&quot; to &quot;I had to shout 3 times for you to notice&quot;, and only the far end of that spectrum are the 'movie' type. More commonly it's just imagining a conversation, and often it has voices or faces with it, but sometimes it's imagined scenarios in full-movie form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. </p>
<p>I also after learning about it realized how people usually tell stories about the dreams that a coherent and how they &quot;saw things&quot;.</p>
<p>Like, my dreams (and they are rare) are 90% of the time me waking up with KNOWLEDGE about events that transpired, but no actual memory of things I saw, only rarely some brief flashes here and there. I guess it's the same for you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah I actually do have picture dreams but I forget what they looked like pretty quickly once I wake up.

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read it seems pretty typical that people with aphantasia still have visual dreams. In fact, you're the first person I've seen say otherwise. Then again, lots of people don't have very vivid dreams in general regardless of their visualizing ability. Have you never had a dream where all your senses were engaged?</p>
<p>I have definitely had a lot of dreams like you describe, but I think it's related to when the dream is interrupted. I seem to remember reading that memories of dreams are mostly purged if you complete a rem cycle before waking up, and that we typically have 4 or 5 different dreams per night - i could be remembering wrong though.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I do actually, but it's fairly rare and usually when I wake up after having had an intense dream I feel really exhausted or even sweaty... I never thought much about why that is though.</p>

<p>That sounds interesting, maybe one day if I have the time/money I'd get myself hooked up to some wires to figure out what's going on in my sleep :D</p></div>		</li>
