			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most complete answer. I think archiving is a far more common reason to use zip than the minor compression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very nice answer and gets to the question asked by the OP.</p>
<p>And in my experience, the compression aspect of zipping is not nearly as important as the collating of multiple files/directories into a single file. File transfer protocols (like ftp) must verify that each file is transferred  properly--if files are collapsed into a single archive, that quality check needs to occur only once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>gzip (standing for GNU zip) is only a compression format. The bundling happens with tarballs (hence the <code>tar.gz</code> file extension in every gzip archive). Also, I believe <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code> is <em>not</em> referring to a tarballed gzip file but rather the gzip format itself.</p>
<p>Edit: <code>Content-Encoding</code>, not <code>Content-Type</code>. oops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to bow to you, I did write only a quick post (or tried to!).</p>
<p>The gzipped data in Apache, etc. mod_deflate/mod_gzip is indeed a gzip-compressed response header, though, so could contain multiple files if pipelining etc. is enabled, I believe.</p>
<p>But you're right - it's not QUITE a zip file.  And your tar line is spot-on but most people have never seen a .tar.gz and wouldn't know what to do with if it they did (Windows for example doesn't open it by default, and if you can extract it you get a tar with almost no clue what to do with it).</p></div>		</li>

<p>7z and open as archive again obviously.</p>
<p>Now old mod archive formats like .omod or .fomod on the other hand... no clue what to do with files in those at all.</p></div>		</li>
