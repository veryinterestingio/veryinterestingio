			<div class="markdown"><p>Kate here - thanks for your questions. In answer to your first question, Hannah and I tend to work on qualitative projects so we don't use pre-existing big datasets. But there are lots available. Here in the UK, to name a few, are all the info collected by the Office for National Statistics on cause of death, age, gender, location etc. And there are annual surveys such as the British Attitudes Survey that sometimes include relevant data. When it comes to funerals, the most consistent large datasets being generated are on funeral/cremation/burial costs, by insurance companies who produce annual reports on said costs. I've been involved in these before and they are fascinating, in terms of choices made and why (as much as can be captured in a variable).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hannah here - to add a reply to your interesting question about Ebola... Given I do my fieldwork in the UK I would not feel comfortable with speculating about cultural behaviours in various African countries, but a former colleague, Dr Ann Kelly, would definitely be able to comment as she has done a lot of fieldwork in Ebola-stricken countries and written extensively on the issue. See:  <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ann-kelly" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ann-kelly" target="_blank">https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ann-kelly</a></a> Get in touch with her if you're interested to follow up.</p></div>		</li>
