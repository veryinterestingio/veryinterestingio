			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also an essential way to keep primitive humans alive, to make them more stressed and aggressive that allows the cavemen peanut brain to take more risks to obtain food coz &quot;oh shit oh shit we need food I don't feel alright imma go fucking tackle that deer over there coz I fucking have to.&quot; Which, it's kind of a reflex response that we haven't evolved out of just yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cavemen did not have peanut brains. Otherwise this is fairly accurate. Being more aggressive when hungry would more likely put one in the &quot;fight&quot; state of mind rather than the &quot;flight&quot; state of mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may also be an evolutionary trait to be fierce when you are hungry. So that you can get up and go hunting instead of sitting in your caving and dying from depression.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>absolutely. stress generally does have utlility for survival so much so that the epinephrine mentioned is what is commonly called adrenaline....gets you up qnd going and provides bursts of energy when normal flows are insufficient.   of course...our modern sources of stress make this often ledd useful then they once did!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the same principle for stress I think (mentioned above). I read in a different thread about stress that since we are not being in a &quot;full&quot; survival mode against possible menaces nor hunting, our bodies tend to lock up the hormones and cause us tension and discomfort due to them not being discharged. Sorry for the unintentional eli5 but I don't really science </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chronic stress is also part of the problem. Being exposed to those stress hormones <em>every day</em> is really bad for you, with no escape or resolution. Theyâ€™re only meant to be short term bursts that allow you to respond to a threat. </p></div>		</li>
