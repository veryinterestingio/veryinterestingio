			<div class="markdown"><p>If there's a reef then you can get perfect surfing waves that break consistently in the same place (for a bit until the tide changes). One of the most famous is Banzai Pipeline and Backdoor in Hawaii which is actually three reefs that work at different times as the tide changes water depth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you for restoring my faith in this sub!<br />
Reading all the other top comments is so freaking tilting in this thread. Talking about wind deciding the direction in which waves travel or turning cups into balls...?   </p>
<p>Waves are water molecules in a up-and-down motion, nothing else. You don't need wind for them to propagate over the ocean or any body of water for that matter. Stretch out a bedsheet tight, grab the center and pull it up and let go. As it goes down, waves spread in every direction, just like they would in water. There is literally no sideways motion in there. That only comes into play as waters get shallower.<br />
As to what causes the up-and-down motion, that's a whole other question.  Ask a geologist, they may have an answer to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol you're pretty wrong. The individual molecules travel in a circular motion.
