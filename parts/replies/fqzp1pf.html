			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a brewing expert but probably not. Since most of your sugars turn into alcohol during fermentation it's difficult to get sweet flavors through to the other side. </p>
<p>If you could figure out how to get the right flavors, you might be able to cut the beer with something sweet after fermentation but as far as straight brewing goes I don't think it's possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several sugars that don't ferment, or don't ferment well. Those will remain in the brew and give it a marked sweetness. </p>
<p>There is a whole category of beer called Pastry Stout that is super dark, super sweet and often very strong with additions like vanilla, coffee, cocoa and any other traditionally pastry-like flavours. </p>
<p>There are dozens of velvet cake beers available.</p></div>		</li>
