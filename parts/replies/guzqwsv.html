			<div class="markdown"><p>Ice can exist at very high temperatures if the pressure is also very high. There are actually many different types of ice as a result (meaning different structures at a molecular level). <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/1280px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">Here is a diagram.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water that is compressed extremely densely. If something is compressed its molecules also compress and get closer together. The difference between solid and liquid is how far apart their molecules are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Phases" target="_blank">There are different kinds of water ice called Phases</a>. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metallic hydrogen reportedly looks shiny and reflective like most metals. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2119442-metallic-hydrogen-finally-made-in-lab-at-mind-boggling-pressure/" target="_blank">This article has a picture.</a> Helium would probably look pretty much identical, as the reflectivity is a general property of what makes metals metal. Metallic helium would probably be generally white/colourless, because it's not a transition metal ion.</p></div>		</li>
