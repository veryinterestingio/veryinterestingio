			<div class="markdown"><p>Some cases fish and animals still manage to survive large wounds. But theres many factors that come into play, like natural predators, diet, environment, location of wound etc. Its not common but still possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I think it's luck. The animal has to survive being wounded long enough to heal. While they're healing if their movement is impacted they're volnurable to becoming lunch. A fish that's had it's tail fin bitten off for example likely won't be able to evade the next predator.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As anyone who has had to cone their pet can attest to.</p>
<p>My cat had a blocked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_gland#Dogs_and_cats" target="_blank">anal gland</a>. It progressed very quickly from &quot;huh is her backside swollen?&quot; to an open wound. A lot of that was because she wouldn't stop licking it.... but we used our human intelligence and put a cone on her (and shoved antibiotics down her throat for the next couple of weeks)</p>
<p>It closed up and we were able to take the cone off in less than a week, but she would be in much worst shape now if not for our intervention. </p>
<p>Realistically, surviving large wounds isn't all that useful in the wild; as being slowed down by injury is often a death sentence anyway. If the wound doesn't kill you, an uninjured predator will. Life spans in the wild tend to be very short.</p></div>		</li>
