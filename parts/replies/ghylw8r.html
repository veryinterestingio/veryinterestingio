			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, basically there is only about 10% efficiency in each step of the food chain. Just think about how many calories a cow has to consume until it is fully grown and how many meat-calories you end up with. Same for milk or eggs: You basically have to keep a whole cow or chicken alive just to get a few calories of milk/eggs every day.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh, and even more inefficient would be for us to eat carnivores e.g. cats because then you add a whole step.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. For every step up in the food chain you 90% energy goes to heat loss and only 10% energy is fed forward to the next organism.</p></div>		</li>
