			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no starvation mode, there's only starving. When you're starving your organs are getting damaged and your brain is one of them. There is no energy conservation when starving, you still use as much energy as you need to live and if no new fuel comes in you die. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your statement isn't wrong, but it could be interpreted in a misleading way. Starvation experiments have measured a reduction in BMR. Temperature, heart rate, and respiration rate all decrease, reducing the energy necessary to live each day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure what he means by starvation mode is when the body starts more actively using fats for energy (more than usual for average person) due to an extremely low carb diet.</p>
<p>The answer is still no, but it is <em>kind of</em> a starvation mode.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you're wrong. There is a wiki article that says you are wrong: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_response" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_response</a></p>
<p>I think that the human body reacts to a sustained caloric deficit through physiological changes intended to adapt to that deficit and promote survival. The wiki article and numerous other sources back me up. You have no sources. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a note, the 20% is not based on your metabolic caloric needs (my over 6' height uses way more calories than my wife at closer to 5', but our brains use about the same amount), but is instead based on your resting metabolic rate (which also varies, but is significantly lower than what you typically think about as your daily caloric intake).  If you want to read more, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/thinking-hard-calories/" target="_blank">this article in Scientific American</a> was pretty good, and <a href="https://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1993.75.6.2514" target="_blank">this source</a> (paywall) talks briefly about RBR in men and women.</p></div>		</li>
