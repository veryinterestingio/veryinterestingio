			<div class="markdown"><p>12 inch singles playing at 45 for up to 8 minutes were popular in the late 70s &amp; early 80s. At least in the UK. They were the standard for playing in discos, longer versions of hit songs. And were claimed to have a richer sound than the standard 7 inch single.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You still see that now and again. Sometimes a band will put out a double record on two 45 rpm 12 inch records instead of one 33 because the quality of 45 rpm is better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its also so they can make wider and deeper cuts, spaced more apart, so they can master it to sound better and louder.  The more you pack on one side of a record, you sacrifice quality. </p>
<p>Also, you can have less material falling on the inner area of the record, where things tend to distort more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the flipside, there's occasionally singles that are 33 1/3, in the 45 size. (But with a small hole for a 33) I think that some of the crappy ones made for kids with fairy tales on them are made this way, but I also have one with a live version of Roundabout by Yes that's a small diamter 33 single.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>depending on the way the master is done (the method for encoding the grooves), 45 would yield better resolution, considering better and more accurate pickups. But as a listener of 33 albums, I can tell that the quality of a 2-side album was pretty good in the 80's, when the technology was mature.</p></div>		</li>
