			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not really true for aviation, or at most it’s true for a very narrow subset of innovations. Commercial aircraft have billions of dollars worth of development funds, and are all custom systems specifically for that airframe to optimize the hell out of them. Small corporate airframes usually use some standardized parts, and always use off the shelf engines, which means they’re far less fuel and aerodynamically efficient than commercial designs because they just don’t sell enough for the billions of dollars of development that goes into bespoke components.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I flew along on the SF50 last summer. It is cool, but I am not really a big fan of the systems. It automatically does things that I would want more, or should I say easier to access, control of in a failure. Sure, you &quot;can&quot; access it via menus and sub menus, but it takes time and requires more heads down time than I prefer. Sure, I learned to fly on old &quot;steam guages&quot; and everything being a toggle switch so I might be old school to much, but I like being able to turn stuff on and off immediately and by feel.</p>
<p>Cirrus CAPS system is incredible, but I feel that people are being conditioned to use it when the aircraft is still fly able. As such, quite a few of those emergency checklists seem to get to Pull CAPS handle too soon for my liking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's cool. So you're saying the second switch handles the whole starting procedure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! There is a computer system called FADEC (full authority digital engine control) which takes care of the whole sequence. Jet engines are unique in their starting as you need to move air through the engine in order to get the the engine self sustained. The sequence initiates a starter to start spinning the N1 shaft (the big fan on the front) then ducts pressurized air from the APU (the small engine in the tail used on the ground for power and AC), it then will introduce fuel and flame to start the engine. All the while it is monitoring for any malfunctions, which can include Hot or Hung starts and starter cranking time limits. After it is complete we get an “Avail” annunciation on our Engine Display and then can proceed with the second engine start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP is talking about all the other stuff that pilots need to do. For example here's a video I just watched a few days ago:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeSO6msDk" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeSO6msDk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKeSO6msDk</a></a>  -- Its about 15 minutes of pressing buttons and starting processes. I think thats what they meant. There's so many systems that need to started and checked. OP and me are thinking it would be great if there was one button that took care of the whole thing.</p>
<p>In theory it could be done but I can imagine it would be expensive. I'm going to guess that they'll try to make this startup process simpler and simpler as time goes on.</p></div>		</li>
