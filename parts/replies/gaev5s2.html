			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I’m guessing that our brains don’t keep that information at all because it knows it’s irrelevant to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anytime I was reading as a task or an exercise in an exam. I forced myself to concentrate. I knew the information is useless. But I read it anyway with 100% attention. I had a general understanding of the text and I could answer the questions after but I always choose to check the text again and find the answer to be 100% accurate which is a really fast procedure because generally know where the answers are located in the text. These are stored only in short time memory for me. I don't care about it' contents really I just want to get the stupid exam right.</p></div>		</li>
