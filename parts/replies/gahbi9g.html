			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! Cross-species communication among the groups you suggest is of course much less impressive than communication within each of them. But with regard to the possibility of we humans being able to communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence, I'm optimistic. However, we have to find them first!  The problem there is that microbial life is probably common in the galaxy, intelligent life much less so. It might be that the nearest microbes are on a planet 50 light years away, while the nearest intelligent life might be more like 50,000 LY from us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s interesting to think that other species could be getting more out of life too, like what we think is a rich experience could be a dull and monotonous life to them. I really hope we can meet another intelligent civilization</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I do. But perhaps I should ask what you mean by 'filled'. I think that the number of planets with such life is huge, but it's a tiny fraction of all the planets that there are with life. Maybe in our galaxy there a billion planets with microbes but only ten with life as you describe it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm willing to bet pretty much anything or any amount that we will find microbial life in our own solar system.  We have multiple possible locations for life beyond Earth.  I am confident one of them contains at least microbial life, with a decent chance at higher forms of life at any of the locations as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but an alien isn't going to be descended from any of them, which makes their particular problem solving abilities nearly moot in this conversation. The only important characteristic is cross species communication, which isn't even that relevant because all animals on Earth had the same variables during the course of their evolution that will likely be very different for an alien. Aliens could communicate with methods that would be very unusual for any Earth animal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But none of those things mean they also communicate anything like life on Earth. Even if they used sounds and expressions, they could be unrecognisable to us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I wonder is how much of intelligence is a product of convergent evolution.  There's quite a bit of evolutionary distance between humans and octopus, and yet there seem to be moments in which two individuals can bridge some of that span.</p></div>		</li>
