			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, especially in arid environments (obviously). For example, at the proposed Eagle Mountain PSH project in California, projected evaporation rates are high enough that the state resource agencies are concerned about resulting concentrations of sediment, heavy metals, and other materials in the reservoirs. To address this water quality issue, the projectâ€™s license (issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) requires a reverse osmosis water treatment system to maintain water quality at or above state-mandated standards.</p></div>		</li>
