			<div class="markdown"><p>They tend to be randomly scattered throughout the forest, and people tend to stick to trails. They also decay/get eaten. And if someone spots a nice shed on a trail, they tend to pick it up and keep it. I live in moose country and occasionally see a hiker packing out a massive moose antler.</p></div>		</li>
