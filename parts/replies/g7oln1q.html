			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really easy to get into an argument about what's healthy. Rolled oats has more fiber than simple carbohydrates and no added sugar. So that alone makes it much healthier than many foods marketed for breakfast such as most boxed cereal. </p>
<p>If you're goal is to lose weight and you're wanting a carb, oats is a good choice because it is more filling and has better satiety than boxed cereal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other person said healthy is sort of a made-up term that has no strict definition. Everybody's health needs are different and the only thing you can really do is to look at your entire diet, every single bit of food drink or anything else that goes into your body, as a whole.</p>
<p>That said, oats are IMO a pretty solid choice for a carb, as long as you don't fall victim to the trap of sweetening them up by adding honey / brown sugar / etc. Or loading them up with a ton of fat from butter/cream. Some vanilla and some pumpkin pie spices are good ways to amp up the flavor without adding a bunch of empty calories</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even adding a teaspoon of sugar or honey it’s still nowhere near captain crunch or pastries for breakfast. My go to for a cup of raw oats (80g) is to cook in 9oz unsweetened vanilla almond milk, 1t cinnamon, handful of frozen berries, 1t psyllium, 1t honey. My advice for people trying to eat healthier is to add enough sweetener at the beginning to make it palatable and then just slowly wean off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>This would only effect the cholesterol that you eat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's inaccurate. The small intestine produce cholesterol also, which the fiber in oats binds to and eliminates.</p>
<p>The marketing here isn't &quot;oats help lower cholesterol&quot; but rather, &quot;soluble fiber helps lower cholesterol.&quot; Oats just happen to be a breakfast food high in soluble fiber.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, cholesterol production is so important that your liver and intestines make about 80% of the cholesterol you need to stay healthy. Only about 20% comes from the foods you eat.</p>

I haven't had red meat in over a year and live as healthy as a monk and my doctor still tells me to change my life style cause my results are shit. We're all gonna die people! Drink some wine with a nice plate of cheese and prosciutto because dietary cholesterol has minimal impact on your numbers.</p></div>		</li>
