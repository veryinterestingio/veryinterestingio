<p>In comes an extremely cuddly cat I decided to get and WOW. It’s like I could breathe again. Slowly but certainly I noticed a serious decrease in my feelings of depression and overall better energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be that guy, but the effects of oxytocin are actually widely misunderstood. We don’t actually know the direct relationship between oxytocin &amp; it’s effects on human interaction/affection. However, it is commonly hypothesized that oxytocin is released during the bonding period between mother and child, as well as between two members of the same family or a relationship.</p>
<p>Just wanted to throw out that basically we don’t know for sure what it does, but it’s <em>probably</em> related to bonding/sexual desire/human interaction.</p></div>		</li>
