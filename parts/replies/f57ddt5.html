<p>Fuck diets. Track kcal and do it your whole life. It won't return</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if not intending to stop, it's easy to accidentally fall back on old habits. I've known about this for years and managed to get out of shape again. Basically, you don't immediately stop doing things. Eventually the exercise goes down, and then stops. You still feel fine, maybe you're eating a bit more; but you haven't gained any weight. At this point you might start indulging in a few more things. Unfortunately, at the current rate the changes are too slow for your monkey brain to register it at a problem; and really you don't mind the extra weight. Ultimately, you don't notice until things get out of hand.</p>
<p>I agree fuck diets (for the most part). I really want to move to non-counting, though. Just naturally eating correct portions and exercise. The problem I have with calorie tracking is it doesn't last for me, after I get in shape, at it is a mental sink (albeit a small one).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I've been making the same point for a while. It's actually one of the hardest parts of lifelong fitness, if you've ever been out of shape, or eaten too much. Even if you know you can't go back to old habits, and you know about the problem, it's easy to go back. You lived that way for a reason.</p></div>		</li>
