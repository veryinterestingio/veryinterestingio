			<div class="markdown"><p>You know what, despite having lived in both Bath and Oxford I never got into real ale. I much prefer a cold fizzy lager. I also don't drink tea or coffee, so I'm a bit of a sterotype breaker for a mathematician.</p>
<p>I think the single most dangerous misconception is not really about a mathematical concept at all - and this is an idea I explore in the book a lot - it's beleiving that people who weild the statistics are unquestionable; tha numbers are somehow nuggets of hard truth that can't be questioned. Sometimes the people who use the numbers (be they doctors giving us medical test result or Journalists manipulating the results of a medical test or even &quot;expert&quot; witnesses in a law court who aren't experts in statistics) aren't the best equipped mathematically. </p>
<p>On that note, these are the last two paragraphs from the book</p>
<p>&quot;  We must ensure that the person with the most shocking statistics doesn’t always win the argument, by demanding an explanation of the maths behind the figures. We shouldn’t let medical charlatans delay us from receiving potentially life-saving treatment when their alternative therapies are just a regression to the mean. We mustn’t let the anti-vaxxers make us doubt the efficacy of vaccinations, when mathematics proves that they can save vulnerable lives and wipe out disease.</p>
<p>It is time for us to take the power back into our own hands, because sometimes maths really is a matter of life and death. &quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is extremely good point. Should we tell them that the commonly used p-value of 5% means that a random effect can manifest itself in 1 of 20 studies? I.e. one study in 20 could be bogus.</p>
<p>Many studies should have in caps &quot;IN MICE&quot;. So that journalists don't copy it as 2000th miracle cure. This comic shows it pretty well: <a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1174" target="_blank">http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1174</a></p>
<p>Also, people make mistakes. Some even cheat. In those professional papers.</p>
<p>A serious issue is that people don't try to replicate studies often, because impact factors. Though they'd need to be replicated to check if it holds up.</p>
<p>I can't even count how many times I tried to replicate a study, just to find out after a few days where the actual trick was hidden. How many times the formulas are flat out wrong. Missing definitions. Etcetera.</p>
<p>E.g. it's easy to tell which computers are bad if you have the IP reputation beforehand. Doesn't matter how many classifiers you threw at it. The reputation had such weight among other parameters that you could just basically save us all time by not writing that paper.</p>

<p>I know some of those personally. I would only approach them with something sharp, stabby, or bullety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, quite literally the most dangerous is the MMR anti-vaxxers who claim to understand the sham science that spawned their evil, but then refuse to accept REAL studies proving not vaccinating is 5 to 10 times more likely to result in death or disability than the FAKE risk of autism.</p>
<p>More generally, to my thinking the most &quot;dangerous&quot; misconception is that Statistics is difficult to understand. If people are resistant to even basic concepts, there's little chance they can thrive in the modern world.  How else do you decide where to send your kids to school? Which car to buy? Or understand what a poll is actually saying?  And if you don't understand Coincidence is not Correlation, and Correlation is not Causality, it's all useless anyway.  </p>
<p>A new survey in the States makes understanding polls simple: it reported 3% of African American women support Donald Trump in 2020. The poll's Margin of Error is 3.5%.</p>
<p>That's not to say we should stop tossing out the occasional &quot;homoskedasticity of residuals&quot; or &quot;multivariate regression&quot; to make strong men weep and women swoon. Or vice versa, since 60% of my OR MSc class at LSE was women. Though being 20 years older than most I learned an object lesson in outliers.</p>
<p>I also eschew coffee and tea (Diet Coke, thank you), but my first choice is a fine bitters. Impossible to find here in the States, getting more difficult in the UK. So I enjoy a Bombardier or Hobgoblin whenever possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That would only happen that frequently if all your nulls were true. In practice the overwhelming majority of published tests are done with point nulls, which are almost always strictly false.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly everything can fundamentally be expressed mathematically - well at least our brains are crunching reality into math equations. The problem is our conscious ability at breaking reality into data, there is a link between reality and data but we just don't have the ability to fully understand it. So it makes sense why we try to use data to express reality, we get disconnects. The reason why data scientist pays so much is the skill at reconstructing data back to reality</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people confuse mathematics with &quot;accounting math&quot;. Mathematics is science about structures.</p>
<p>In practical life, people confuse correlation/causation/implication/equivalence all the time. It's extremely annoying to have an argument with that confusion.</p>
<p>They don't understand even the most basics of statistics, like understanding sample size, the significance of an effect.</p>
<p>I don't expect them to understand Bayes theorem or Godel's theorems, but for the love of god don't misinterpret studies because you couldn't understand what it says.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are areas where this is true (Algebra, Topology, Graph Theory) and also some areas where this has little relevance (Number theory, Analysis, and Combinatorics). I believe a more general description of mathematics is &quot;the science of solution.&quot; It's why all the math problems from grades 1 to 18 begin with &quot;solve the following problem.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coul be said like that. Though I'd argue that number theory is also about structure. E.g. where exactly do primes lie (Riemann's hypothesis). Also analysis is about structures (Banach-Tarski paradox, some of Lagrange's theorems could be an example).</p>
<p>Or you could say that applied mathematics is more about solutions than structures, albeit numerical approximations at times.</p>
<p>Edit: one good example on how the structure part and solution parts overlap are SMT/SAT solvers. Based on very theoretical math, but they can crack real-world cryptosystems.</p></div>		</li>
