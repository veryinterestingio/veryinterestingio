			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry but this isn’t entirely accurate. If we’re going to make a comparison with water, voltage is pressure, amperes are flow rate and the size of your bucket is storage capacity. Also, how much water flowing per second gives you the flow rate not the pressure (although granted you can work out one from the other if other factors are known)</p>
<p>However, much like a bucket with a hole in it, as the bucket empties the pressure will drop (lower head pressure) and therefor the flow rate will also drop, so you’re kinda right, if only accidentally. But while this analogy is one way of measuring remaining charge of a battery it’s not a very good one, especially for lithium ion.</p></div>		</li>
