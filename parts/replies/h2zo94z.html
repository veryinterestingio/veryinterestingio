<p>Wow. Now I understand why the Romans decided just to build on top of their rubble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just used asbestos as one possible example, there's gonna be loads of other stuff and generally when you're turning up you don't have all the info you should about a building.</p>
<p>And yeah, even stuff that is considered non-toxic in its intended state can end up being hugely problematic when you pound it into a fine dust that then catches whatever gust of air goes by.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa... Thats a crazy price for tipping. I paid 7ish€ per metric ton of hardcore if I do all my work (well with my friend anyway). Thats not subsidized or covered by something else in any way, they grind it down and sell as construction materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is normal to do that sorting at the construction site if its a professional thing, so it will be mostly sorted (under 5% &quot;impurity&quot; is usually accepted). The way we did it:
Drive through a scale with a car and a trailer, drive to the yard, find the most similar looking mountain of rubble, load off that shit, go to the scale, go back to a pile of wood scrap, load that off, scale, go back, load of the asbestos roof crap.. repeat until its done. Go to the office, pay up, go home.</p>
<p>I replied to the part where he mentions tipping fees. €169 probably gets me a truck with a dumpster and 2 men who will shovel, take it all out, load up, leave and do all of the above while I stand around making sure they don't rip some wall out I need.</p>
<p>Cheaper might get me guys who will dump it in more shady place, which I don't condone.</p></div>		</li>
