<p>I assume they mean System on a chip. Basically everything you need in a computer in a single chip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SOC is System-on-chip; it typically combines a large number of common functions on a single die.</p>
<p>For example, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 'CPUs' in many phone are SOCs; they contain a CPU, GPU, Wifi/LTE Modem, typically some DSP for sound, and sometimes RAM.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks to everyone who replied. I appreciate it. </p>
<p>I would have figured you combined CPU/GPU/RAM/DSP, but never thought they could cram the modem and wifi on it too. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The industry never came up with a smaller RAM board standard</p>

<p>Desktops use DIMM for their shape, but there is also SO-DIMM, which is about half the size. Laptops probably use this size if their RAM is expandable, and other hardware like routers and printers might use it, but still SO-DIMM would be too large for cell phones. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point; There is SO-DIMM, but even it is far too large for many small form factor devices.</p>
<p>I was focusing on the difference in how it's implemented between socketed and saudered-on installations, and glossed over SO-DIMM. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
