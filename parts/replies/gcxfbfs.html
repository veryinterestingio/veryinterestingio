			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're correct that people pay for the rate of data transfer in terms of speed, I imagine the person asking the question is from the US or somewhere where they still have a cap on data usage amounts too, i.e. only 100GB of data a month or whatever. That's most likely what they mean when they say quantity, they're talking about how much they're allowed to transfer according to their plans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I've always found that really interesting, the cost is absurd. I pay about Â£16 a month ($20?) For a SIM only contract which gives me unlimited everything, tethering included. US prices seem absolutely insane to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah I had satellite internet a few years back and the data caps and plans were killing me, but the unlimited plan was very expensive at the time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point; I've edited my answer to address this. TLDR: 100GB/month is still a rate!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but many do pay for a amount of data, even now you can buy data in gigs, when you use it all you have to buy more data</p></div>		</li>
