			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Helium hates itself.</p>
<p>Long answer:<br />
The three main phases, solid liquid and gas, are based on the attraction of the molecules to themselves. The less attraction, the more they can bounce around, and the less they stick; becoming a liquid, then a gas.</p>
<p>A solid, like a block of iron, is very self-attracted, meaning even at high energies (high temperatures) it will remain solid. However, a gas (let's just say nitrogen) isn't attracted to itself very much at all. So, you have two options. One, condense it down so that it can't move around very much, and it is forced to solidify or liquify (pressure), OR you lower the energy enough that it would rather calm down and make friends with its elemental buddies (freezing).</p>
<p>Helium has so little attraction to its own elements, for a variety of reasons (mainly noble gas, and smaller molecules are less reactive), that even at almost the lowest energy you can make it, it still doesn't bind with itself at standard pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the answer I first thought of. I would be interested in knowing what substances can exist in liquid form at 1atm but have a very small gap between freezing and boiling.</p></div>		</li>
