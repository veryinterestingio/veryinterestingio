Also works better with larger apertures set on the lens itself (relative to the size of the shaped hole you're shooting through). It's easier to achieve that with a lens that has a large maximum aperture in the first place (e.g. f/2.8 rather than f/5.6)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It took me way too long to realize that camera was taking a picture of itself in a mirror. I thought you had taken the image with another camera.  Very interesting.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to see it take a picture of a distant point source of light at varying degrees of focus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually do have that kind of defect after an eye surgery. My left eye pupil turns into a horizontal slit under light. </p>
<p>I can confirm shapes are the same. I just see a bit blurry with that eye. Doctor said it will turn back to normal in time.</p></div>		</li>
