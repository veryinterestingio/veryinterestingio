			<div class="markdown"><p>Another cool thing to know is the secondary colours are the opposite scales primaries when mixed in equal parts.</p>
<p>Subtractive</p>
<p>Yellow + Magenta = Red</p>
<p>Yellow + Cyan = Green</p>
<p>Cyan + Magenta = Blue</p>
<p>Additive</p>
<p>Blue + Green=Cyan</p>
<p>Red + Blue=Magenta</p>
<p>Green + Red=Yellow</p>
<p>Edit: Additive not addictive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to explain is that RGB generates light, while CMYK reflects light. I work in print advertising, so I have to work in both color modes. The difference is vast! RGB has millions of colors. CMYK has 10,000. Photos that look good on screen may not look good in print without significant massaging, or sometimes simply not at all. Things like skies or grass often don't convert well between the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to jump on this reply and add that the mixing of colors is based on the sensitivity of the human eye and human perception.</p>
<p>When we talk about human vision seeing red, green, and blue, what we mean is that we have 3 kinds of cones in our eyes.</p>
<p>The &quot;blue&quot; cones see wavelengths of light from about 400nm to 640nm, and are most sensitive to 420nm wavelengths.</p>
<p>The &quot;green&quot; cones see wavelengths from 400 to 650nm, but are most sensitive to 535nm light.</p>
<p>The red cones see wavelengths from 400 to 680nm, but are most sensitive to 565nm light.</p>
<p>True yellow light has a wavelength of about 580nm and stimulates the red and green cones in about equal measure. Our brain interprets this stimulation as &quot;yellow.&quot; If we produce the colors red and green together in about equal ratios, it stimulates the red and green cones in equal measure. Our brain interprets this as being the color yellow.</p>
<p>If we had an extra cone in our eyes that was most sensitive to light between 535nm and 565nm, it would be stimulated by yellow light more than red and green light. We would be able to uniquely identify yellow as being yellow, instead of being a mix of red and green.</p>
<p>This produces some very interesting behaviors in the human eye. The red cones in our eyes have low sensitivity at 450nm, but the sensitivity curve is actually slightly higher at 400nm. This causes us to &quot;see&quot; a bit of red in light at 400nm, giving ultraviolet light it's purple hue.</p>
<p>To produce purple light, we mix red and blue values in equal measure. Where equal parts red and green simulate a wavelength between the two colors (yellow) equal parts red and blue do not (a wavelength between the two would be interpreted as greenish.)</p>
<p>Other combinations have no equivalent wavelength on the visible spectrum. Where violet is due to the 400nm response of our red cones, there's no wavelength of light which will produce an equal response in the red and blue cones without also stimulating the green cones. Magenta and pink are made by mixing red and blue light in a way that's impossible to accomplish with a single wavelength of light.</p>

<p>Some other notes:</p>
<p>We can measure the actual wavelengths of light using an optical spectrometer. These use various methods to split light spatially based on its component wavelengths. The simplest example is a prism, which refracts (bends) shorter wavelengths of light (blue) more than longer wavelengths of light (red). An entrance slit is used to allow a single &quot;beam&quot; of light to reach the prism, and the prism splits it apart revealing the colors making up the light. A true white source will produce a rainbow. Where a RGB source will produce distinct bands of red, green, and blue.</p>

<p>You can make a spectrometer at home using a printed card and a CD.</p>

<p>One other interesting note is that the cones in our eyes are sensitive to UV light down to about 300nm. The main reason we can't see UV is that the lens of our eye blocks it.</p>
<p>Modern camera sensors can detect UV light down to about 350nm (UV) and well above 1000nm (IR.) Most modern lenses block UV light; the coatings, materials and glues used inside them don't allow it to pass. The camera includes an IR blocking filter to prevent IR from reaching the sensor. Tree leaves and other things reflect a lot of IR, which will produce a strong red tint and low contrast if it were allowed in.</p>
<p>Film stocks tend to be more sensitive to UV than modern digital sensors, but significantly less sensitive to IR. Older lenses were also simpler, and tended to allow more UV to reach the film. Photographers used UV blocking filters to prevent the the film from capturing UV. These filters are not necessary with modern cameras, and are mostly used to protect the front of the lens.</p>
<p>Because film is not normally sensitive to IR or deep red, we can develop it under a red &quot;safe light&quot; in a dark room without fogging the film up. Human eyes are sensitive to those wavelengths, but film is usually not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, if I were using an old Black and White film camera (which is sensitive to IR ?) then Red flags and Green leaves would be <strong>brighter</strong> on the photo than when I look at them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. I will add this people get hung up on yellow blue red, or red green blue color systems. CMYK is a common color system for printers, but there are a ton of different color systems out there. </p>
<p>Printing companies sometimes have to print with wierd color systems or special inks so that they can get prints that are true to color with the digital designs. Look into it if you are interested it's pretty neat stuff.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will point out that the reason we use Red, Green and Blue primaries is because those are the primaries the human S,M and L Cone cells are vaguely centered around. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_sensitivity#/media/File:Cones_SMJ2_E.svg" target="_blank">Cones SMJ2 E - Spectral sensitivity - Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>If we had yellow detector cones and had  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy" target="_blank">Tetrachromacy - Wikipedia</a> , we would probably need to modify our display primaries from RGB to RYGB displays or everything would look fake.</p>
<p>RGB only works because our eyes are easily fooled through  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)" target="_blank">Metamerism (color) - Wikipedia</a>.    Some cameras though have different RGB sensitivity so you can never color correct a photo to look exactly the same way it &quot;looks&quot; to a human's retina.   But since we're directly stimulating the least overlapped areas of the cones we're able to deliver billions of colors pretty much indistinguishable from the real thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point of note (and can be seen in your first link above), the &quot;Red&quot; cone actually more accurately centres itself on yellow BUT the red cone is the only one that stretches to the red zone of the visible light spectrum with any sort of relative frequency, and so we assigned it the &quot;Red&quot; name for sake of ease.</p>
<p>The abundant overlap between our green and red cones is 1) largely why red-green colour blindness is the most frequent colour blindness and 2) allows us to differentiate the most shades of green, compared to any other colour, while the lack of coverage on the red end of the spectrum means our eyes are not very sensitive to red light.</p>
<p>To break it down very simply, that's a general rule as to why we use shades of green for classic night vision (we can differentiate more shades, therefore get a more detailed picture and are more sensitive to the different intensities, assisting in depth), and why we often use red for low-light objects that we want to be seen but not to be intrusive or irritating (common for alarm clocks, exit signs [red's frequency also travels further without deviating, which allows for a better image at night or in low-light, too])</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting thing is the colour magenta. It's what our brains come up with when they see red and blue cones activate at the same time, even though there is no possible wavelength of light that could actually do that (without also activating green), which is why some people say it &quot;doesn't exist&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an addition to this: most paints consider the base colors to be Blue Yellow and Red. (this is also often taught at school) This is confusing because additive primaries also contain blue.</p>
<p>The answer is that with subtractive BYG colors, you can't actually get the full spectrum from just mixing (even though this is kinda what kids are taught) - you can't get to the cyan or magenta areas on the gamut; but these colors do not really appear enough in &quot;normal&quot; paintings to be a real problem. </p>
<p>For painting, one needs to use actual cyan or magenta paints and cannot just mix red/yellow/blue to get there.</p></div>		</li>
