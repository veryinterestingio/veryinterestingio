			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any source of that? I am definitely a night owl and I'm finding increasingly difficult to explain to others why I find so difficult to follow normal sleep patterns in this pandemic. I find myself falling asleep by 4AM and waking up at <del>12AM</del>12PM. I tried waking up earlier for a few days, so that I would be tired and I would be able to go to sleep earlier, it didn't work, I just somehow defaulted to a longer day than usual and went to sleep at the same late time as before.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've tried and had to change my sleeping  hours many times, but when I dont have to wake up in the mornings I always drift to that schedule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like even though you might be a night owl you fall asleep this late because of screens / lamps being around. I don't think if you lived during the middle age that you would fall asleep at 4am because it would be very dark and there wouldn't be much to do.</p>
<p>I once read that in some isolated tribes nowadays that young / older people have different sleep schedules so that there is only a short window during the night where no one is awake. I think the latest someone would get to sleep was at like midnight or 1am.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying you have it, but look up delayed sleep phase disorder (there's also advanced sleep phase disorder, which is opposite). There's another comment responding to OP that doesn't specifically reference these, but explains that some people are naturally night owls or early birds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told I have delayed sleep phase disorder when I was maybe 21 after I saw a doctor. No matter what I tried, I'm just a night person. I find that in periods where I'm unemployed or have time off I default to a roughly 28-32 hour cycle. I work in security now, of which 99.9% is nights (I'm currently at work, 1730-0400) and while it does match me way better than say, school, I'm starting to really hate being forced to be so alone. It's almost impossible for me to get anything done or have any sort of life outside of work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That used to be me before the pandemic and now it's shifted into going to sleep at 1pm and waking up at 10pm and I keep trying to not fall asleep during the day but I get so tired and then can't sleep at night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, I know there are more morning people than nightowls but I vote all of us fellow night owls rebel and start a night society so we can have our own businesses to work at and go to/utilitize with a schedule that works for us. The only time I felt my work matched with my natural sleep pattern was when I was a bouncer working 8:00pm to 4am. There's so few jobs that follow a similar schedule so I'm forced to be an early bird but I feel like I'm brain dead all day by doing so in comparison to being awake at night.</p>
<p>I know it will never happen, but a night owl can dream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the lockdown I had 2 weeks with no work and because I couldn’t leave the house I had absolutely no where to go in the days. I very quickly reverted back to my teenager summer holiday sleep pattern of going to bed at around 6-7am and waking up very late in the afternoon. Since the age of 16 I’d always had summer jobs or somewhere to go that meant I had to get up in the mornings so it was interesting that 14 years later I still hadn’t changed and my natural sleep pattern is total night owl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i had five years off work. i found i was on a 25 hour circadian rhythm. so each day i naturally woke and slept about an hour later unless i forced myself otherwise. over the course of each month i'd typically wake up every hour of the clock.</p>
<p>some times i'd try and reset myself. stay awake 36 hours to go to bed at a normal hour. then within a few days i'd find myself sleeping four or five hours extra, because i was over tired, and wrecking my pattern again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve got this except mine is a little longer, maybe 26-27 hours. If I were allowed to just go with my natural rhythm I would sleep about 10 hours and be awake for about 16. What ends up happening in reality is I usually get shorter and shorter nights of sleep each night until one day a month or so I play catch up and get like 12-13 hours of sleep.</p></div>		</li>
