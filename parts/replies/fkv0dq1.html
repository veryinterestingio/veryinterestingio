			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't underestimate the trauma that will be caused by this pandemic. It will have lasting consequences just like 9/11 had on security. We could see long-term measures. Surfaces in public spaces designed to minimize viral survival, increased screening of viral illnesses, etc. People have been spraying antibacterial crap everywhere even though bacteria have never been the main concern for epidemiologists. edit: Just wanted to add that antibacterial resistance is a significant concern though.</p>
<p>It's like companies only investing in IT security once they've had a major security problem. We hadn't been doing much in terms of viral illnesses prevention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most cases of food poisoning aren't caused by people not knowing how to cook properly, they're caused by unsanitary processing or similar at the production level. Eg. cholera outbreaks in the production of fresh veggies, unsanitary conditions in the butchering process, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to confirm that stomach viruses are still going strong. I have been staying home for two weeks now, with the exception of getting the occasional take out, and I got a 24 hour bug. I was mostly annoyed since I had been scrubbing the skin off my hands and taking other steps to stay clean/healthy. But it was probably in something I ate. Uhg. Fortunately, in my house we had a quarintine plan in place in case one of us got sick and that was tested and passed. The bug stopped with me.</p></div>		</li>
