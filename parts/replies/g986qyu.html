			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. But my point was that since these are simple measures and we know that none of them are completely effective, a) it would be unethical to force a cohort to just use one (which doesn't answer your question, I know), and b) it's not like all of these measures can't be implemented with minimum effort, fuss or inconvenience everywhere anyway, so the value of needing to ee which is best and choose one over any other is not so great. I know this doesn't really answer your question either, but it might explain why we're not too concerned about why it needs to be addressed. :)</p></div>		</li>
