			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe they’ve come in contact with a similar version of that virus before so their immune system found antibodies quickly. Maybe their initial infection was smaller and more easily handled. Maybe they were in better health when their immune system began the attack so symptoms did not arise. Maybe their immune system just happened to use the correct antibodies early on.</p>
<p>It’s really some combination of these things. The immune system is extremely complex. There’s so many variables and unknowns it’s really hard to say why some do and some don’t.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible that they were only exposed to a small level of the virus to begin with, so assuming it replicates in an exponential manner, it would have been detected and antibodies produced early enough to avoid further symptoms?</p>
<p>The opposite would be someone suddenly being exposed to a large quantity of the virus and coming down more suddenly. I'm not an expert but this would make sense to me.</p>
<p>EDIT: Did a little reading and it looks like this would be entirely plausible. Our immune systems are very complex and combat the infection at all stages, from generic capabilities to kill or prevent infected cells from spreading disease early to specific immune responses that eliminate the virus in the late stages. If the infection was sufficiently small to begin with, the immune system may be able to slow it from spreading, delaying significant symptoms until an antibody is developed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viral load is a thing. The greater amount of the contagion that you are exposed to, the more of an immune response is needed to fight it. </p>
<p>That's why you see some doctors that are treating patients with COVID-19 coming down with critical cases of it themselves. They have a much higher exposure to the virus. </p>
<p>If you are exposed in passing, less of the virus gets into your body initially and your immune system can fight it off with a lower response. </p>
<p>Think like an enemy storming the gates, you need to aim everything you've got at it. Vs a trickle of enemy soldiers where you can just pop them off with a dude in a guard tower.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Answering this as someone with the opposite issue: my immune system is compromised. I don't get these symptoms; my body cannot get rid of the virus in the same way, it grows, develops, I die.</p>
<p>For those that do not react, one has to imagine their immunity already exists (they're body has no need to get rid of the virus, it simply recognises it in it's tiniest form when it first tries to gain access. </p>
<p>It expels the virus and as the virus is very undeveloped in size and remains quite tiny it is very much easier to get rid of. It can be exorcised via whatever bodily fluids the body see's fit, as with any other anti-body it deems unacceptable for whatever reason, be that because it just doesn't like the look of it (it's an &quot;alien body&quot; or it is recognised as a virus, either from past experience in some way or just because their DNA has it inbuilt to see it as a threat). It will expel in the easiest way it can, be that sneezing, coughing, passing through the gut or however else it deems fit. It could be such a small and underdeveloped virus that the method needed isn't much at all and it's almost unrecognised on a concious level, or that the person is just far too busy in their concious life, with family/job/whatever else to pay it much attention at all.</p>
<p>How many times have you randomly sneezed or had a bit of a bad belly and then it clears up almost without notice? Do you ever think about what every single incident was about? Perhaps had your body not reacted like that, whatever was inside of you developed to a deadly level. That it didn't meant your immune system was able to get rid of it before you even noticed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Except those with immunity. Once the immune system figures out the specific antibody to identify and target the disease, any new infection of that disease is eliminated with extreme prejudice without showing many of the symptoms. Basically immune system assassins.</p></div>		</li>
