While the sun is not an idealised black-body it is very close. This image shows that no star could ever appear green as a function of temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really cool and answers the question perfectly I think. One thing I'm having trouble interpreting, what does the &quot;infinity&quot; hard stop signify on the plotted line? Does it mean that's as &quot;blue&quot; as it's going to get, no matter how hot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The ratio of intensities across the visible range approaches a constant as the temperature goes to infinity. Things keep getting brighter, but the color impression (if you are sufficiently far away to not damage your eyes...) doesn't change any more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're totally arbitrary axes. The coordinates of a given color in those axes were determined by perception experiments with people in 1931. There are two other similar color spaces commonly used in color science with different labels for the axes that are just as arbitrary, (u, v) in 1960 and (u', v') in 1976</p>
<p>The main feature of these color spaces is that two light sources represented by points in the space will produce a color somewhere on the line between them when mixed. But the diagram could be rotated and scaled evenly without changing that property, which makes the axes arbitrary</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but then the question is meaningless, since the alien would have a different definition of &quot;green&quot;.</p>
<p>You could actually see it as green, as a human, if you were somehow insensitive to red light, though. But then every star would be green/cyan, so that wouldn't say very much. At point &quot;green&quot; would just mean &quot;not blue&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a recent paper (summary <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-are-plants-green-to-reduce-the-noise-in-photosynthesis-20200730/" target="_blank">link</a>) that may have finally solved this question: why do plants reflect green light, when our sun (even through the atmosphere) has the most energy in those green frequencies. Their conclusion: flickering light (mainly from other leaves) makes it less energy efficient, in the long term, to focus on the peak wavelengths than on the surrounding colors. Evolution preferred steady energy absorption to higher, but more variable, absorption. So plants absorb more red and blue than green, despite the fact that our sun (through the atmosphere) has more energy in the green frequencies. Not in any way an obvious or simple behavior to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought they'd already rather conclusively proven it was because cyanobacteria evolved chlorophyll in an environment where they lived in the shadows of purple-red photosynthesizers? </p>
<p>Like what you're saying clearly can't be the full story because there are absolutely red and purple plants still, too.</p>
<p>Edit â€” Yeah I don't buy this study. They're greatly exaggerating how their prediction for absorption peaks matches observed data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually no.  The chlorophyll being green means that it is reflecting that color, and not absorbing it at all.  Plants benefit most from red and blue.  Check out some uber-efficient greenhouses; they use all red and blue LED grow lights, because anything not used by the plant is just wasted heat.</p>
<p>Look at that spectrum chart again.  Yes, the sun's output peaks in green, but what actually reaches the surface is much 'flatter' across the visible spectrum.  And worse, plants evolved in the ocean, so what's really relevant is what the absorption spectrum looks like underwater.  And perhaps not even then; if evolution simply first stumbled upon a &quot;pretty good&quot; solution with red &amp; blue-absorbing molecules, or the green-absorbing molecule just isn't as effective, then the reason for <em>green</em> plants would be chemical and biological, not the physics of nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>In any event, the limiting factor is not usually how much sunlight can be taken in by the plant, but rather water and all the assorted other nutrients.  Notice how many plants prefer partial shade, or even no direct sunlight at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that there are many brown and violet algae, and even some terrestrial plants, which consequently absorb the green light very well. It may well be that those plants evolved first, but were later outcompeted by the green plants which filled a different niche.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, those plants are MUCH, MUCH <strong>YOUNGER</strong> than green plants.</p>
<p>Brown algae first appeared 150-200 million years ago.  Green algae first appeared 1 billion years ago, and blue-green &quot;algae&quot; (which actually are photosynthetic <em>bacteria</em>) may have appeared as much as 3.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Typically when something is much more abundant, found across more species and biomes, that means it evolved <em>eatlier</em>.  Common traits are often common simply because species carrying them have had more time to specialize into many different evolutionary niches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm colorblind, so forgive me if I ask for a clarification.</p>
<p>I thought purple was a combination of red and blue light, so no star could be purple because it could not peak in two frequencies that far separated from each other.  Is violet equal to purple?  Does a red+blue two-peak object look the same to human beings as a violet single-peak object?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>violet is a distinct color (purple is a range of colors); red and blue light mix to form magenta (which is like pink and violet mixed)</p>
<p>to that end, magenta light can't really exist except for a mixture of red and blue; orange acts the way you described. red + yellow is indistinguishable to the eye from straight orange</p>
<p>edit: here is a good <a href="https://youtu.be/FTKP0Y9MVus" target="_blank">video</a> to watch about color (i am sorry if you can't see all the colors though)</p></div>		</li>

They can see more into the Violet range.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't violet light purple? It was my understanding that violet was visible to pretty much everybody, and that it was ultraviolet that some people can occasionally percieve as bluish white. All the sources I could find described violet as at the higher end of the visible spectrum, and having a similar appearance to the color violet that's created as a mix of red and blue. Apologies if I'm missing something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll probably late to the feast, but... We have to remember  that light can light is emitted  and light can be absorbed. </p>
<p>This is as simple as I can make it.</p>
<p>A red LED is giving out red light.</p>
<p>Red paint isn't red because it's giving out red light. It's red because a pigment in the paint is absorbing blue light, and reflecting red light.</p></div>		</li>
