			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard cheeses are like Parmesan and cheddar. Low water content compared to something like a Brie or <em>ahem</em> American cheese. This means that there is less sugars as the culturing process has progressed thoroughly. On that same note that is the basic idea with probiotics and things like yogurt and cottage cheese. The problem with this is that in addition to the cultured dairy you are also getting loads of sugars that will fuel the bad bacteria. </p>
<p>Cheeses also promote saliva flow which is protective and  neutralizes the harmful acid effects IF the tooth surface is clean. So eating cheese by itself may be good or cheese with spinach but put that into a spinach dip and put that on a cracker defeats the purpose. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can reduce the risk of cavities by attempting to remineralizing them with certain products or foods like hard cheeses but it is much more complex than that.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dental professional here.  You should always research advice from anything on the internet. The term you are looking for is cariogenic foods, demineralization and REmineralization of teeth. </p>
<p>Enamel is mostly minerals and the weakening of teeth happens when bacteria in our mouths lower the pH below 5.5. There are products with dairy derivatives like recaldent in trident and lately arginine for preventing the decay process. </p>
<p>But once again we need to control many other factors such as how often one eats/snacks and how good we are at cleaning all areas of our mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dental Hygienist for 25years here. This is why they say “Cheese puts the bite on cavities”. It neutralizes the bad acids left in your mouth after eating. Reduced decay (not by much though.) It’s easier and much more effective at just using a fluoride toothpaste or MI paste.</p></div>		</li>
