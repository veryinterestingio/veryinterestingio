<p>use molecular micro techniques to validate specimen acquisition techniques</p>

<p>You were validating the methods they used to acquire the specimens? Or the specimens themselves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Validate new swab types and placement during acquisition during a small research tech position between school and starting my first hospital job. Edit here: a friend and I were working with an MD/PhD who was trying to get a new swab cleared through the FDA. We both left before he finished his swab design copyright application but I'm relatively certain it got denied due to similarities to another product used to get NP swabs for PCR type testing. Essentially we did a lot of work with different sizes, materials, and where in upper respiratory tract to get specimens. He was doing some work with the hospital we trained for lab at and some patients who were positive for flu, rhino/enterovirus, etc agreed to an additional swab or 2 for research purposes.</p>
<p>Once I was in the hospital, I validated testing for new tests and reagent lot numbers so we could maintain clearances to run testing and do CAP surveys.</p></div>		</li>
