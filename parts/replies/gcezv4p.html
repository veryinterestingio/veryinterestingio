			<div class="markdown"><p>To your point however, it's a common misconception is that COVID is a respiratory disease. While the airway is the primary method of transmission, SARS-CoV-2 attacks multiple organs and body systems. It's high affinity for our ACE-2 receptor, allows it to move to multiple systems of an infected host. This receptor is found most in the fatty tissue lining our organs. More fatty tissue, more seceptability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, fat cells undergo hypertrophy (increased cell size) as you mentioned, and also hyperplasia (increased cell proliferation/reproduction). This means fatter individuals have more adipose cells and those cells are larger in volume. Lastly, when you start losing fat, the cell size begins to reverse and get smaller. However, you do not lose cell count (generally). This is a serious reason why when people diet and lose weight, their relapse back to being overweight is quick and easy. Here's a paper on it for more info: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653640/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653640/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653640/</a></a></p></div>		</li>
