			<div class="markdown"><p>Gonna hijack top comment because I think it looks at the topic in a manner that is not overly related to energy consumption.  And nothing against Daniel Kahneman, but he doesn't really know boo about brain metabolism.  </p>
<p>There is a big misconception that thinking hard somehow ups the energy consumption of the brain precipitously and that isn't even close to the truth.  One of the largest components of the brain's energy budget is maintenance of membrane potentials for all the different cell types in the brain as well as protein synthesis etc.  This is referred to as housekeeping.  This component of the energy budget is more or less fixed. Then there is the constant firing of all the sensory systems etc.  </p>
<p>One way to measure energy consumption in the brain is glucose utilization by PET (positron emission tomography) or by fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging).  The latter is indirectly related to the energy use but is strongly  correlated with increases in local glucose consumption through blood flow - glucose/oxygen consumption coupling. These  variables are strongly coupled (the correlation coefficient for flow metabolism coupling across multiple brain regions from multiple studies is &gt; 0.9).   If you put someone in an MRI scanner and have them do nothing, there is circuitry called the default mode network that is active (and some parts are less active).  This network is incredibly conserved across subjects and some people refer to it as the &quot;laundry list&quot; network since when you are requested to do nothing then you start musing about all sorts of things you might have to do, like your laundry.   If you are then presented with a task, such as a complicated mental arithmetic problem what will happen is the default mode network becomes less active and other areas related to arithmetical calculation become active.   The total energy consumed by the brain doesn't actually change that much, but different local regions will change.  Don't forget that when you are awake your visual, acoustic, proprioceptive and other systems are more or less constantly active and therefore action potentials are continually being produced.  </p>
<p>Here is one of the best (albeit rather old - 2001) accountings of the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1097/00004647-200110000-00001" target="_blank">energy budget of the brain</a>.   This analysis is for information processing in grey matter.  White matter consumes about 30-40% of the energy [whether measured by glucose/oxygen/ATP] of grey matter.   For white matter the &quot;house-keeping&quot; functions unrelated to neural activity are a much larger fraction of the total energy budget than grey matter (about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3272449/" target="_blank">60% vs. 25% in grey matter</a>).  Therefore all this energy in white matter is being consumed rather independently of alterations in cognitive activity.    In short by my educated estimate, intense mental activity about something might only increase overall brain energy consumption by something on the order of 1-3%.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, from our own experience, there's certainly an &quot;exhaustion&quot; period after a long day of work solving problems (I'm a software developer, so essentially entirely mental labor).</p>
<p>So the real question should be, at least for what I'm curious about, what is the feeling of &quot;mental exhaustion&quot; that we're feeling?  That likely has more to do with the mechanics of memory, learning, and knowledge than simple energy use.  Edit:  I shoulda just read further down this thread :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question however when you are doing something you love like skiing or playing guitar or even checking out people in a bar your brain, from a neural activity point of view, is definitely working as hard as when you are thinking about something like a math problem.   It may be, however, that sustained singular activity does eventually cause depletion of chemicals that must be replenished and that the local brain region needs to use the excess energy for something like more neurotransmitter synthesis for instance. I notice this effect most when I am driving for a very long drive like 5 hours or more.  When I stop I often feel like not even looking at a screen.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy is not the only potential cost for using the brain. There may be other things that are limiting the maximum concentration. I mean sure, if you lack energy from food, you won't be able to concentrate much. But simply eating doesn't help you with concentrating after 4 hours.</p>
<p>So theres obviously other things happening in the brain that require breaks or even sleeping to continue giving the best results.</p>
<p>Some of these things may even be about time, just differently than you thought. Because relaxing for some time does restore your ability to concentrate.</p>
<p>So whatever I'm the brain gets used up by concentration is restored over time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The answer is yes.  In addition to all other stamina. That's what causes a diabetic coma.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You are referring to hypoglycemic coma, primarily a complication of insulin use. Normal adults do not become hypoglycemic in the absence of a stimulus like self-administered insulin, and hypoglycemia is not typically associated with a decrease in mental stamina--rather, it causes depression of all mental function (metabolic encephalopathy).</p>
<p>When we say &quot;diabetic coma&quot; we are more commonly talking about the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482142/" target="_blank">hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome</a>, a state in which hyperglycemia causes fluid shifts in the brain that result in altered mental status and coma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there was any way to isolate what part of the body consumes calories when those things were stated.</p>
<p>So since professional chess players obviously &quot;care&quot; about their craft, their whole body will experience stress.</p>
<p>Just like playing any competitive game on the computer will raise your heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
<p>Since the easiest, and probably oldest way to measure metabolic activity, is to simply take oxygen breathed in minus oxygen breathed out, those numbers make it impossible to see which part of the body actually consumes calories.</p>
<p>Since any stress will cause the body to burn more calories.</p></div>		</li>
