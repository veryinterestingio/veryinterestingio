			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you personally experience the lifting of the fog you described? Because most of the times I had a cold there was a pattern: at some point of my illness I felt more energetic and happy. One time I have had inflamed tonsils for days, and at the 3rd or 4th night my heartbeat felt unusual, checked my pulse, was at 55-60 range, whereas my usual resting HR is 70-80. The day after I felt more lively, smarter and motivated, also I had an urge to &quot;do&quot;. But as a few days passed, I was healthy but never felt like I should be active.<br />
Also, one time I took aspirin for a few days for a minor cold, and at a Friday I drank a six-pack and felt very energetic and strong, like I was drugged...but all I had was beer. My stomach was burning quite intensely (probably because of the ASA), but I had so much energy that I was out all night dancing like a rave maniac.<br />
Maybe these are just coincidences, but the thing is that when I'm healthy (no illnesses, colds or other) I feel tired and depressed. The inflammatory theory of depression is something that gets some attention nowadays, but I'm sceptical because you can get the same amount of confirmation and disapproval on research topics in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I was diagnosed with the inflammatory disease, ankylosing spondylitis, at the age of 25. One hour after taking my first dose of Humira (a medication that blocks the cytokine TNF-alpha), it felt like I was waking up for the first time in a year. </p>
<p>My mind became quicker. I became more aware of my surroundings. I was more motivated and active. I was definitely happier. </p>
<p>And then I would lose it all periodically, about a week after my dose, because the standard 2-week dosing cycle wasn't frequent enough for me. Getting suppressed by the cytokines again was never as noticeable. I would just start losing track of time, move slower, lose my productivity and my intellectual sharpness. And then my next dose would bring it all back again. This leveled off when I was approved for weekly Humira 3 years later.</p>
<p>It's interesting how it's so much easier to notice yourself getting smarter than it is to notice yourself getting dumber. It's a really clear demonstration of the Dunning-Kruger effect.</p></div>		</li>
