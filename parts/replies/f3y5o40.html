			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere recently that the plumb bob, as an example, is a largely unchanged tool that was used the same way for hundreds of years and is still used exactly the same way today.</p>
<p>It was in a post about flying buttresses that listed several tools that my goldfish brain can’t remember right now that are unchanged except perhaps materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plumb bobs, string lines, water levels, all very much used today the same way for hundreds of years. Sure, we got lasers and shit, but using the old tools helps build fundamental knowledge of the craft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a 3-beam laser level.  It’s probably one of the most useful tools I’ve ever bought and has saved me HOURS on various projects around my house.  The thing is basically the combination of a plumb bob, string, level, and straight edge all in one super amazing, yet still surprisingly simple tool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great points - I'd also mention that on the construction side, there were quite sophisticated &quot;technologies&quot; based on knowledge at the time that simply aren't used anymore because there are easier ways to do it now. But old methods were still very clever and innovative, based on less advanced tools. Kind of like &quot;steampunk&quot; or &quot;atompunk&quot; extending somewhat outdated tech. Romans with their even more outdated &quot;technology&quot; were able to build a miles-long aqueduct of smoothly fitting, leak-less stone or concrete at a slight angle. They also invented a form of concrete that is stronger in some ways than material today, getting stronger with exposure to seawater.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Story-Construction-David-Macaulay" target="_blank">David Macaulay's Cathedral</a> is a great (illustrated!) dive into medieval construction techniques. Highly recommended and it's written like an ELI5!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That handles the &quot;designed perfectly&quot; part.</p>
<p>The &quot;built perfectly&quot; part might actually be harder. For example, the work required to get stone blocks perfectly square, or according for the lack of perfect square without ruining design.</p>
<p>I guess we only see the ones that didn't fall down over the years. That and back then they could probably kill off workers who screwed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Survivorship bias is always in play. Oldies are typically good music because there's a selection bias to pick the favorites and ignore the duds of the past. Old vehicles you see on the road are better maintained by their owners than the new cars, but the new cars are better engineered to need less maintenance. The buildings that have survived hundred or thousands of years have probably done so  they were better maintained.</p></div>		</li>
