<p>We use UV lamps in some of the equipment at work and they generate a bit of Ozone, the amount of extraction H&amp;S requires us to have to remove the Ozone is ludicrous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would love to know the answer to this question. I once got upgraded to a beautiful room at a casino but it reeked of smoke. I called reception and they sent up a maintenance guy with a large ozone machine. Fast forward 90 minutes - the smell was completely gone and the air just smelled and felt so pleasant in the room.</p></div>		</li>
