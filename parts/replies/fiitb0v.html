If it were oil, they could hold back more than 231 feet because the specific gravity of oil products is less than 1.0!   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My message?</p>
<p>Hell, I don't approve! It's a reflection on industry and it's culture. Profits above all else and I'm lucky to benifit from those experiences.</p>
<p>There are disasters out there waiting to happen. Substitution of materials, inappropriate ratings of EX gear, service life being extended beyond reason....I could go on.</p>
<p>Oil and gas is a rotton industry and the cracks will open up as renewables take over. Companies will resist and eek out as much life from aging equipment as possible without spending more than they have to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but I think your guesstimate on pressure is far too great.</p>
<p>City water pressure is between 45 and 80 psi.  I can't come close to completely holding back a garden hose with my thumb.  If the valve is only partly on for really slow flow, I can block it at first, but as pressure builds, no, I can't.</p>
<p>So I'd spitball ~20psi as a limit, so 46 ft of water column.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the size of the hole. A hose is pretty big, if it was a pinhole it would be easy to plug. What ultimately matters is the force, which is pressure x cross-sectional area of the hole. A smaller hole would be easier than a large one with the same pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is important to consider. It is trivial to hold back 125 PSI air from a 1/8&quot; shop nozzle. I'm sure that even standing on a 55 gallon drum lid with all of my 350 lb weight I could never keep 125 PSI from leaking, if not launching me off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be very careful if you're ever tempted to do this. A pinhole stream at moderately high pressure will break the skin, tear into underlying tissues, and likely lead to necrosis requiring amputation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got two systems in play with city water, flow pressure and static pressure.  You may have flow pressure of 45 and 80 which you could hold back, but the second you stop flow you get the static pressure of the system, which could be 100-150psi, causing you to not be able to hold it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>static pressure of the system, which could be 100-150psi,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You wish. Our house is on top of a hill, and static pressure barely exceeds 30psi. Flow pressure can be less than that at times.</p>
<p>We installed a booster pump which brings static pressure up to around 70psi. Flow pressure drops a couple of psi, when the pump can't quite keep up with demand.</p>
<p>If your utility provides static pressure that is much higher than this, houses usually will have a pressure reducing valve, as a lot of plumbing isn't meant regularly experience more than around 100 psi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google tells me municipal water pressure is 45 and 80 psi.  Height is everything.</p>
<p>Two houses running off the same line but at different elevations experience a loss of 1 psi for every 2.31 feet of height increase.  Houses much higher or lower than the regulation require their own pump to increase pressure or a local regulator to lower the pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what if you just had a pinprick length cylinder that was *really* long - if you had a 2mm radius hole that was 231 feet deep, that'd only be 0.221 litres of water. You're telling me i couldn't hold back 0.221l water? that seems absurd to think about</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>don't be fooled by the volume. You can't hold back even a few drops, if there's enough pressure behind it, it's even used as a delivery device for drugs, if you've ever heard of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_injector" target="_blank">hypospray.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that doesn't sound right, 0.221 kg of water should surely only exhibit 0.221 * g newtons, right? What about a ball which weighed exactly 0.221kg, but had a little pinprick coming out of it, i could carry that on my finger easily, what makes water so different?</p></div>		</li>
