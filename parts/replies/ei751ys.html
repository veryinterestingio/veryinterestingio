			<div class="markdown"><p>The electrical grid would get knocked out, which would more than likely make a bigger impact. It wouldn't be too hard to fix the electrical grid though since it would just need to have parts replaced, but a CME would knock out the grand majority of satellites permanently, which would cause a bigger impact to communications than the temporary loss of the internet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be no easy task to just &quot;replace parts&quot; for the grid. IIRC much of the important large parts of power stations (and substations?) is made to order many months in advance by very few businesses. There is very little production capacity for this heavy equipment.</p>
<p>If entire countries went down it could well be several years to repair.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is, scarily, far from true. The largest transformers in the grid take six months each to manufacture under current conditions. If all the big transformers in the Americas were killed at once, best case scenario would be starting to restore power in a <em>year</em>.</p></div>		</li>
