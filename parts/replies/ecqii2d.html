			<div class="markdown"><p>If I had to guess, I would say it's a combination of efficiency as energy consumption vs added value and also if where the mutation started, if the animal was conscious enough to recognize the mutation as massively different. If so, the animal with extra appendages would probably be socially outed, therefore not getting food or learning how to get it on their own. Even smart animals can be bullies</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it is bullying. It is extremely common-place. Moreso with intelligent animals. </p>
<p>Also, what?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or a second smaller liver?</p>
<p>What's with better performing scrotum or a better post-ejaculation sequence? Wouldn't it be significantly pertinent to be able to easily ejaculate multiple times without a hormonal sequence kicking in making your body to take a break? Same happens for animals, but why? The semen creation process isn't that demanding.</p>
<p>It feels like the human as a species is pretty much &quot;good&quot; equipped in all kinds of disciplines but in just one &quot;exceptional&quot; and that is our fine motor skills, the hand eye coordination, ot the brains cognitive functionality in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually our biggest superpower was probably sweat glands, allowing for extreme endurance in running.  We can pretty much run every other animal into heat exhaustion. </p>
<p>Not having to actually fight things is why our ligaments could move on our arms, giving us fine motor control, instead of needing leverage and strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you and I both know that without that hormonal sequence that triggers a refractory period, some people would NEVER leave the house and would starve to death. That would not be good for the survival of the species.  In fact, I would venture to guess that there were such creatures but natural selection weeded them out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's interesting that the discussion has involved both the &quot;why not more arms?&quot; and &quot;why not more eyes?&quot; questions. A <em>huge</em> amount of the energy our brain expends is focused on two things: vision, and hand movement. Eyes and hands are <em>incredibly</em> expensive, from a brainpower perspective. Chances are the evolutionary math just didn't work out in terms of providing more survival value vs. resource cost to &quot;run&quot; the extra anatomy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All tetrapods (basically, everything with a backbone that's not a fish, so birds, lizards, mammals, etc) are descended from a fish with two sets of paired fins.  Once this &quot;two sets paired appendages&quot; deal was settled in place, it became basically impossible for new appendages to appear (it doesn't appear to have ever happened in any tetrapod species).  Probably, the structure of our limbs and body plan is now too complicated for there to be a survivable step-by-step set of mutations to produce four arms.  It doesn't matter how great four arms would be, if there's no set of survivable mutations to get there, it isn't going to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well there are survivable mutations, since things get born with extra limbs.  Its just that limbs tend to &quot;get in the way&quot; more than they help, not to mention that's extra muscle that needs constant energy.  In lean times, sometimes its simply the smallest of the species that is the fittest to survive, due to not needing as much food as the bigger ones. </p></div>		</li>
