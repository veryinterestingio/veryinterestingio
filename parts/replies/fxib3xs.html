			<div class="markdown"><p>Lost my mom five years ago, and it wasn't until a year after the funeral that I broke down crying by her shrine.</p>
<p>Never cried that hard in my life, but it was cathartic.</p>
<p>Hope you're doing better. You're never alone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>She wasn't their to meet the 2 miracles that happened due to IVF. That's the hardest part for me is my kids never meeting her, and learning her life values first hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, the loss hit me months later when I was watching a doctor who episode. My grandma passed a few years back. She raised me for several years and was one of the most important people in my life. She was 91 when she died, and I honestly felt like I had prepared myself. I held myself together for months.</p>
<p>Then, I was watching Dr. Who with my boyfriend and there was an episode where one of the character's shares a very nice moment with her grandmother, and the realization I would never have that again broke me. I started ugly sobbing immediately and realized I hadn't processed anything at all. She would never see me get married, never see where my career might take me, etc</p>
<p>Anyway, it's been about two years now. I miss her all the time but I'm not as sad about it anymore. I remember the amazing times she gave me, her selflessness, and I'm just so thankful I got any time with her at all. I personally don't believe in afterlife, but that just makes the time I had with her that much more precious.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the long rant. I guess I just wanted to share that I know what you're going through, and I'm so sorry for your loss.</p></div>		</li>
