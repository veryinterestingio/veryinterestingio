			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, thanks for the extra info. Well it can be both, but yes I know about the body destroying its own lost-cause cells.</p>
<p>But since the sun causes the damage that results in the cells being destroyed, I decided that &quot;the sun destroys the cells&quot; is close enough for this ELI5 answer, especially since this question isn't asking about actual the mechanism of damage.</p>
<p>When someone <em>was</em> asking about the mechanism, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mx1sv8/eli5_why_do_you_feel_more_tired_when_sunburnt/gvljpja/?context=3" target="_blank">I included the body killing its own damaged cells for safety in my answer.</a></p></div>		</li>

UV-C can damage cells enough to trigger apoptosis, it can damage DNA enough for NK cells to recognize the issue and kill the cell, or enough UV exposure can damage fundamental biochemical routes and just kill the cell (which then will be reabsorbed by the body).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the best answer (at least of the current top few). The problem is that 10min isn't enough time to recover. </p>
<p>Maybe not a good analogy for a kid, but it's kind of like how with drinking alcohol, there is a cumulative effect of the exposure, unless your body has sufficient time to digest the alcohol between drinks. Having one drink and then waiting six hours before the next drink would be a long enough break to prevent the cumulative effect and you would only be feeling that second drink. However, waiting just 10 minutes between drinks isn't going to do much; you'll feel the cumulative effect of two drinks pretty much the same as if you took no break. </p>
<p>So with alcohol, the length of break needed to be helpful is based on how long it takes your body to break down the alcohol, and with sun exposure the length of break needed to reduce sunburn is based on the amount of time it takes your skin to repair. In both cases, 10 minutes is just not enough to disrupt the cumulative effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breaks WILL help. Significantly or not is the question:  </p>
<p>You'd get the same amount of energy radiated onto your skin, but over a longer time period, which basically means at a lower wattage.</p>
<p>If there was NO difference, then the amount of &quot;break time&quot; would not matter. I:e You'd get the same burn from 4 hours straight as youd get from 1 minute every day over 8 momths, which we know wouldn't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I'm sorry you got bothered, that actually is a good correction. I shouldn't have started my answer with &quot;the breaks don't help&quot; then explained how they would if they were longer.  I edited my comment to be more accurate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Was skimming comments at that point and hair-triggered on your first line.
The equivalent of reading headlines and thinking you know the news.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They said there's no <strong>meaningful</strong> recovery, that breaks make <strong>very little difference</strong>, and there's no <strong>meaningful</strong> healing. </p>
<p>Where did you read breaks make &quot;NO difference&quot;?</p>
<p>You two are saying the same thing. Arguing while agreeing. </p>
<p>This is a reddit moment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be fair I did start my answer with &quot;the breaks won't help&quot;, which sounds more absolute than I meant. I edited my answer. Thanks for the defence though!</p></div>		</li>
