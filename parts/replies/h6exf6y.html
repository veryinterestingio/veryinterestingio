			<div class="markdown"><p>Female pets can have pyometra very easily, I had a dog who died that way and I know a lot of people who have gone through the same. </p>
<p>My male cat escaped following females and returned home almost dead.</p>
<p>Animals suffer a lot if they're going through the heat and can't mate or for males close to animals in heat, it's a really strong instinct and they stop eating and act abnormal.</p>
<p>So if you're not going to let your pets mate and be responsible for the puppies every heat it's actually better for them to be neutered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just assisted in a pyometra cat rescue and I can tell you I thought for sure the cat was a straight up euthanasia. A sack of bones, puss everywhere. After antibiotics enough to put on some weight, a spay resolved it completely and it looks like she will gave a long and normal life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However it causes a large increase in the risk of mammary cancer.</p>
<p>Spay/neuter has population level benefits as well. Fewer intact animals means fewer unwanted/abandoned/euthanized animals.</p>
<p>But yes, there are pros and cons at an individual level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly it's a moot point, the animals still need to be neutered in countries where they don't belong. Cats might be cute, but they're the second largest perpetrators of extinctions next to humans. </p>
<p>Personally I believe cats should be banned in places like Australia. They wreak havoc, and that doesn't seem a worthy price the ecosystem has to pay just for a pet. </p>
<p>At the very least, don't let your cat outside to roam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do think spay/neutering is good overall, and necessary. </p>
<p>Unfortunately the real problem is caused by irresponsible humans, allowing their pets to roam and/or abandoning their pets.</p></div>		</li>
