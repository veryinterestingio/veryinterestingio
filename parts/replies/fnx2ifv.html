			<div class="markdown"><p>Best not to compare the herpesvirus family with RNA viruses.</p>
<p>Chicken pox is a special case partly because it's a herpesvirus (DNA) virus that takes up permanent residence in cells. That's why it can come back later as shingles, etc. We don't ever really get life-long immunity, not even to the strain we catch.</p>
<p>I've had shingles decades later from the infection I caught as a child, lucky me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps your immune system is not strong enough due to other factors. During my college one of our batch mate got infected with chicken pox.despite having gotten the virus 5 yrs ago, he was immunocompromised so it made sense for him to be weak in fighting the virus despite being vaccinated</p></div>		</li>

<p>I already have anti-vaxx “friends” claiming this whole thing is a conspiracy and saying, “they will not win!!!”</p>
<p>Meaning the vaccination people won’t win.</p></div>		</li>
