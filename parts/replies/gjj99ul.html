			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible to just.... not form an antibody to something that is dangerous to us but not because of some sort of immune pathology? (I've avoided using the word &quot;antigen&quot; since, by definition, an antigen is recognized.) You mentioned PRRs, PAMPs, and MHC complexes, but what if V(D)J recombination just doesn't form something that binds antigen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's...complicated. This is where luck and individual immune systems have a large role. Yes, you are correct that there is a chance to not develop immunity to something, hence why herd immunity can benefit populaces. Some people may even lose memory cells and their counterparts through illnesses such as measles or cancers that can directly impact the adaptive immune system.
(Shameless plug:.  &gt; get vaccinated&lt;)</p>
<p>In addition, there is always the very sad reality that sometimes the body will just not find the correct combination in time and lose the fight...</p>
<p>Regardless, the immune system is amazingly good at it's job and there is an entire network of cells designed to get these antigens presented and recognised as fast as possible.</p>
<p>PS. You can use the word antigen, we'll know what you mean :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true. The gut response is not fully understood but the presence of innate lymphoid cells regulates the response in part.</p>
<p>Your gut excretes a few grams of IgA antibodies every day. Thatâ€™s a lot of protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While others correctly point out the gut microbiome is technically the outside of your body, this does not in any way mean the immune system is not sensing and responding to it (similarly with skin and airway). Actually, the majority of immune cells reside at these &quot;mucosal&quot; surfaces!  On top of that a huge proportion of this mucosal immune system is indeed dedicated to tolerance of those gut microbes (at least under healthy / homeostatic conditions).  Always kind of mind-blowing to me because, as others pointed out, this mucosal immune system is really poorly understood still and seems to violate a lot of the immunity rules that were derived from studying so-called peripheral responses which are soooooooo important for protecting from infections inside the body. I, and many others, argue that our view of immunity is actually quite skewed because of our lack of understanding of the majority of it (mucosal immunity).  That is, when we factor in mucosal immunity most immunity actually consists of tolerant responses (when these go awry == allergy and autoimmunity). At mucosal surfaces, IgA, innate lymphoid cells and in particular a subset of T cells called T regulatory cells (Tregs) are very important in setting up this tolerance and many labs are dedicated to understanding how these cells (and IgA) develop and are maintained, but there seems to be more question than answers still IMO and, critically, the &quot;gut&quot; is not one organ but several with different functions (even in different locations of the colon) complicating matters. So, in short, our immune system doesn't' just &quot;ignore&quot; the microbiome (that is NO response), but actually has a very complex and concerted effort to recognize and tolerate the microbiome. </p>
<p>One critical piece missing from most of this conversation though is that of T cell selection that occurs in the thymus. Because of T cell selection (which is supposed to remove T cell receptors that recognize self), from immune system point of view everything that it recognizes with T cells (central to adaptive immunity) is non-self. Kind of an oversimplification, but it speaks to your question that there must exist ways independent of recognition of self vs non-self that control immune responses. You don't want to respond to MOST things in the environment actually or we would all be dead from our own immunity. Figuring how the immune system differentiates is kind of the big area of research these days because it is important for everything from tumor immunotherapy to autoimmunity and allergic diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least part of the answer is answer 2 above: immune response. The human microbiome has evolved to not trigger an immune response, and so doesn't have any problems.</p>
<p>A specific example of this is Salmonella. Basically all humans have Salmonella, all the time - it's part of our native gut microbiome. When we get sick, it's not because we have Salmonella in our stomach - it's because there's TWO types of Salmonella in our stomach, and they're fighting. Which results in our immune system showing up, and fighting them both off. When you recover, one of the two types has won, and is now back to behaving, and you're fine. Well, unless the invading Salmonella won; because now you're at risk of getting human Salmonella, and now you've got two types of Salmonella...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct in saying that upsets in the microbiome can cause illness (Clostridia species being a good examples) but I just want to point out that Salmonella is not something you want in your gut. It is a pathogen that specialises in causing disease and some &quot;strains&quot; actually penetrate your gut and directly attack the immune cells. These are the types that cause the worst illnesses such as Typhoid. I think you may be be confusing Salmonella with E. Coli which, as you said, can trigger a response if a new variant appears and starts to upset the balance. This is a contributing cause of the hilariously named but unpleasant &quot;Delhi Belly&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
