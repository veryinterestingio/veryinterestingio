			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really actually, apparently she went from about a DD to a C. Thatâ€™s a pretty standard reduction, if not less than usual. She had large breasts for a professional tennis player but not shockingly large compared to the general population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're going to have large breasts, low body fat and athletics won't change that unless you're actually starving yourself. Cup size and the hourglass figure to make that pop is the fixative thing here. It's much easier for someone who wouldn't otherwise have large relative breasts (compared to their body size) to get them by being overweight, and hourglass figure wouldn't matter there. That's a place women's bodies put extra fat. Lacking obesity, what you're banking on is just genetics for whether you get breasts or not, and again for whether you get the complimentary figure that makes it look bigger than it is. Unlike movies, athletics does not select for this and in fact would select against it mostly, and cultures around the world don't necessarily share the American fascination with breast size.</p>
<p>You can decrease size some by using sports bras, but that doesn't stop the problems caused by it. Fat jiggles, that's just physics. Any motion throws that off. Gymnasts would never make it. Swimmers get drag from it, heck they shave their legs to get that little bit of edge. More importantly, it hurts badly. Sports like sharpshooting wouldn't be affected, but again, you've only got genetic chance for that to show up, there's not active selection like in the movie business. There's no benefit to people showing that off either in sports that aren't affected by it, so even if people do you probably won't see it.</p></div>		</li>
