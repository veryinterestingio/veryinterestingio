<p>Unless you somehow stranded yourself at Point Nemo, you're going to be within flight range of a helicopter that can drop off supplies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily. Helicopters have very limited ranges and there are plenty of islands that are well outside the range of the nearest shore-based helo.</p>
<p>Big maritime patrol/SAR aircraft are perfectly capable of kicking a package attached to a parachute out the back door though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some with decent range like the MH-60 used by the Coast Guard but you're right that Helicopters generally have inconventiently short range if they're shore based</p>
<p>Luckily the US Navy is scattered around the world and just about every ship in service in major navies has a helicopter.  The recent rescue of the Micronesian men had supplies dropped from an Australian Amphibious Assault Ship that happened to be in the area so while you may be out of range of all land based helicopters, there's probably a NATO ship dicking around near by that can drop supplies</p></div>		</li>

<p>If there is a ship nearby, why dont they just drop anchor a mile (or whatever) off the coast of the island and send like a dinghy to the stranded people to pick them up?</p></div>		</li>
