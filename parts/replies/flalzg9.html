			<div class="markdown"><p>I smashed my thumb in a car door and got a nasty blood blister under the cracked nail. So i <del>went to the doctor</del> <em>spent over an hour in the bathroom cutting the nail away with a pair of surgical scissors</em>. I used TCP as an antiseptic and, although it stung, my adrenaline sure helped. It didn't hurt in the &quot;stop doing it&quot; sense, it hurt in the &quot;this is hurting either way&quot; sense, and at least now it's grown back perfectly normal. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's real hard to determine that something is &quot;harmless&quot;. But if you're just using your phone because there's fuck-all other to do, well shit. Go at it, son.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true.</p>
<p>But to elaborate, <strong>itch response is a side effect of new tissue growth</strong>. We are more likely to be aware of and pick at scabs, because the itchiness is drawing our attention.</p>
