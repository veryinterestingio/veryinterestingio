			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 approves. To elaborate, your vocal folds are indeed muscles that were in a state of total relaxation. The first sounds you make when you wake up will be dryer or lower in pitch due to your vocal fold muscles not being stretched. The muscles are thickest at the bottom and thinner on top closest to the epithilium. So as air passes through the vocal tract and by your folds that haven’t been fully stretched yet, the thickest parts will come together and produce a lower pitched sound. Also, the speed of the air can affect the folds and upon awaking, our lungs/diaphragm are relaxed so the air speed will be slower. Other factors including the air you slept in, snoring, and hydration may affect your dryness or raspiness upon awaking.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't. Our vocal tract is made up of &quot;resonators&quot; called formants. The formants filter out lower and higher frequencies which gives everyone their unique voice. If your formants filter out lower frequencies, then you will have a higher voice. And vice versa. Obviously, you can make your voice go lower but it is not permanent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just remembered hearing an interview with a singer who said that for this kinda sad song he had, he went to the studio early in the morning for the final recordings in order to capture it in &quot;morning voice&quot;</p></div>		</li>
