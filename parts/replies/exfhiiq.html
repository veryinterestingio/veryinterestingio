			<div class="markdown"><p>This is me. I most likely have an acetaldehyde enzyme deficiency which makes my face pretty red when i have 3-5 shots or a couple glasses of wine in under an hour.   </p>
<p>I've read that some people that have the deficiency have a much more efficient alcohol dehydrogenase, like 40x more efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t most people get flushed consuming that amount of alcohol in under an hour? </p>
<p>It’s not recommended for men to consume more than 4 standard drinks a night, much less in an hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it's definitely noticably different if you're affected by this, especially by the <em>Asian glow</em> thing mentioned in the Wikipedia page they linked <em>see also</em> section.</p>
<p>As someone who suffers from Asian glow, being drunk is <strong><em>horrible</em></strong> for me. I feel like I've been poisoned. It gets worse the more alcohol I drink, but even in small amounts I don't ever feel “drunk,” only fuzzy and itchy like I'm having a legitimate allergic reaction to something in my entire face, neck and hands. So I mean yes... But “normal people” can still drink too excess with the goal of getting smashed, and not actively feel like they've been poisoned, regardless of tolerance.</p></div>		</li>
