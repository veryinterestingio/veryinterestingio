			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mentioned briefly in the first link... apparently your pelvic floor muscles can weaken and urgency issues can get worse if you force out urine too quickly.</p>
<p>Some people may find they have incomplete emptying and feel the need to force some urine out at the end of urination...this is indicative of an underlying issue, but if you have to do it to fully empty your bladder and avoid leakage later, then you may have to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you don’t want to see a video:</p>
<p>By forcing pee out, you put a pressure on the bladder, and increased pressure makes pee want to escape faster. But the urinary tract is NOT the only way for the pee to escape! You also have two ureters, tubes that connect your kidneys to the bladder, and it’s imperative to keep those tubes one-way-tubes. The kidneys are very sensitive to increased pressure. Since it’s primary function does not involve high pressure*, the kidneys are enclosed in a very stiff shell. So if even a little bit of pee escape up the ureter tubes and puts a higher pressure on the kidneys they won’t have a good time. If this keeps happening your kidneys will start to deteriorate faster than among the normal population.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you’re born with more than twice the amount of kidneys that you need for a lifetime, so please don’t be afraid to donate one to a person in need if you’re otherwise healthy.</p>
<p>EDIT: *except blood pressure and osmotic pressure and diffusion pressure etc... I’m trying to keep this ELI5 and with focus on the question.</p></div>		</li>
