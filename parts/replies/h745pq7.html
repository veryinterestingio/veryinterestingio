			<div class="markdown"><p>Have been a trucker through covid. Definitely honed the best position for the steering wheel. For me it’s at a slight angle towards me, but mostly flat and as close as it can get to me. My little fingers wrap gently around the circumference while the palms of my hands do the pushing/pulling part.
I’ve noticed a few old school truckers having permanent hunched backs from leaning onto the wheel.
Definitely not a good job for your health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive for my school district and we actually have buses with each configuration. The vertical steering wheel definitely involves less leaning over the wheel to steer (hand-over-hand steering is strongly discouraged). I definitely prefer the horizontal setup probably because it doesn't crowd as much as the vertical wheel. Vertical wheels get in the way of your legs as well as your vision to the road directly in front of you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vertical is better for ergonomics rotating a wheel horizontally is not as easy ergonomically. Technically you can make a bus with power steering that drives like a sedan. It just wasn't done in the past due to power steering reliability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vertical is ergonomic for shorter drives but if you are working 8-14 hour trucking/bus jobs then efficiency start to drastically flatline as your arms start to feel like a vegetable. Vehicles with angled steering wheels aren't touring cars, it can't sacrifice the long-term comfort over short-term steering ease.</p></div>		</li>
