			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the fact they have lungs limit the depth they can go based on size or air capacity </p>
<p>Like I know that humans can’t go a certain amount under without it effecting us I am wondering if whales can go deeper due to there size or just in general don’t go deep or do dolphins have the ability to go as deep as a human or deeper</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have found beached dead whales with evidence of diving injuries, but we think it that’s generally caused by Navy sonar activity or boat noise. On a planned dive, really deep divers collapse their lungs and rely completely on what is stored in their tissue. They have more hemoglobin and myoglobin than non-diving mammals, so the oxygen that they need is stored bound to hemoglobin instead of in gas form. It’s pressure changes to gas that cause diving injuries. Generally the bigger the animal, the more oxygen they can store, so the deeper they can go, but there are exceptions where smaller whales, like beaked whales, have adaptations to go even deeper than most bigger whales. This is mostly whales, dolphins generally don’t go very deep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It bothers me that they're spaced evenly rather than based off a linear depth scale. Makes those top and bottom ones look way less outlying than they really are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not about depth of dive, but on the potential of a larger whale, so it kind of misses that point, but still relevant to the discussion I think. </p>
<p>Scientisis attached a heart monitor to some blue whales and measured them. They found that the blue whale's heart (which takes 1.8 seconds to pump in it's contraction) was running at its absolute maximum when recovering from one of their deep dives (~34BPM IIRC). There's no way a mammalian heart can get any bigger than what the blue whale has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are we really sure about this? Specifically the part that breathing air allows for more oxygen availability. I'm having trouble believing that one breath of 23% oxygen is necessarily better over the next few hours than continuous interchange with 1% oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t just take one breath generally. They take a couple, rest at the surface a bit, and then dive back down. Shallow divers, like most dolphins, breath every few minutes, particularly if they are traveling over long distance. You may be thinking of sea turtles where they eat coral for an hour or so and then finally go up for a couple breaths and then head back down for another hour. They don’t use a lot of oxygen. Whales, on the other hand, will rest a bit and then maybe dive for 20 minutes or shorter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the general theory, that endothermy and higher metabolism also sustain a bigger brain and intelligence. Octopi have multiple brains instead of one big one but it’s still a bit mind blowing as to how intelligent they are for a cold-blooded, short-lived animal.</p></div>		</li>
