			<div class="markdown"><p>The weird pupil-shapes probably also allows cephalopods to see in colour.</p>
<p>Cephalopods only have a single type of photoreceptor cell, which would prevent them from seeing in colour. However, given their incredible ability to create optical camoflage, they do seem to be very aware of colours.</p>
<p>Therefor there is a good reason to believe that cephalopods detect colours through chromatic abberation, using their weird U and W shaped pupils and the way different wavelengths refract differently to create their own distinct form of colourvision.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What it sounds like is that cephalopods may perceive color not based on certain kinds of cells in their retina that get activated based on light frequency, but rather where on the retina the light falls, due to the way light refracts through their unusually-shaped pupil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans have 5 to 6 different photoreceptor cells. We have <strong>rods</strong>, which see in black and white but have a higher sensitivity (allowing us to see in low-light conditions), we have <strong>intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells</strong> (which have some role in subconscious light reflexes but plays no role in conscious sight) and we have three (and in some people four) types of photoreceptor cells called <strong>cones</strong> which are all differently sensitive to different wavelengths. Normally humans have Short-wave cones detecting blue wavelengths (S), Medium-wave cones detecting primarily detecting green wavelengths (M) and Long-wave cones detecting primarily yellow-red light (L). The balance between these cones allows us to detect what kind of colour something is. Some humans have a 4th type of cone detecting light in the blue-green spectrum, which (at least according to some research) might alter the way they perceive colours in that spectrum and in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Cephalopods have one type of photoreceptor cell. Which would normally render them 100% colourblind, but obviously this isn't the case. Simulations suggest that chromatic abberation would give them colourvision as capable as our own.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fvm84W1HMfs/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">this image</a>. This might reflect how light is physicly detected inside the eye of a squid, but the way their brain processes it it would resolve in a 100% perfect colour image with no distortions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>P.S: Note that stating &quot;how does a squid perceive reality&quot; is inherently a question we can't know with the tools currently available to us due to the intersubject barrier. All our perceptions of objective reality are based not only on the physical tools we have to perceive reality, but the way that reality is uniquely processed in our own brains. The only way to know how a squid perceives reality is to be that squid.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, chromatic camoflage at least requires some ability to perceive what's around you, but if that requires colourvision or not? <em>shrug</em>
Scientists have absolutely brought forward a few different hypothesis about squids ability to camoflage themselves, and not all of them require functional colourvision.</p>
<p>Though Chromatic aberration is still the best hypothesis that I've seen so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do seem to, and another theory is that they use the change in brightness caused by expanding and contracting different layers of chromatophores over these receptors to distinguish between colors in the environment. Sort of like changing out different colored filters and seeing what effect each has, except that the filters are constantly moving and extremely complex. </p>
<p>Some cuttlefish have three distinct individually controllable layers of chromatophores that alter light in different ways, and they can toggle them extremely quickly (in milliseconds).</p>
<p>It's likely some <a href="http://thedishonscience.stanford.edu/posts/octopus-vision-is-in-the-skin-of-the-beholder/" target="_blank">combination</a> of the two systems</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And some people can have less depth perception even with two good eyes (Oliver Sacks discusses this, including his own experience, in The Mind’s Eye). In those cases, the world can feel/appear “flat” and the <em>perception</em> of depth doesn’t kick in within the brain/experience even if all the proper info is entering both eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say no. You can use parallax information Googling quick seems to imply that the disparity is more effected by eye structure than the distance between eyes. </p>
<p>It would be possible to judge distance if both eyes saw the exact same location of the object basically with angles and trig. idk the accuracy as far as our brain is concerned making those estimates on the fly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can perceive depth in other ways such as by inferring the true sizes of objects you are familiar with (even with no true sense of depth you would know your car is far away if it looks very small). Binocular vision just greatly enhances it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article you link to for slit pupil dilation allowing greater control of light doesn't actually support that hypothesis. The very context of that quote in the article (emphasis mine) is: </p>
<p>&quot;The slit pupil of a cat, for example, can change the intensity on the retina 135-fold, compared to 10-fold in man [2]. <strong>This has never seemed to be an entirely convincing explanation, however</strong>, as some animals (such as the tarsier) have circular pupils that can close down very effectively, to a diameter of about half a millimeter [1], and in many ungulates the rather rectangular pupils do not close to a narrow slit in bright light. A recent paper by Malmström and Kröger [3] offers a much more intriguing explanation of the oval pupil; it relates to the way that vertebrate lenses have evolved to handle color.&quot;</p>
<p>Simply comparing the degree to which a human's pupil can constrict compared to a cat's isn't necessarily indicative of greater functionality between the two pupil shapes outside of evolutionary context. As the article further mentions, other nocturnal animals have round pupils which can constrict far more than ours, to a degree much more comparable to a cat's slit pupil, so that isn't inherently a constraint due to round pupil shape.</p>
<p>That article itself is something of a summation of <a href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/1/18.short" target="_blank">this paper by Malmström and Kröger</a> which posits that the vertical slit pupil more likely helps in dealing with chromatic aberration in nocturnal animals with multifocal lenses. The large pupil size to focal length ratio of the eyes in these animals leads to relatively narrow depths of view and lots of blur outside that area of focus. To compensate, many nocturnal ambush predators evolved eye lenses with multiple concentric rings of different focal lengths. Slit pupils allow portions of each ring to remain available to light even when the pupil is highly constricted.</p></div>		</li>
