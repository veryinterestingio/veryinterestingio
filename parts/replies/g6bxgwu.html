The preprint was retracted because it is provably false (and it was pretty amateur computational biology).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I know what that second paper said but it makes zero sense that the original team of scientists could all completely mis-read the results of their blast search and that a nobel prize winning virologist (Luc Montagnier) would claim their results were accurate and that they came under such political pressure that they were forced to withdraw their research if that were not true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To look at this story from a different point of view, I must say it was pretty astonishing how quickly the research community pointed to its shortcomings! The good thing about preprints, if well regulated, is that researchers can quickly access the research outcome and show its flaws before it even gets published. In that sense, preprints combined with an engaged community around them are helpful in the crisis times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem of withdrawing from preprints is that they don't leave a clear withdrawal reason on the page. I am sure if there was any merit in the study, researchers would rethink and do it. They might indeed be busy with it. But don't forget the name damage. I don't know what the rules are for authors with withdrawn papers from preprints. Maybe they are not allowed to post for a certian period. As for journals, probably most jnl editor would risk accepting any work from this group for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We discussed the withdrawal of preprints with a number of stakeholders in a workshop earlier this year, our recommendations around the withdrawal and removal of preprints, as well as in relation to other aspects of preprint use are summarized in this report (disclosure: I am an author on the report): <a href="https://osf.io/8dn4w/" target="_blank"><a href="https://osf.io/8dn4w/" target="_blank">https://osf.io/8dn4w/</a></a></p></div>		</li>
