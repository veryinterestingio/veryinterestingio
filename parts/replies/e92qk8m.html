			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing is like coloring on the sidewalk with chalk. You draw with the chalk and then wash it away with water when you want to draw more. When you color with just a small bit of chalk it washes away quickly. But when you look at a bright light for a long time it's like coloring with A LOT of chalk, and it will take a lot of time and water to wash all the chalk away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When this happens just by a quick glance at something like sunlight reflecting off glass or maybe someone doesn’t turn off their brights for an extra second, does the cause severe damage? I always get super freaked out any time I see those spots and don’t know if that’s founded or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a hose filling a bucket with a small hole at the bottom. If the hose is flowing at a normal rate the bucket will drain as fast as it is filled. Now if the hose is at full blast the bucket will fill up and won't be able to drain fast enough untill the hose returns back to normal and the bucket can drain the excess over time. </p></div>		</li>
