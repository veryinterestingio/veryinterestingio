<p>Great job to raise awareness, as these problems can debilitate someone for a long time.</p>
<p>I believe that this is similar to tendon injuries, and the recommendation of <strong>eccentric exercises</strong> for rehabilitation.</p>
<p><strong>Tendinopathy</strong> has an initial <strong>Tendinitis</strong> inflammatory phase, but then it has a mostly noninflammatory remodeling phase (<strong>Tendinosis</strong>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, <strong>once tendons are injured, they rarely fully recover</strong>, which can result in limited mobility and require long-term pain management or even surgery.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>The culprit is fibrous scars</strong>, which disrupt the tissue structure of the tendon.</p>
<p>&quot;Tendon stem cells exist, but they must outcompete the scar tissue precursors in order to <strong>prevent the formation of difficult, fibrous scars</strong>,&quot; Fan explained.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Finding a therapeutic way to block the scar-forming cells and enhance the tendon stem cells could be a game-changer when it comes to treating tendon injuries.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Healthy tendons, connecting muscles to bones, are primarily composed of type-1 collagen, a very strong material.</p>
<p><strong>When injured the body responds by producing the inferior type-3 collagen to quickly repair the damage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This type of collagen is not as strong as type-1 and is more prone to damage</strong> </p>
<p>Scientists at the University of Glasgow are trialling a new therapy that will use injections of microRNA – small molecules that help regulate gene expression – into the tendon to ‘dial-down’ the production of type 3 collagen and switch to type-1.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Eccentric exercises</strong></p>

<p>WHY ARE ECCENTRIC EXERCISES EFFECTIVE FOR ACHILLES TENDINOPATHY?. </p>
<p>Int J Sports Phys Ther. 2015;10(4):552-562.</p>

<p>Eccentric Training for the Treatment of Tendinopathies, Current Sports Medicine Reports: May/June 2013 - Volume 12 - Issue 3 - p 175-182 doi: 10.1249/JSR.0b013e3182933761</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An eccentric contraction is the motion of an active muscle while it is lengthening under load.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>in a biceps curl, the action of lowering the dumbbell back down from the lift is the eccentric phase of that exercise — as long as the dumbbell is lowered slowly rather than letting it drop</strong> </p>
<p>(i.e., the biceps are in a state of contraction to control the rate of descent of the dumbbell).</p>
<p>Eccentric training focuses on slowing down the elongation of the muscle process in order to challenge the muscles, which can lead to stronger muscles, faster muscle repair and increasing metabolic rate.[1]</p>
<p>Eccentric movement provides a braking mechanism for muscle and tendon groups that are experiencing concentric movement to protect joints from damage as the contraction is released.[1]</p>
<p>Eccentric training is particularly good for casual and high performance athletes or the elderly and patients looking to rehabilitate certain muscles and tendons.[2]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So for an achilles injury - would this be the equivalent of pushing up off your toes and then slowly lowering your foot back flat to the ground?</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/lkWdPCG.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/lkWdPCG.png</a></p>
<p>Alfredson H, Pietilä T, Jonsson P, Lorentzon R. </p>
<p><strong>Heavy-load eccentric calf muscle training for the treatment of chronic Achilles tendinosis.</strong></p>
<p>Am J Sports Med. 1998 May-Jun;26(3):360-6. </p>
<p>doi: 10.1177/03635465980260030301. PMID: 9617396.</p>
<p>Before you do this, make sure you stretch your calves with your hands on the wall, and then stretch your Achilles by bending your legs.</p>
<p>How I did it was:</p>
<p>Go to the first step of stairs.</p>
<p>The toes and top half of your foot are on the edge.</p>
<p>Go to your toes with both feet.</p>
<p>Lift the non-target leg so that you’re on 1 foot.</p>
<p>Slightly bend that weight-bearing leg.</p>
<p>Then slowly lower.</p>
<p>It’s been a while, so I don’t remember how much of the exercises should be straight leg or bent leg.</p>
<p>You’ll definitely feel it more in the Achilles if you bend the leg, but I believe strengthening and stretching your calves is also important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can do this on a set of stairs for more range, letting your held hang of the edge a bit. Push up then slowly lower down over 6-8 seconds and repeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow this is really interesting. I’ve been using a workout machine called Tonal. It’s super high tech with like magnetic weights that can change resistance based on what the computer tells it to do. There’s an “eccentric mode,” which increases the weight on the way down. So when you do bicep curls, the weight will be higher on the way down to create more resistance. I figured it was “gym science,” but now I’m thinking it’s actually real science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having torn both my gastrocnemios calf muscle and my anterior talofibular ligament (3 years apart, both football injuries), all I can say is fuck cross sectional massage to breakdown and align new scar tissue. That shit hurts like a mofo.</p>
<p>I asked my physio &quot;how will I know it's working&quot; and she said when you can tolerate they pain more! I couldn't take the initial massage on the ATFL for more than 6 seconds the first couple of times, I near passed out with the pain. I've never felt anything like it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had MPFL reconstruction and I can attest to this. The massage was the worst, except maybe bending the knee. When I had a previous knee surgery, my physical therapist said it would help the scars fade better. This surgery I said screw it, and didn't massage it on my own. It hurt way too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physio student here, I think the evidence around  cross sectional deep frictions isn't great. Learnt about them on my sports massage course, but they are bloody uncomfortable, so unless new robust evidence comes out in their support I probably won't bother with them (unless someone really wants it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, I suppose it did. I was able to work up the time by getting my wife to do it instead, and that along with physio and strength work got it back to nearly as it was before. My right foot is slightly more rotated to the right when standing now, but that's about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow this is such good advice and knowledge. I tore my meniscus pretty badly and it hurt so badly to walk for almost 2 months so I pretty much did nothing. I sat and played games while icing and heating and bracing and barely walking, it did not get better at all.....2 months later I couldnt squat or have almost any range of motion like before. then I finally saw a sports therapist and he was like...that was honestly one of the worst things you could have ever done, now there is so much scar tissue wrapped in every direction we have to start from square 2.</p>
<p>He put a towel in my mouth and then &quot;popped&quot; my knee by practically scorpion kicking my heel to my head. I bit so hard, and I have an INSANE pain tolerance honestly it can be scary, but I cried a little bit. Normally I just walk through broken bones for days before thinking I need medical help but this....this felt like he tore every fiber of ligament in my knees apart. I could actually feel the scar tissue tearing off every thread it had attached inside my knee. It is in my top 3 most intense painful experiences of my life. </p>
<p>He explained that he had to tear all the scar tissue that formed around the meniscus in order to get it to break free and be mobile again. Well it felt exactly like that. And he gave me all these painful stretches and squat exercises to do every day. Well they hurt but I kept doing them and within a week I was 75% of where I was before the accident and within a month I was actually 110% better cause how hard I was exercising and taking care of myself. </p>
<p>It changed my life. But yeah exactly as you are saying, one of the worst things you can do is try to not move your injury and let it heal over on it's own. You have to do very exact and deliberate exercises and stretches to make sure it returns to normal mobility and strength. </p>
<p>Now I cant recommend people going to an sports chiropractor or physical therapist enough because they dont just try to help you in the moment, they want you to get back into  proper form and shape as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Before that I had tried to go to a regular doctor and all they did was give me painkillers and say stay off it and I needed an MRI with possible surgery. Bulllllshout!</p></div>		</li>
