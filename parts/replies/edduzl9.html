			<div class="markdown"><p>Lemmy still had wedges and they were LOUD. Probably the loudest in the business. He actually had his engineers get clever using a dual mic setup. They would tape a second vocal mic to the first one and set it out of phase. He would sing into just one mic. That way any sound the showed up in both mics that weren't his vocals would get (mostly) cancelled out. This prevented a lot of feedback that allowed his engineers to turn his wedges up even more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.. I have wondered why he had two mikes... figured it was for redundancy.  </p>
<p>'That's perfect, just a bit more'</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a Snapchat video taken by a musician from a pretty popular rock band, and I was shocked at how quiet it is on stage. Like, I knew it was quieter from reading about monitors and that but I guess it never quite sunk in just how little they get of the house mix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s weird for sure. I played with a group where everyone ran direct (no amps), everyone uses in-ears, and the drums were electronic. The only thing you’d hear on stage was the singer. If someone in the audience came up on stage it was always amusing to see their reaction. </p>
<p>Also meant we went home with no ringing ears. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I play bass in a band and do some backup vocals. I like a lot of my own bass and voice. And I tell them to not give the lead vocalist much or any of my vocals. He's not used to singing with harmony and it just messes him up, lol. He doesn't need to hear me. I just follow him.</p></div>		</li>
