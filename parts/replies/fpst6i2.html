			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad it was useful! Tornadoes are my favorite natural phenomenon and when they're out in the open not hurting anyone they can be incredibly beautiful. It's crazy how much we still don't know about them but we learn more every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was about six or seven we had a tornado “jump” our property. You could see the damage in the field on one side of the house and then directly on the other. Pulled our corn crib a foot off the foundations and destroyed two out buildings, aside from that a few branches and shingles were the extent of the damage. (The three damaged buildings had one foot in the grave as it was).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info! A question Ive always had since watching the movie Twister as a kid (I know its a movie, so science isn't always as important as story). If you were somehow able to secure yourself to the ground and a massive EF-5 traversed over you, would you be able to breath if you were suspended in the center of the of the vortex for an extended period of time or does it form almost a vacuum state towards the base?  </p>
<p>Also - you said wind speed is 0 at the center. is there still lift from the vortex at the center, or only at the perimeter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes, to be more precise there is still lift that balances the inward max flux. You'd still be able to breathe though - the pressure drop is far from being a vacuum. An example ( <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/samaras.gif" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/samaras.gif" target="_blank">https://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/samaras.gif</a></a> ) from Tim Samaras and the Storm Prediction Center (though presumably not an EF-5) shows such a pressure drop that is a little stronger than the strongest hurricanes but no worse than being on a tall mountain.</p>
<p>As an aside, Twister is a movie that did an exceptional job of representing the science of tornado research faithfully, as it utilized extensive consultation from real scientists and researchers. Some of the props in the film are still on display at the National Weather Center at the University of Oklahoma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, while a lot of the science is valid, there's a reason the two battling colleges in the movie aren't real colleges. The experiment with Dorothy and Dot was actually based on old science. Over the course of three years in the 70s and 80s they would take grad students (because they were expendable) and have them try to drop similar devices  called TOTO (TOtable Tornado Observatory) in paths of tornadoes. Over the 3 years none of them actually worked and they moved on, continuing to advance in so many other ways. When OU saw the final script and realized the out of date science they planned on using, they refused to allow them to use OU as a college. As a way to 'get back' at OU, the only piece of OU seen through the movie is an old hat warn by Dusty, the crazy storm chaser. Jokes on them, because for most of the students at the school of meteorology he's actually our favorite character!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Norman Oklahoma. The weather center here does tours and has a bunch of stuff in it showing how much damage a tornado can do. The weather center is a absolute unit of a building too thing is built to take direct hits from tornadoes and has done so.</p></div>		</li>
