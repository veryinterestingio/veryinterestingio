<p>And it hurts, right? I can't be the only one that gets physical pain from hearing certain sounds. Metal scraping metal, forks and knives on a plate, fingernails on a chalkboard all make my teeth hurt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more the feeling than the sound.<br />
I think it's because I think about my nails being bent backwards when I hear the sound. Anything to do with nails or teeth give me that same cringey sensation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not op, but I get the same feeling imagining silverware scraping against dishes or teeth. Not so much biting down on it, but the idea of the feel of it scratching across my teeth. As for dishes, the thought of the sound gets me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I can relate to this. And if I have to make up a quick hypothesis for why these sounds are so annyoing I'd say it's because it feels like someone is damaging their nails or teeth and it triggers this strong &quot;mirror neuron&quot; hard wired emapthy thing. Or it feels like whatever is making the sound has the potential to damage nails or teeth in that way, so you have to avoid it. (The fundamental point being that you should avoid chewing or clawing it, but like with heights and other potential dangers we often over-react.)</p></div>		</li>
