			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exponentially. Air intake for an insect is proportional to the surface, which scales in square of size.</p>
<p>Oxygen consumption is proportional to the mass, itself proportional to the volume, which scales in cube of size.</p>
<p>So the oxygen consumption grows faster with size  than oxygen intake does, which limits the insect size. But if there is more oxygen in the air, then the size limit is increased.</p></div>		</li>
