<p>For a long time I thought I had a terrible memory for events and a “vivid imagination”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My emotionally abusive ex-wife would constantly comment on how I had a terrible memory, even before she was obviously gaslighting me. Only afterwards did I realize I actually have a great memory and that was one of her gaslighting techniques.</p>
<p>I think one of the most important aspects when talking about gaslighting is that the perpetrator is trying to make their victim question reality and feel insane. The perpetrator manipulates their victim into thinking that the abuser is only source of truth and nothing else can be trusted, even the victim's own mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God forbid you misquote their exact words, or show any doubt as to wording when quoting their bs back to them. They'll change the whole thing into your fault, your shitty memory, and your clear anger issues. Because being angry about their gaslighting and abuse isn't a human reaction they will allow you to have. Because you're so lucky they'll put up with you in spite of all your faults that only seem to occur around them. So lucky, in fact, that they're the only people you see anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buddy you hit it exactly. Ive got so many moments and stories quoting exactly things she said yet I was wrong and had &quot;extreme anger and trust issues&quot; according to her. Theres one story that she repeated for 7 years and her own step mom backs it up as she was there with her...yet when using that story to prove a point I was trying to make she said it never happened and doesn't have a clue as to where I got that story. I'm still waiting to ask her step mom. And this is a story with zero meaning...but now I question what really happened since ot fit her best to change the thing 7 yrs later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very well worded.  My mom is a champion gaslighter, and this is an exact description of her behavior. “Because being angry about their gaslighting and abuse is a human reaction the will allow you to have.” Bingo. She loves to say “I’m not making you angry/sad, you’re letting yourself feel that way” if anyone tries to call her on it. We don’t have a much of a relationship anymore. </p></div>		</li>
