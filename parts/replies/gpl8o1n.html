			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a <a href="https://youtu.be/_gCJHNBEdoc" target="_blank">youtube video</a> talking about this idea.</p>
<p>Basically it goes like this: A beat is enjoyable to bob your head to and feel the rhythm of. We get more joy out of it if we feel like we can <em>predict</em> where the next <em>hit</em> is and follow along (for most of us, anyways).</p>
<p>If you have two drummers playing two different beats, as long as the tempo lines up and they don't play anything too complex, we'll still be able to follow along and bob our heads. But if they start to play complex polyrhythms or at different tempos that don't line up nicely, then we start to lose the beat and it becomes less enjoyable.</p>
<p>Now, if you take a simple beat and speed it up fast enough, it will start to sound like a note pitch. Because that is basically what a note is: a <em>really</em> fast beat. If you take two notes and zoom in on the &quot;beat&quot; of their frequencies, you will see a similar pattern as you might if you were to look at the beats of the two drummers. The more that those patterns align, the more pleasant the combination of the notes are to our ears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the easiest way for me to explain it and even our current understanding could be wrong.  Everything in known existence vibrates.  Vibrations equal sound.  So our bodies and everything that makes us up is a musical instrument.  Everybody resonates at slightly different frequencies (with too many factors including weight, height, hydration levels, mental health and physical health).  So as being with brains that can translate physical movement into audible sound, what sounds good to us is what's in tune with our natural frequencies which gives us our understanding of the terms consonance and dissonance.  It can get much more complex, I'm just trying to make it understandable if I'm even doing that right lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone, all respect to the parent commenter, but for the love of god, the comments I see worry me that y'all think this is all there is to it. Yes, this is ELI5 but damn. We've got some dude saying this condenses a whole book, but it doesn't cover the whole overtone series or explain overtones vs fundamental, it doesn't even tell you the name of the tuning system they're discussing, why we use it, or why some people hate it..it doesn't even define a semitone (the 12 notes). This is half of half a lecture that music students get through on their first week of a four year degree (and then, admittedly, mostly forget exists). If this looks like approximately 10 minutes of lecture material, that's because it is.</p>
<p>If my professor heard someone say we have a 7 note scale she would stab you and ask the class to name the pitch you screamed. I have never felt the pain of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/65213-briefly-stated-the-gell-mann-amnesia-effect-is-as-follows-you" target="_blank">Gell-Mann Amnesia</a> so hard in my life</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not the only possible scale, but it's by far the most common. Even cross-culturally, music from regions in the world have a lot of the same notes as in Western music, because of the physical principles involved.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All you really need is a small proportion of the crowd that can find the notes on their own. People are extremely good at just copying the note of people around them, especially when they are anticipating the next note in the case of the pentatonic scale (either consciously or unconsciously).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a crowd that large you will have a few people with perfect pitch, another fraction with experience singing and they can just drag the rest along. That and most tone death people know how to pretend to sing pretty well. I got through high school band moving my fingers and not blowing air into the instrument.</p>
<p>So I don't think this is nearly as impressive as people would think. It would be more interesting with a group not exposed to the pentatonic scale, but you just can't find such a group anywhere in the world. Babies get exposed to the pentatonic in the womb at this point, it is everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How did that even... happen? Was it because he gave the audience the first 3 notes and its just natural to default to the pentatonic scale from there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That‚Äôs what McFerrin implies: that the pentatonic scale is ingrained in the human brain and we just instinctively sense where the next note should be. Not a neuroscientist though, so can‚Äôt say if that‚Äôs true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What‚Äôs interesting to me is relative pitch. I can‚Äôt necessarily tell you which note you‚Äôre playing/singing because I no longer sing professionally and am out of practice, but I have always been capable of telling you if something is tuned or not. Correct notes just vibrate differently, man. Even when I had no vocal training and was in beginner‚Äôs violin classes I could tune without a tuner.</p></div>		</li>
