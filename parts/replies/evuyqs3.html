			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain from sores is caused by inflammation and the buildup of fluids, extracellular leakage, blood, cytokines, etc in an area because the capillaries will expand and leak at the site of damage. The capillaries leak in the first place because white blood cells are brought in. You'll always notice that reddened patches of skin don't hurt until it gets inflamed and there is swelling. </p>
<p>Some of this fluid quantity is yanked out with salt, leading to relief. The body can solve all minor problems in a certain amount of time. The salt/gargling just relieves pressure and lowers the pain till the body finally clears the problem.</p></div>		</li>
