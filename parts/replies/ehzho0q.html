			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone mentioned this later in the thread and I thought you'd be the right person to ask. Are any of the particles in the air actually turned into plasma? Or are we simply seeing electronic excitations of nitrogen and oxygen, without any formation of plasma?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>why does oxygen at a different altitude give of different color?</p>
<p>I understand that different gases produce different colors as the electrons are excited and relaxed; what I'm not terribly clear on is why do you see disctinct banding of colors, rather than a non specific color glow that is the result of the color mixing oxygen and nitrogen exitation and subsequent photon emission on relaxation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen emitting red photons instead of green photons means that it was excited by lower-energy particles. The low-energy particles &quot;deposit&quot; their energy high up in the atmosphere, whereas the high-energy particles travel through more of the atmosphere and reach a lower altitude before depositing the energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is different mechanisms of excitation, at higher altitude there is less oxygen because the air is less dense. The majority of the light comes from the oxygen atoms being excited by the charged particles hitting them and emits red light. Lower down in the atmosphere this is still present but there are more oxygen atoms and excited nitrogen molecules around, the collision of these particles is what causes the emission of the green light from the oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The color of aurora at different altitudes is a consequence of the air molecule the plasma is interacting with. Red aurora is caused by the interaction of plasma with atomic Nitrogen. Blue aurora is the interaction of plasma with Molecular Nitrogen (N2) Which ionizes as a result of this interaction. Green aurora is caused by the interaction with Molecular Oxygen (O2). This color stratification is a direct result of the energy of the plasma particles and the stratification of gas species in the upper atmosphere due to the lack of pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The white light is probably a combination of different charged particles reactions making the white in the aurora as white is the natural colour of all combined colours in the visible spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s pretty interesting. I saw an aurora in Norway. It was white which I thought meant it was a weak display. I thought this was because there was not not enough energy/activity to trigger the colour receptors in my eyes. But the strange thing was it was very defined and clear. Strong in appearance if you like. Just white. </p></div>		</li>
