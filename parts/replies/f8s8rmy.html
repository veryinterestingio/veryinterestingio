			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, 1. In the VEGGIE Pillows and APH Science carrier we use arclite as the growth medium. Arcilite is red material they use on baseball fields. We are experimenting with some aquaponics, hydroponics, and other growth methods in our ground research labs.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The VEGGIE system on the ISS requires regular attention by the crew to add water to the plant pillows. APH has automatic watering and a controlled environment. Although a regular check of these plants while they are growing is needed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Irrigation is very hard in microgravity. That is the biggest gardening technique that does not work the same way as on Earth. </p>
</li>
<li>Our overall goal is to supplement the crewâ€™s diet using crops grown. In the next 5 -10 years we will continue to work towards that goal. </li>

<p>How about a source of negative pressure(like plunger &amp; servo) applied to the bottom of each pot?</p></div>		</li>
