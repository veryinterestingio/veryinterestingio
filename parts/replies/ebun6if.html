			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I'll leave the house and make sure I remember the number of things I need to know, and say them in my head, and sometimes make a tiny silly story about them (the oranges dance on a cake while a cheddar cheese block is throwing up milk).  When I get to the store it's easier to recall the number of things I had to pick up (so I know if I'm forgetting something), and the silly story helps me link them together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just attach it to other things. Like if I need to not leave without something I'll convince myself that &quot;its all good because when i touch the doorknob I'll remember&quot; while imagining me touching the knob and remembering. It works most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time i try to stop thinking about something i think of some fucked up scenes in a disgusting movie a friend tricked me into watching. My brain has associated trying to stop thinking of something with that movie, so whenever i wanna stop thinking about a cringe memory that popped into my head i start thinking of that movie because its something i never want to think about, and i cant stop </p></div>		</li>

I tried to hard to stop thinking about these movie scenes, that now they are tied to trying to clear something from my mind. &quot;Think of something else so you stop thinking of this shit, oh remember this thing you tried so hard to stop thinking of that one time, well here you go buddy&quot;</p></div>		</li>
