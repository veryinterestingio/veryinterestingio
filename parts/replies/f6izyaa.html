			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. </p>
<p>They cant find anything whose answers matches reality as we can observe.</p>
<p>Like the question about stars to faint to find. It could answer almost everything but... They are not there. We are so good at searching now that we would be able to find atleast some new stars that can account for this. And have not for 80 years. Therefor that cant be the answer. Unless the stars themselves are made of dark dark matter and that would still count as a win for dark matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The missing stars being made up of dark matter is ruled out by gravitational microlensing surveys, so even that doesn't work.  If such stars existed, we'd see far more gravitational microlensing events than we do as they pass in front of background stars and bend their light momentarily from our perspective on Earth.  This shortage of microlensing events also rules out compact objects of normal matter like rogue planets and brown dwarves, there's just nowhere near enough of them (there's still billions and billions of them in our galaxy alone, but there would need to be quadrillions and quadrillions of them and there aren't).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that dark matter is predictive is a good argument.   </p>
<p>The case that springs to my mind that mirrors OP's thoughts is how they had to keep adding epicycles to the Geocentric model as their observations got better. Epicycles could only describe, they could never predict.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm reminded of the increasingly convoluted explainations that were required to make the geocentric view of the heavens fit the observational data, when applying a heliocentric model made everything work AND was able to provide predictions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that early heliocentric models were as bad or worse as geocentric ones because they likewise assumed circular orbits and it wasn't until Kepler that we got elliptical orbits and very good predictive ability. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I suppose you could've theoretically jammed epicycles into the heliocentric model too, but to my knowledge no one did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this. I was with OP on dark matter skepticism, but I didn't realize all of the separate different problems that it solves.</p>
<p>Point 9 blew my mind, BTW. Matter which does not collide. Are we living in a video game engine or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually not that egregious from the rule set of particle physics. Most &quot;interaction&quot; is via electromagnetism, and that includes most physical &quot;bumps,&quot; &quot;drag,&quot; and &quot;bounces.&quot; Removing all forces but gravitation should produce the characteristics we observe in dark matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This brings up something I thought about while reading the above. Is it possible that dark matter isn't matter at all but an even weaker fundamental force than gravity but acting similarly? So weak that it's only currently observable at galactic scales?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most seems like a massive understatement. I don't think I know of a single effect the strong force has outside of holding protons and neutrons together. No real idea what the weak force does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the answer is yes, we are living in a video game engine. Dark matter is basically no clip but can still interact with gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, point 9 <em>really</em> shows the strength of dark matter vs. a scaling factor or some other unknown mathematics for gravity, pretty awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrinos are a form of matter that doesn't collide with other matter, and they've been known to exist since the 1930s. Billions of them are passing straight through you every second. Any particle that doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force will behave this way, so there being one more kind really isn't as dramatic a leap as it might appear to be.</p></div>		</li>
