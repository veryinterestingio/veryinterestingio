			<div class="markdown"><p>Some key context here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heracles wasn't a real person.</li>
<li>Deïanira wasn't a real person, either.</li>
<li>Deïanira was tricked into killing Heracles.</li>
</ol>
<p>She was named Deïanira (husband-killer) in the stories about Heracles because that was the most important thing she did in the story. It's not like there was a real woman who popped out a baby and said, &quot;I think I'll call her Husband-Killer. That's a pretty good name for a girl.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean really, this is the real reason. It's like Remus Lupin. Remus from Romulus and Remus, the twins who were raised by a she-wolf and founded Rome (Remus lost the contest, obviously). And Lupin from the latin lupus - wolf. Remus Lupin is a werewolf, and that's the most important thing about him. He isn't born a werewolf and becomes one later, so it makes no damn sense that both of his names relate to wolf when he's born. But he's a fictional character named for what he is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bit of a spoiler in the story, don't you think? </p>
<p>Imagine if Hollywood characters had names like these. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey Wifestealer, wanna grab a beer after work?&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Uh, sorry Doctor Cuckold, I've got a, uh, I've got my origami class tonight.&quot; </p>
<p>More seriously, the reason for this is that ancient Greek narrative styles were very different from modern ones. Every Athenian already knew the story of how Oedipus the king accidentally murdered his father and married his mother when Sophocles first put on the play. Thus the big reveal at the end is a reveal <em>for the characters in the play</em> but not for the audience, who already knew the story. For Athenian theatergoers, the power of the drama lay in seeing how such a terrible moment of realization could be dramatized on stage.  </p>
<p>It's an odd way to think about narrative -- everything is already known -- but the concept of a story with actual surprises in the plot appears to be a more recent invention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s the same way we still enjoy narrative tales today, and the techniques are just as blatant. We enjoy it even more if it follows this classic structure too, we use tropes like the heroes quest, three part act structure, heck have you ever wondered why Loki in avengers is so damn popular? He resonates with our understanding of the trickster just as deeply as our ancestors did. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I've used a similar line before! At this point , 95% of the time my intro is &quot;Hi my name is Ariel, yes like the mermaid.&quot;</p>
<p>The 5% of times I don't say it, they do. Without fail. (ETA this actually just happened on my lunch break today lol)</p>
<p>I've embraced it. I own little mermaid merch. One time I tried to avoid someone so I pulled my hood up and turned my face. They caught me anyway. Then I remembered I was wearing PJs with the little mermaid and the actual word &quot;Ariel&quot; all over them (I was just checking the mail). </p></div>		</li>
