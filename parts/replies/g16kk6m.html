			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, not all plastics can be digested by these new specially optimized microbes, but it's a start. It's not something we can bank on but at least we can find a bit of solace knowing it shouldn't be a problem forever like we once thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have and still use wood boats, and microbes have had millions of years already evolving to eat that, which was an even harder challenge than plastic was. It is the reason coal exists. It took a long time for a microbe to figure out how to eat the stuff so woody plant matter accumulated.<br />
Basically, we don't have to worry about that. Microbes figuring out how to efficiently digest plastic would be a blessing, not a curse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious questions: How did microbes evolve so fast to do this? Plastic has only been widely used since the 60s I believe.</p>
<p>Also, do the micro plastics stay in the water molecules if the water is boiled and distilled? Would that work to filter all this over time?</p>
<p>Either way this situation is pretty fucked and we need to severely reduce our use of plastics, people</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically their life expectancy. Living long for us humans it's great, but it has taken our evolution to a slower pace. Say for example mosquitos compared to humans. They can reproduce in a matter of days from born, therefore their evolution rate is significantly higher than us that we take at least 12 years from born to reproduce. Well same thing with microbes, plastics have been around 60 years ish, but microbes could've had billions of reproductive cycles in that time, making them adjust to consuming what for us is a very new material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: the microbes would have to produce a new generation every second in order to have 1.9 billion reproductive cycles within 60 years. A billion is a lot. Your basic point is still valid though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no microplastic in water molecules. Boiling will not get rid of microplastics, distilling will. Molecule is really small. Water molecule is about 2.75 Å while smallest microplastics are about 10 Å. And thats like 1 nanometer.</p></div>		</li>
