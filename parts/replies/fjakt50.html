I think your hunch is correct.  If not enough photons are collected in 1 minute in order to get above the random noise threshold then no amount of stacking will bring those photons out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not when you stack multiple exposures, it averages out the random noise.  Off the top of my head I think that noise increases with the square root of signal.  So quadrupling the signal only doubles the noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interval isn’t regular.</p>
<p>Say there are two stars in the sky, both pretty dim, but one much dimmer than the other.</p>
<p>During a particular exposure, the camera could record photons for one or both of the stars.  The brighter star will more often produce that photon. When you stack the images, the brighter image will have more photons recorded during those one minute intervals.</p>
<p>Just because a photon isn’t detected in the first 1 minute exposure doesn’t mean that it will never be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea with a 1-60 or whatever other combo is that you do not want to leave the shutter open all 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Even if you track well, you still have temperature issues causing small shifts in the plane of focus, moisture, plane trails, etcetc. There is also a signal/noise issue where your sensor has little errors that pile up and compound each other.</p>
<p>Using a sequence of 1-2 minute shutter times you eliminate all of these. Or if not eliminate them, you can reduce them to manageable issues you can deal with in post.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The sensor does not operate long enough to experience significant thermal change, and the glass/body don't shift enough in response to external temperature changes in this brief period. You can re-focus (or at least check the focus) every few frames if you notice things drifting.</li>
<li>A frame with an airplane trail in it can simply be removed from the stack, or averaged out by the software. Ditto if you get moisture disrupting a frame.</li>
<li>Out of 60 frames, no single pair of frames will be identical in terms of having enough photons to represent the entire picture, but over the course of 60 the frames will include all of the information collectively; most information will be on multiple frames.</li>
<li>All but the most sensitive tracking devices will have at least a little drift over the course of an hour, even if only due to temperature changes in the tripod and tracking mechanism. 1-2 minutes is not enough to see tracks if you have a wide-angle lens on a still (nonmoving) tripod, and even a shaky tracking mount with a long lens can avoid tracking in a 2 minute frame.</li>
<li>You can develop each short frame separately or all together depending on how each came out. With one long frame you are stuck with what you got.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no reason NOT to take a single-frame 60 minute image if you want to challenge yourself-- it is a great goal, and I encourage it. But if you are after a specific image or a theme or scientific data, and you want a fine-level of control, the smaller frames are the way to go.</p></div>		</li>
