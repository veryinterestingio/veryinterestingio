			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It can also be explained by looking at the horizon. The horizon is how far we can see and as of now the horizon for us is about 45 billion light years away - even though the universe is only ~ 13 billion years old.</p>
<p>How is that possible? It’s because the light was emitted when it was 13 billion light years away but as the universe expanded it is now 45 billion light years away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that imply that one or both of the objects are travelling faster than the speed of light?</p>
<p>Lets say the bigbang was 13 Billion years (13BY) ago. Two objects emerged on either side of Zero point travelling away from each other.</p>
<p>If 13BY later they are separated by more than 26BY (13BY * 2) wouldn't that mean faster than light movement? and each object could only be 13BY or less from Zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason they are further away from each other is because the space in between them is expanding. </p>
<p>Imagine two ants moving away from each other on a rubber band.  While they are moving, the band is being stretched.  So while they may only more a cm/sec, they will be more than two cm apart from each other after the first second.</p>
<p>It's the same thing for galaxies in the universe.  And everything in the universe for that matter, but gravity tends to keep things together at the local level</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With our best current measurements for the most part the universe looks exactly the same in every direction. There are slight anisotropies in the CMB background radiation but this is basically hypothesized to be local quantum fluctuations effectively frozen due to the initial expansion. Considering the horizon itself intrinsically limits our observation we can say nothing about our larger place in the universe. What we can (and will ever be able to) see will only ever get smaller due to the expansion of spacetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no way to define or explain it in human terms because we have no concept of how you would exist without time. Just like someone trying to explain what happened &quot;before&quot; the big bang, time didn't exist so the premise is flawed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not necessarily true. Nothing can really be said about the nature of time very close to the big bang because the assumptions that 'time did not exist' comes from a strict reading of relativity which has not been rectified with quantum mechanics yet so any extrapolations from classical relativity are necessarily going to be incomplete until that occurs. The entire notion that time did not exist is itself a flawed premise. What effects dominated and the nature of spacetime itself very close to the big bang are all conjecture from incomplete theories at this point.</p></div>		</li>
