<p>As well as the level of the Caspian Sea being below the Oceans level. So it can't flow into the Ocean but the Ocean could flow into the Caspian Sea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first point doesn’t make a difference, there are a lot of lakes worldwide like that. Their watersheds are called endorheic basins.</p>
<p>As for the second point, the important thing is that the Ocean doesn’t flow into the Caspian, even though in terms of pure elevation it could. If it did, the level of the Caspian would rise to sea level because the volume of water in the Ocean is far greater than any other body of water in the world. If that occurred, the Caspian would become a true sea.</p></div>		</li>
