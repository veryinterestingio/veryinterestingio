It is still kind of a solid, it has NOT turned to actual water but it does behave a bit like a liquid. In fact, a layer of water on top of ice can make it less slippery due to suction and surface tension. Quasi-liquid doesn't have surface tension. I like to think of it as very, very, very tiny snowballs.. or kind of like a ballpit where the collection of balls in a contained space act a bit like a liquid but individually are solid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting, I never heard something about QLLs.
I have been reading some papers and articles about it now, maybe someone can help me out. What do they actually mean by Quasi Liquid Layer/Droplet.
Lets look at skating on ice for example:
My understanding is thst instead of melting, the ice sublimates under the metal skid increasing the vapour pressure between the ice and the skid. After the vapour pressure reaches its peak, water condenses out of the gas phase forming a liquid layer/droplet. Is that correct?
Why do they refer to it as quasi liquid? I mean it can't be some knew kind of phase can it? Do we just not know exactly at which points between the ice and the skid the water is vaporized, liquid and solid and that's why we call it Quasi-liquid? Or is there something else I am missing?</p></div>		</li>
