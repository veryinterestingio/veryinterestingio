<p>Edit: You lied to me (read with a heavy, stereotypical, Jewish woman accent) -  <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/how-fast-can-a-housefly-fly/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/how-fast-can-a-housefly-fly/" target="_blank">https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/how-fast-can-a-housefly-fly/</a></a></p>
