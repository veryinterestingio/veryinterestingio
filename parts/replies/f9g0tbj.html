			<div class="markdown"><p>A memory leak is usually when programs do not handle data properly.</p>
<p>ElI18+</p>
<p>It's the result of poor code quality or environmental factors that cause programs to use mass amounts of memory they aren't actually using. Many things can cause it .</p>
<p>A big cause is programmers not deleting data correctly - if they for example remove the actual but not the address in memory or every other part, you are left with random bits of data. Add this up enough and it becomes a problem.</p>
<p>ElI5:</p>
<p>Let's say I control an elevator that can handle 10 people.</p>
<p>I move the elevator between floors, getting people off and on. One time, I tell someone to get off,  but before they are off the elevator I close the doors. I thought I got the person off but I didn't and I don't realise it.</p>
<p>Now, I'll keep acting as normal without realising there's 1 extra person on the elevator. I end up getting 11 people stuck on the elevator because I didn't properly remove the 1 person.</p></div>		</li>
