			<div class="markdown"><p>The article you linked does not support this idea, and in the opening lines it directly disputes it. It states that most food cravings are simply for high calorie foods, or salt that we rarely need more of. Pica (the desire to eat various non-food items) can indeed be a sign of certain types of malnutrition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can promise the person that linked it has no medical training. One of the first things we were taught in our early classes for medical school was that cravings aren't an indicator of nutritional desires. There have been a lot of studies done on this and somehow people still go against the evidence and think that their cravings are somehow different than decades of medical evidence.</p>
<p>I even had someone tell me once that my dreams were telling me I was iron deficient. It's amazing what people will rationalize. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's why I clicked and read the entire article - I was sure this had been disproven for decades, and was shocked that a reputable website had an article about it. But nope, OP didn't read his source. I have no medical training either, which is why I only summarized the article.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there different levels of this, maybe? I've heard that things like craving a cheeseburger or a donut are just psychological cravings...not based on your body telling you too need protein or fat or a sugar fix.</p>
<p>But then there are genuine cravings like anemic people wanting to chew dirt. </p></div>		</li>
