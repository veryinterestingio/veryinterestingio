			<div class="markdown"><p>Our galaxy, our planet, our country, our town, your eyeballs and my eyeballs are the center of the <em>known</em> universe simply because the universe is defined by what we can see (hence know).</p>
<p>It is not that our galaxy <em>appears</em> to be the center of the universe.  It simply is such because the known universe is a sphere with the observer at the center.  Someone over in a different galaxy would view things the same way.  They would not say &quot;shucks... I wish I was in the Milky Way at the center of all things&quot;.</p>
<p>This sphere's distance is how far we can &quot;see&quot;.  This is based on a number of things including light speed, age of universe and rate of expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>We do not know, cannot and may never be able to determine what's beyond that distance.  But we <em>believe</em> for a number of reasons (mainly tests of curvature of space) that the real universe is <em>at least</em> 100 times larger than that if not infinite.  We have no reason whatsoever to believe we're at the center of that... nor any reason really to believe there is a center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a result of the inflation of the universe. Because the way the universe is expanding you can choose any point and it will appear to be the centre from which everything else is expanding away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think its more that if you're out at sea where there's nothing but water visible looking out 360Â° then you're right smack bang in the middle of what you can see.</p>
<p>Just over the horizon the the North there might be land, to the south there might be many more miles of sea but in your little visible bubble, you're at the centre.</p>
<p>Same applies the the universe, we're only at the center of what we can see, we could be off to the side or near the top but unless we can see it in it's entirety we'll never know.</p></div>		</li>
