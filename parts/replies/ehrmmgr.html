			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that despite all the handwaving about doomsday scenarios in the comment above this where people seem to be answering based off having watched Hollywood movies: those effects were seen on 1960's era electrical grids and devices.</p>
<p>Modern electrical grids are far more protected and an EMP would trigger automatic shutdowns, not fry everything in sight.</p>
<p>Much of our communications infrastructure interconnection is optical, not electrical.</p>
<p>EMPs cannot impact anything that doesn't have sufficient inductive wiring attached to it. Most things that have long lengths of electrical line attached to them (like your cablemodem) have overvoltage protection.</p>
<p>Your cell phone, your TV, your cablemodem, your car, your microwave - all of it will survive an EMP blast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I too am not a fan of Hollywood-like doomsday scenarios, I would still like to point out that in sufficient proximity to the blast, the effects of an EMP would still be rather destructive, also with today's hardware.</p>
<p>The reason is the extreme gradient of the pulse, where even modern surge protectors and overvoltage protection would be useless, because the power rise in the electrical grid would just be too large too quickly. So most stuff that is connected to the grid has a good chance to be fried. <a href="https://www.twowayradiotalk.com/emp-and-your-electronics/" target="_blank">Two-Way Radio Talk</a> has an interesting piece about the consequences, including a list of stuff that would survive: Cars, airplanes or unconnected desktop PCs are very good Faraday cages and deliver automatic protection, while small unconnected devices like phones or tablets typically don't have enough inductivity to be destroyed.</p>
<p>As you pointed out, optical communication is not affected as such, but the interconnects, routers and relays are mostly still electrical, since active elements need energy input to work. Those can principally be subject to the pulse and any missing link will cut the chain. Similarly, as noted by Two-Way Radio Talk: Cars would still work, but not the electrical pumps to get the gas out of underground storage tanks.</p></div>		</li>
