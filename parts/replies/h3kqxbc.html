			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually yes. But what’s interesting is that we know certain specific asteroids have very high content of gold and other rare metals. One gold rich asteroid a hundred meters in diameter might contain more gold than all known terrestrial reserves. </p>
<p>How exactly these elements occur today in such high concentrations in certain bodies I haven’t heard an explanation for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the natural concentration of gold. The rarity on earth is because most of it sunk to the core early in the creation of the earth because gold is heavy. Most of the gold in the Earth's crust is from asteroid impacts.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the amount in the core, the total gold that has been mined in history would amount to one ounce per person currently living. The unmined gold in the crust should be an order or two higher say 10 oz (or 300g) per person.</p>
<p>The amount in the Earth's core is about 200 million kg (or 200,000 tons) per person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold is uncommon in Earth's crust because in the planet's 'big hot runny ball of lava' phase long ago, the heavy elements mostly sank to the core and the lighter elements rose to the surface. We live on the light, fluffy layer of oxygen and silicon floating on top of an ocean of iron.</p>
<p>Those core metals are buried out of our reach now; but imagine if, in the early solar system, a planet had begun forming, had layered out in this way, and then been violently clattered by some other infant planet? Smashed to pieces? Then you'd get a swarm of asteroids; light rocky asteroids made from the protoplanet's mantle, and heavy metallic ones made from its core. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Psyche" target="_blank">Concentrated masses</a> of nickel, iron, and very likely all manner of even heavier metals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The theory I heard was that they are fragments of planetoids that ware big enough to allow differentiation (heavy metals at core, light metals at surface) and then subsequently broken up again. Think moon-hitting-earth like impacts.</p>

<li>Estimate of minable gold on earth: 190,000 tonnes</li>
<li>Volume of that: ~10,000 m^3</li>
<li>Olympic swimming pool: 2,500 m^3</li>
<li>All minable gold on earth fits in four olympic swimming pools.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun <em>did</em> get other heavy elements. Here is a breakdown of its elemental composition:</p>
<p><a href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2020/G-solar-abundances-alt.png" target="_blank"><a href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2020/G-solar-abundances-alt.png" target="_blank">https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2020/G-solar-abundances-alt.png</a></a></p>
<p>The key isn't that rocky planets like Earth were able to retain heavier elements, but rather they weren't able to hold onto lighter elements. Free hydrogen and helium quickly escape smaller bodies like Earth, but larger objects with stronger gravity, like the Sun (and gas giants) can retain them better.</p></div>		</li>
