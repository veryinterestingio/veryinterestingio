			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. The plant may be in production constantly but individual equipment  must be cleaned even if in place.</p>
<p>Even piping cam be cleaned this way.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That typically isn't even the case, most production facilities will periodically have most or all of the facility shut down for various reasons, like power maintenance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, from the factory tours I've done through school I've learned &quot;running 24/7&quot; Really just means &quot;there's Always someone here doing something&quot;. Machines go down, maintenance is required, inspections have to happen, Systems need to be rebooted etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it depends on what type of plant. Anything involving furnaces or ovens tries to minimize downtime for that equipment because of how long it takes to heat up, so they will disable individual segments of the line over time instead of turning it all off every time they have to clean something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once worked maintenance on the night shift in a food production plant. We'd shut down production nightly around 11 pm, then we had our cleaners come through and do a multi stage cleaning of everything while we did some daily work on the machines. Everything would be back up and running by 5 am for morning shift so they could get straight to work.</p>
<p>Basically my shift would oversee shutdown, take care of any issues found during the day that didn't require stopping production, such as simple things like cracks needing welding. We would then so tasks like sharpening blades daily, moving and testing equipment for the next days setup, and making sure that everything was operational for the first couple of hours of production. Then the morning shift maintenance would come in hung over and have an easy day, hopefully. If anything fails they get to fix it while a manager gripes about $10k per minute downtime per line or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what I do for a living, we call them shut downs. Plants are built with redundancies so that when piping or equipment needs repair they switch over production and we do the repairs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My old man runs the boilers at a place that makes canned soup/veggies/all sorts of other good stuff. While they are operational 24/7 doing <em>something</em>, they regularly shut down parts of the plant for cleaning and maintenance and occasionally do full shutdowns for the same reason. In fact, getting back into production after those shutdowns is a big part of his duty and why he's one of the higher-ups on the crew. Apparently it takes a lot more specialized knowledge to start a coal-fired boiler than it does to keep one running once it's been started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep I work at a soda bottling plant and that's how it's done. A full hot CIP using stages involving chemicals and scalding hot water must be done <em>at least</em> once per week, shorter less intensive CIPs every 48hrs, simple rinses between flavors, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked in different food plants (frozen food and bottling plant), and that's exactly how it works : after running line one and three for a day, you switch to line two and three while line one gets cleaned, then line one and two while line three gets cleaned, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there are often parallel lines.</p>
<p>But not always, and that's not a problem since there are some buffers anyway. You can shut down a part of the line, like for 6 hours, and still the rest of the factory can work with intermediary stocks for some hours.</p>
<p>Also they can have backup lines, old machinery that they only place and power on when they have no other recourse. In a car factory I worked on, when doing maintenance on painting robots, they used in fact 5 dudes to manually paint the cars while the robots where off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although my experience is limited to two different processing plants, I haven't seen a line that allows intermediary products, it was always straight from raw to packaged. The product is not stored in between, as it would be a logistical nightmare. I've seen lines being rerouted, but never interrupted to be reset further away. Cars are a different thing, because except for a few engine parts, they can't get contaminated.</p></div>		</li>
