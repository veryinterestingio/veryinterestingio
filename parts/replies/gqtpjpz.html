			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Halfway through development, some of the tech the game will ultimately use will not even exist.  </p>
<p>Some isn't even on the radar yet and the game gets a surprise upgrade in the final stages.  Some of the tech planned for from day 1 ends up being vaporware.  Like they might plan for ray tracing, but on release date there is nothing usable on the market.</p>
<p>The key is the game content and code needs to be scalable for whatever tech is available on release date.  It's not a simple call.  An ambitious project manager might mandate content be formatted with a lot of extra man-hrs expended with the expectation this will work with ambitious as-yet-unseen tech that ultimately doesn't even end up in the release by the end of the project</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a slider from 0 to 1. 0 is the normal balls, 1 is the shrinked balls. The slider controls the intensity of the shrinking. It's pretty old technology, but the application of it is... neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I've heard from a designer friend is that sometimes, especially with AAA, a lot of stuff and detail is modeled on the off chance that it will be needed. Not out of necessity. Then, when the launch window approaches, lead devs will go over models and animations. If something is deemed unnecessary and too hardware demanding, it gets cut. If something is too detailed for performance it will get compressed, altered or relegated to the high quality options. Model designers can take this into account and create many detail levels for one object, so it looks good at any level. And so on, in order to strike the producer's desired balance of detail vs performance.</p>
<p>So you might get hired to do horse textures and half of your work might not be used. Or maybe someone was hired to make detailed models, got to do the horse's testicles for a laugh and it was considered not performance impacting, so it got to stay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having worked on several small-to-medium-sized software projects, I'm always blown away at the scale of triple-A games. So many teams involved and not just the pieces that get put into the game, but all the business side (e.g. marketing) as well. Just read through the credits of any triple-A and see how many people are involved. Now imagine driving that level of complexity over multiple years to deliver a product. It's really impressive, IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes me kind of sad that I wasn't working during the 8 bit era when one or two devs could code an entire game.</p>
<p>Seriously, where can a dev hope to make that sort of impact anymore?  The complexity of software has evolved to the point where <em>everything</em> is massively complex requiring whole teams to do anything.</p>
<p>About the only option left is development for <em>very</em> resource constrained environments; embedded mostly.  So, then you have to work for a large company that produces the hardware unless you're developing for a commodity product like arduino.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like there's that much fertile ground left for an individual dev to make a huge contribution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fallout New Vegas was pretty completely broken on its release date, despite using a rather dated &quot;safe&quot; game engine.  And a lot of its content seemed unfinished.</p>
<p>The Strip was supposed to be a big open world without being broken into cells, but it didn't work on consoles.  So, at the last minute, they broke it into cells and added &quot;junk wall&quot; partitions you had to cross through and load a new area.  It was pretty obvious that the content wasn't architected this way from the start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Daikatana as well. Romero was a game design genius whose mind far exceeded the state of gaming tech at the time. Any one of his cool ideas would have taken a Carmack level of genius at the time to implement, but he didn’t have a single Carmack for the game. And Carmack struggled on his own too, he had the technology know how but never really struck the same kind of gold again that he did with the game designer genius of Romero. The problem of keeping up with the always changing current state of gameplay and loop trends can’t be solved with technological genius alone either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the models and environments are probably made in something much more advanced compared to a game engine then simplified, streamlined and imported into the engine. Major difference between games and VFX is games have to do things on the fly. But you can still model and create environments, animate, texture etc etc in similar tools, you just can't render and apply lighting and fx on the fly in the same way.</p>
<p>Also good to note that lighting as mentioned is one of the things that makes us believe in photorealistic VFX. </p>
<p>Game engines making this happen on the fly and believably is the hard part</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Side note here, this is one of the reasons that all this RTX/real-time path tracing stuff has got me so excited.  I was a bit skeptical of the concept at first, since I figured that getting any photorealism in anything approaching realtime was still a bit of a pipedream.</p>
<p>But, if you combine path tracing with AI-based denoising, suddenly interactive raytracing seems practically inevitable.  Even on my PC with an outdated GPU that actually slows down my raytracing vs CPU-only, Blender's preview render mode with the denoiser enabled is still completely stunning in terms of rapidly spitting out very believable images.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah it's pretty wild. I want to learn the dev side of VFX, it's just crazy, but it's just such an insane leap it's hard to find the time. Amazing stuff for games dev though and altered reality is going to get wild if the price point comes down and some hook can make it mainstream.</p>
<p>Though for VFX it's not so important. Fun fact our render farm of 500ish machines does not include a single GPU. It's pure core and mem. Though we steal artist machines with gpu's if necessary for rando plugins that are too hard to make work. I don't think many artists use RTX, maybe a couple 20's, still rolling mostly with the GTX.</p>
<p>Thing about VFX is you can leave renders running for days if you have to for the heavy depts. Iterative depts like animation, texturing and comp not so much, but a lighting frame could take a day no worries. So diff to game dev.</p>
<p>(Edit: iterative depts being ones who cannot progress without seeing results)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that a lot of the time companies will have access to hardware before it gets released. GPU and CPU vendors will make testing versions of their hardware that has features that will be released to consumers in a few years. My company had access to a Intel CPU that had features enabled 2 or 3 years before the first commercial release. While those versions will have bugs and will be different than the final product it allows developers to prepare for newer hardware. A huge game developer like Rockstar probably has access to such beta hardware and can build their game for hardware that will be available in 2 or 3 years.</p>
<p>Edit: take this with a grain of salt. I never worked in the gaming industry and I don't know anyone who does. My post is mostly speculation based on my experience with hardware vendors (but never GPU vendors).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This could be enough to plan ahead, but you'd be stuck not being able to test things until dangerously close to the release date (this explains some buggy releases). In a way it makes sense: the game will not talk directly to the hardware, and the drivers that do that are built by the same company that produces the hardware. It's not like a CPU where different software companies will have products that directly use a feature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Game dev here. This is a factor. Hardware and software makers very much need you to buy into what they're doing. From Intel or Nvidia or Sony's point of view, they're worried about getting enough developers to use what they make, so that users will buy what they make (versus what their competitors make).</p>
<p>3-5+ years out you get briefings on their roadmaps. You know what CPU and GPU makers have in their own pipelines, so you plan accordingly. 1-2 years out they're sending you prototypes. Console makers, in particular, might make some things available on the earlier side to help you prepare.</p>
<p>For a while before you ship, usually it's not that your target hardware doesn't exist, it's just that the things that do have that level of performance are expensive. We usually work with high end systems. </p>
<p>Modelers and people making textures and audio will design with that end state in mind, given what's expected to be there at launch; poly counts (and geometry formats), resolutions, bitrates, shaders all take their cue. Usually they overdo it because downsampling is easier. Sometimes we really do just guess wrong and have to redo something. Or a lot of somethings.</p>
<p>Most of the time we spend working on a game, it doesn't look how it's going to look. That comes towards the end, when you finally get the engine running on hardware resembling what it'll ship on, and the lighting and shaders starting to run right.</p></div>		</li>
