			<div class="markdown"><p>I didnâ€™t consider this in the other direction. If my brother gets bitten, his arm better resembles the Rocky Mountains than any limb. At least when Iâ€™m bit, itâ€™s a small red bump, the stereotypical red swollen itchy bump on google images and webmd. </p>
<p>I also have dry skin and eczema, so then itchiness of bug bites gets exasperated, so I will say that the itchiness to some extent is from other factors too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this. I react to basically everything. I can have bites and no one else will and itâ€™s only because I react horribly to any bite.</p>
<p>It sometimes has some utility. Iâ€™ve been in apartments that had bed bugs but until I slept there, no one knew.  After I slept there, they knew to look, found them, and exterminated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have other allergies?</p>
<p>Anti-allergy medication also works against mosquitoes. One pill and poof all the itching spots are just gone.</p>
<p>I use cetrizin, works great and is cheap.</p></div>		</li>
