			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, if you’ve got any European ancestry I feel that’s pretty likely for most people. That’s 10 generations back, and 1000 people to choose from! </p>
<p>I’m sure more than a few Spaniards came to England during Mary I’s time, given she married the King of Spain, and bred into the population. In the US it’s even more likely given how much of the place was colonised by Spanish in the first place (and the rest by English, who I’ve just dealt with).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;For example, your dad might be ethnically half Spanish and half Native American, with a genetic ethnicity that's 50% Native American and 50% Iberian. The alleles he passes on to you, though, might be 20% Native American and 30% Iberian.&quot;</p>
<p>Is this disconnect the result of DNA recombination?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You always get 50% of your DNA from each parent, but for any generations beyond that, it's a crapshoot. The amount of DNA you get from your father's father vs. your father's mother (and the &quot;ethnic origin&quot; of that DNA) will depend on which particular sperm happened to get the job done during your conception, and where the recombination points happened to fall along the various chromosomes for that sperm. Similarly, the amount of DNA you get from your mother's father vs. your mother's mother depends on which egg is used and how its DNA got recombined.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are male then you get your entire Y-chromosome from your father's father. And if you are female, then the X-chromosome you get from your father is the same as the one he got from his mother.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So say you're a female and 3/4 of your grandparents are Russian, but your paternal grandmother is Irish. Would the granddaughter most likely get a higher percentage of Irish genes because she inherited grandma's X, or would it still be totally random?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to DNA recombination, independent assortment of homologous chromosomes also introduces new variation. </p>
<p>You can number your chromosomes from 1-23, and everyone has two copies of each chromosome. 1/2 from your mother 1/2 from your father.  </p>
<p>During the initial stages of meiosis (when bodies make eggs and sperm instead of body cells), 'cells' are created which contain only 1 pair of each chromosome. But which chromosome from each pair it receives is random. </p>
<p>That means that theoretically, you could have an egg or sperm that is 100% made up of DNA from one of your grandparents.</p>
<p>It is most likely to be 50:50 (think of how it's more common to roll a 7 with 2 dice because there's more possible ways to add to 7 than any other number), but even then you could get red hair from your Dad's dad, blue eyes from your Dad's mom.</p>
<p>The combination of DNA recombination and Independent assortment generates the novel genotypes or combinations of traits seen in offspring. </p></div>		</li>
