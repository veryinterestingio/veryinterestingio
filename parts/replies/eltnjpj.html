			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome. Word of the day is penultimate.    When star supernovas do any tangible iron &quot;chunks&quot; of matter get thrown into space or is it just atoms of iron floating around until coalescing into a planet ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all atoms floating around.  They get blasted out from the supernova. The atoms don't even form into dust grains for many years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm going to have to disagree with /u/ExtonGuy with the caveat that I may very well be totally wrong and after such a huge supernova (enough that iron was actually the endpoint of nuclear fusion) everything is atomized....</p>
<p>Well, let's think about it.... There's likely enough energy around that iron exists with a number of electrons (all?) stripped off. That would leave each iron atom with a hefty positive charge....</p>
<p>It may very well be that the result is  an atomic mist that expands somewhat spherically from the central supernova...</p>
<p>But I'm going to guess, and I'm thinking of the Crab Nebula and its composite image, that as this atomized stellar dust starts to cool, the  various speeds of the ejecta start to cause bottlenecks, you're going to start to see &quot;ribbons of matter coalesce around the shock waves (physical, EM, gravitational?) in a somewhat spherical shell outward bound&quot;.</p>
<p>These are huge stars with lots of matter. Just as smoke from burning hydrocarbons (basically soot) can form as the particles in the smoke cool and coalesce, I'm guessing that supernova ejecta will similarly cool and coalesce. </p>
<p>If there remains a neutron star or black hole at the center, then you may see an &quot;inward light shining out&quot; effect as the EM radiation beats the &quot;soot&quot; and makes it glow.</p>

<p>>&gt; I may well be totally wrong.</p>
<p>Join the club, we got lots of room.</p>
<p>The iron atoms ejected from a supernova can join into grain once their temperature gets below \~ 900 K. But I don't know how long that would take. The Crab Nebula ejecta is over 11,000 K, I have read, and its been over 1000 years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Finally, the question regarding where elements heavier than iron arise may come to mind as well.  </p>
<p>That happens after the super nova explosion in the many nuclear events that occur as those elements are forced out into space with the immense number of neutrons and neutrinos that get created (maybe not the latter).</p>

<p>[Here's the S-process in terms of &quot;heavier than Fe&quot; elements and how they're formed.](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process</a></a> )</p>

<p>This is really fascinating stuff and we're able to figure out so much about where particular elements and their isotopes came from based on this science.</p></div>		</li>
