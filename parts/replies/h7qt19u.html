<p>The radio signal is also cone shaped like the beam of light. That's where <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagi%E2%80%93Uda_antenna#:~:text=A%20Yagi%E2%80%93Uda%20antenna%20or,acting%20as%20half%2Dwave%20dipoles." target="_blank">Yagi antennas</a> come into play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a &quot;weak signal&quot; but it's still strong enough to carry the data of a phone call in real time or upload photos, sometimes both simultaneously. Using this flashlight analogy, you can see the flashlight but it's useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not if you blink the flashlight on and off in a pattern, like morse code. The signal from your phone is modulated very quickly to carry the code necessary to transmit all of that data. The tower's strength isn't for reaching your phone, it's for reaching lots of phones all at once. When it's communicating with your phone, it's not using any more power than your phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tower also has a bigger antenna so it's more capable of picking up the weak signal from your phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct- but it does those things at much lower dates than the other directions.</p>
<p>Also a better way to think of it is that it's a weak flashlight...but you have night vision goggles</p></div>		</li>
