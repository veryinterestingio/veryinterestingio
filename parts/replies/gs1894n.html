			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, this seems to be the clearest answer. The &quot;further barrier to drug development&quot; in terms of ability to recruit for trials on pregnant women is definitely what had me at a loss. I suppose there's just no way around it (assuming there aren't generally enough women who'll volunteer to create a large enough sample size) until technology allows for accurate reproduction of human body functions for testing? Which I'm also assuming is quite far off...
And depending on how that works might have even more ethical issues (oh no, now we're down a rabbit hole)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the vaccine is widely distributed, there will be some women who get the vaccine without knowing that they're pregnant.</p>
<p>Those cases are tracked and followed l, to look for adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>Edit: someone else already said almost the exact same thing, I should have read more replies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your question is specifically about vaccines, in which case they generally won't bother testing and approving these drugs in pregnant women because they can just wait until they give birth to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>For drugs more generally, doctors will prescribe drugs that haven't been tested in pregnant women to the pregnant woman if the benefits outweigh the risks in the doctor's mind. Eventually there will be incidentally collected data on safety in pregnant women from this practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You think that, my ob was REALLY pushing me to get the covid vaccine as it's &quot;totally safe for pregnant women&quot; even though there is no way to know currently. </p>
<p>I am perfectly happy to get the shot once I give birth and recover a bit, but while I am still baking this bun you will not come near me with a needle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this being the best answer. However for context 1) medications r not commonly tested in pregnant females or children 2) meds for children are automatically dosed by weight rather than by regular adult dosing without evidence of appropriateness (some do have evidence but most don’t) 3) covid vaccines in particular have not been tested on pregnant women, children or people with immunosuppressed status so they r not recommended for these populations bc THERE IS NO EVIDENCE that it’s safe. Basically most of the ppl that really need vaccines are not studied bc takes too long or it is too hard. In the health region I work they are advising these populations to take it based on the risk that covid presents being higher than historical problems with vaccines- i agree with this but it remains problematic that they test vaccines on one population when other populations are more in need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there is significant evidence that Covid during pregnancy is extremely risky so most resources are pointing towards shared decision making between patients and providers. They can weigh the substantial, serious known risks of Covid against the unknown likely small risks of vaccination. We can predict that the risks of vaccination are low because of animal testing, because of safety testing for similar vaccines (like the Ebola vaccine), from trial participants who got pregnant just before or during the trial, etc. We know the risks of Covid for pregnant people are high because we know the risk of hospitalization, ventilation, and death are greater in pregnant patients compared to non-pregnant patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question with regard to immunocompromised status and COVID vaccines is one of effectiveness rather than safety. Neither of the vaccines is based on an attenuated virus, which is the kind of vaccine that is a problem in this population.</p>
<p>Effective dosing is the biggest question wrt pediatric COVID vaccines, too. Phase 2/3 of the Moderna trial is already underway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breastfeeding is actually a slightly different situation. It’s possible to test for changes in the milk. It might even be possible to pay women to pump milk and not feed their babies, to check for any changes from the medication. We can’t (afaik) look for any changes in what filters through the placenta to a fetus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't work directly on <em>pediatric</em> clinical trials, but our sister department directly across the hallway does. There's a lot of cross-talk.</p>
<p>For us (adults-only), if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or participating in activity that could lead to pregnancy (that means becoming pregnant or impregnating), you generally not allowed to enroll into a study without consenting to using at least one (but often two) forms of birth control. The exception to this are drugs that are known not to be harmful to the baby (or potential baby) such as novel treatments using existing drugs.</p>
<p>Whenever the baby gets involved, they ramp the restrictions up even higher, lower the enrollment limits, and monitor safety data extremely closely - both for the mother and the infant.</p>
<p>So basically what you said. Generally:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller studies with fewer participants.  </li>
<li>Stricter inclusion criteria for participants (no at-risk pregnancies allowed).  </li>
<li>Closer health and safety data monitoring with a greater readiness to 'pull the plug' on the trial.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the ways we gauge potential outcomes is by tracking all pregnancies that occur on our studies and recovering some baseline medical information.</p></div>		</li>
