			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, meant selling the stock. Okay, so as an example, a note is slipped under your door. Seemingly innocuous you read it, somewhere in the middle of it, it explains that shit is about to hit the fan. In order to avoid that the illegal nature, you are now legally obligated to now make that information public and <em>then</em> it is legal to sell your stock, correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not legally obligated to make it public. You're just not allowed to sell your stock based on that information (or really at all since you have no plausible deniability).</p>
<p>In fact, depending on the nature of the information making it public can also be illegal.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely people buy and sell stocks all the time for no real reason, what’s to stop OP just destroying the note with the information on and selling his stock? Maybe he just ‘got lucky’ by selling before the stock tanked and invested in something else</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A random note under your door would probably not be insider trading unless you would have a reason to receive it by someone in the know. Anyone could've given you that note, it's just as likely the note is wrong and baseless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, suppose there is a company that is failing for whatever reason, people are starting to get anxious and thinking about selling their stocks.</p>
<p>Can a company executive prevent people from selling stocks by individually contacting all shareholders and telling them, in confidence, that the company is about to announce something that is going to completely tank their stock prices (say, their CEO is being investigated for fraud or something)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not very realistic, since there are likely thousands or even millions of investors, some of which are funds.  How would someone contact each one of them individually at virtually the same time?  You can't let some investors get a jump on the others.</p>
<p>And how is something &quot;in confidence&quot; if you are telling thousands and thousands of people?  Why not simply announce the same thing publicly (assuming that it is true)?</p></div>		</li>
