			<div class="markdown"><p>My best answer is that the contracting fibres have got tight.  You know like with those coiled phone cords and sometimes they wrap around themselves? It’s like that.  Or to put it another way, you got 1000s of these little pully systems (muscle fibres) in your arms, and a big elastic band holding it all onto the bone (tendon).   You’ve heard people say they feel tight? Well imagine you’ve got a rubber band and it pulls on a thousand pully’s that all attach to each other (sometimes attached in a spiral) in one full rep, those thousand pully’s have got caught on each other, snapped, twisted or broken.  Some are even caught in a way that means they can’t stretch back out any more.  That twisting, breaking, and catching on each other is what being ‘tight’ is and why you get “t-Rex” arms.   It’s a rough analogy yes, but I think it suitably explains the tightness.   </p>
<p>My favourite is this, but it’s easier to show than explain, I’ll try.  Get your fingers and wrap them round the fingers or the other hand.  So your index fingers wrap around your middle fingers and everything else.  Make sure they’re tight and knotted.  Then pull them apart, you can’t.  That’s  your muscles after exercise.  Then if you hold your hands so the fingers rest in between each other, they should pull apart easily. That’s essentially how a normal muscle should function.   Now if your hands were pulled apart so that the fingers no longer touched, well that’s a pulled or torn muscle.  </p>
<p>Hope that makes sense. If things are unclear, please ask.  </p></div>		</li>
