			<div class="markdown"><p>If u put a methyl group on pentane’s first carbon then it’ll extend the chain to a hexane </p>
<p>The structure of the methyl group in the pentane might seem bent but c-c single bonds can be twisted around.</p>
<p>Think of it like this
U get a pipe with five 十-like segments, and connect a sixth one on one end
It’ll look like its a branch of the five-segment pipe but in reality the water that goes through the pipe is going to be passing six segments</p>
<p>Hope my over-complication of the matter helps lol</p></div>		</li>
