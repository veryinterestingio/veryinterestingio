			<div class="markdown"><p>The equatorial bulge and the centripetal force contribute equally, altitude above the ideal ellipsoid matters, everything else is a <em>much</em> smaller effect. The gravity anomalies GOCE measures are at most ~0.5 mm/s^(2) while the pole/equator difference is ~50 mm/s^(2).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Approximately equally due to coincidence, or exactly equally for mathematical reasons?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way. If the earth was a very viscous fluid such that it could deform to have minimal stresses but not flow in any short time scale (such as with water) what shape would it take? The answer is one where the forces pulling in and the forces pushing out match equally (or are in the process of equalizing to match equally).</p>
<p>In the geologic scale, this is nearly what the earth is. This is <em>why</em> we have a bulge at the equator, and why gravity is very similar around the world. If the earth didn't spin, there would be no bulge and the gravity would still be similar in all locations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to know this too - there's absolutely no practical application for it (for me, at least) but dang it I love physics trivia and I want to know how much less you weigh due to the equatorial bulge and how much due to centriwhatever force</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Approximately.</p>
<p>There is an interesting exact match in general relativity: Time dilation from motion at the equator (making time there go slower as seen from the poles) and from the higher gravitational potential (making time there go faster than at the poles) cancel exactly at sea level - because sea level is an area of equal effective potential. But this works for the potential only, not for the gravitational acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The most detailed model of the Earths' gravitational field that I know of is <a href="http://ddfe.curtin.edu.au/gravitymodels/GGMplus/GGMplus_readme.dat" target="_blank">GGM+</a>, which was built by combining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Field_and_Steady-State_Ocean_Circulation_Explorer" target="_blank">GOCE</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Recovery_and_Climate_Experiment" target="_blank">Grace</a> satellites with topographic data. Effectively high-resolution height maps of the surface are used to sharpen up the very blurry maps of the gravitational field the satellites produce.</p>
<p>Based on this model the gravitational acceleration at Kilimanjaro is 9.766044 m/s^2 and that at Mount Everest is 9.769463 m/s^2, a difference of 3.4 mm/s², which less than you would expect based on the latitude difference. This is mostly due to the height difference.</p>
<p>Here are maps of the area surrounding each mountain on the same color range from 9.765 m/s^2 to 9.790 m/s^(2): <a href="http://folk.uio.no/sigurdkn/ggmplus/S05E035_crop.png" target="_blank">Kilimanjaro</a> and <a href="http://folk.uio.no/sigurdkn/ggmplus/N25E085_crop.png" target="_blank">Mount Everest</a>. They are actually surprisingly close considering how different their surroundings are. There are valleys 0.6° = 70 km away from Mount Everest where the gravitational acceleration is almost 9.790 m/s^(2), which is 0.2% (about 22 mm/s) larger than either. That's a difference 5 times as large as the difference between the two mountains. Conversely, you don't have to go far from Kilimanjaro in any direction until you reach areas where the gravitational acceleration is greater than that at Mount Everest, despite the large difference in latitude. So small-scale gravitational fluctuations can sometimes overwhelm the larger scale effects of the Earth's rotation.</p>
<p>GGM+ also produces maps of the local <em>direction</em> of the gravitational field, which also changes in response to local mass concentrations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's quite simple to estimate the altitude effect: F~1/r^(2), dF/dr~2/r^(3) -&gt; delta_F/F ~ 2 delta_r/r </p>
<p>r=6370 km near the surface, so 1 km height changes your force by about 0.03%.</p></div>		</li>
