			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this a bit more (because it's hella interesting), these happen due to different genes being switched on and off when different signalling molecules are present. Scientists are still trying to figure out all the genes and signalling molecules ( + their cascades) involved in this, and it gets very complicated when you consider that different cells and tissues have different ways of controlling their growth, but still integrate it across different cell types.</p>

<p>Seeing as u/hoxa5 does research in this area, they can definitely explain this better than me and go into much more accurate detail. </p>
<p>Also - u/hoxa5, is your username inspired by the field too? I only noticed when I was about to type it and it made me smile :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m pretty uninformed about this topic. How far along is the research into these signaling genes? It seems like this could have some large impacts on medical advances.</p></div>		</li>
