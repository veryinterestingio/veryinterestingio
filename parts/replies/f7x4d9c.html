			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you.  I don't know.  Personally, I no longer use headphones of any kind.  I love music and like to listen to public radio.  Now that I have this condition I have moderate level of music or public radio on all the time to help mask the tone.  Instead of headphones, when I'm out and about and would like to listen to something, I have a small hand held radio that I take with me, and play at a modest volume so as not to disturb people.  To my knowledge no one has ever been bothered by my small radio. Contrar, I think people listen along with me, if they are say, waiting at the stop light to cross the street and have stand near me.  </p>
<p>I want to say I will never use headphones again but I can see very limited instances where I might want them, such as on a plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My old boss suffered with it too so I definitely know the change it can make. I made this post now to try and see if what I was doing was safe for my hearing or not. Thanks for the heads up, I’ll definitely take it seriously</p></div>		</li>
