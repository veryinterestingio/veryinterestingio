			<div class="markdown"><p>To begin with, it is important to point out that the iLet® bionic pancreas is an investigational device and is limited by federal (or United States) law to investigational use.  Consequently, I must not compare the device with other systems that are either on the market or in development. </p>
<p>However, what I can say is that the iLet bionic pancreas is designed to only require that a user enter only body weight to initialize the system. The system will not require insulin injections, the setting of basal insulin rates, insulin correction factors, carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios, or carbohydrate counting.  Instead, it will use autonomous, self-learning, decision software to determine a user’s dose every five minutes.  Consequently, it will not require (or allow) patients or providers to set or adjust insulin therapy. Our goal with this design is to make it easier to use by more people and by more physicians.</p>
<p>I should also point out that the bionic pancreas technology has been tested in the academic arena in about 15 phase 2 clinical research trials in the outpatient at home-use settings. The first dozen of these studies used an investigational version of the bionic pancreas that ran in an app on an iPhone that controlled one or two modified insulin pumps through the Bluetooth radio (one insulin pump delivered insulin and the other was re-purposed to deliver glucagon). The last three of these studies used an investigational version of the iLet® bionic pancreas that consisted of a purpose-built, dual drug chamber, wearable device, called the iLet bionic pancreas, in which the bionic pancreas algorithms that ran on the app of the iPhone bionic pancreas were embedded on the iLet bionic pancreas. </p>
<p>These clinical trials typically involved between 10 and 40 study participants, where each participant would use the bionic pancreas for one or two weeks and would also spend one or two weeks on their own usual care, in random order.  Usual care was defined as whatever their insulin therapy was at the time of the study. This usually included insulin pump users, sensor-augmented insulin pump users, multiple daily injection therapy users, and sensor-augmented multiple daily injection therapy users.  Thus we can look to these phase 2 trials as a way to understand how bionic pancreas technology would compare to usual care at the time those studies were conducted.</p>
<p>In some of our studies we compared the insulin-only configuration of the bionic pancreas to each study participant’s usual care; in other studies we have compared to bihormonal configuration of the bionic pancreas to each study participant’s usual care; and in still other studies we compared both configurations of the bionic pancreas (the insulin-only and bihormonal configurations) to each study participant’s usual care.  Results from these clinical studies were published in various journal publications including (Russell et al., New Engl. J. Med., 2014, 371:313–25; Russell et al. Lancet Diab. &amp; Endocrinol., 2016, 4:233–43; El-Khatib et al., Lancet, 2017, 389:369–80).</p>
<p>We consistently found that the bihormonal configuration of the bionic pancreas resulted in mean glucose levels that were lower across the cohorts than usual care.  Results also showed that the bihormonal configuration of the bionic pancreas resulted in less hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) across the cohorts than usual care.  These results were found to be statistically significant.  Furthermore, results showed that there was less variability in mean glucose levels on the insulin-only and bihormonal configurations of the bionic pancreas than on usual care.  Typically we found that fewer than 50% of the study participants on their own usual care had a mean glucose level below 154 mg/dl (which corresponds to the American Diabetes Association goal for therapy for people with type 1 diabetes), whereas typically about 50% of those participants on the insulin-only configuration of the bionic pancreas and 90% of those participants on the bihormonal configuration of the bionic pancreas had mean glucose levels below 154 mg/dl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for elaborating as much as you could. Will this device require re-filling of insulin and glucagon chambers? Is it a single use device or wil you be able to reuse it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you have to refill the insulin and glucagon cartridges before they are empty. The device is reusable. Please see my response to u/NotSeveralBadgers for further details about how the device operates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you expect to avoid a significant glucose spike if you have to wait until ingested carbohydrates begin entering the bloodstream for the machine to administer a bolus? How does it know the difference between the first 10 minutes of a 15g carbohydrate load and the first 10 minutes of a 60g carbohydrate load?</p>
<p>The unavoidable time delay from subcutaneously administered insulin, added to the delay from interstitial glucose readings, both seem to be fundamental barriers towards perfecting smart pumps, and so far other than the bihormonal aspect, you have nothing categorically different than MedTronic’s AutoMode, and Tandem’s Control-IQ.</p>
<p>Further, regarding the bihormonal factor, I’ve never seen any data to suggest type 1 diabetics are typically deficient in glucagon secretion, and I know for a fact that that it is not a diagnostic indicator of T1DM. In fact, I’ve only ever seen data demonstrating the opposite, that patients’ alpha cells typically over-secrete, and that reducing glucagon secretion can alleviate chronic hyperglycemia.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I misinterpreted what you are saying, but if T1D patients still secrete glucagon, how can they still become hypoglycemic?</p></div>		</li>
