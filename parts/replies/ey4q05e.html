			<div class="markdown"><p>From an article I googled:</p>
<p>“Common sense suggests that because the field of &quot;red&quot; flavors was already so crowded—cherry, strawberry, watermelon, cinnamon, cranberry, red apple—and there are scarcely any blue foods in nature, raspberry was simply traded from Team Red to Team Blue to avoid confusion among consumers. “</p>
<p>Also Red No. 2 caused a cancer scare in the 50s so it was a benefit for the new raspberry flavor not to be red and associated with the carcinogenic dye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern artificial blue raspberry is actually mostly made up from a mixture of pineapple, banana, and strawberry favor profiles. Next time you get something blue raspberry flavored, close your eyes before you eat it and focus really hard on the flavor. You'll taste mostly pineapple</p></div>		</li>

<p>Watermelon to me just tastes like mildly sweetened yummy water, whereas watermelon candy is typically an overwhelming front of powerful (but delicious) sweetness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say &quot;and yet so tasty&quot; but I'm a bit late to the party. However I must ask if you've ever had a watermelon from say... A farmers market? Or only the grocery store versions? And do you know they ways in which to select a ripe one? None of these watermelons I'm mentioning taste like those delicious candies, but they're certainly better than a whimsical buy at your local Wal * Mart (yes I'm old and petty). As it goes with arriving late to the party, when</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's similar to grapes, grape flavoring is based on concord grapes (the really purple ones), not the red and green grapes you see in every store.  Concord grapes are a wine grape, while red and green grapes are table grapes.  Wine grapes are smaller, thick skinned, and often seeded, while table grapes are the big seedless kinds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly it is a very small molecule as well. Put a banana in a bag with a sealed packet of chips (crisps) and they will take on the banana flavour pretty quickly, the &quot;banana ester&quot; can go through the sealed packaging.</p></div>		</li>
