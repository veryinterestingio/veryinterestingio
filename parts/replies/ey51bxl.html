			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need an existing model, but that would be really helpful. For instance, since we have thousands of models of flight, it'd be much easier to engineer flight in a new creature. Or we could even start with a creature like a bird that already flies. Engineering fire, an entirely new trait, by contrast would require more work and luck. But as we talk in the book some creatures like Bombardier beetles and electric eels could be very helpful in terms of giving us ideas and biological templates to build on. There would definitely be unintended consequences though so you are right on that.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrqYdvZ29E" target="_blank"><em>Unforeseen</em> consequences</a>, perhaps?</p>
<p>I imagine troubleshooting software bugs in living beings must be a real treat. What is your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle" target="_blank">SDLC</a> like? How do you test, debug, and particularly handle... discarded living beings?</p></div>		</li>
