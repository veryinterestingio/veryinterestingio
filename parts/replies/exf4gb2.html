			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy isn't correct, you can indeed get one beam to completely disappear! The interference pattern that you see is actually the result of misalignment or incorrect mode-matching of the interferometer arms (e.g. one beam larger than the other). A properly aligned interferometer will have the entire beam getting dimmer and brighter as the path length difference is changed. Of course the power isn't being destroyed or created - its just being given to or taken from the path going back to the laser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by mode matching?</p>
<p>I don't get how the light would choose a path like how you're describing unless you are saying there is a physical misalignment. Isn't the light splitting through the beam splitter a random process that roughly splits in 50 50 regardless of direction along its axes up and down left and right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The total optical power won't change, because all of the original optical energy is still in the beams. The intensity does change, because optical intensity is a measure of optical power per unit of area, W/m^2 in S.I. units. Thus, the interference pattern has regions of no intensity where the two beams have destructively interfered due to phase difference resulting from the different optical path lengths. However, integrating the intensity across the area of the interference pattern will result in a result of 50% of the original optical power. The other 50% returned to the laser.</p></div>		</li>
