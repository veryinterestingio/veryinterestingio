			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, a 1 hour hot bath burns 130 kcal, which is quite a lot when you're dieting on 1200 kcal/day. So a sauna may well burn a non-negligable amount.</p>
<p>Shivering also burns a lot of calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you postulating that, because we sweat out the water produced by burning fat, that sweating promotes fat burning? It doesn't really work that way. The body doesn't burn fat in order to create sweat, it burns fat to create energy, and water is a byproduct*. If you need more water, your body just tells you to drink. Excess sweating just dehydrates you, and dehydration is a bad weight loss strategy.</p>
<p>Also, sweat isn't the only way water is removed from the body - I'd guess we exhale, urinate and defecate far more water than we sweat on average.</p>
<p>*the small complication is that creating and secreting sweat requires energy, so you do burn fat to sweat, but you burn fat to create the energy for sweating, not the water. And it doesn't require a lot of energy so it's probably negligible.</p></div>		</li>
