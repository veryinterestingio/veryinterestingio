			<div class="markdown"><p>One answer to this question: the heat shield itself is actually not very heavy, at about 160 pounds: <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/cutting-edge-heat-shield-installed-on-nasa-s-parker-solar-probe" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/cutting-edge-heat-shield-installed-on-nasa-s-parker-solar-probe" target="_blank">https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/cutting-edge-heat-shield-installed-on-nasa-s-parker-solar-probe</a></a></p>
<p>However, other components of the spacecraft needed to be specially designed to distribute heat effectively throughout the spacecraft, radiate excess heat into space, and monitor the temperature carefully.  And all of the instruments needed to be designed to tolerate the thermal environment.  So another answer would be that essentially the entire spacecraft is designed to protect from the heat. -Marc Pulupa</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that the heat shield is a foam material with very low heat conductivity.  The surface reflectivity is important, but given the harsh environment a mirror may not be as durable as a white surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not much actually. The heat shield is made out of carbon foam and it's very porous. It weights only 160 pounds despite being 8 feet wide. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess would be that both a mirror and a white heat shield would reflect light at all wavelengths. It's just that a mirror has specular reflection whereas a white object reflects light in a diffuse manner. So it wouldn't make much of a difference to polish it like mirror, because the amount of light reflected stays the same</p></div>		</li>
