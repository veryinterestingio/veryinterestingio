			<div class="markdown"><p>Bodybuilding.com is a great place to start as it has reputable individuals creating many articles on this question</p>
<p>Testosterone Nation is also a good place to visit as they have many renowned writers who touch on this and more as well.</p>
<p>DO NOT stop at these websites, the world is your oyster for this information, always bear in mind who is writing what you are reading though and if there is document RESULTS!!</p>
<p>P.S try to stay away from open discussion forums, while they may have some good material, they do contain a lot of &quot;bro science&quot; which is essentially wives tales for fitness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, there are many great metabolic nutrition/physiology textbooks used in classrooms available as another springboard! I'd link mine... But I don't remember it off hand, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Fats (autocorrect almost got me with <em>farts</em>) provide the backbone for all hormones. Fat intake is arguably the most necessary macro in the group..</p>
<p>I don't know numbers re: waking/asleep state, but the point would be mostly moot I imagine. If I had to guess, hormonal production is higher during sleeping as a regenerative state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I shouldnt have used the term Hypertrophy so loosely.</p>
<p>Although Hypertrophy and a pump are not interchangable, it is generally agreed upon that a pump will lead to hypertrophy with the right diet,exercise, recovery and lifting form.</p></div>		</li>
