It’s not like one team of people traveled to a billion houses across the globe; it’s more like every country aimed to visit a certain percentage of the houses in its territory, and the WHO supervised the efforts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how the UN works, btw. If they service to do something, it isnt &quot;every country on earth&quot; lending a hand. It's usually a mix of US funding, specialists/managment from EU, China, or Japan, ground staff from India, Pakistan, or African nations trying to score points.</p>
<p>Small nit pick, I admit, but we should be clear on what the UN is and isn't, no?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You missed a word in there, so I just assumed it was 7-10 weeks. 7-10 days is really dang impressive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>India was one of the worst affected countries when this whole campaign started because of how people in rural areas live. This whole system was basically made out of necessity, but it's still bloody incredible. </p>
<p>There are tiny hospitals in every small village put there for the SOLE PURPOSE of vaccinating children.  It's insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's <em>incredibly</em> hard when you have secluded villages that live x days upstream of a river, or tucked away in the mountains with only perilous access on foot, or in contested hotspot areas with guerilla groups, all the while coordinating the visit to 1 billion people in 1973 India where many regions still relied on telegraph cables for communucation.</p>
<p>The two situations have nothing in common aside from the geographic size of the countries.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't know about that. Not everyone gets mail every day.</p>
<p>Certainly a significant percentage though.</p>
<p>Edit: as pointed out below, plenty of people go to the post office to get their mail (far more than in the UK, for example)</p></div>		</li>
