			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always been a night owl. Even as a kid, I went to bed after midnight, parents woke me up on time to go to school. Played for a bit with friends after school, took a nap, did homework, repeat cycle. </p>
<p>I tried to go to sleep earlier and functioned okay, but I naturally progressed to sleeping later. I’ll start feeling tired, but as soon as 10:30 or 11pm hit, I’d basically be wide awake and my brain would be really sharp and creative. Things that would take me a long time to do during normal hours would take me about half as long during night time hours because my brain just worked more efficiently. </p>
<p>I do need to sleep a lot though. I’ve tried multiple times to adjust my sleep schedule and it doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Edit to add that I’m in my 40s, so it’s not a young-person thing. My parents confirm that I’ve been like this since I was a young kid. My husband is also a night owl, though not as severe as I am. </p>
<p>Our young daughter tends to stay up late, even though we send her to bed early. She’ll stay awake in her bed playing out conversations for several hours and usually doesn’t fall asleep until 10pm. She’s been doing this since she was 4. </p>
<p>It’s definitely something biological and not something we can train ourselves out of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this interesting because I do pretty well with having not a lot of sleep, but I wouldn't describe myself as a morning person, and would much rather stay up late to get things done than get up early to do them.</p></div>		</li>
