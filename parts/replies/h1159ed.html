			<div class="markdown"><p>I went down a wikipedia rabbit hole one night and was reading the page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder" target="_blank">schizoid personality disorder</a>. The page specifically mentions that autism (aspergers at the time) was once called &quot;schizoid disorder of childhood,&quot; and the same psychiatrist who coined the term &quot;autism&quot; also came up with the words &quot;schizophrenia&quot; and &quot;schizoid.&quot;</p>
<p>The connection is kind of interesting but also sad to think of all the children who must have ended up in psychiatric wards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also want to add that the guy who discovered autism, Leo Kanner, dubbed the syndrome has extremely rare and disagreed with the notion that it might be a spectrum even though many of his fellow colleagues thought so which needless to say, caused a lot of problems in the future and led many children with autistic symptoms to be diagnosed with schizophrenia instead because there was a huge overlap between the two. </p>
<p>He didn't acknowledge the work of Hans Asperger either who discovered autism around the same time and believed that it was indeed a spectrum.</p>
<p>Fun fact:  Leo Kanner also blamed the condition on bad parenting and coined the term &quot;refrigerator mother&quot; which was a theory that autism was caused by lack of maternal warmth since, majority of his patients' mothers were college graduates (which was heavily stigmatized then) and/or gave the impression of being slightly eccentric.</p>
<p>A lot of these misconceptions definitely added to the chaos that ensued later in autism research.</p></div>		</li>
