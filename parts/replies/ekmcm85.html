<p>The image we all saw yesterday is oriented almost perfectly for us to &quot;see&quot; it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the biggest misconception surrounding this image. If the accretion disk was edge-on then we'd see a streak across the center of the black circle (like in Interstellar). But everyone keeps repeating that black holes would look like the image from yesterday regardless of what angle the observer was at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. The gravity of the black hole would bend the light around the back side, so we would see the top and bottom of the edge-on accretion disc as a halo around the shadow. This halo would be visible from basically any orientation of the accretion disc.</p>
<p>It's being repeated because it's true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We also used this tech to look at our own supermassive black hole, here in the milky way.<br />
Due the the angle we view it from the picture is much less impressive and looks more like a blob.</p>

<p>Has this picture been released?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They took pictures of both over roughly the same time period. Weather wasn’t cooperative, and as mentioned elsewhere, there is much more gas/noise to be filtered out for it. </p>
<p>They haven’t determined if they can still get a cohesive image out of the data they have, or if they need to start over.</p></div>		</li>
