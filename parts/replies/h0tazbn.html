<p>Nope.</p>
<p>And sometimes, libraries have to pay to renew their digital copy, to mimic how they would have to buy a new physical copy after the physical copy wears out.</p>
<p>Again: <em>Libraries hate this.</em> Their money is always tight enough without this nonsense added on.</p>
<p>But as you said: profit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I have a Kobo e-reader which I love to bits, but I have to use Adobe to transfer books to it, and it will literally fight me tooth and nail over books I got from the library. Even gave me guff about a book I bought from Google Play. I gave up.</p>
<p>Now that I have a tablet with Libby, it's a million times easier. And Adobe still hasn't fixed their garbage program. It's so bullshit.</p>
<p>Edit: I appreciate the wifi comments, I wasn't sure why I didn't use that at the time, and then I remembered I lived in China at the time and their internet wouldn't let me sync that way. SMH. Oh well, I'm quite happy now with Libby and my tablet. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been years since I worked at a library, but I remember the despair when they realized they'd have to buy four copies of this super popular new release in physical form, and then <em>another</em> four copies at basically the exact same price in digital form just to meet patron demands, on top of the fees for the Overdrive system. Instead of helping alleviate budget pressure, it made things worse. :(</p>
<p>But if they didn't go with ebooks, were they a truly modern library meeting their patrons' needs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an academic librarian. Ebooks we purchase a license for typically cost in the hundreds for a single user (if someone else tries to access the book while someone is using it, they're told to check back later) and go up to truly ridiculous levels when we pay for more than one user - you know, like a class of students using the same book. We have books we paid thousands of dollars for that were made obsolete within a couple years when the new edition came out. We can't even sell our old ebooks like we can our old physical books to try to get some of that money back, it's just a huge portion of our annual books budget gone forever.</p>
<p>Public libraries don't deal with the same prices we do, but ebooks are in almost all cases significantly more expensive for publics too. Some public libraries are even charged per checkout, whether the book is read or not. Not to mention, publishers are trying more and more to implement embargos on new titles, not understanding that libraries actually significantly drive book sales, they don't take away sales. Many people discover their favorite authors through library books and go on to support those authors by buying their books. </p>
<p>The public demands ebooks more and more, but as this thread alone demonstrates, the public has no concept of what libraries pay for ebooks, how publishers operate, and how little money actually goes to the authors. Publishers have done an excellent job of convincing the public that they're the good guys, actually, and they deserve huge chunks of taxpayer money from ebook sales to libraries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the early days of video rental, it used to work like this too. Video rental companies used to have to pay upwards of $80 per video, and hope to rent it out  30 times over its lifetime to make a profit. It meant they didn’t buy many copies of even really popular new releases, so customers would often go to rent a new release and find it was unavailable - a missed rental opportunity. </p>
<p>Then Blockbuster came along and they were big enough that they could dictate terms to the distributors (or their middle men). They changed things so the videos were sold to Blockbuster for just a few dollars, then Blockbuster would pay the distributor (or whoever) an amount for each rental.</p>
<p>It benefited the customers (they always had the new releases) and everyone on the selling/renting side (no more missed rental opportunities). Hopefully someone can come along and change the model for ebooks at libraries too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Spotify premium is an analogy: you pay monthly to get the Spotify premium service (analogous to the library getting its monthly budget). Then when you listen to a song the artist gets 0.001 cents (or whatever). The customer doesn’t pay per song.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Independent publisher here. We sold over 3000 copies of a certain ebook to libraries and made $20 from it.
It’s not publisher profit, it’s services like Libby or whatever distributor is selling to the libraries that makes that money.</p>
<p>Edit: I mean Independent publishing house - not self published. Most Canadian publishers are small firms funded by the government. We specifically only take a small piece of book sales, and fully absorb initial costs.
We profit only off of movie deals and foreign rights</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but the point isn't profiting off the library system, the point is that when you go to the library and see a wait-list your options are to either:</p>
<p>A) wait. </p>
<p>B) purchase a retail copy.</p>
<p>Thus you have a tried and true two-tier system where paying readers get immediate access.</p>
<p>I can't speak to what the Library paid per license for your book, but Libby has a 90% market share and annual revenue of ~100m. Assuming the 10% competitors take a similar cut, we're talking about distributors draining ~110million a year.</p>
<p>We spend ~$13.7 Billion in America annually on the library system ~45% of which is on acquisitions, or ~6.2 billion. I don't have a full breakdown of the acquisitions budgets at hand without more google-fu than it's worth, but that's about 1.7% of the acquisitions budget going to ebook distribution systems. That's actually pretty reasonable in the grand scheme of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a self published author.  I provide copies of my books to any library that requests one to them for $0.01.  That's not a typo.  I charge them only <em>one cent.</em>  They also get them DRM free and are <em>not</em> limited to the number of copies they can lend out.</p>
<p>I also sell them through other means.  Am I cutting into my profit?  Probably, but I still make money from direct sales.  Not much money, mind you, but some.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>20/3000 = 0.0066 - we sell them cheaper.</p>
<p>Edit: Jkjk I see your point, libraries that ask for our books + local high schools get most of our books free of charge - this drives interest and sales. The point is that Libby and these ebook distributors have a weird distribution method that ends up being terrible for both libraries and authors/publishers.</p></div>		</li>
