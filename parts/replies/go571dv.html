			<div class="markdown"><p>it does! Battery powered lights absolutely get dinner as their power runs out, for example. It's not always obvious because lots of machines can't run below a certain voltage at all. So, a &quot;dead&quot; car battery stops running entirely when it's at 70% of its max voltage (10/14). You don't notice the difference between 100% charge and 70% charge much when it drains over time, but I just put in a new battery and immediately saw the difference. Something that can work all the way down to 0 voltage would be a lot more obvious to notice the voltage draining.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does! Most devices stop running before a battery is 'dead'. However, they don't care <em>too</em> much about a minor change in voltage. Lights may get dimmer, or your car may take longer to start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah my phone is 5 years old now - when it says itâ€™s down to 1% it usually lasts at least 20 or so minutes before fully dying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why a phone fresh off a charger seems to go down to 99% within minutes, and the last 1% feels like it lasts forever</p></div>		</li>
