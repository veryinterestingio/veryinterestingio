			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a trade off, imagine an environmental niche can only produce x amount of energy for an organism to consume while maintaining balance. That organism is free to distribute those x points to any function, strength, intelligence, precision, senses, mass etc. Humans dumped their stats into intelligence, dexterity at the cost of things like mass or muscle. So far it's worked out pretty well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father died of a drug overdose at 49. During the autopsy they said his heart was 3 times the normal size.  All this information makes sense to me and this has to have something to do with why people with dwarfism die young. Do their organs continue to grow after the body stops?</p></div>		</li>
