			<div class="markdown"><p>I won a brewing contest with a small beer.</p>
<p>The sign-up form asked for details about the beer and the brewing process, but not the ABV nor the recipe or enough info that the judges could calculate it.</p>
<p>My doc had told me to cut down on alcohol, so I started all-grain brewing my own 1%-2% beer and after a couple of years I was getting consistently very tasty beers. So I entered one in to a local brewing contest and took best in show.</p>
<p>$100 first prize, wooo!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have brewers in my family-and-friends circle. Through hanging out with them and others who brew and organise events like this, I can say I’ve seen a lot of a particular type of personality: brewers who are snobs about anything low-alcohol, and will be absolutely prejudiced against anything under 6%. They’re just another kind of gatekeeper, but unfortunately common. </p>
<p>Luckily those kinds of events also attract a lot of open-minded and curious people who want to try everything, too. Much more pleasant to be around. I don’t have the energy to deal with gatekeepers.</p></div>		</li>
