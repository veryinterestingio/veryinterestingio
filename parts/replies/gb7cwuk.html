			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, so depending on each person’s muscle make up and use they have varying degrees of “default positions”, your note about different “anatomical positions” depending on the society is also something fun to think about, thanks for the in depth reply!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense when you think about how some people can touch their toes and some can't, or how peoples' posture varies greatly. It's honestly less of a &quot;default position&quot; and more of a &quot;path of least resistance&quot; position. An easy way to think of it is that your muscles have a certain elasticity to them, and if enough tension is placed on a muscle, they'll naturally want to &quot;snap back&quot; to a less strenuous position. On a neurological level, your body also has things called muscle spindles which detect when a muscle is stretched to the point of injury, and will engage the antagonist muscle to pull the muscle back to a more neutral position (this is why you'll start shaking when doing a really deep stretch.)</p>
<p>By the way, the difference in anatomical positions aren't a cultural thing so much as it's based on the terminology itself.</p>
<p>In western medicine, &quot;proximal&quot; refers to how close something is to the heart, especially in the extremities (&quot;distal&quot; refers to the opposite.) So your elbow would be proximal to your wrist, and your wrist would be distal to your elbow. Since the arms and legs both extend downward in western medicine, you can usually think of proximal as being &quot;higher&quot; and distal being &quot;lower&quot; (obviously this changes as soon as you move your body into a different position.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine speaks in terms of chi/qi, which describes energy flow in terms if yin and yang. Yin energy comes upward &quot;from the earth&quot; and thus would travel from your feet up to your torso (yang energy comes &quot;from the sun&quot; and goes in the opposite direction.) However, because eastern anatomical position has you placing your arms above your head, yin energy also continues from your torso UP into your arms. If you were to use western terminology for this, you would say yin energy travels proximally through the legs, but <strong>distally</strong> through the arms. Using a different anatomical position for TCM keeps the terminology internally consistent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that the other way round. In western position the hand is distal to the arm whether in the default anatomical position, pointing at the sky or bending over and touching your toes. In TCM the hands would be yin to the arms in the default and pointing positions but yang when bending over and touching the toes. Thus western is internally consistent and CTM externally consistant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anatomical position provides and absolute point of reference for describing the position of body parts.  In that position, for example, the thumb is lateral to the index.  Like how on a ship you don't say left or right, you use port or starboard.</p>
<p>In addition to the functional resting position described above, there is also an 'open-packed' position for any given joint.  This is the position in which there is the least stress on the joint and it is able to move most freely.  In a lot of cases, the open-packed position would be a natural resting position.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A guy who does a lot of curls without balancing it with triceps work would have the elbow at a more acute angle I would imagine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting. Why not simply have them sleep in zero g?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are still somewhat in control of their bodies while they sleep. Some people toss and turn all night, I’m big on kicking my partner and stealing blankets, etc.
Point is you wouldn’t necessarily be 100% completely relaxed just because you’re asleep. Knocking them out would be much more reliable and fun.</p></div>		</li>
