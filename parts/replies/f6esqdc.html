			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to a regional conference for my job recently, with one of my employees in tow. We went around the room introducing ourselves and everyone thought my employee was my boss until I said my job title. Another person in the room (in front of our regional manager) blurted out, “what, did you start when you were three?” I said “four, actually.” My hair is going gray pretty rapidly and I’m hoping that helps. I look 20 and I feel 80.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extra fat, especially on your face makes you look like 35-40. If you’re younger losing weight can make you look younger, but if you’re old it often makes you look older. Obviously this varies by person depending on your skin and where you hold fat, but it tends to work this way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It has some weird allergy and immune system symptoms, and has to limit her histamine intake, but one of the side effects, is her skin doesn’t wrinkle, like at all</p>
<p>She looks 15-20 years younger than she is because of it</p></div>		</li>

<p>This just sounds super interesting to me.  I went on the wiki page and to be honest, it sounds horrible. Or at least quite a few of the symptoms.  I didn't see anything about skin not turning wrinkly. But I did skim kind of fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most upsetting thing that happened when I worked for a small airline in college as ground crew was an older ladies skin tearing open like paper because of lack of elasticity. All she was doing was holding onto the handrail while walking down the steps from the small plane - but as she took a step, she didn’t slide her hand. The skin wrinkled on top and then split. There was blood.</p></div>		</li>
