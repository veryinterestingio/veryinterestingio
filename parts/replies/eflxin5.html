			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an arcapeligo under the ice because of the ice.    Greenland is similar.    When the ice cap is gone, the land below it will rebound and be above sea level, eventually making one landmass.  Hudson Bay is still slowly rebounding from the last ice age for example.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the land mass of Antarctica would be below sea level right this instant if you teleported away the ice, but that doesn't mean the above-sea-level land masses are all &quot;islands.&quot;</p>
<p>In those places, there's sub-sea-level bedrock, then up to two miles of freshwater ice, then air. As the ice accumulated, it started shoving the bedrock down below sea level. </p>
<p>Of course, if all the ice in Antarctica melted, there would be a lot of big land masses turned into island chains (including Antarctica) but from a geological standpoint it makes more sense to think of Antarctica as one mostly-connected land mass with portions of it pushed below sea level.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is news to me, and fascinating - any sources? And what about <a href="https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/cryoscoop-ice-islands-and-new-antarctic-map" target="_blank">this?</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now the weight of the ice is pushing much of the continent below sea level. If all the ice mysteriously vanished it would look like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica#/media/File:AntarcticBedrock.jpg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica#/media/File:AntarcticBedrock.jpg</a></p>
<p>However once it rebounded it would look more like the map you posted. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that mean the earth is very hot underneath? from the immense pressure?</p></div>		</li>
