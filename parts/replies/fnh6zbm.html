			<div class="markdown"><p>To amplify this a little bit.</p>
<p>The FORCE depends on both masses, however the ACCELERATION, or the change in motion, of the object only depends on the central bodies mass (aka the Earth). This means if you were the same distance as the moon (and going the same speed), you would follow the same motion as the moon. The moon has a higher force acting on it, but due to its high mass, the resulting acceleration is the same.</p>
<p>Incidentally this is also why all objects fall at the same rate (ignoring drag effects).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>worth mentioning that, while the radial acceleration of you and the moon would be the same, there's a lot of orbital intracacies that would disallow the actual motion from being identitical. (very different effective potentials between the two objects will make their stable orbits very different)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The acceleration on the moon DUE to the earth implies earth is. Acceleration due to gravity is independent of the object being accelerated.</p>
<p>Given F=ma
m_moon <em> a = G </em> m_earth * m_moon / r^2</p>
<p>The moons mass divides out leaving you with the acceleration due to earth gravity.</p>
<p>a = G m_earth / r^2</p>
<p>If you evaluate this with r equal to the earth radius (that is to say, evaluate the acceleration at the earth surface) you will get 9.8 m/s^2 or 32 ft/s^2. </p>
<p>That value is independent of the mass of the object being acted upon. A brick and a feather are both accelerated at 9.8 m/s^2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation, but I would add the following :</p>
<p>Oceans can be seen as a continuum, which means every particle of water will push and pull onto its neighbours. Gravitational attraction depends on the distance between the 2 objects. Two adjacent particles of water will therefore be attracted by the moon with different intensity, since they are not exactly at the same distance from the moon. The difference in force between the two particles is really what induces the flow to move from in one direction or another. If you integrate this over a large distance you end up with more water being &quot;moved&quot; and that's why tides are barely noticeable on small lakes. </p>
<p>TL/DR: Tides are the result of a cumulative effect of the moon attraction over bodies of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those having problems imagining this:</p>
<p>It's not like the moon can actually <em>lift</em> the water on the side facing it. It's more that the water that is not directly under the moon moves a little bit sideways towards the moon. So the water under the moon is not <em>dragged</em> upward, it is <em>pushed</em> upwards by more water flowing to it's position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's one way to see it. Another way to illustrate this phenomenon is with ferrofluids and a magnetic field. Depending on the intensity of the magnetic field, it could be possible to recreate tides on a more observable macroscopic level. You could even observe both extremes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The distance between water particles is not so significant, because the distance from the water particles to moon, is so much bigger.</p>
<p>A better picture for this, is, when you only think about the surface of the water. If the world would be only Ocean, the surface would be a perfect sphere.</p>
<p>The other extreme would be without earth gravitation all the water would be pulled to the moon.</p>
<p>And the right answer is now in between these extremes.</p>
<p>That means the water is pulled to the moon, but wants to build a sphere.</p>
<p>Or in a detailed view. The water particles are pulled to the moon, so they are lifted on the moon side, but also flow down on the surface away from the moon side.</p>
<p>Not so easy to explain in detail, although it is a simple phenomena.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting way of explaining things. Could you elaborate? </p>
<p>Are you referring to the experiment astronauts do on the space station? When they let water floating around until it forms a sphere? If so, I believe this is more related to surface tension and I think (and I may be wrong on that) that surface tension is negligible at larger scale.</p></div>		</li>
