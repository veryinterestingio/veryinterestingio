After a long time the gas and breaks are both pressed down all the way.  When you stop drinking you let off the brakes and all of a sudden it's all gas, and no control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh. It usually more than a few days to get a significant neuroadaptations mechanisms. Some people who've been alcoholics a while don't really feel the physical withdrawal.</p>
<p>For some people, only a few weeks will be needed.</p>
<p>But it will not give you the feeling of being on amphetamine, it will more give the effect of having a massive panic attack that doesn't stop (with seizures).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It... um, if it feels like any part of amphetamines, it's the come down, but without being mentally slower!</p>
<p>It makes sense that that would happen in a brain that has treated dopamine the way an amphetamine user treats sleep though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually more due the the depressant effects physiologically more so than mentally. All GABA based drugs, think valium Xanax, alcohol and phenobaritol, effect things such as heart rate and respiration. This means the body no longer maintains total control over these physiologic systems and so when the substances keeping them in balance suddenly stop being present the body goes into shock i.e withdrawals. With these gaba drugs the reaction can be so extreme as to result in heart attacks or strokes. This is what's causes death. They can ecan cause muscle spasms so extreme as to fracture your femer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it was worth clarifying. A lot of people assume “depressant” means something that causes depression, but this isn’t the case. The opposite of a depressant isn’t an antidepressant, but a stimulant. (A substance that causes depression is a depressogen, for anyone curious.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I saw below you described that a combination of meds helps bring the volume down. I wasn’t thinking of how awful a constant, loud ringing would be to live with forever. My knee jerk reaction wasn’t very considerate of your experience. I was just shocked, I’ve never heard of that as a treatment before and those are controlled substances.</p></div>		</li>
