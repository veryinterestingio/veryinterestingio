			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.  People are good at painting the outside of their boats bright colours, but unless the boat has capsized, if I’m in a airplane at 1000m looking down, it’s the inside of the boat I’ll be seeing.  The more the inside of the boat contrasts with the colour of the water, the easier it will be to spot.  Contrast and distinctiveness (and movement) are key factors in visibility from the air.</p></div>		</li>
