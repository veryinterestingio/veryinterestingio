			<div class="markdown"><p>In that case, they're just stuck with displaying different frames for different lengths of time. For example, playing a 24 Hz film on a 60 Hz display, you can show one frame 3 times in a row, then only show the next frame only 2 times. This takes the same amount of average time (1/12th of a second) as 2 frames at 24 Hz. This technique is called a 3-2 pulldown and was commonly used to transfer films on physical reels to analog TV signals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TV was shown at 29.97fps and 60Hz monitors are basically just double that. There are 2 standard frame rates for entertainment 24fps and 29.97fps. So anything divisible by 24 or by basically 30 would work as a frame rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally, it would be divisible by 48 or 60.   It's why 240hz displays exist.</p>
<p>Yes, I know the &quot;pixels&quot; don't update that fast.  But you can run at a permanent 240hz clock speed, and just duplicate frames at a consistent number.</p></div>		</li>

<p>PAL broadcast at 25fps, and film records at 24fps.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 60hz actually comes from TV, which was originally 30 frames per second, interlaced. Half the screen was shown on alternating lines, then the other half, thirty times a second. And since you're only showing half at a time, you need twice as many frames, thus the NTSC standard of 30fps for TV was broadcast as a 60hz signal.</p>
<p>I know, not really what you were asking, but I thought some people might be wondering why 60hz refresh rates are so common.</p>
<p>What's really fun is that TV <em>isn't</em> 30fps... at least not anymore. TV was originally broadcast in black and white, but when they added color to the signal, well, they needed to get that information in there somewhere, so they shortened the frame rate just slightly to 29.97fps.  </p>
<p>Of course, with video games and computers, there's no need to worry about broadcasting bandwidth (and interlaced video has pretty much gone the way of the dodo in favor of progressive scan - i.e. drawing the whole frame instead of alternating halves), they can take full advantage of that 60hz refresh rate, displaying at a full 60fps (or higher, if the display can accommodate it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other thing to keep in mind here is that most 144hz monitors also have a 120hz mode for solving the 30/60fps pulldown jitter for games/media that don't support 24fps or a number evenly divisible by 144 (like 72 or 48fps).</p>
<p>I currently run my monitor in 120hz mode because I can then watch/play the most common frame-rates (24/30/60) without any pulldown jitter, whilst targeting 120fps for modern games. There are a multitude of video games that do not support frame-rates above 60fps (any Bethesda game, Dark Souls 3, Amnesia, etc) which means playing it on a 144hz panel will induce pulldown jitter (unless G-sync/freesync is enabled and supported... and even that is spotty).</p>
<p>120hz is great for multimedia usage (movies, youtube, gaming, video-editing) because it is evenly divisible into the most common frame-rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone buying a monitor these days, especially higher refresh rate, you need G-Sync/Freesync as they do so much. I have forgotten that stuttering and screen-tearing even exist and are issues others still face at this point, it feels like an issue of the past now with 144hz G-Sync.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that many programs do not utilize G-sync/Freesync correctly or at all.</p>
<p>For instance, VLC and MPC media players (along with web browsers... so YouTube and any other web media player) do not engage G-sync or Freesync, so your monitor is at 144hz despite the 30 or 60fps content being played on screen... which causes the pulldown jitter.</p>
<p>The same can be said with games that cap at 60fps. Gsync can sometimes reign in the refresh rate, but often it will jump from 57hz to 62hz and back causing additional stutter, where locking the game to 60fps with V-sync and setting the monitor to 120hz (or 60hz) solves the problem.</p></div>		</li>
