			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that helps me is this word 'game' (literally the only LPT ive seen thats been helpful):</p>
<p>Basically, go through the alphabet and for every letter, think of three words. Do it slowly, like a word per breath.</p>
<p>I normally fall asleep by the time i get around 's' or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One that I like to do is try to remember and list as many of a certain ‚Äúthing‚Äù as possible, like as many Beatles songs as I can or as many Pok√©mon as I can. When there‚Äôs a lot of the thing, eventually my brain just starts to get disengaged by it and drifts off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try counting backwards by threes starting at 300. It's just awkward enough that you have to concentrate but not so hard or interesting that you're straining. Keeps your mind from drifting to stressful things but doesn't keep you awake. I rarely get below 201.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has been my technique too, and I rarely have trouble dropping off.  Mostly the first part, about not doing anything other than sleeping when I lie down in bed.  If I want to scroll Reddit or whatever on my phone, I do that in a chair first, <em>before</em> going to bed.</p>
<p>In the rare case that I can't fall asleep within 20 minutes (it's usually more like 3, so if I'm still awake after 20, something's up) then I get up and go do something for an hour or so, until I feel proper sleepy.  Then I'm out like a light when I do go back to bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find if I'm not asleep in 40 mins then I will have a REALLY bad night and usually not sleep for 2-3 hours.</p>
<p>But these days I fall asleep pretty quickly. I've got my facemask and my headphones in and it's like a switch for my brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  I was able to train myself to fall asleep within minutes of laying down.  It took years to do.  Meditation practices really helped.  You have to learn to turn your brain off and not reflect on your day, wonder about tomorrow, agonize over that dumb thing you did.  </p>
<p>Now I check that all of my muscles are relaxed and just fall asleep.  If I am preoccupied and thinking about something I usually recognize that and make myself mentally say &quot;sleep&quot; with every exhale.  It works in a few minutes.  </p>
<p>The only things in my bedroom are my bed, a night stand, and a chest of blankets.  I never use my phone or read in bed.  Sleeping only.</p></div>		</li>
