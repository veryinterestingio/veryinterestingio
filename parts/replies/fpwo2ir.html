			<div class="markdown"><p>No,</p>
<p>Penicillin G (natural kind that comes directly from the wild fungus) is for intramuscular injection only. It likely isn’t taken orally because its chemical structure isn’t conducive to being absorbed into the bloodstream, or it is broken down by our digestive system.</p>
<p>The V type that is taken orally is a derivative that is manufactured from mutated Penicillin strains that don’t occur in the wild.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you have a bacterial infection, and do end up eating bread contaminated with the penicillin bacteria/fungus as you describe, does the penicillin have the capacity to still function in a medicinal way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to that question is yes.  It most certainly DOES have the <em>capacity</em> to function in a <em>medicinal</em> way. You can add effective rates being pretty poor or whatever else you want, like it's not good for you, could do more harm than good, or whatever else, but the answer is yes.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that you started with &quot;No&quot; and then used &quot;likely can't&quot;.</p>
<p>I have a hard time accepting someone's answer when they use a definitive and then later use non absolute terms. If you are going to make assumptions and suppositions, don't use definitives to do so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The V type that is taken orally is a derivative that is manufactured from mutated Penicillin strains that don’t occur in the wild.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just for the record, even aside from the specific targeting you did from a question with a generic premise, that means absolutely nothing. I am not a biologist or a virologist but even I know what a derivative means.  Refinement of something does not negate the viability of the original.  This is like suggesting Tylenol doesn't work because extra strength Tylenol was developed. It's also worth noting that even before V was developed penicillin was taken orally. It wasn't originally found and then sat on a shelf until they figured out how to inject it intramuscularly.  Since then, yes, they have refined it and newer strains/versions have been refined but again, that does not negate the original positive effects it had... orally.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s worth pointing out that the bacteria that eats meat, for example, isn’t just trying to kill off competing bacteria. It has evolved to eliminate as much competition as possible, which includes rats, coyotes, birds, and lions. In other words, some of the toxins are strong enough to make big animals (like us) sick or dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good ELI5 answer but I would like to also add that toxins come in many varieties.  The toxins themselves can be broken down by other microbes or heat or other processes.  Many toxins are not heat stable and given the right amount of time and temperature they will break down and no longer be toxic.  So technically even the toxins could be &quot;negated&quot; by microwaving.Now we get to the more interesting part, bacteria and fungi can make spores/endospores that can be much more tolerant than the organism itself.  Think of it like a seed that can withstand drying out but still germinate later.  These endospores often are much more likely to tolerate heat, UV and disinfectants/medications.  So when you get food poisoning there are three routes of infection (or a combination of them occurring).  </p>
<ol>
<li>Bacteria/fungi is alive in the food and gets in your gut and makes you sick by creating toxins.</li>
<li>Bacteria/fungi has been killed by cooking but the toxins are still present in high enough concentrations to make you feel ill.</li>
<li>Bacteria/fungi and their resulting toxins are not in high enough concentrations to harm you but their endospores exist and germinate in your gut or after cooking the food and multiply to a high enough concentration to make you vomit and poop at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why do I know so much about this?  I am a mycologist and once got so badly food poisoned I lost 15 lbs in 2 weeks and was one of the &quot;worst cases&quot; my doctors had ever seen.  So for the next 3 months of recovery I read a lot and saw many internists and dietitians and discussed these topics at length.  Also... probiotics are a scam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The right probiotic works for the right indication. Not all probiotics work for all indications, and not all probiotics work for different indications. None of the supplements are regulated, and if you're lucky enough to get one that actually contains what it says on the label, many end up delivering bacteria to the small intestine, not the large intestine, where they can cause Small Intestinal Bacteria Overgrowth and brain fogginess.</p>
