			<div class="markdown"><p>Napalm also is oil based so if you try to rub it off it just spreads additionally it had been used to ignite over the top of trenches using up all the oxygen in the area and suffocating those in the trenches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Napalm is actually not really banned. It's present in various agreements but generally its use is only prohibited against civilians.</p>
<p>When Obama ratified the CCW which includes this prohibition, a reservation  was made which suspends the treaty's application in any situation where it is believed civilian lives will be saved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same goes for WP. WP is a dual use system, for either a smoke screen, or for lighting the target on fire.</p>
<p>WP can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>in all areas (including civilian) for smoke</li>
<li>against the enemy not near civilians as an incidiary</li>
</ul>
<p>WP can not be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>as an incindiary against civilians or in an area known to have civilians</li>
</ul>
<p>Context is <strong>extremely</strong> important, yet so many skip over context, and go for all or nothing labels, which is in fact false.</p></div>		</li>
