			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation, but just one correction, I don't think the wavelengths change with respect to each other. The wavelength will change inside the thin film, yes, but it will change back to it's original wavelength upon exiting the thin film, so upon exiting, the wave reflected from the surface and the wave reflected from the back of the film will have the same wavelength, just with a phase shift that causes either constructive or destructive interference. </p>
<p>Edit: The wavelengths would change if the wave undergoes Compton scattering within the film, but in that case the reflected waves would no longer be coherent and probably wouldn't interfere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what happens when the thickness is uniform:</p>
<p><a href="https://gfycat.com/BrokenHappyColt" target="_blank">https://gfycat.com/BrokenHappyColt</a></p>
<p>There is no effect from a swirly pattern due to varying thickness, but there is still a rainbow pattern since the light hitting the surface and bouncing towards the camera is doing so at gradually steeper angles along the surface, giving a gradient of colors based on the different colors' indexes of refraction (how much they bend when traveling through a prism). Notice how when the person filming holds the surface perpendicular to the camera's view, the image sort of &quot;comes into focus&quot; and loses the rainbow pattern. This is because the different indexes of refraction of the different colors of light have no effect when the angle of incidence (how the light hits the surface) is ~90 degrees. Light is bouncing off of their face and camera, going to the surface, then bouncing straight back with the colors in relatively the same places, leaving the image intact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The light is bouncing from different angles, so the thickness of oil that the light must travel through to reach your eyes is different from different places on the surface of the water/oil.</p>
<p>(This is responsible for the regular prismatic effect you see, not actual variations in oil thickness. Variations in oil thickness are responsible for the irregularities in the pattern.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not uniform thicknss which causes the wave to be at different phases upon exiting, the actual wavelength stays the same when it comes back out, just the interference changes due to the differing phases</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite, the thickness won't effect the wavelength. The thickness controls the path difference. If the path difference is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength, than we get constructure interference. If it's a half-integer multiple then we'll get destructive interference. So the thickness will determine which wavelengths interfere constructively and destructively, but the thickness of the film has no effect on the wavelength of an individual wave.
So the nonuniformity of the oil thin film will simply make destructive/constructive interference occur for different wavelengths in different parts of the film. </p>
<p>It's easier to understand if you consider a monochromatic wave (so just one wavelength). The wavelength will change inside the film, but return to its original wavelength upon exiting the film. The wavelength is not changed because of the thicknesses. But complete constructive/destructive interference can only happen for intenger/half-integer multiples of the wavelength.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Multiple angles of refraction. The angle of refraction also depends on the density of the medium. Surely the inconsistency of the thickness in the medium cause the colours, like when a rainbow forms due to the light being refracted at different angles due to a rain drops shape?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The angle of refraction depends on the refractive index of the medium (which is related to density), the incident wavelength and the incident angle of light. For a given wavelength and a given incident angle,  the angle of refraction will be the same regardless of thickness because the refractive index is a constant throughout the film (assuming there is no index gradient). The colours you see are caused by constructive/destructive interference. The variation in thickness of an oil film is what causes the swirly rainbow pattern, because at a given viewing angle, which wavelengths interfere constructively/destructively at that angle is dependent on the thickness. </p></div>		</li>
