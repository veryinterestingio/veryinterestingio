<p>For instance, if some change makes you better at surviving in the cold, but you live in a hot climate, it likely won’t get passed on. In a cold climate, it could be very useful.</p>

<p>Is this necessarily true though? I know very little about genetics, but isn't only if the gene is disadvantageous it won't get passed on? For example, if the gene that made it survive the cold made it suffer in the heat, it would be bred out, but if it didn't affect surviving in the heat whatsoever, it will still get bred on? If having the gene doesn't decrease it's chances of survival, it can continue to propagate in the gene pool right? Or is there something more to it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re absolutely right. It would be passed on in the short term to the immediate offspring, but the genes wouldn’t propagate to the rest of the population like they would if they helped. In an isolated environment, they may propagate, which is why we see really weird adaptations on islands the ISS bacteria no doubt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How different are two random individuals in a bacteria colony? Are they much more similar than we see in, say, a pack of animals? To use an example, humans/animals have different eye colors, and those eye colors are still around even after thousands and thousands of years. It's either a disadvantageous gene nor an advantageous gene, but all the eye colors still exist and haven't left the pool of genes. Is there similar type of genes in bacteria, or are they more selective and can somehow detect superior genes since their genes matter a lot more?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A single gene could help an organism cope with both heat and cold. For example many of the genes that help plants cope with drought can also help with freezing. Especially useful in deserts, where temperatures swing from hot to cold and are dry. </p>
<p>However, these genes may be “expensive” in terms of slowing growth in mild, humid, fertile climates like a rainforest, where hospitable conditions allow plants to grow fast, and the ones that don’t expend energy on unnecessary stuff are more likely to outgrow their neighbors. </p>
<p>Genes can be beneficial in one context and neutral in another, so they hang around for a long time (like a vestigial organ), but there may be a slight pressure to gradually, over a very long period, lose that gene due to very small energy expenditures or random mutations that don’t get weeded out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, and so is the statement you were wondering about. Note the original statement said 'likely wont' and 'could be'.  There are no absolutes, just general trends and competing evolutionary pressures. Things might completely disappear over time, or they may simply be supressed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but &quot;likely won't&quot; implies a tendency to get rid of the gene, a more than 50% chance to not pass it on. My question is, is that necessarily true? Do bacteria actively remove genes that have no negative side effects, even if there isn't necessarily a positive one? A net zero affect. Because humans don't, or else we would all have the same eye color</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good way to think about it. &quot;Species&quot; are technically defined by a few different things but mainly their DNA and whatever makes them unique from their most closely related species. So for instance, the difference between giraffe species is mainly assessed by where they live and what that population of giraffes has that is different from populations of giraffes elsewhere - Northern giraffes live in the northern part, and they have been found to be genetically distinct from Southern giraffes who live in the south because those populations of giraffes (which once upon a time were all much more genetically similar, a proto-giraffe if you will) diverged long enough ago that those that live in the northern part are considered a different species than the south even if they look very similar. Another species of giraffe, the reticulated giraffe, is considered a third species because their population also diverged and happened to evolve with a distinct reticulated coat pattern. But if you want to keep drawing finer and finer distinctions, there are also subspecies of these giraffe species, and honestly each individual giraffe is genetically distinct unless they are literal clones. So a new species of giraffe could be evolving as we speak, where an individual giraffe is born with a mutation that happens to allow it to go longer without water or have a better camouflaged coat pattern than its counterparts, and if that giraffe reproduces enough generations to create a separate population of Different giraffes that all have that trait or coat pattern, that population could then be considered a new species of giraffe. But it ultimately came from existing giraffes that happened to have a mutation that was better suited to changes in the environment so it proliferated. And those existing giraffes came from a proto-giraffe, which came from a proto-mammal, which came from a lungfish I think. The same applies to bacteria, only on a much faster scale. The species on the ISS are probably &quot;new&quot; species in that they do not exist on earth, because they have evolved to reflect their unique environment. It is also true that we do not have a catalogue of every single bacterial species on earth, and sometimes we find crazy things in places we did not expect like deep sea bacteria genes in samples taken from human bellybuttons, but that is more reflective of the super fast evolution and incredible diversity of bacteria.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tl;dr, The species on the ISS are probably &quot;new&quot; species in that they do not exist on earth, because they have evolved to reflect their unique environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this the reason bacteria change their DNA a lot is how fast and often they can divide. Each time they do this their DNA has to split and recombine into 2 separate strands, one for each cell. Each time DNA is copied this way there is a  chance for error, those errors can manifest as mutations and when those mutations are advantageous you and up with a new strain able to compete with the other microorganisms in thr environment.</p></div>		</li>
