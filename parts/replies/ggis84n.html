			<div class="markdown"><p>If we were to inject and dissolve oxygen into your blood, you wouldn't get much damage in space except for stomach cramps from passing gas. Suffocation kills you and the most you get from a sudden depressurization from 1atm to 0atm is ruptured ear drums.</p>
<p>The pressure differential from 1atm to 0atm is smaller than most people think. If your spacecraft gets punctured and has a small 1cm hole, you could plug it with your palm and not feel much pain at all.</p>
<p>Edit: On the other hand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byford_Dolphin" target="_blank">the explosive decompression of a diving bell</a> from 9 atmospheres caused the evisceration of one person and the death of 4 others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 atmosphere is about 15psi, which is still a lot of pressure if you think about it. A few square inches of surface area can add up to hundreds of pounds of pressure. You would still get serious pressure sickness if you depressurized yourself from 1atm to a vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen would boil out of your blood causing serious pressure sickness (a.k.a. &quot;the bends&quot;). If you tried to hold your breath it would cause internal injuries. You might also get bruising on any skin that's exposed to the vacuum (basically like getting a giant hicky all over your body). After a few seconds you'd lose consciousness and die. Afterwards your body would slowly freeze-dry as all the fluids evaporate.</p>
<p>Your best bet would be to let all the air escape from your lungs, and you might still have enough oxygen left in your blood to remain conscious for a couple of seconds, but that's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't try to hold your breath; you will fail and rupture your lungs removing any chance for resuscitation afterwards. All of the air will immediately evacuate your lungs and your rectum, your eyes will immediately become cold and dry due to the large water content in them, and your vision will also blur. Your eardrums will instantly rupture. Hypoxia sets in immediately, and you have about 15 seconds to do what you need to do. Trained fighter pilots can hold out under these scenarios for about 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The good news is, aside from the ruptured eardrums, you can be resuscitated in a pressurized environment for up to 3 minutes after the event without serious injury. Furthermore, if you recently lost consciousness (e.g. moved from one airlock to the other and passed out as the second one began pressurizing) you may even come to without any assistance. After about 3 minutes you will begin to suffer brain damage, and after about 10 minutes your chances for survival are slim-to-none.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely the thing that's going to kill you is the lack of pressure causing all the liquid in your body to boil? </p>
<p>Also, heat transfer through matter is called thermal conduction. I believe thermal radiation is exclusively the emission of electromagnetic radiation, which can happen in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation was the wrong word, good catch. General point should still hold up for a layman though ;)</p>
<p>And the boil thing is a myth, human bodies are durable enough that going to 0 pressure isn’t enough to the liquid to boil. You skin is strong enough to hold you at about the right volume, preventing liquid from reaching low enough density to boil. Your blood will freeze from heat loss before it boils from pressure. Close your eyes, though. Really don’t want your eyeballs contacting a vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body does have some internal pressure, which seems like it would prevent it from boiling immediately. I would imagine the same thing that happens to divers when they ascend too fast would happen though.</p>
<p>I don't know how fast it would kill you, but it would probably be the thing that you succumb to eventually.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Radiative heat transfer is a lot slower than conductive heat transfer at human body temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the scientifically-informed advice that I've been able to find on surviving explosive decompression or exposure to a vacuum is to let all the air leave your lungs to avoid serious injury, and you'll have a few seconds of useful consciousness left to try to save yourself somehow.  </p>
<p>If you used an oxygen tank and scuba mask you would pressurize your lungs, which wouldn't be good. Unless somehow your lungs were still able to extract enough oxygen from air that's at near-vaccum pressure. I know the atmosphere inside the Apollo spacecraft was pressurized to around 5psi, or 1/3rd of atmospheric pressure at sea level, and that's probably enough to cause some serious injuries if you pumped your lungs up to that pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The apollo astronauts only wore their EVA suits (the suits they wore on the moon) while they were outside the space craft on the surface of the moon, which was only for a few hours. Inside the space craft they just wore regular jumpsuits. During the launch and re-entry part of the flight they wore flight suits (those suits with the fishbowl helmets) which are not actual space suits.  </p>
<p>So for most of the flight they just wore regular clothes. The EVA suits were just for EVAs, and the flight suits were just for launch and reentry.</p></div>		</li>
