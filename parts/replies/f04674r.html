			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! Your eyes are protected by the law of conservation of etendue.  Alternatively, consider the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Either of them imply that you cannot (passively, eg with lenses or mirrors) magnify the moon to make something brighter than the surface of the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct in what you say, but it's not applicable to this situation. </p>
<p>Yes, you can't make something brighter than the surface of the moon, however you can view more of the moon's light. If someone shines a flashlight at you from across the field during daytime, you will barely notice. If someone puts the light in front of your eye, it will hurt. You're no longer taking in UV radiation or the bright reflected sunlight, but now you have the entirety of the flashlight light going into your eye. </p>
<p>It's not brighter, but there's a lot more of it, which has approximately the same effect.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>&quot;more light&quot; in this discussion is the same as &quot;brighter light.&quot;</p>
<p>Light is photons.  You can crank-up the energy either by having more of them (brighter), or by having each photon carry more energy (bluer).  There <em>are</em> passive ways to do the later (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-harmonic_generation" target="_blank">frequency doubling</a>), but in the context of this thread, everyone is talking about the first thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually <em>is</em> how it works, but it's a fairly obscure fact. I never ran into in my optics course, e.g. In fact, I had to learn the term &quot;etendue&quot; from a webcomic years later... But here goes:</p>
<p>Argument that should convince you (which the other commenter just brushed off with a reference to the 2nd law of thermodynamics): Suppose that you are alone in a dark universe aside from a blackbody emitting light at some temperature, T.  You allow yourself to come into thermal equilibrium with the blackbody. And you're a sphere, so you also wind up at the temperature, T. Then imagine you place a lens between you and the blackbody, focusing light onto a spot on your spherical self. If the &quot;brightness&quot; (not a technical term, actually, but let's roll with it) that spot &quot;sees&quot; is greater than the brightness of the original object, then surely that patch of your spherical self is receiving a larger number of Watts per square meter, right? More than it was before? Surely then its (local) temperature will increase. To try to anticipate your objection--fine, the temperature of the rest of your sphere can decrease since the lens &quot;stole&quot; light that would have hit elsewhere. That doesn't solve the real problem--that lens is transferring thermal energy between two objects (the emitting blackbody and a patch of you) at the same temperature without doing any work.</p>
<p>edit: Perhaps part of what rubs you the wrong way about what they said is that you're reading more into it than they really meant. They said you can't make the Moon appear brighter than it would if you <em>pressed your eye up to its surface</em>--not that you can't make it appear brighter than it looks to the naked eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds silly and wrong. It's like basically looking into a magnifying glass, you know, the one you can use to burn stuff with using the Sun. Same principle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm happy to make the same argument for the sun if you think that you can refute that.  </p>
<p>Using a magnifying glass to focus the sun's light, you cannot make a spot brighter than <em>the surface of the sun</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely stared at the moon through my 10 inch Dob a couple of times. Never noticed any effect and it didn’t hurt.  Wondering if it’s true that this could cause long term damage. I doubt it but it sounds halfway plausible. Any ophthalmologists in the house?</p></div>		</li>
