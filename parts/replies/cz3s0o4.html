			<div class="markdown"><p>I read another comment in a different thread a while back where some scientists are out on a pacific island in the mid 90s, and they are chatting to a local tribe about ancient ritual cannibalism that occured there. At one point one of the scientists asks &quot;Do you know what the tastiest part of the human was supposed to be?&quot;, meaning, 'were there any records?'. </p>
<p>Before anyone could stop him, a seven-year-old child yells out &quot;The palm of the hand tastes best!&quot;. So yeah, that was happening until at least the 90s... </p>
<p>Incidentally, a lot of Redditors also stated that the small of the back was the 'fillet mignon of people'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The remark about the 'fillet mignon of people' is more of an anatomical remark than cannibalistic.  </p>
