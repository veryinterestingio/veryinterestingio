<p>That's why most lossy compression is applied to media content (ie. audio and images).

For example take a 500 page book and scan through it to find the 3 most commonly used words.
Then replace those words with place holders so 'the' becomes $, etc
Put an index at the front of the book that translates those symbols to words.
Now the book contains exactly the same information as before, but now it's a couple dozen pages shorter. This is the basics of how file compression works. You find duplicate data in a file and replace it with pointers.
The upside is reduced space usage, the downside is your processor has to work harder to inflate the file when it's needed.</code></pre>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can't compress it, but I can clue you in to a battle mechanic that is unique to the Emerald fight. </p>
<p>Short story: Each character should have max HP and no more than 8 materia equipped, though less than 8 may still be advisable.</p>
<p>Slightly longer story: One of Emerald's attacks is &quot;Aire Tam Storm&quot; which does flat (ignores armor and resistances) 1111 damage for each materia the character has equipeed. So if you have 9 materia equipped, it's a one-shot unblockable insta-kill, since you can't have more than 9999 HP. </p>
<p>So having all characters equipped with less than 9 is almost essential.</p>
<p>See &quot;Aire Tam&quot; backwards!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really sarcasm, I just wanted to demonstrate it for others. But I didn't work it out for my own benefit, I am already semi-familiar with the concept of data compression.  </p>
<p>I counted occurrences of &quot;the&quot; in OP's original post and knew immediately it would wind up being a bit shorter. It was funny to me to apply the technique described on the text that describes the technique. In a way, it's a bit like a quine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>edit: 624<em>ish</em></p>
<p>was 638 a typo? Yours showed as 628 for me. I tried to account for a difference in newlines. I am using \r\n, but if you were just using \n, that would not explain the difference</p>
<p>Edit: I give up, the reddit editor makes it really hard to do this cleanly and get the count correct. Things are getting mangled when copy/pasting from the browser</p></div>		</li>
