			<div class="markdown"><p>Coming from a computer architecture perspective. We have Caches which when they get filled up tend to evict the oldest (usually) data. Is the memory store of the immune system infinite? Do we know how much it is? Can we take the body through so many infections that it forgets some and then repopulate the immune system with only those that we want? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'memory' of the immune system is literally just populations of memory T-cells floating around in your bloodstream, with each clonal line of cells recognizing one antigen. Once the memory T-cells are formed, they kinda just... exist until they slowly die off and leave you vulnerable to the disease again.</p>

<p>So no, there's no kind of centralized memory here with finite capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm.. So, is there a finite store of t cells in the body? If yes, do they prefer the last viral infection to keep track of? If yes, then we can keep infecting with multiple viruses (dead / mild forms) in each sitting (sort of like chemo sessions). So that, at one point the auto immune disease is fixed. Rather than reset the immune system by killing it all off. </p>
<p>Sorry if this sounds stupid.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some ways there IS a finite capacity as there is only enough space in your body for a certain number of T cells. You want them to be as diverse as possible to protect you from many things but once the “niche” reaches capacity, what then? Do you start to lose older cells first? I think with measles it wipes out many of the existing T cells and when they repopulate they are only specific for measles until the host is able to build up diversity again through exposure to pathogens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I can get, it’s more like a multi-platform botnet that can learn new systems. It doesn’t have memory, cause it self replicates to spread. Each strand of the botnet only works on 1 platform, ie disease, but will replicate more when it comes into contact with it.</p>
<p>So it gets rid of diseases by just having a large portion of the immune system doing f*** all and waiting for their turn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably finite but staggeringly huge so that it doesn't matter. Even before getting into immunology itself, you only need a small amount of &quot;bits&quot; to be able to encode way more information than we can likely overload the immune system with. The amount of diseases it could identify and remember- using just a few parameters- has to be significantly higher than thousands or hundreds of thousands, and that's a LOW estimate from me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There has been research into fasting, and low calorie diets as a way to reset the immune system in relation to diabetes.  Apparently the immune system also resets if it's not seeing new food for a while.  Which makes sense, if you think that throughout most of evolutionary history, &quot;we&quot; would have found a food source, used it up, moved on when it ran out, starved for a few days (or more), and then found a different food source, with potentially different bacteria and viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been thinking about this, and I think it depends on whether or not the autoimmune disease has a genetic component (which we’re finding out that quite a few do). This is because it would determine how likely you would be to just get the disease again. If it wasn’t genetic, you probably would be able to “cure” the disease (if the measles virus wiped out ALL of the autoreactive memory cells), because the likelihood that the random combination of VDJ that caused the autoimmune response in the first place is pretty minute. But if the autoimmune disease was genetic, I’d posit that the likelihood of you getting the autoimmune disease again is pretty high. That’s not to say that you couldn’t be lucky and never encounter the original thing that set off the autoimmune disease in the first place ever again, but in the case of autoimmune diseases that are “caused” by very common things, you’d probably just develop it again.</p></div>		</li>
