			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not fully understood what causes them but I think of them as mini-seizures. This is not scientific but my personal theory is that something goes wrong in the central nervous system but there are additional safety mechanisms that make sure no full blown seizure occurs. Since myoclonus is a common side-effect in epilepsy I’m thinking that a person with only essential myoclonus has some overlapping characteristics but not all of them which prevents anything else from happening but these involuntary little jerks. They usually do not progress or get worse at all but I wonder if someone who has them may be more likely to suffer an actual seizure if many triggers align such as sleep deprivation/alcohol/bright lights/drugs. This is all speculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a really strong theory. Since I'm pretty sure not everyone experiences these shivers do you know what type of biological difference would cause a person to have them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have those involuntary heavy shivers from time to time (4-5 times a year maybe?) but never had any seizure, never fainted from heat or any other reason, dont drink/drugs and have seen really intense light shows that have big seizure warnings with no problems. I always took them as a kind of yawn. As its involuntary but you have no power over when/how it happens. Glad to know Im not the only one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Old folk tale that I heard was because it was someone walking over your future grave.</p>
<p>I happen to enjoy “frisson”, I think it’s called, when listening to certain music. Usually a small shiver accompanied by goosebumps on the arms, and if it’s strong enough, the legs. I say enjoy, because it’s a pleasurable sensation to me.</p></div>		</li>
