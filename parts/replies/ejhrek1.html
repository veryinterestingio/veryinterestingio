			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously perfect answer!!! </p>
<p>Some interesting related facts: </p>
<p>Originally the fusion bombs tested by the US pre-castle_bravo_incident... we used a tungsten-carbide tamper and the scientists tried U238 because they assumed it would be more efficient due to its atomic mass.</p>
<p>Because fission neutrons can have a spectrum of energies it is possible that a Uranium atom will emit very high energy neutrons which will easily fission U238. The rate of birth of those is low so no chain reaction... but because the excitation energy to binding energy of U238 results in energies like 1.7MeV regular fast neutrons can fission U238 nuclei. Now, there is a flux breaking point where the total number of U238 fissions produce high enough flux to result in a chain reaction purely run on U238.
In the case of a 3-stage fusion bomb it is actually possible to use D-T fusion to just initiate a U238 only chain reaction... this effect actually accelerates the neutron doubling time... this is because the neutrons that can cause U238 fission would no longer be linearly dependent on the neutron resulting from fusion... this makes the U238 burn up more efficenct and results in an even bigger bomb.</p>
<p>Last: after the 50Mt mark of a bomb you start to see diminishing returns because the larger the bomb the more energy is directed vertically... so the blast starts to look more and more like a taller and taller cylinder.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The third picture shows the explosion peaking through the clouds. So much of that energy is &quot;wasted&quot; going straight up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit of a critique on the description in the album. OP notes how it didn't leave a scar and ultimately nature does away with it. Tsar Bomba was an air burst and pretty high up at that. If it had detonated at ground level it would have left an impressive crater. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funnily enough, you can actually make nuclear shaped charges, which concentrate their blast in a (relatively)  small area, and propagate largely wherever the bomb is faced. Take a look at the Orion project for a nuclear propelled rocket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really, long before that - the early multi-megaton hydrogen bombs were made that large mainly because the delivery methods at the time were so inaccurate that you needed such a large yield to ensure the target is destroyed.</p>
<p>With the high accuracy of modern ICBMs with MIRVs, warhead designers have instead focused on making the warheads smaller and more efficient, and settled on somewhere around a few hundred kilotons of yield as a probable optimum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Having much more accuracy and good intelligence of the area makes nukes pretty much pointless these days (at least with our smaller scale proxy wars and fights against insurgents). Having knowledge of all the targets and where they are exactly and being able to accurately hit all of them trumps pretty much everything else with a bigger boom. Nukes filled the gap when we were carpet bombing cities and areas, but now it's more efficient to hit the two or three buildings in that city that you know contain targets.</p>
<p>The biggest boon to modern warfare is probably our drone technology and surveillance. I'm sure things would change dramatically if there was a real WW3 head-on US versus Russia or something, but for now nukes are pretty much just to scare other countries from invading or nuking us.</p>
<p>Not to mention the whole world would turn on you if you used nukes now. They were kind of a one time use thing and then MAD after... hopefully it stays that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also a question of ease of delivery.  You can make arbitrarily high-yield thermonuclear bombs (multiple secondaries), but they get bulky and heavy quick which makes delivery a problem.  There was discussion about making a gigaton-yield bomb, but it just would never have been practical.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's also a followup book, &quot;Dark Sun: The Making Of The Hydrogen Bomb&quot; which I've not yet read, but is on the list.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both those books kick ass, but the first one - I was really stunned towards the end, when it got more philosophical, with things like the evolution of weapons, the &quot;nation of war dead&quot; idea, and how we've moved from the battlefield combatants to civilians/non-combatants and how war has evolved to keep everyone in low-level terror. No wonder it was Nat. Book Award and Pulitzer prize winner. </p></div>		</li>
