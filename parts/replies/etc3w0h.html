This is why large speakers are needed for low frequency sounds, and smaller speakers for higher frequencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And for the exception that proves the rule, you have &quot;long throw&quot; woofers, which use a smaller area (say 5&quot; cone instead of 8-10-12&quot;) and make up for it with an unusually long travel, to get the same overall air moved.  More compact and lower mass, but creates a new set of engineering challenges hence not as common.</p></div>		</li>
