			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry! I've added a little warning &amp; the book title. Hopefully I didn't cause too many mobile users to burn through their data plan.</p>
<p>It really is a great book. Even in you are reasonably versed on the subject it's a great example of how complicated subjects can be explained in a fun and understandable way.</p></div>		</li>
