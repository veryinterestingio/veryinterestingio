			<div class="markdown"><p>I still am not sure if I understand about &quot;relative time&quot; from the simultaneous lightning strikes thought experiment.</p>
<p>He says 3 clocks are synchronized and the time of an event is defined as the position of the hands of the clock <strong>in the immediate vicinity of that event</strong>, not as measured by an observer between two events. An observer could verify that the events are simultaneous by standing still at the midpoint. But that is not the only way to confirm it. So just because an observer not meeting this specific criteria sees two events happening non-simultaneously does not necessarily mean that time is relative.</p>
<p>If instead of lightning strikes, we saw pulses of light that carried an image of the clock faces in the vicinity of each event, we would certainly receive those pulses at different times, but could clearly see from all points of observation that the time as measured by the clock faces were identical and therefore the events were simultaneous regardless of our frame of reference.</p></div>		</li>
