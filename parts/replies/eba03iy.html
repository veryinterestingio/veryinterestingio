			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't they show the same if you calibrate the first to the gravitational pull at sea level and the other one to the gravitational pull at measurment level?</p>
<p>Asking because I learned in school that scales measure your force on them and convert that to mass using a pre-set value for your local g. </p>
<p>After all mass shouldnt change.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically I believe there is a measurable difference between your weight at the poles vs weight at the equator.  But it's very small.  I was taught this was due to equatorial bulge because of the earth's spin.  Someone correct me if I was fed bad information, I haven't had the opportunity to weigh myself in both locations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but there are other factors that might magnify or cancel it out.</p>
<p>If the plane is flying east you weigh less (and if west you weigh more) since your adding (or subtracting) from the centrifugal acceleration in the opposite direction of gravity due to the spin of the earth.</p>
<p>Your weight increases as you move away from the equator for the same fundamental reason - the centrifugal force from the rotation of the earth is lower.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does, depending on how deep underground you go.</p>

<p>It's complicated. And the question is actually quite a bit more interesting than the original question of this thread :)</p>
<p>First, lets assume that the Earth is of spherical shape and has a spherically symmetric density distribution (that is: the density only depends on how far down you go, not where on Earth you look). That's not entirely true, but it's close enough.</p>
<p>A powerful tool we use here is Newton's Shell Theorem. This is a theorem that makes 2 important statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Outside a spherically symmetric body (which includes a spherically symmetric mass density), the force of gravity is equal to what it would be if all the mass of that body were located at the center of the sphere.</p>
</li>
<li>Inside a hollow spherically symmetric sphere, the force of gravity is zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another important tool we need here is the principle of superposition of forces. If object A exerts force <strong>X</strong> and object B exerts force <strong>Y</strong>, then the combined force of objects A and B is <strong>X + Y</strong>.</p>
<p>From the second point of the shell theorem, we can immediately conclude that if we'd be located in a small hollow cavity at the center of the Earth, we'd be weightless, as the force of gravity is zero. So that's cool.</p>
<p>We know how much we weigh on the surface. But how about in between? Does it decrease gradually the further down we go?</p>
<p>Suppose we're at some distance <em>r</em> from the center of the Earth. Lets call the total radius of the Earth <em>R</em>. Now, we can imagine the Earth consisting of 2 parts: A sphere with radius <em>r</em> surrounded by a shell starting at <em>r</em> and extending to <em>R</em>. Essentially breaking the Earth up at the same distance from the center that we're at.</p>
<p>Now, from the principle of superposition, we can conclude that the total force of gravity is equal to the sum of the forces exerted by each of the two parts. But the shell theorem (2nd statement) tells us that the outer shell exerts no net gravity force. So as we dig down through the Earth, we can ignore everything that's above us (that is: further away from the center from the Earth than us).</p>
<p>And for the inner sphere, the first part of the shell theorem tells us that the force of gravity of this inner section is equal to whatever the force would be if all the mass of this part would be located at the center.</p>
<p>Now, suppose the Earth would have the same density from the core all the way to the surface. In that case, the mass is simply the volume times this constant density. The volume of a sphere is proportional to the third power of the radius. But gravity decreases by the square of the distance. So dividing these two out, we find that the force of gravity is proportional to the distance we are from the center. That would mean that as we dig down, our weight would decrease in a linear fashion from surface (normal weight) to center (weightless).</p>
<p>However, the density of the Earth is far from constant as we dig down. The crust far less dense than the inner core. Take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth#/media/File:RadialDensityPREM.jpg" target="_blank">this image</a> from Wikipedia that depicts the average density as function of distance from the center. You can see that there's a huge jump in density on the boundary between mantle and outer core.</p>
<p>That means that as we start digging from the crust through the mantle, we're digging through relatively low density material, leaving most of the mass still beneath us, in the core. I haven't done the calculations, but judging from this density profile, I would expect that as we start digging, we gradually increase in weight, reaching a peak at or near the mantle/core boundary, at which point our weight would decrease until we reached weightlessness in the center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, I believe you (and Newton) but I'm having a little bit of trouble intuiting the 2nd part of the theorem.  It makes easy sense if you are at the center of the shell, since the entire mass of the shell is pulling at you in all directions equally ( =&gt; no net force).  A little harder for me to picture as you move away from the center... when you move away, you are closer to some of the mass and farther from more of the mass... I guess because it's a sphere, the amount of mass &quot;further away&quot; grows fast enough to evenly counterbalance the &quot;getting closer&quot; to the smaller amount of mass in the direction you moved?  Or something like that?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>ETA: Ah, yes... the force from the far-side mass is decreasing with the square of the radius, but the <em>amount</em> of mass (\~ to the surface area) at that distance is (hand-waving the calculus a bit) <em>increasing</em> with the square of the radius.  Likewise, the force from the closer mass is growing with the square of the radius, but the <em>amount</em> of mass at that closer distance is <em>decreasing</em> with the square of the radius.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Right?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can understand how forces cancel while you're at the center of Earth, but if you're e.g. at R/2 the situation isn't symmetrical anymore, you have a larger mass towards center and a smaller mass towards outside, pulling in opposite direction. So how can we ignore that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s slightly more complicated than that (and also different than what the other reply said unless I’m reading that one incorrectly). Yes, you’ll have more mass attracting you in different directions. You’d also be closer to the remaining mass closer to the core though. Considering the density of the core is significantly greater than the density of the crust and mantle, this would probably make a significant difference. I’m not sure which factors win out at what depths. If you wanted to know for sure, you’d probably have to go back and do some calculus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume at the poles so you don't slide along one side. At the equator you'd go from like 1500 km/hour one way to 1500 km/hour the other way and the friction would be kinda rough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the jump. If you jumped up, you might just have enough velocity to make it out on the other side, and might not. If you jumped in a tunnel on top of a mountain, and exited from the tunnel at sea level, you might go a mile or more into the air before you came down to a hard landing because of earth's rotation.</p></div>		</li>
