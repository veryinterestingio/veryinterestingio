They told him that he was not qualified to make that call. He said OK but the body is right here and his head is over there.</p></div>		</li>

Anybody who died on the Parliamentary estate would have their death registered as having occurred at St. Thomas's hospital just over the river.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said.
When my mother was in her last days, the hospice nurse drilled into our heads that we should speak very carefully near her for 15 to 30 minutes after she stopped breathing. Even when all the criteria above are present, there is still enough uncertainty that we did not want her last experience being the revelation she is dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My Dad died last year from a lung disease.  </p>
<p>We hung out all day joking and talking about old times.  Later in the afternoon he said, &quot;it's time.&quot;  After a huge dose of morphine put him to sleep they took him off the ventilator.</p>
<p>Basically he suffocated --no oxygen got to his brain.  He had a moment there where he sat up and tried to hold on, but his eyes rolled back and he sank into the bed.  </p>
<p>About a half hour later he completely stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 'ol heart just kept on going.  All other life monitoring signals were flat line, but the ticker kept ticking.</p>
<p>After about an hour we realized we better go get the head nurse.  He's gone, but the heart isn't going to stop.</p>
<p>Pacemaker kept it going.</p></div>		</li>

<p>“What if I die, and my heart keeps beating?”</p>
<p>Umm .. that’s actually what will happen until they turn it off.</p>
<p>“But I don’t want to be dead and feel my heart still beating”</p>
<p>Well .. you won’t .. because you’ll be dead</p>
<p>“But what if I can still feel the heart beating?”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely accurate. A lack of pupillary response isn’t the criteria for brain death. You need to lack all your brain stem reflexes: pupils, corneal, cough, gag, oculocephalic &amp; spontaneous breathing. In order to confirm brain death there are very strict criteria that differ from state to state (and even hospital to hospital), but the absence of the above reflexes is always a part of it. </p>
<p>Someone can be legally dead and still have a pulse, also. If someone had a catastrophic brain injury and is brain dead, but the heart is still beating, they can be legally dead. This is how organ procurement takes place. The legally dead person with the beating heart is taken to have their organs harvested. Since the organs are still being perfused with blood, they are still viable. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad had a massive intracranial haemorrhage and had fixed dilated pupils, but was not technically 'brain dead'. He could cough and gag and had spontaneous breathing aided by a nasopharyngeal airway after we elected to take him off the vent. He died a few days after extubation, he may not have been been brain dead, but he would not have had any reasonable quality of life nor probably consciousness so we let him go. Sound bizarre but it was helpful to us that he had had a smaller haemorraghe a few years before and we all recall seeing that on the scan, which in comparison was tiny, and knowing how much that small area of bleed had changed his life. So that when we saw how massive this one was in comparison, we knew he was already 'gone'. Unfortunately we were unable to donate his organs. RIP Dad x</p></div>		</li>
