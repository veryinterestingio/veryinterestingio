			<div class="markdown"><p>This is becoming a hindrance during our vacations (we go on a lot of cruises). Originally, I considered it a feature - work couldn't get ahold of me unless they wanted to shell out absurd amounts of money per minute for Internet or even voice (shore-to-ship calls at that time - early 2000s - were something like $17.50 per minute)!</p>
<p>But these days, since I have gigabit Internet to my house, I rely on the Internet a bunch more; I basically stream everything I need whenever I'm away from home from my home network.</p>
<p>Our income has increased considerably as well, so we can now afford the absurd rates on the cruise ship for Internet access. But it's 250-500kbps on average, if you see a megabit you're really fortunate. So these days I bring about 2 terabytes on USB/Flash media with us, and burn a few blu-rays, so I have access to whatever chunks we're currently into from my Plex library (I know, I know - why pay to sit on a boat and watch the same TV you watch at home? Because I'm neurotic).</p>
<p>I wish the cruise lines were more attentive to their more technical customers. I wouldn't mind paying a surcharge for access to an updated satellite connection that could at least give me multiple megabits. Netflix on a cruise ship would be amazing.</p></div>		</li>
