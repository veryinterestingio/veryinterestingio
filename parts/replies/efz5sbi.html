			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like the same thing when swimming in the Dead Sea. When I went there they warned us not to shave or anything for at least a day or so before hand because of all the salt. Luckily I didn’t get any water in my eyes either but I did get some in my mouth and it tasted like acid. It was awful 10/10 do not recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is very relaxing but caused one hell of a nosebleed the next day for me, due to the salt I assume. Likely dried out my nasal area. Normally I average maybe one nose bleed per year or something like that, but it gave me 3 the day after. </p></div>		</li>
