			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s because a huge percentage of the world’s shipping was British when the Greenwich meridian was globally agreed. So our hours are aligned to that longitude, or are offset by a whole number of hours from it (with a few half and quarter hour zones). But the exact seconds are now measured based on UTC instead of GMT, and the worldwide atomic clocks used are coordinated in Paris, not London.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But getting people all on the same page with clocks was actually secondary to the real goal of synchronized time. The big benefit was the ability to accurately calculate position. Specifically longitude. Sailors could calculate latitude and had been for ages, the problem was how to calculate how far east or west you were. So the Royal Navy crowdsourced (before crowdsourcing was the thing it was today) ideas and gave a prize to the winner:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_rewards" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude\_rewards" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude\_rewards</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>12 (and by extension also 60) is an easier number to evenly divide than 10. Twelve breaks into even halves, thirds, quarters, and sixths, where ten only breaks evenly into halves and fifths. So if you don’t have a calculator to easily do multiple digit decimals, a multiple of twelve makes for easier mental math in more situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like that’s the one incongruity that no one ever talks about.</p>
<p>Random Europeans: “Fun fact: The reason we use base 12 for our time is it divides perfectly into many ratios. Those ancient Greeks were truly brilliant!”</p>
<p>Americans: “We use Imperial measurements so there are 12 inches in a foot.”</p>
<p>Europeans: “REEEEEEEEE”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>multiple of 12.. like 24. Honestly, how often do you need to calculate time, multiply it or else.</p>
<p>If you reduce 12 AM &amp; 12 PM to the least that identifies the time it would be 12 A, 12 P or just 12 , 24 which is shorter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, that goes back to the Sumerians or Babylonians, who divided the day into 10 hours and the night into 10 hours, then added one hour for dawn and dusk to both day and night, totalling 24.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on a quick bit of Googling, they were responsible for the base-60 numbering system (Sumerians invented it, Babylonians adopted it for measurements) which we use for seconds and minutes. It was the Egyptians who first divided day and and night into 12 units each.</p></div>		</li>
