			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t make a difference whether you pick up or not, the call still connects either to you or your voicemail so they know it is active. It’s frustrating that you can’t really do anything to stop them, but at least on smartphones you can  get apps to help filter out spam calls.  Some are paid, though some carriers have free apps too. That way at least you aren’t inconvenienced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an old device for land line phones that would play the tones for a disconnected phone number any time you answered your phone. The theory was that the automated systems listened for those tones and would automatically hang up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As nobody is giving you the right answer I thought I'd explain. Most people doing this are actually far more advanced and detailed then you'd think. Systems will typically flag a number as human answered or machine answered. </p>
<p>Humans speak differently when recording an answering machine message as to how they speak when answering a call. Computers have been able to distinguish between these for decades already.</p>
<p>Also there's a bunch of different tones that can be played which give it away or you can use to fake out call centres. Putting the &quot;number disconnected&quot; tone at the start of any voice mail is one way to get yourself off a lot of lists.</p>
<p>The main thing to remember is spammers are in it for the money. While most people collecting numbers will flag all the differences and note it internally they may not pass that information on when selling the numbers they have. </p>
<p>This means that while they may make a note of &quot;answered by human&quot; vs &quot;answered by a machine&quot; it might not matter when they are selling their list. They may end up just grouping them all together and listing answered numbers. Or they may separate them based on what there buyer is looking for.</p>
<p>For example, someone offering a sale in your area might be happy with voice mail numbers. It's still likely to be listened too and they don't need a direct reply. A scammer on the other hand only cares for human answered numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If this is the whole issue why don't they just classify personal phone numbers as PII and make it illegal to collect and sell.  Wouldn't that eventually elimnate all the spam calls.</p>
<p>Fwiw I send these callers to speak with r/itslenny and record them wasting their time for my own humor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply saying nothing until the other end speaks has been amazingly effective in eliminating spam calls. Just answer the call and don't make a sound for ~5 seconds until the other end hangs up. Bam; spam calls drop to almost zero. Compare to just letting it ring where it tries again a day later.</p></div>		</li>
