			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. I work in a brewery and have to be careful when opening emptied tanks, because they are very close t ok pure co2 (less than 50 parts per billion oxygen). One time I accidentally took a whiff Iimediately after opening the tank. I can tell you it is extremely painful. skin burns, eyes burn, lungs feel like death... I think if I had taken a full breath, I might have passed out on the spot. It is the most common cause of brewery deaths I am told.</p></div>		</li>
