			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be useful to add that this only works for inertial reference frames, reference frames which are moving at a constant <strong>velocity</strong> (speed+direction) and have no rotational motion. Rotating reference frames are non-inertial so they're a little more complicated.</p>
<p>If you think about stars rotating around each other such that they are always the same distance apart, there is a gravitational attraction between them (because they're massive) but the rotation offsets that and they stay separated. If you were in the middle of the stars rotating with them such that they looked stationary and stayed the same distance apart then how do you reconcile that with the fact that they still have mass and should therefore attract one another gravitationally?</p>
<p>You have to introduce what's called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force" target="_blank">&quot;fictitious force&quot;</a>. These are additions to the maths which we add in to account for the non-inertial nature of the reference frame you're working in. It's like when you're sitting on a spinning roundabout and you feel a force pushing you outwards, there's not a force pushing you outwards (in fact what you're doing is pulling yourself inwards to keep you moving in a circle) but from your perspective you feel a force pushing you outwards.</p>
<p>So yeah the maths works out the same no matter what reference frame you use <strong>so long as it is an inertial reference frame</strong>. Once you go from an inertial frame to a non-inertial frame you have to introduce extra forces to keep physics working as it should, and it's the presence of these fictitious forces which you can use to tell if the stars are rotating around one another. So in the example of you standing in the middle of the stars and spinning with them:</p>
<p>You know the stars have mass so should attract -&gt; you can see that they're stationary and not being pulled towards each other under gravity -&gt; therefore there must be a fictitious force pushing them outwards to offset the gravitational attraction -&gt; therefore you must be in a rotating non-inertial reference frame and the stars must be spinning around one another.</p>
<p>Another example of a fictitious force is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force" target="_blank">Coriolis force</a> which is why storms in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (generally) spin in opposite directions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd observe gravity holding the matter of each star together then try to work out why the stars don't similarly attract each other, then mathematically work out that it could be because they are in orbit about your point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say you held an object out in front of you and let go.  If you were stationary it would just sit there, if you were rotating it would appear to start moving as your body continues to rotate and the object does not.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fun fact: this is very similar to how we can prove the Earth rotates around the Sun.  The other planets trace strange shapes in the night sky and make rapid changes in direction without any apparent force acting on them.  If you assume the Earth is stationary then it's impossible to explain, if you assume the planets are orbiting the Sun and the Earth is rotating on it's axis everything snaps into a much simpler model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key is to realise that it's acceleration which matters here, not velocity. Acceleration causes 'fictitious forces', and you can detect these 'fictitious forces' without using anything else as a reference.</p>
<p>Imagine you're on a very smooth, quiet train with no windows. If you're coasting along a straight section of track at a constant speed, you're going to find it impossible to tell how fast you are going, and in what direction.  You have nothing to use as a reference, and you can walk around normally. You're in an inertial reference frame, so everything acts exactly as if the train is sitting still.</p>
<p>Now imagine the driver slams the brakes on. You're going to immediately notice that you're being thrown out of your seat, and that you can't walk easily because of the deceleration. Even with no external reference, you can tell that you are changing velocity, and in which direction the change is occurring. Because of the acceleration, you are in a non-inertial reference frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inertial reference frames have no <em>acceleration</em>. You can tell you're in a non-inertial reference frame by the existence of various fictitious forces that only appear in non-inertial reference frame. For example, if you're in an orbiting reference frame you might experience a centrifugal force (a force pushing you away from the center of your orbit). If you change your reference frame to no longer be accelerating towards the center, the centrifugal force disappears and instead is simply an expression of momentum via Newton's first law.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. </p>
<p>Different reference frames will measure different velocities for the same object.</p>
<p>But if something accelerates, <em>that's</em> absolute.</p>
<p>All reference frames will measure the same acceleration that an object is experiencing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer is technically the right one, but there's another point worth mentioning. Nobody in this thread has mentioned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">Cosmic Microwave Background</a>, which I think is important here. The CMB, being residual background radiation, is felt at any point in the Universe, and is measured to be coming from every direction. So if there is some assymetry (more technically anisotropy) in the signal, as detected from a certain point, that must mean you are moving <em>relative to the CMB</em> in that direction. In the article I posted above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The latter is caused by the peculiar velocity of the Earth relative to the comoving cosmic rest frame as our planet moves at some 371 km/s towards the constellation Leo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effectively the CMB <strong>does</strong> give you a way to have a background 'grid' against which to measure speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but there is still no physical reason why that reference frame is better than any other.  It makes intuitive sense to measure relative to that but the math still works out from any reference frame making them equally correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I don't disagree. For OP's question I just thought it would be worth mentioning that it <strong>would</strong> be possible to know if two objects were in inertial motion thanks to the CMB, even without a 3rd object (assuming that we are allowing the CMB to also exist in this hypothetical).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible to measure positional changes relative to it? It seems similar to using constellations as a guide, i.e. it's easy to judge orientation, but tracking position change is almost impossible (unless your velocity is incredible).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't use the CMB to know where you are in the Universe. If you measure the CMB as the same in every direction it doesn't mean you are in the centre of the Universe. However, you can absolutely say that &quot;I am not moving relative the CMB and everyone moving relative to me <strong>is</strong> therefore moving (again relative to the CMB)&quot;. So it gives us a bit of a Universal standard.</p>
<p>The analogy to stars isn't quite apt, but imagine it this way: The sky is full of <em>identical</em> stars that are all evenly spaced, and all of them are the same size, temperature, brightness, ect. If you move in one directly, the stars in that direction will seem bluer (from blueshift) and the ones you are moving away from will seem redder (from redshift). Then you can say &quot;I am moving because the stars look different in one direction, and I know they are all identical in physical properties&quot;.</p>
<p>For the CMB, it is a similar trick, but instead of a sphere of stars around you imagine an infinite 3D grid with stars at each vertex point of the grid. Now, although the above redshift/blueshift trick works for measuring velocity (speed and direction), you can't use your distance from stars to know your position. They are all identical, and continue as far as you can see in every direction. Hope that helps :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if one person is on a train, heading 40 mph to the east and another person is sitting at the station waiting for them, physics works the same. What's going on is different, but the rules are the same. One of those rules is that from their perspective, they are at rest. Another is that light is traveling at c.</p>
<p>The problem with the idea of a photons refernce frame is that it would have to at rest and traveling at c, which is clearly a contradiction. Because of that contradiction, it's impossible to say what is moving where and how fast.</p></div>		</li>
