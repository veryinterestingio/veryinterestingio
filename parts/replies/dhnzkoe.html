<p>Okay! So my jugs are on the 4ltr side of the spectrum so to speak - which makes things difficult for people in social situations. </p>
<p>But it's also difficult for me. My body is not proportionate to my bazoombas. Trying to look professional without a button popping open is hard. Bras are hard. My back hurts and any complimentary tops make me look like I have a built in shelf and/or cup holder. </p>
<p><em>However</em>, when I want to bust out my, uh, bust and be all sexy lady like <em>of course</em> I want looks. </p>
<p>They are huge! And sexy as fuck. </p>
<p>Just common sense and context. Not the sodden trope of 'be attractive, don't be unattractive.' </p>
<p>Edit!: Haha! Did I ever respond to the wrong thread. 😊 I love it. I'm keeping it. As many gave said, it's complimentary to my post history. </p>
<p>Edit II: I want to thank my beer and mental illness for my unanticipated recovery into the upvote world.
Thanks 8% shit malt beer and clobazapam. Together we make a team of sorts. Not a team that's medically sound, but a team nonetheless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if it was the one in house but my father once caught Psittacosis. It really fucked him up for like a week. It took ages to diagnose too because he hadn't knowingly been in contact with any exotic birds (nor was he in an environment in which you'd find them). Nasty stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember being disappointed by that episode bc Naegleria fowleri has only ever infected people who swam in warm, stagnant water and got that water up their nose. AFAIK, you can't get it from aerosolized water. Hope this puts your N. fowleri worries to rest. </p>
