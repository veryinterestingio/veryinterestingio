			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically what I said is accurate, but as ever, there are a few exceptions. As another poster had said, there is a variety of banana called Cavendish, and this is what most of us eat. (If there is a banana disease that affects this variety then it might get wiped out as there is no genetic diversity). There is another variety called Goldfinger, and maybe a few other varieties that people eat, but for most of us, we've only ever eaten clones of the same banana.</p>
<p>Apples vary from tree to tree because of cross pollination, but some varieties are clones.</p>
<p>Seedless grapes are clones too. Wild ones aren't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what OC meant was the variety within each strain- like how not all “red delicious” will taste the same. I was wondering the same thing about fruits like blueberries where you can taste everything from sweet to sour and bitter with berries coming from the same bush and at the same level of ripeness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what he's referring to is that within the same batch of Granny Smiths/Afourer Mandarins/whatever, some of those in the same grocery bag could be more sour/sweeter than others even though they're the exact same kind. </p>
<p>CMIIW but it has to do with the soil/climate conditions? Like some grapes might get more sun than others and therefore sweeter. </p></div>		</li>
