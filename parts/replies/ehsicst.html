			<div class="markdown"><p>These aren't always nefarious. For the common example of flashlight apps that need access to your camera, the LED light that's used for the camera flash is what it really needs. Also, many apps have QR/barcode scanners that not everyone uses, or may not know about when they first install it. Same goes with the microphone. If it's any kind of social media app, it records video to share with your friends. It needs the microphone to get the audio to go along with it.</p>
<p>If in doubt, deny access. If the app doesn't work right, you can go back and allow it. Usually if the permission is critical to the app's operation, it will tell you when you try to use a certain feature. The developer should be able to clearly answer your question about why it needs access, though. It's usually buries in the terms of service, and if the app is free and not someone's home-grown project, it's usually so they can collect data for advertising purposes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tell that to IoT botnet operators.  They're just as bad as the old notorious internet worms.</p></div>		</li>
