			<div class="markdown"><p>Cicadas are the shit at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KUxMY77i0q4" target="_blank">And as Peter Gregory explains</a>, can cause a lot of chaos.</p>
<p>Cicadas are born to live out a summer, die, and then re-emerge every 13-17 years. There are some that re-emerge every year, but they always shoot up populations when the 13-17 year ones come up, because they are a great food source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived through one of these re-emergences in NoVA In what was it like ‘05 or something? I walked to school. Shit was crazy, and loud.
They’d constantly fly into you because I assume they’re pretty much blind. Thankfully I never got bit by any they were more like gigantic and loud June bugs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck June bugs. We have the brown and white striped June bugs up here and it is the only insect that I am irrationally afraid of. They are HUGE and you can hear them flying around like an ominous buzz at night. Then they land on you and you can feel it because they are so stupidly big and heavy. Even as it walks on you you can feel each foot lifting up and setting down on your skin. They also hiss. Bugs are not supposed to hiss.</p>
<p>Give me spiders, wasps and centipedes, I'll be wary of them but I'm rarely afraid. June bugs turn me into a scared little kid though, and I don't even think they are dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>> (particularly ants) </p>
<p>Ants are a completely different breed, and do not use the swarm tactic. 99&#37; of all ants do not  have the ability to reproduce. Ants are successful because of their social cohesion. Yeah, they reproduce a lot, but their strategy is completely different from flies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why I mentioned antswere very different about breeding than the others.</p>
<p>They still pump out enough princesses and drones to form new colonies pretty quickly though.  And they have absolutely no concern about sacrificing large numbers of colony members for survival.</p></div>		</li>
