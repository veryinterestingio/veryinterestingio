			<div class="markdown"><p>My fiance and fam insist on the SPF50 sunblock so I get zero tan. I'm tired from the waves and stuff after a day at the beach, but no big deal.</p>
<p>One day it was cloudy and a little rainy when leaving to go, so forgot the sunblock. It cleared up. We left early when we realized we were going to burn if we stayed any longer without sunblock. Felt nauseous and far more tired.</p>
<p>I know its anecdotal and its true that we did get a slight burn (didn't really hurt, but did itch and peel), but that's all I got.</p></div>		</li>
