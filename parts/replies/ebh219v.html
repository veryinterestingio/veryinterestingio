			<div class="markdown"><p>There definitely is such a thing as genetic memory. There was a study with mice where they exposed them to a particular odor then applied an electric shock. The offspring of those mice, when exposed to that same odor, showed signs of anxiety even though they never had first hand experience associating the odor with the shock.</p>
<p>Just think about the reason why children are afraid of the dark. Back in the day predators used to attack out of the shadows. Or how we find the smell of feces repulsive. There were probly countless generations where &quot;we&quot; got sick from being exposed to it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, many things are built into our genes, the ability to shiver, the tendency to smile when happy (even among the blind, who can never SEE a smile)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that caution around dark, unknown places is something that's drilled into peoples' heads.  Not specifically, but in messages via media, vocal tone, things like that.  Look at children's books.  Safe places are well lit, everything is is visible.  &quot;bad&quot;places are usually dark and things are hidden.  A kid doesn't have to have a scary experience in a dark alley to internalize the message that places like that are scary and should be avoided.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering humans rely so much on sight, an instinctual fear of dark places was probably a useful evolutionary advantage.  If your mind cant readily read the surrounding because it is dark, it likely treats that as a warning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Media is a big factor, I am sure; some today discount the play of media(books, music, TV, movies, pictures, social media( have you seen some snapchat filtersðŸ˜‚). The impact is even worse I am sure when children donâ€™t get to process the messages with their parents. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A LOT of things are ingrained in your brain whether you know it or not. People born blind still smile when they are happy and kids know the dark is a bad and scary place. You might not even consciously experience something but your mind IS familiar with it</p></div>		</li>
