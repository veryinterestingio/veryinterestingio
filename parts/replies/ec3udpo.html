			<div class="markdown"><p>I have aphantasia.  I find that due to my lack of visualization, I am extremely unobservant.  I can't replay a memory to see what someone was wearing etc...  If I want to know that information, I have to consciously think about it at the time.  In that case my memory is more &quot;solid&quot; than average as I will remember that information as a fact.</p>
<p>Eg.  &quot;Sue was wearing a blue dress&quot;</p>
<p>However, I only remember what I specifically noted.  If someone asks me a question about that dress</p>
<p>Eg. Did it have buttons?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with aphantasia, this seems to be true, at least in my case. People have commented on how good my factual memory is, and just a couple of weeks ago I was discussing aphantasia with a friend and he remarked that this could be why my recall seems to be more accurate than for most people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that makes perfect sense.  You have no other mechanism for remembering than something I might describe as &quot;verbal&quot; memory.  So you get bloody good at it out of dire necessity.  I am probably about the exact opposite of aphantasic, I use image type recall as my most reliable mechanism, and suck pretty hard at remembering word-based stuff.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/a7iock/are_people_with_photographic_memories_less_prone/ec4bib9/" target="_blank">See my comment above</a> if you're interested in a detailed description of the dark side ;)  I've thought a lot about how my image based memory works, just as I'm sure you think lots about how your aphantasia works.  And that's in part because of my weakness in the other direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>False memories are generally caused by the individual getting it sort of &quot;corrupted&quot;, in lack of a better word at the moment. This corruption is caused by emotions and ideas getting mixed in with the memory.</p>
<p>Imagine they have a fresh memory, this is a photo of the situation. Then that memory fades and now they have a registered memory of the memory, this is a sketch of the photo. To stay accurate, you need to accurately reference the sketch, but what ends up happening is that people go &quot;the colors were AMAZING&quot; (exaggerates colors) - &quot;This thing was HUGE&quot; (exaggerates size) - &quot;It was me and Steve...&quot; (loose idea about the timeframe, and used to hang out with Steve in that period, so visualizes hanging out with that person)</p>
<p>The last example I gave there is a pretty common one. Because you have an inaccurate idea about the timeframe, you get a faulty point of reference, and as you put things together, you try to adjust the memory to the inaccuracy. One of the ways hyperthymesia works so well is because they have a very strong frame of reference in the accuracy of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RadioLab did an interesting episode on memory, and one of the parts that stood out to me was the assertion that every time you remember something you are recreating that memory (and there can be some errors in that recreation). </p>
<p>Is that how you understand memory to work, and do you think that might affect people with these hyper-accurate memories? My thought is that perhaps they’re only ever asked to remember a particular day once in their life, so the memory doesn’t get copied enough to introduce errors, whereas the rest of us only have a few memories that we access all the time and introduce more errors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that most experts do think that remembering involves reactivating old memories in a way that allows them to be changed following the remembering - that is, the new memory is often a combination of the original memory and what was remembered. That being said, while this often does introduce errors (Google verbal overshadowing for how this commonly occurs when verbally describing visual memories), there is some evidence that it can improve memory when the recalled information is correct. Of course, that's not very surprising.</p>
<p>It's not clear why people with good memories would undergo fewer recall events than others, so if I understand you correctly then I don't think your suggestion can explain the difference between people with highly accurate autobiographical memory and others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the verbal overshadowing search term.. that should help in finding more info. </p>
<p>I’m not suggesting that those with better memories would undergo fewer recall events, but that they would have a wider range to choose from. If they can remember every moment of their life accurately, they have a (practically) infinite set of memories they could recall at any time. I, meanwhile, can’t remember before age 5 or 6 and would probably struggle to come up with more than a dozen events each year. </p>
<p>So I’m choosing from a much smaller ‘basket’ of memories when I try to remember a life event versus the person with a super memory who has many times more memories to choose from. The assumption there is that the recall is random, which would probably only be true in situations where someone asks ‘what was the temperature on September 21, 2005’, but my guess is they’d still use a larger ‘basket’ of memories for common recall than those of us with standard memories. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think that what you're thinking of is what Rhodopsin brought up. The fresh memory is more correct, but as the fresh memory fades - you instead make a written memory of the memory... and in that process you oftentimes lose accuracy  </p>
<p>Hyper-accurate memories do work. It's been properly validated. Their memory of recalling events doesn't &quot;go unfresh&quot;, and they don't have to make a second-hand copy of it, like people otherwise would.  </p>
<p>I don't find your suggestion that accessing the same memory a lot would reduce its accuracy to be true in a general sense. If they are using the memory while retelling a story about it and they embellish it that way, or if they're thinking back on it and their emotions and thoughts get carried away, they can sort of conjure an idea in themselves about the memory and then believe that idea. If you catch my wording, I would divide it into *memories*, *written copies of memories*, *thoughts and ideas*... An accurate memory is kind of like professional division, when you keep thoughts and emotions separate from the memory - without mixing them up.<br />
The loss in accuracy comes down to human performance. Memory in general is linked tightly to performance, and that's why you hear about loss of memory function in individuals experiencing lowered performance - like sleep deprivation, overworking etc.</p></div>		</li>
