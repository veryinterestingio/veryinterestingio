			<div class="markdown"><p>This gets to a key point - forts could both be used to disrupt supply lines, but also, as storage facilities, to make the supply lines easier to manage for the fort builder. If you only have to get more supplies every three months instead of every week, thats a huge advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the subject is so broad, and the answer varies wildly based on time period, type of cannon, type of shot used (anti-ship, anti-fortification, anti-personel, etc.). Without going into too much detail, and an answer for this question spans hundreds of years of history (think China 12th century). Early guns had effective ranges in the order of hundreds of feet to thousands of feet. They were direct fire weapons. The advent of rifling in the early 19th century allowed a civil war era cannon a range of a mile. Cannon was at the forefront of the military technology arms race for hundreds of years.</p></div>		</li>
