			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically PID is lower level. Closer to the machine.</p>
<p>Fuzzy logic is easier to code than using PID, especially if there are many variables and many outcomes possible. Like not only straight, left or right, but maybe also up and down, slower/accelerate, roll.</p>
<p>Otherwise PID controllers are faster to execute and more efficient. But too complex to use for a complex behavior.</p>
<p>You'd maybe want to use fuzzy logic to take the decision (43% left, 30% down, roll 12%, slower 5%), and then several PID to control each actuator.</p></div>		</li>
