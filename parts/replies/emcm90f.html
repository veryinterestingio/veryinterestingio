If you want to get a sense of just how different it is (without learning both), I recommend reading this excerpt of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight ( <a href="https://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/stella/readings/Middle/GAWAIN.HTM" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/stella/readings/Middle/GAWAIN.HTM" target="_blank">https://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/stella/readings/Middle/GAWAIN.HTM</a></a> )  </p>
<p>This is a great example of Middle English. Since you know modern English, see if you can understand it.<br />
It is a fairly decent comparison to the kinds of differences that pop up between Ancient and Modern Greek.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Greek here. Modern and ancient Greek may have the same linguistic base, but there are different meanings and it's difficult for an average Greek speaker to understand ancient Greek. However we can read ancient Greek quite easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One important thing to note is the nationalism inside languages. For instance, when France was formed, the French spoken by nobility wasn't even a language a majority of the now French citizens spoke. Languages and cultures such as Occitan or Breton were very different and speakers would not be able to communicate with each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely accurate--before you had quick and common travel, radio, TV etc languages could and did diverge at a steady pace. Even with those things today, try talking with someone on the other side of the country, especially from a different socioeconomic background. Sure, Gaius Flaukus XIV would be be able to understand another patrician on the other side of the empire, but John Buttstink in Gaul and Ionnes &quot;square-balls&quot; in Ionia probably wouldn't understand either, especially after a couple hundred years.</p></div>		</li>
