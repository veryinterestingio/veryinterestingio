			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, great, but does that mean that DC electrons ARE flowing? So why is a copper wire totally locked into its physical state, why doesn't it show any signs of being made up of these tiny things that flow? And if you're putting 120 volts to a wire, but there's an incomplete circuit (light switch is off), then what happens on the end supplying the push? How does it &quot;know&quot; that you suddenly turn a light switch on and being flowing (or vibrating)? What's pushing on the electrons in the first place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DC electrons do flow, but not at a extremely fast speed like light (unsure of the exact speed in practice). All metals have free electrons the can flow in any direction, they float between the atoms due to the metals molecular structure, but this happens regardless of if any electricity is flowing it happens in random motion instead.</p>
<p>When you &quot;turn on&quot; a light bulb, you connect a wire which goes through the bulb and the other wire goes back to the power source, so it doesn't &quot;know&quot; you connect the bulb, the &quot;pushing&quot; force simply has somewhere to go now, which is through the bulb. When a wire is open to the air it still pushes, but not strong enough to move (unless you have a lot of push which then becomes a spark/arc). This doesn't deplete the power source because the unless the electrons actually move (not just pushed) then no energy is transferred.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, but probably not as fast as you think. It's less that each electron instantly zips all the way around the circuit and more like a conga line where electrons enter the back of the circuit and eventually make their way around following the other electrons all moving in the same direction.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>They are <em>really</em> tiny. You can't see electrons directly, only the way they interact with other matter. And in a metal conductor, they don't interact with the metal in any way that gives off photons you can see.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It just fails to push and nothing happens. The conga line stops because there's nowhere for the people in front to go so no one enters in the back of the line. They might jostle around in the back a bit but if there isn't enough force to close the circuit by doing something like arcing, then the whole conga line pauses.</p>
<p>When you say &quot;120 volts&quot; that number is basically a measure of how hard you're trying to push people into that conga line. It's not an infinite force and an incomplete circuit means there is enough resistance to push back against it and stop any electrons from flowing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's pushing on the electrons in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, it gets back to either a battery or your power company. With batteries the pushing comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force" target="_blank">electromotive force</a>. The chemicals in the battery are trying to go through a chemical reaction that lowers their chemical energy and pushes out electrons. They are only able to do that if there is &quot;room&quot; for those electrons to go out. By that, I mean there's a certain amount of force (voltage) that the chemicals can push against. (For example, a 9 volt battery can exert 9 volts of &quot;force&quot;.) If the circuit's resistance is below that, then the reaction will proceed and electrons start flowing. But if the circuit is open or has too much resistance, the chemical reaction isn't strong enough to move the electrons and the whole reaction shuts down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The copper wire is made up of copper atoms, which are made of comparatively dense protons and neutrons being orbited by comparatively weightless electrons.  The atoms are close enough together that they &quot;share&quot; their electrons in a giant pool instead of having a few atoms locked together in a molecule. </p>
<p>Electrical current &quot;pushes&quot; electrons from one end, and they flow around the pool until electrons &quot;fall out&quot; the other end.  But while the water in the pool splashes, the concrete of the pool stays still.  The protons and neutrons of the nuclei stay comparatively still.</p></div>		</li>
