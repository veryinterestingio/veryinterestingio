			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! But then I wonder what is the last ‘biological process’ after which the tree is dead. Even if you can’t test it easily. (Sorry for so many words, English isn’t my mother tongue). For humans is the heartbeat stopping, for plant what is it? Something about chlorophyll?</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, it's not the case that &quot;the tree is dead&quot; and &quot;the tree is alive&quot; are the only two alternatives.  Trees with dead branches are still alive.  There are many &quot;partially alive in some parts&quot; alternatives for a tree.  </p>
<p>We don't count humans as &quot;dead&quot; just because their heart stops.  Many people have been saved every year by medicine after their heart stops.  People are legally considered &quot;dead&quot; when their brain stops working, even though many will still have a beating heart at that point in time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a tree next door that I can see out of my bathroom window. The tree went completely dead looking maybe three years ago. All the leaves fell off and never grew back and even the bark started coming off and the tree was all smooth looking. It was that way for the past two years and suddenly from the trunk it started growing new leaves. Now it looks like a big shrub, but still has the rest of the dead branches coming out of the top of it. You never know when it comes to trees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, ok! I thought there was some ‘mandatory process’ that without it a tree could no longer ‘be saved’ and so it is declared dead :) thx for explanation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, like other folks posting, but while trying to save a plant, I had another Redditor explain that &quot;plants store life&quot;, but only so much. Plants (trees) without leaves can still be alive, but the measure of their stored energy is difficult/impossible to quantify. If they consume that energy (not dormant) and fail to absorb new energy, they will die.</p>
<p>I recently bought three Carolina reaper plants that were shipped...poorly. I got them from the mailbox and replanted them immediately. All leaves fell off. They were three brown sticks in dirt. Without Reddit, I might have tossed them. Instead, I listened to the posters and cared for the brown sticks.</p>
<p>The stored energy in the plants enabled new leaves to form on 2 of the plants. On the 3rd one, you could see sprouts start, but eventually they stopped sprouting.</p>
<p>In short, 2 of the plants had sufficient energy to recreate what they needed to absorb energy. 1 plant was on the cusp, but fell just shy.</p>
<p>Back to your question, without the ability to measure the &quot;energy&quot; stored in a tree/plant, you don't really know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That the tree starts to decompose. Typically you'll see a lot of fungi latching on to take advantage of that biomass. Might be another sign - a lot of mushrooms around the base of the tree. Suggests the roots are rotting.</p></div>		</li>
