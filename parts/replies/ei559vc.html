			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember right, girls are more likely to die in utero, while boys are more likely to die as infants. And as I remember it, although ostensibly infant mortality is technically higher for boys, when you factor In stillbirths, etc., both genders are equally likely to die.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's one article suggesting environment could have something to do with which gender a child is: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23151996/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23151996/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or that less food would favor the gender that takes fewer resources to survive and has a singular reproductive capacity.  </p>
<p>Meaning in a starving population if one boy and five girls are born you could have a population that survives by having say 25 babies.  Versus five boys and one girl you could have say five babies.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Alec Cawley research: Women, as gatherers, in many case  provided the majority of the calories consumed by the tribe. The hunters  would bring in an occasional bonanza of meat, but the women provided  the baseload of food that kept the tribe alive.   Men often only provided less than 10% of total calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d link the source if I knew it, but this info is coming from a few years ago.</p>
<p>Basically, the premise is that females are a better choice in a resource-scarce environment because they have a guarantee of reproducing, while a male-heavy population will result in male genetic dead ends that fail to find a mate and struggle to thrive with the lack of resources. Thus, its more advantageous for genes to spread matrilineally. </p></div>		</li>

That sounds like a very primitive thing that some civilization would have figured out to eg reliably produce male heirs, but somehow &quot;there are only daughters, so everyone with a dubious claim starts a war&quot; is a common plot in history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well true but hormones also play a large role in features or even pseudosexuality,
despite chromosomes being xx or xy if a xx baby is subjected to high levels of testosterone the female babies clitoris will develop somewhat into a rudimentary penis.
In some cases it's been so severe a babies sex is mislabelled until they've had their chromosomes examined and realized they were the opposite sex the whole time.
Even after development, with female bodybuilders as example who do steroids their clitoris will take on the characteristic of looking more like a penis.
With males it's normally less severe but can lead to conditions like gynecomastia or sometimes inferility.
Other things can also influence sexuality in weird ways such as Kleinfelter's syndrome which is XXY sexuality, and the people develop looking mostly male but have odd features like ovaries where testicles are supposed to be.</p></div>		</li>
