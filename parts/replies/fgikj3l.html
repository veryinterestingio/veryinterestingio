			<div class="markdown"><p>Aquatic life isn't as skittish, isn't defensive of territory or young, and doesn't really see humans as a threat or food. Most just want to investigate. </p>
<p>So, cameramen can get really close with relative safety.</p>
<p>When you see those shots of a great white shark that look like it's an arm's reach away, <a href="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/2q/dx/p02qdxv9.jpg" target="_blank">it probably is</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Filming of aquatic life is usually just getting really close.</p>
<p>Light gets absorbed in the water, so the deeper you go the less color there is.  This is fixed by adding lights, but they also have limited range.</p>
<p>Luckily most aquatic life usually doesn't care about you in the water. </p>
<p>Also most aquatic life is really easy to predict when and where its going to be.</p>
<p>I'm going diving next week in Belize and I can pretty much guarantee ill see nurse shark, octopus, and a ton of specific fish. I'll probably see eagle rays. Its a few months early for whale sharks though. </p>
<p>I dove the Galapagos last year and we were pretty much guaranteed to see hammerheads pretty close.  We were lucky to see a mola mola and a manta.</p></div>		</li>
