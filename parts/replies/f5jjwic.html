			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe, either manually or automatically, a scram was initiated in response to sudden rising temperatures, and that was what actually triggered the runaway thermal explosion. The RMBK control rods had a section of graphite moderator attached to the end of them, such that when the control rods were removed they were replaced with the graphite displacers to further increase power.</p>
<p>Initiating the scram was, counter-intuitively, dangerous because the length of the graphite displacers was shorter than the height of the core. So when the control rods were fully removed, in their place was a section of graphite with 1.25m of water above and below it. The water acts as a neutron absorber, which reduces the rate of reaction. By reinserting the control rods, the graphite starts to displace the 1.25m column of water near the bottom of the reactor, and starts to spike power output locally. That spike causes water to boil, and power to increase in a feedback loop as described above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In human terms, the scram was initiated because the reactor should have been shut down 36 seconds earlier. At that point they were just gathering data and watching the pumps' performance.</p>
<p>Reactor power had begun to tick up slightly, which possibly jogged the control engineer's memory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When operated appropriately, the reactor scram (even with the graphite tips) would have sufficient margin to preclude a steam explosion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well not it wouldn't. That's why the minimum ORM was increased from 15 rods to over 80(!).</p>
<p>The Soviets immediately decided that anything under 30 rods was extremely dangerous, and then kept raising the limit. And that's with additional absorbers and a faster scram.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A scram would mean the full insertion of all 167 rods. I'm certainly willing to accept if I'm mistaken, but as far as I'm aware, under normal conditions (i.e., the core is not poisoned and the reactor is not already operating in an unsafe state), the scram would safely terminate a power excursion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AZ-5 = Scram.</p>
<p>The scram was what <em>created</em> the power excursion, so you have something here very backwards.</p>
<p>The core being poisoned helps prevent a power surge, not cause one.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Research  [20]  conducted  after the accident has shown that the reactivity introduced into the core by the control  rods largely  depends on  the ORM. When the ORM  is about 30 effective  manual control rods  (approximately  100 control  rods,  each  lowered  to  the  1.4  m  level),  a  strong negative reactivity  is  introduced.  When the ORM  is  about  15 control  rods,  during the  first  six  seconds  after  triggering  of  EPS-S,  less than B_eff  of  negative reactivity is  introduced into the core.  In the case of a  non-regulation  ORM of 7 control  rods, during the first eight seconds after  triggering  of EPS-S the inserted  reactivity is positive  (i.e.   the  chain  reaction  is  being  accelerated   rather  than  terminated). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This text indicates an ORM of 15 was sufficient to preclude the sequence of events that happened. A small amount of negative reactivity is introduced at an ORM of 15, but the sequence of events required a positive reactivity insertion.</p>

<p>^(Sidenote: you are clearly knowledgeable on the topic, but from our discussion a couple months ago I continue to recommend you read the INSAG-7 report from start to end, since it is the most definitive source on the accident to date and would further add to your considerable knowledge.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is the most definitive source <em>in English</em>. It was written in the early 1990s and is outdated or questionable in several areas. For instance, INSAG-7 overlooked the rather large likelihood that ORM <em>was</em> 15 rods because the DREG computer had a glitch that did not account for the 7 LAR rods. The report also oversimplifies the power conditions in the bottom half of the core at 1:23:40.</p>
<p>Also read the footnotes, INSAG here is just quoting an analysis done by the reactor's design bureau in 1986, which is a questionable source. Basically any Soviet analysis of the accident from the cover-up period needs to be corroborated by later work.</p>
<p>What we do know is that the RBMK was labelled a nuclear hazard at less than 700 MW and 30 rods ORM (later increased several times over).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But they also wanted it unstable to test if in a complete power outage the fans would still be turning enough to keep it stable until the back up generators kicked in which had a time lapse before they were up and running. I think the test had already failed 7 times and because of this the plant wasn’t up to code, they were positive it would work and rushed the test which was well described by internetboyfriend666. I’m a chick so I hope I added to the posts making some sense of it</p></div>		</li>
