<p>There's more additional accumulation of ice on land caused by added precipitation in Antarctica, than all the glacial melt going on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is demonstrably false, the mass balance in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/4/1095.short" target="_blank">Rignot et al., 2019</a> highlight accelerating loss of ice from Antarctica as a whole with the most recent rates being ~250 gigatons per year of mass loss. There are areas that are gaining mass (i.e., ice is accumulating), but these are exceeded by areas losing ice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...something few people realize is that the total mass of water in the oceans is decreasing as a result of climate change, not increasing.</p>
<p>The primary driver in rising sea levels is the increased volume that ocean water takes up as it warms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also incorrect. Thermal expansion is certainly important, but it's less than half of sea level rise (e.g., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011GL048794" target="_blank">Church et al., 2011</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1829" target="_blank">Chen et al., 2013</a>). By proxy, mass addition makes up more than half of observed sea level rise.</p></div>		</li>
