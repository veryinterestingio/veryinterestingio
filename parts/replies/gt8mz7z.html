			<div class="markdown"><p>This is great. You may be the person who can answer something that's been bugging  me for a long time..</p>
<p>Why is grape flavor ...well, not?</p>
<p>If you eat a grape, it's sweet but tart, depending on ripeness..and has its own flavor profile</p>
<p>Anything &quot;grape-flavored&quot; is purple and tastes the same..but it doesn't actually taste like a grape, including grape juice.</p>
<p>Is this just me? Why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a few things. Primarily a historical holdover.</p>
<p>I'll get back to grape, but a real banana's flavor comes from probaly 200 chemicals. Banana Laffy Taffy is like 4 chemicals. Isoamyl acetate is the primary component in both the real and fake version, so if you use your imagination, it's banana.</p>
<p>You might hear that it is meant to resemble some long-forgotten variety, and maybe gros michelles have more isoamyl acetate, but it's really just formulator laziness.</p>
<p>Flavoring as a science didn't spring fully formed into existence. 100 years ago it was drug store owners noticing that the chemicals they had on hand kinda sorta smelled like fruits, and mixing them together to approximate a fruit.</p>
<p>Now, we can make a very, very convincing banana flavor, but if you bit into a laffy taffy and it taste exactly like a banana you'd be put off. The primitive history of candy flavoring has forever colored our expectations. You expect fake banana. </p>
<p>The real-tasting banana flavors go into, like, banana cream pies and bottled smoothies, where you don't even notice them.</p>
<p>So grape flavor. Historically, it's ethyl acetate (ever smell acetone free nail polish remover? That's that), methyl anthanylate, tartaric acid, more if you want to round it out, but methyl anthanylate does the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>But real grapes are subtle. Methyl anthanylate is present in grapes, but it's mostly just sweet, acid, and water. Fake grape is the primitive version of grape, cranked up to ten. </p>
<p>Watermelon has the same issue. Ever drink watermelon juice? It's more water than melon. Nobody would want a gum that actually tastes like that, so bubblicious made a caricature of it.</p>
<p>Citrus flavors are the weird exception. </p>
<p>Orange, lemon, lime are way more real tasting, even in the cheapest candies. That's because it's stupid easy to make a good citus flavor, even in 1880. Grind up the peel, press out the oil - bam, citrus flavor. Can't do that with a grape.</p>
<p>EDIT: I almost forgot! The other thing is that flavor plants are almost universally Kosher. When you work with real grape, you need the rabbi to supervise the run, <em>and that's the only thing like that</em>. So flavor companies dont like working wirh real grape because it's a headache.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was confused about the cis-3-hexanol, like what’s cis there? It’s actually cis-3-hexen-1-ol, so the carbon chains both bending up (or down) from the double bond at the 3 carbon and an alcohol on the one end. </p>
<p>Anyways you reminded me of why I choose my career path. Chemistry and biochemistry are so cool! Now back to counting pills.....</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this what items like imitation vanilla are? &quot;Tastes close enough but is actually something entirely different?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. They're leveraging that fact that vanillin can come from places other than vanilla beans. But vanillin alone is flat and &quot;artificial&quot; tasting. Buut maple kinda tastes a little like vanilla, and so does caramel, and so does malted barley. So does rum. So take that flat fake vanillin and add that stuff (or the chemicals in them responsible for the flavor) and you get something closer to a real vanilla bean flavor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im starting to feel like I don't really know what things actually taste like. Lol.  I may think I like caramel, but maybe I just like maple syrup... maybe the program had to create too many flavors so some of it is just procedurally generated. Joking ofc.</p>
<p>How do you know so much about this? Sure, some of its just common sense but you know loads of facts specific stuffs. Very impressive, imo anyways</p></div>		</li>
