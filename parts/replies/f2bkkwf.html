<p>I found <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/what-creates-static-electricity" target="_blank">this</a> article quite interesting. Apparently you can have molecules break apart on contact, with the resulting torn-apart moieties reacting with air to generate ions.</p>
<p>This would also explain why shape seems to be important rather than just chemical composition; some configurations would be more amenable to tiny parts breaking off.</p>
<p>Electronegativity probably still comes into it, with it influencing how a free radical will react with air, but there's probably a reason chemistry didn't just figure everything out decades ago.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a great summary of the field, though his info on the technologies used by Xerox and Kodak seems to be out of date (Kodak does still make printers, just not office-sized ones; Xerox uses a variety of different charging systems).</p></div>		</li>
