<p>I'm not sure toothpaste would have mattered. Our ancient ancestors are noted for having better teeth than our own. <a href="http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/price/pricetoc.html" target="_blank">Books have been written on the subject.</a> The need to brush is a product of modern diets. Modern meaning since the start of agriculture 10,000 years ago. Indigenous people around the world today, who still hunt and forage like our ancient ancestors, have perfect teeth without ever brushing or having access to dental care.</p>
<p>Cavities and early tooth loss are actually a modern problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At first I thought this said 12 ounces of cherry coke and I was like eh, that's not <em>that</em> much. But a 12 pack? Holy shit, I thought I drank a lot of soda.</p>
<p>But I still drink a lot of soda and sometimes I'll binge on candy, but not often, and I really don't get many cavities these days. It's been a few years since I've had one.</p>
<p>Really I think brushing your teeth twice a day and using mouthwash and going to the dentist twice a year seems to keep your mouth healthy for the most part. Or maybe everyone is just different.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There's plenty of ways that evolutionary pressures work on things that are past child bearing age. The most obvious that comes to mind is that a living grandparent is someone capable of sharing the task of rearing a child, especially in training the mother in how to keep the baby alive. That's a pretty important thing for a species where post-natal development is so prolonged and intense. The healthier the grandparent, the longer they can stick around to care for their descendents and pass on valuable knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gives a shit until you can't have kids anymore, which is far past 20, and even still it's relevant to the extent that you can play a grandparent role within a nuclear family setting to help your offspring have offspring. Literally anything that can help your line of descendants better procreate is relevant in natural selection.</p></div>		</li>
