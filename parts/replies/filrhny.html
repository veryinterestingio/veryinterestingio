			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhh okay numberphile was talking about those fast growing functions but they made it seem TREE(3) existed apart from those growth functions, I didn't realize they had a role in figuring out TREE(3)'s value</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it actually doesn't, it simply is a way to categorize the size of numbers that are too large to express with other mathematical notation.</p>
<p>the lower bound that is described in the fast growing hierarchy is just an unrelated number for with TREE(3) has been shown to be at smallest. in other words, it is the number &quot;n&quot; for which TREE(3) is greater than or equal to n.</p>
<p>sorry if i didnt make that clear in my comment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the first time in a long time that I have read something so far beyond my knowledge that I understood <em>literally nothing</em>. Usually I can follow along at least a little bit with some pretty wild quantum physics type things, but this? Nothing. Like, not even a slight sliver of it, it feels like inventing a colour that isn't on the spectrum and trying to imagine what it looks like. </p>
<p>What a cool feeling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, in part it's because a lot of the concepts I talk about just can't be condensed into an easy to read Reddit post. If I were willing to write paragraph upon paragraph of explaination, I could probably make it a little easier to grasp. Nothing I talk about is too hard to grasp however, it's just intimidating at first glance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s complicated, but like anything else in math, it’s constructed from relatively simple ideas and you can learn the concepts, even if like me, you don’t really understand set theory.  </p>
<p>Here’s a good video series that explains to a layman how the fast growing hierarchy works and how to use large transfinite ordinals to generate ridiculously large numbers. The first few videos are easy enough to understand, but after a while it gets really weird. </p>
