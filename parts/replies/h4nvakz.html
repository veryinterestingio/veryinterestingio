			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, orbits are the answer. As long as you stay above a black hole's Schwarzschild Radius it behaves like any other mass. And orbits are not so much about distance and more about velocity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can scroll through our solar system and see how much of it is actually empty. It takes quite some time, since space is just so incredibly big and empty, but it is really interesting to just see <em>how</em> big. If you have 20-30 minutes spare time, I seriously recommend giving it a look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a somewhat related question: it’s said that black holes boundary is where the escape velocity is speed of light. But is that the condition to say we can’t escape the black hole at all? Shouldn’t just having a counter force on which is slightly more than the black hole’s gravity enough? The object would eventually come out the black holes influence this way. And There is no limit of force which can be applied that I’m aware of (the structural engineering put aside) </p>
<p>Or does the explanation boil down to “we don’t know as black holes are edge of our physical understanding”?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't a sufficiently high force actually change change something about this? Like, force causes acceleration, so a huge blackhole-defying force would quickly accelerate you to relativistic speed, which would cause you to gain relativistic mass, which would bend spacetime (possibly in a way that would let you escape?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The event horizon is the point where <em>Newtonian mechanics</em> would calculate the speed of light as escape velocity. In Newtonian mechanics you could escape from any point and black holes wouldn't be black holes. But Newtonian mechanics is not the right description for black holes.</p>
<p>If you are beyond the event horizon then no amount of force can get you out. There is not even an outwards direction. Getting out is as impossible as getting to last Tuesday. In which direction would you point your rocket engines?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a limit, the speed of light :) if something descends to or below the event horizon, it would need to travel at or above the speed of light to escape. Anything with mass (a spaceship, probe, person, rock, etc.) would thus require an infinite amount of energy to reach that speed. To our knowledge that isn't possible.</p>
<p>However, something could orbit or flyby the black hole very near to the event horizon without descending into it. There would be some extreme forces and velocities involved but at least the object could escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was purely trying to understand it from dynamics perspective: if we apply a force continuously slightly greater than gravitational pull, it should eventually get out? </p>
<p>To draw parallels, In case of earth, the rockets from earth don’t travel at earths escape velocity to go to Mars or something</p>
<p>But I think I understand that the space-time are so twisted and warped that possible paths lead into the black hole if speed is less than c</p></div>		</li>
