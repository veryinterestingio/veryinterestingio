<p>How much of that effect do you think is from the masks and distancing versus having schools shut down? Have you seen any studies discussing the relative importance of masks vs distancing vs shutting down schools, office jobs and restaurants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t seen any well-designed studies to address that question and don’t even know how someone would begin to design one. As far as our demographics go, our hospital’s catchment area includes a number of school districts with varying policies with respect to in-person, hybrid, and virtual school attendance, and anecdotally, compliance with distancing and masking. No schools have been completely shut down this academic year, and the all-virtual cohort is definitely a minority. Percent positivity rates for Covid vary by municipality but have been in general trending downward since October/November. We aren’t conducting any sort of study that would allow for drilling down on Covid positivity status as a function of school district or even personal behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some Yale researchers did the best they could to tease out which recommendations helped vs hurt. All correlation, not causation, but that’s what we’ve got. And it’s all covid-specific, doesn’t address the impact of these measures on other respiratory pathogens. I also haven’t seen any other studies about them other than description of numbers compared to previous years that all say, yes, they’re really low this year...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think either alone would prevent the other viruses circulating. In schools there has to be a lot of transmission from running noses then play and touching surfaces. There's no way masks on + schools open means viruses aren't being transmitted.</p>
<p>I hope zoom has finally proved that 90% of teaching can be done online (just wait til teachers realise the khan academy is a thing), that self-directed Internet learning is more productive than the Victorian methods once the basics have been learned and less overwhelming social distractions and bullying resulting from throwing so many kids together.</p>
<p>When the data is in perhaps not doing that way in future would put schools at risk for being sued for endangerment and negligence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi. Do you think a contribution to the lower amount of cases could also be due to less people going to the hospitals because they don’t want to risk “getting sick”? I have colleagues and neighbors not taking their kids with colds/flu who resort to home remedies and over the counter meds, waiting it out until they’re better...  I know some adults that don’t go when they’re sick for the same reason or they’re scared to test positive....  no matter how much we try to convince them to go get checked and treated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! Also a pediatrician, but based in the outpatient world (aka clinic.) My practice offers video visits so patients don’t have to come into the office and risk exposing others/themselves, and truly, the number of colds is extremely low comparatively. I’ve had lots of COVID cases (especially with the spikes around the holidays) but every influenza test has been negative. Our county numbers are essentially zero, so I have mostly stopped testing for flu this season. </p>
<p>Masks and lack of in-person school is what’s really driving decreased influenza activity, in my opinion. We know that flu is spread by respiratory droplets, and that COVID is more transmissible than influenza. </p>
<p>Personally, I will probably continue to wear masks at the grocery store and on planes during cold/flu season, even if COVID disappears completely and life resumes exactly as it was before. The lack of cold/flu illness among my coworkers during the pandemic has been really striking. I am fully vaccinated against COVID and I get my flu shot every year, but a regular cold still really sucks; and I have gotten a mild bout of influenza (mild thanks to the vaccine) but I don’t wish to repeat it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the comments! I was someone who started masking when I got sick as early as 2018, and while I got some funny comments from my coworkers then (&quot;Your black mask reminds me of Scorpion!&quot;) I never felt unjustified. I'm someone who keeps a cough for a long time after a cold or chest infection, so even though I'm feeling great I'll still cough for weeks on end. Didn't want to spread that around.</p></div>		</li>
