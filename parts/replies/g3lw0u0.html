			<div class="markdown"><p>The limit is the battery getting damaged from charging too fast and wearing out quickly. Even if you have a fast-charger at 12 volts, the phone actually has to step that back down to about 5 volts to charge the battery. You actually can't pick voltage you are charging a battery at, it has to be the battery voltage, but you can change the current.</p>
<p>The higher voltage is just to get the power through the cable without melting it. Power is voltage times current, so you can trade one for the other, but only current causes heating in the wire--this is why long-distance power lines are super high voltage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soooo... I have a USB-C charging port on my phone, and confession time, I sometimes use my laptop charger on my phone since it has a longer cord. But the laptop charger says it's a 65W charger... Am I wrecking my phone battery? I haven't noticed any insufficiencies so far. But also I know that's different from Voltage, but I've always wondered if it was a bad thing to do, and you sound like you would know</p>
<p>Edit: Dang. USB-C's are sick</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can cram more power into the phone in a shorter period of time, but if you shove too much power in too fast your phone will explode.</p>
<p>Anyone who's ever plugged electronics in to too much juice knows how rapidly stuff blows up into a puff of smoke. The whole thing is fried at that point.</p>
<p>The slow charging rate is to not damage any of the delicate electronics or overload the battery.</p>
<p>Charging electric cars has the same limitation. You can only charge a battery so fast before the battery overloads with catastrophic results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Will you please explain why tongue is a different matter? I ask because recently I heard of a toddler who put the charging end into his mouth and was electrocuted. I have been wondering about this question since then.</p>

<p>I don't know what kind of a charger it was. May be some fake Chinese knock out. I will not be able to say for sure, but Indian markets are filled with unprotected electronics, and the house fittings are not done well in low financial lodgings which is where this incident took place.</p>
<p>However, read about a similar incident in the US</p>
<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/phone-charger-burn-toddler_uk_59dc800fe4b0208970cf4fbe" target="_blank">https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/phone-charger-burn-toddler_uk_59dc800fe4b0208970cf4fbe</a></p>
<p>Then, across the pond, in the UK, quoting Sheila Merrill, public health adviser for The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) telling HuffPost UK: “Mobile phone chargers are a common feature of an everyday household, and if left plugged in can cause severe burns, as well as being an increased fire hazard.” </p>
<p>Further, at least one &quot;expert&quot; website does claim that mobile phone chargers can be dangerous when put into mouth. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not 4x the power, it's 16x the power. The power is voltage times current, but the higher the voltage the more current is pushed when you have  a resistive load like a baby, so your power is voltage squared over resistance.</p></div>		</li>
