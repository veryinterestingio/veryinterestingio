			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;8D&quot; music that goes around on social media etc wasn't recorded like that though. It's existing pop songs that have been put through some processing so it sounds like the audio source is moving around your head.</p>
<p>My guess is a combination of volume, latency and reverb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard of this.</p>
<p>I assume it's basically a &quot;binaural&quot; audio filter that simulates a room, and plays the music in it.</p>
<p>Or perhaps they play the music out of speakers in an actual room with some fake ears. Which is even cooler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're mostly right, they also reduce the bass a little I believe to make it seem like it's live.  In most cases the source of sound is spinning, and it's all the sound, not just some.  This is very easy to replicate so most &quot;8D&quot; channels are revenue farms.  Free DAWs can replicate these very easily (you literally move a slider, that's it) (Spotify's Soundtrap for example), so with a device that has internet (it works on mobile as well) and a recording of a song you can make one of these in probably under 15 minutes, if you count rendering time. And you'll get 15 million views, by using free software and someone else's work.  If you can't tell, I'm not a fan of these, including the misinformation they spread about &quot;8D&quot; audio. I'm not even sure how they came up with the number 8, there are only 3 dimensions and headphones can only replicate 2 well, if I had to guess it would be the flat plane having 8 angles if you cross 2 x's, there's a name for this but I can't remember, explaining why the audio spins and does nothing else.  It seems like there is now 16d audio as well, it's probably the same but now it goes above you too <em>oooooooo</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure it's right though. I thought that plotting an instrument in a normal stereo field is just a case of changing the volume in  the two channels. So L: 100, R: 0 is hard left; L:100, R:100 is central; L: 0, R:100 is hard right. Audio latency between the channels doesn't happen in music the way it does in real life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The way it works, he records all sounds in a studio using a dummy head. But a very accurate head, where the mics are positioned as they would be in a human head. Left and right channel are mixed using an algorithm called Cetera.</p>
<p>Online there is a lot of information, he was <em>fucked over</em> in the 80s by the &quot;big guys&quot; and you can image the rest.</p>
<p>In Buenos Aires he has a <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/blind-theater-buenos-aires" target="_blank">blind theater</a> which I'm hoping to visit one day.</p></div>		</li>
