			<div class="markdown"><p>The tricky thing here is that it doesn't explain why hot air rises or why it stops where it does.</p>
<p>Hot air is less dense than cold air. So it's acting like a bubble in a sea of dense air, the same way a bubble of gas acts when you release it under water. </p>
<p>It rises to the point at which its density matches the outside air (which is very cold!). </p>
<p>It spreads as it rises â€” hence the bubble goes from being round to mushroomy to finally an &quot;anvil&quot; shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We did a conventional weapons explosion at the end of our tour in Iraq, the sheer amount of explosives  going off at the same time created a rather large mushroom cloud. There was also a very visible, very large shockwave that came towards us, it was pretty awesome. So it happens with conventional explosives also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only real differences between conventional explosives and nuclear explosives are size efficiency and nuclear fallout.</p>
<p>Everything else is just a result of energy being released really fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The forms in which the energy is released differ a lot between nuclear and conventional weapons, and also between nuclear weapons of different sizes.</p>
<p>For example, a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb will roast you with its heat well beyond the radius where the blast is very dangerous. No conventional weapon of any size will do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was 12B, doing route clearance, we detonated a triple stack mine we found with c4, even after backing off about a mile, it still rattled my teeth. We exploded many IEDs and mines before, but this one was rather large.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got to witness something similar.  In my case it was at a national lab developing explosives, and after some tests were done there was a quantity of stuff left to dispose of, so they brought out some folks to see a big explosion in a safe environment since they were gonna blow it up anyway.</p>
<p>I could see a difference in the air as the shockwave came towards us, rippling the trees it was coming across.  Really neat, and yes, mushroom cloud.</p></div>		</li>
