			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually inside your fuel filler door or on the gas cap should have some indicator of what type of fuel the manufacturer recommends. Check your fuel filler door to see if it has the information you need.</p>
<p>Here's an example: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cKhpNKd.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/cKhpNKd.png</a></p>
<p>It says &quot;premium unleaded fuel only.&quot; The thing is - premium fuel is different in different areas (might be 93 in texas and 91 in california). The computer that manages the engine in most modern cars can generally compensate for differences - even for lower octane gas (87) - you'll potentially lose a little bit of power and a little bit of fuel economy but you shouldn't hear knocking/pinging from your engine from using a lower rated gas unless you have a much older vehicle whos engine management computer cannot compensate or if there are other circumstances.</p>
<p>You'll notice on the fuel filler cap it also says (crossed out) E20-E85. Up to E15 gasoline. A lot of fuel that you get at the pump has some ethanol in it, that sign is saying that only up to 15% (E15) ethanol gas is acceptable. If you have a car that has flexfuel you can use any combination of standard gasoline and up to E85 gasoline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your filler door says, e.g., &quot;91 octane recommended&quot; it's not required nor is it beneficial (either the compression ratio is high or it isn't).   Dynamic compression, e.g. in low displacement turbos, doesn't benefit enough because the ECU is designed to manage what most people will put in... 87 octane.</p>
<p>High performance cars will actually indicate (emphasis mine) &quot;<strong><em>Requires</em></strong> <x> octane <strong><em>minimum</em></strong>.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically, it will say somewhere on the gas door if your car requires higher octane.  It's also typically reserved for higher performance engines like V8s found in camaros, mustangs, corvettes or engines with turbo/super chargers.</p>
<p>Most non-performance vehicles all run on the cheap stuff.  You can always consult your owner's manual or google it as long as you know your engine size (diff engine in the same car might use diff fuel).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This does seem to be changing a bit as more &quot;everyday&quot; vehicles are getting low-displacement turbocharged engines for fuel economy reasons. Although the owners manual may say something like 87 octane minimum, 91+ for full performance. It's a different situation compared to in the past when running premium fuel in an engine that wasn't specifically designed for it was unlikely to make much difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, not all engines are equal.</p>
<p>My brother rides a Yamaha WR250 dual sport. It needs 91 octane. It's just a simple engine with a higher than average compression ratio. The higher octane helps prevent detonation. </p>
<p>I was storing it for him when he was overseas in the military a couple years. I would take it around the block every now and then because anyone slightly mechanical knows that a vehicle that sits for years will have more issues. It was low on fuel so I gave it half a gallon of 87 used for my generator.</p>
<p>Well it ran BAD. I immediately drove back, parked it, then went with my gas can and bought some 93 to fill the tank to average around 91. Ran great again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume if you bumped down from 93 to 91 or 91 to 89 it wouldn't be the end of the world, but definitely not 87. But at the point you're purchasing a car that recommends 91 or 93, you shouldn't be worried about saving a few dollars on gas, otherwise you can't afford the car IMHO.</p></div>		</li>

<p>MON (motor octane number) is usually lower than RON, so AKI is typically lower than RON.</p>
<p>A fuel that is 98 RON is probably around 92-94 AKI (most US states 93 is high octane)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're measured on different scales. In Europe (and most of the world) the number at the pump is the Research Octane Number (RON). RON is measured using a standardized test engine under controlled conditions.</p>
<p>Another widely accepted industry standard is the Motor Octane Number (MON), which uses a different set of test conditions. Without getting into the details, generally the MON test represents a condition where the engine works under a harder load. This is ideally more representative of the actual conditions under which your engine may have pre-ignition knock; generally an engine will begin to knock when put under load, rather than at idle or running at a low constant speed. MON for a given fuel is almost always much less than RON.</p>
<p>In the US, Canada, Brazil and some other countries instead of using the RON or MON alone the average of the two is posted at the pump, as &quot;(R+M)/2&quot; or &quot;Anti-Knock Index&quot; (AKI).</p>
<p>Typical 'regular' gas in North America is 87 octane (R+M)/2 with the RON generally somewhere between 91 and 95, and MON accordingly 79-83. &quot;Mid-grade&quot; gasoline is 89 octane; RON = 93-98, MON = 80-85. &quot;Premium&quot; gasoline is somewhere between 91 and 94 octane (R+M)/2, which can vary widely in RON and MON. For instance in Canada Petro-Canada sell &quot;Ultra 94&quot; at some of their stations, which is 101.5 RON, 86.5 MON; local competitor Husky also sell 94 octane at certain stations, but their blend is 98 RON, 90 MON.</p></div>		</li>
