			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought as much but then why build such a steep roof in the first place? If its for more space, aren't walls cheaper than roofs? And if you see the photo I posted above the fence is absolutely laughable compared to the roof. It looks like any snowfall could tear that thing straight off. Just seems barmy to me. Charming, but barmy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The charming part is how you use the word Barmy :). </p>
<p>The reason why we have those steep pitches is due to a concept in the northern US we call snow load. When you get upwards in to 1m of snow on the roof it can be enormously heavy. Now imagine it’s the spring and you just got 1cm of rain on top of that snow.   That snow will suck up water like a sponge. The snows weight just doubled or worse. This causes roofs to collapse. That actually happens to a few houses in my community last year. The steep pitch allows it to slide off easier as it builds up.  When it does slide off it’s not entirely uncommon for half the roof load to go at once. </p>
<p>My house has a shallower pitch and I normally have to climb up there in February and shovel it off so the load doesn’t become dangerous in March. </p>
<p>Those “steps” make partitions of snow. So the bottom chunks of snow don’t take the higher up ones with it. When snow slides in to them they tend to act more like a knife than a brake. In practice they don’t see too much force exerted on them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At my school they installed them on the new roof because icy snow dropping from three stories up is bad. I will say it was more than a little disheartening seeing the metal feet littering the walkway on the way to class.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fence is there to break up the snow. Not to stop it.</p>
<p>It stops a giant slab of snow from hitting someone. Instead, snow falls in smaller portions.</p></div>		</li>
