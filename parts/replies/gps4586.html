			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry, shit low effort comment. Modern planes they don’t. An Airbus for example just has what looks like a toy joystick as it’s fly-by-wire. The forces never change on it, you can move it through its full range with one finger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we kinda do if we are going fast enough with no hydraulics and you have mechanical connections, I’ve only experienced this in the piper though because the plane I fly has Fly-by-wire, and I don’t mean so much muscle like you need to be a body builder but it’s a lot harder to move the yoke while flying then it is on the ground</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Boeing it can happen. As well as most smaller airplanes. It's mainly the result of aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces.</p>
<p>Thus, in the majority of airplanes it can happen that an overly strong aerodynamic load during a nose-dive or a HYD failure can need an overly strong control input from the pilots. Even something like a seneca or a navajo can already need some real fighting in a very steep dive.</p>
<p>For the moment, a minority of airplanes are fly by wire. So &quot;they don't&quot; is not a valid response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to remember watching a you tube video (maybe smarter everyday) where they talked about the stick having a counterweight so that in high G maneuvers, should the pilot black out, the stick would return to a neutral position.  Obviously the more Gs you pull the &quot;heavier&quot; the counter weight becomes and the more work it is to pull on the stick...I'm in no way a pilot though so I could be full of it.</p>
<p>Edit* Found the video <a href="https://youtu.be/79rYbkTi4fs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/79rYbkTi4fs</a> 5:40 mark</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is true, even in the F-18, which is fly by wire there is a spring that provides feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydraulic actuators position the control surfaces. Stick and rudder feel are provided by spring cartridges. Although there is no aerodynamic feedback to the stick and rudder pedals, the effect is simulated by flight control computer scheduling of control surface deflection versus pilot input as a function of flight conditions.</p>
