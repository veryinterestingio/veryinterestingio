			<div class="markdown"><p>I think less that the possibilities are endless, and more that the provided explanation fails to terminate at any observable point - i.e. it doesn't truly explain the situation, and merely pushes that responsibility to something else completely. When challenged, the only possible solution is another turtle, which again fails to explain it. If anything, its (nowadays) a criticism on a unsatisfactory answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5 version is that you are an adult trying to reasonably explain things to a 5 year old who just keeps asking “why” to anything you say.</p>
<p>The “why” in the face of anything is the turtle in this situation.</p>
<p>It literally doesn’t matter what you say or how or whatever, kid is barely listening.</p></div>		</li>
