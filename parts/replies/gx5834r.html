<p>I have pretty insane visual patterns when I close my eyes. Not all the time, but right before going to sleep it looks like visualisations of an LCD trip</p>
<p>[EDIT: Imma leave the typo in there, since y'all like it so much]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are called closed-eye visualizations (CEV) and are pretty typical when going to sleep or in a meditative state. </p>
<p>There are different levels with the first being just random noise that we all experience pretty much all the time. Level 2 is colors, most commonly white, red, and black. Level 3 is what you're experiencing before sleep which is the most common time to do so due to the hypnagogic state during the transition to sleep, sleep paralysis can occur due to the same state. Level 4 is where the fun begins and you start to visualize and manipulate objects and environments within a void, similar to lucid dreaming in that you're aware of this state and are in control if you want to be. Upon opening your eyes you can often retain these visualizations which can be a part of sleep paralysis for the unaware. Level 5 is complete sensory override. I would imagine it's similar to lucid dreaming but I have not achieved this level myself so I have nothing to add that isn't on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>If you're already very aware of these visualizations separate from dreaming then you'll probably have good results if you were to meditate in order to achieve higher levels. It's difficult to get past level 3 and hold it but it does get easier with practice, just try to clear your mind and focus on the experience, and don't fall asleep. I've heard that sensory deprivation is a good tool but I have not tried it to any real extent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be but it can also not be. Advice is if it gets suddenly worse (persistence + intensity) to go get checked but most people wouldn't think twice about it if it didn't hurt or wasnt obviously a problem. Eye issues can be subtle and take a long time to progress, so I definitely recommend regular tests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be surprised by amount of &quot;just the way it is&quot; things that happen around.<br />
For example - we all are radioactive. There's radioactive isotope of carbon - C^14. It's naturally exist everywhere and we are getting it from food. While it's very rare - one C^14 atom per 10^12 normal C^12 atoms, our body contain enough carbon to produce  0.01 mSv/year of radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask your background regarding this explanation of biophotons? It's my understanding that these biophotons are far, far too weak a stimuli to activate photoreceptive cells in the retina. The explanation I had learned was that these photoreceptive cells are inherently volatile and will discharge regularly even in the absence of light (see &quot;eigengrau&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I don’t actually have anything more than a foundation diploma in biology, the reason I know so much about eyes specifically is that I chose to have laser eye surgery about three years ago and that got me into a deep dive reading and researching a lot about eyes!
I’m intrigued by what your saying but could you clarify a few points for me; the retina is a combination of a few types of photoreceptor cells; rods, cones and ipRGC’s, and certainly rods do randomly discharge, somewhat based on temperature I believe, but as far as I’m aware they don’t all randomly discharge, is it rods you’re talking about re: discharging regularly? Also I mentioned ganglion not retina, as I had understood (perhaps mistakenly) that the rods, S, M &amp; L cones and the ipRGC’s all absorb different parts of the light spectrum. Is is possible that you were taught that Rods and cones don’t pick up biophotons? but ipRGC’s do and that might explain it?</p>
