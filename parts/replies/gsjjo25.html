			<div class="markdown"><p>Might also be the way internals work. Not that it would be working on the same fashion, but the same kind of idea as how octopuses and rats (if I remember correctly) can have their organs literally pushed into new locations to allow them to squeeze under doors and through holes. Something kind of akin to this would also make it harder to damage them</p></div>		</li>

<p>Please don’t take this the wrong way, but that’s needlessly vague. Saying it’s due (at least in part) to bugs not being human does nothing to explain why they have those attributes while other non-human entities (say, elephants) don’t. </p>
<p>Just as a small nitpick regarding phrasing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to be overly vague, I just really couldn't think of a better way to phrase it at the time. </p>
<p>Others have given a much better explanation than mine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A mouse falling down a mineshaft is fine, a rat breaks a leg, a human's body is completely broken, a horse goes splat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing with rocks: you drop a boulder from the top of the Eiffel tower, it breaks when it hits the ground. If you drop a grain of sand from the same height, it won't break. Because the larger an object, the bigger the mass/surface area. Which means more friction.</p></div>		</li>
