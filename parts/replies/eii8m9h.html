			<div class="markdown"><p>Smells are volatile gases- they have to be.  Lots of soaps and whatever are solids that sublimate into vapor with no liquid state.</p>
<p>So the gas has been adsorbed into the drywall, and slowly being re released.  It would eventually leave on it its own if vented, much more so if the room is hot.  But its release and/or spontaneous oxidation may have a very long half-life.  Speeds up drastically with heat.</p>
<p>Painting will stop it kinda, but it's sequestered and can leak out for a long time.</p>
<p>Ozone generators create ozone gas which oxidizes and breaks apart amines into things with no smell.  You do not want to breathe ozone.  It has a short half-life before decaying back into harmless oxygen.   Less than an hour, more like 10 min.  </p>
<p>It can adsorb and penetrate into porous surfaces which have trapped smells.</p>
<p>You don't want a dinky off-the-shelf toy.   Industrial ozone generators will flood the room.  Keep it unoccupied and on a timer.  Do not allow it to mix in the AC system with occupied spaces.  &quot;occupied&quot; <em>includes pets!!!</em></p>
<p>In some cases ozone can damage some surfaces</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former apartment management, and yeah, ozone is often the only way to get most smells out. It's not an end-all, though; wall washes/wall &amp; floor kiltz (and obvs full paint, and obvs also including the ceiling, plus flooring replacement), duct cleaning, etc would be need. All of that's minimum, though. I've had units where smoke and/or cat urine doesn't come out even after multiple treatments of all of these. At that point... Yeah. Only body I had in 12 years was 3 days, because he was really reclusive and didn't have anyone else in his building. (Four unit flats.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just renovated a house that people smoked in for decades and it had all sorts of funky smells. I bought an inexpensive ozone generator on Amazon and I’ll be damned if that thing isn’t a miracle worker. However, when it was operating in a room—even with the doors closed—the entire house became uninhabitable until it aired out. It typically only took a single treatment in a room to get rid of most odors, but it won’t work if the area hasn’t been cleaned of whatever substance is causing the smell in the first place (in your cause the offending substance has been removed from the neighboring apartment). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ozone is pretty harmful to organic matter i. The concentrations necessary to attack those organic bits (amines) reaponsible for these smells.</p>
<p>Absolutely evacuate the area being treated (i.e. the entire house unless you babe air tight rooms)</p>
<p>Also remove pets, plants and food if you can (unless its in a fridge... Air tight) this includes aquariums - fish are sensitive to ozone exposure as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its also amazing what the human nose can get used to though. I had to travel to a chemical plant last week that uses butyric acid for reasons, and I swear the whole area smells like vomit. Ask anyone there, they don't smell anything. Meanwhile I spend 2 days thinking everything tastes funny because I havent gotten used to it yet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as a beekeeper I use butyric anhydride, which I believe forms butyric acid when exposed to moisture in the air.  </p>
<p>If you can make the association in your head to butter/cheese instead of vomit it's easier to be around.   After all, it's the main component of butter flavor/smell (&quot;butyric&quot; after all) and is used as an additive in processed cheese foods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, humans are way more sensitive to it for rather obvious reasons. During our time before civilization, it could (and would) save your life to know where someone died, even after the body decayed. Its why we have such a naturally strong aversion to it, as what killed the person could still be in the area</p></div>		</li>
