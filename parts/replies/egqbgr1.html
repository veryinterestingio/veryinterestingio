			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the person loses consciousness really quickly. The problem is, many parts of the brain tissue will stay alive for a long time.<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611007/researchers-are-keeping-pig-brains-alive-outside-the-body/" target="_blank">This article here</a> about experiments on pig brains that gathered from a slaughterhouse after around 4 hours of death says many neurons keep living their daily life even after death. So, the definition of death is actually very tricky.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was no evidence that the disembodied pig brains regained  consciousness. However, in what Sestan termed a “mind-boggling” and  “unexpected” result, billions of individual cells in the brains were  found to be healthy and capable of normal activity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the reason I’ve seen quoted in autopsy reports for “died instantly”. The idea being that if the impact is so severe as to stop your brain from inhaling that it’s also stopped other functioning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to it being a judgment call, how often do they get it wrong? I’ve seen footage of car crashes where horribly mangled victims were still (barely) alive, I can imagine if there’s no witnesses and no fumes to inhale, there’s no clear way to tell how long the suffering endured simply from photographs/position of the victim?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll be honest, I have no idea. I don't have 6 years of forensics/pathology training behind me, I'm mostly an enthusiast. I know they do as thorough a job as they can.</p>
<p>However, just because the victim survived the  collision and died later, doesn't mean the cause of death isn't blunt force trauma, i.e. they succumbed to their injuries.</p>
<p>I suppose I should have been clearer in my original comment too - the list of things on the differential for a person found dead in a car accident includes trauma, smoke inhalation, cardiac arrest, epileptic seizure, positional asphyxiation, etc... and &quot;dead on impact&quot; is not a medicolegal term. Clues show up on autopsy and investigation pointing to one or another, and finally, the &quot;most probable&quot; cause of death is the one listed on the report.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Yes, “dead on impact” isn’t used on death certificates. And the cause of death is, indeed, the most probable when an obvious answer doesn’t exist.
In addition to the inspection of the lungs, medical examiners consider evidence of blood loss (or lack thereof), which would indicate whether the person died “instantly” or if they were alive long enough to bleed. They also consider individual injuries and whether they are objectively survivable (someone else mentioned head injuries). In non-traumatic cases, they will consider things like positioning and the state of the scene, and of course objectively fatal disease findings.
BUT you are so right that there are sometimes innumerable small factors at play and so the judgment call is more like a well-educated guess based on numerous findings from the scene/body/autopsy/history and all that jazz. </p>
