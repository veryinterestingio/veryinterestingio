			<div class="markdown"><p>To build on this, you can also do a (very silly) test, look a the moon upside down, through your legs. when moon looks huge, turn around and look back upside down, it will look small, stand up straight and turn around, its big again.
best to do this by yourself, you’ll look silly doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all of my years, this is the first I've ever heard this. And it has broken my brain. Interesting how if I learned this at 8, I wouldn't question it, but hearing it in my 40s it boggles my mind.  </p>
<p>AND... now that I look it up, they DON'T fit at perigee, and while they fit at apogee, there's not a ton of space to spare.  </p>
<p>And there it is, TIL.</p></div>		</li>
