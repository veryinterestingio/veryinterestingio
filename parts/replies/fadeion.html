<p>A small town is different to a large city.  A small rural town may have the entire town running just fine on rainwater/bore/well water, septic tank systems, and fire.  Little country towns back in the day would often spring up on a railway branch line, but they were also centres of a larger rural district, hence the pub and road.  Before there was petrol, there would be blacksmiths farriers and saddlers to service the horses, bullocks and carts.  The very start of a town might involve petitioning the government for a school, post office and someone opening a general store soon after.</p>
<p>A large city might be 3000 years old, but in a broad sense, you need houses, food and water.  Then the threat of disease will require sewers.  Then clean plumbed water.  Somewhere along the way, the roads will be paved just so there isn't so much mud. After this, centrally plumbed water/electricity/telephone is just modern luxury.</p></div>		</li>
