			<div class="markdown"><p>When you take linear algebra, it’s fun doing 2D and 3D operations and trying to draw them.</p>
<p>It’s uncomfortable when you realize the 4D and higher order operations are as  straightforward as the lower order operations, but impossible to visualize.</p>
<p>Student: How do you draw it?
Instructor: You can’t.
Student: why not?
Instructor: ... because it’s impossible ... Moving on!</p>
<p>You just have to get over it. Or maybe imagine the 4D object playing on a farm out in the country with your childhood dog. Not visually though, that’s impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>99.9999% of people that have seen a tesseract have actually seen a 2D shadow of a 3D shadow of a 4D object on their screens. Or a succession of such 2D shadows. Hell, humans can hardly appreciate 3D objects, with our vision being 2D (stereoscopic -- but 2D) and all. But 3D vision wouldn't work in our universe due to photons not moving in 4 spatial dimensions. 4D beings would presumably have 3D vision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For shapes embedded in 4D it can be possible to imagine animations. Beyond that, you can think of cross sections (which may even be 3 dimensional) or abstractly imagine it as having properties analogous to others, and still calculable. The 3-sphere (embedded in 4D), or a 4-simplex (next up from a tetrahedron, with 5 tetrahedra as its facets), or a hypercube. The animations can even be fairly easy in these cases. </p>
<p>In my area some ‘6 dimensional’ manifolds are very important, and where possible we have rather sophisticated ways to characterise them by special ‘subsurfaces’ within them and certain other invariant properties. We can get a qualitative feel for what their topology is like to guide us. </p>
<p>A lot of the time, infinite dimensional spaces and ‘surfaces’ can also be very important. </p>
<p>But throughout, you can describe these all very rigorously with mathematics. Complete ‘visualisation’ is not realistic (our eyes ‘see’ 2D projections at any one time, after all) but also not necessary. If anything relying on visualisation can lead to misconceptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the problem is we want the 4D and beyond to have some physical application in our world. Far as I know, there is no reason to think it does. Spatial dimensions beyond 3D just come up in complex math equations, there's no empirical evidence that they actually exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a description of a 3d sphere moving through a 2d world would appear in thin air first as a dot, and then as a growing and then reducing circle, basically the cross section as the sphere passes through. If that is accurate, would the same analogy apply to a 4d sphere moving through a 3d world. Would see a dot in thin air first, followed by an expanding sphere and then a diminishing sphere, down to a dot and then vanishing?</p></div>		</li>
