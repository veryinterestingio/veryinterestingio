<p>Or wash your hands. I don’t think it’s specifically recommended for regular people who buy meat to use gloves. The important part is that any virus gets off your hands before those hands touch things. Wearing gloves doesn’t necessarily help with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah for most people (who, in general, seem to think gloves are magic and that germs can't stick to them at all), gloves actually make them <em>less</em> safe because they don't change their gloves or wash their hands in between handling steps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, remove and dispose of the gloves after handling the raw meat and before handling anything else, or yes, thoroughly wash your hands for more than 30 seconds after handling raw meat.</p>
<p>Raw meat typically is very fatty and oily, depending on the type of meat, so it takes very hot water and lots of soap to properly wash it off.</p></div>		</li>
