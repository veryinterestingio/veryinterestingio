			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it would be capable of withstanding the heat. If anything it is even less likely to have a problem on the second go around, if it is still at a good entry angle. If it comes in too sharp on second go around, then there is a risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with an ablative heat shield? I would think that engineers don’t want to add to much excess ablative material to keep weight down. Theoretically, if a reentry craft had exactly enough ablative material for one pass but did make it through the atmosphere on the first pass, it wouldn’t have any material left for subsequent reentries. Just my thoughts, correct me if I’m wrong.</p></div>		</li>
