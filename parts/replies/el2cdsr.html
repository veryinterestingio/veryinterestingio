			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, much as we look the same to an outsider, Identical twins can be quite different. I (and my brother) have met people who don't believe we're identical twins despite the fact that others (not at the same time) cannot get over how alike we are. Especially if you have the two twins together it's a lot easier to figure the differences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most identical twins have very noticeable differences to the people that are close to them. My wife is an identical twin, and I could never in a million years mistake her sister for her. Completely different smiles, different freckles, different body builds, and her sister has a huge birthmark that covers one of her knees. They may have started off identical, but they are far from identical nowadays.</p></div>		</li>
