			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people's stress response is to eat to trigger the dopamine release we get from tasty food. That's actually more common than loss of appetite. It just depends on who you are and your different chemistry I believe. I just got through two weeks of barely eating enough to get myself through each day because I was so stressed and guilt ridden.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s how I gained so much weight to. I just ate and ate and ate. Almost any chance. I’ve heard it has to do with good being a reward kind of thing and making you feel better even if it is for a slight moment but I’m not sure if that’s fully correct or not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a long term breakup that resulted in me losing 20lbs and feeling physically great. Another left me probably 20lbs heavier. The way the body and mind operate is fascinating.</p></div>		</li>
