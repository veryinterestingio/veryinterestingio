			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't mind I would like to ask several additional questions. 1. Why doesnt the Cascadia subduction zone create a trench I thought all subduction zones made trenches. 2. Which countries are likely to get hit by M9 earthquakes in the foreseeable future. 3. If california is moving west why isn't is a subduction zone and will it become one at any point in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to comment as well a cool fact that the Juan de Fuca plate off the north west of america is actually the last remnant of an ancient plate known as the Farallon Plate which has completely subducted underneath the north american plate. </p>
<p>In fact it has been over run so deep by the NA plate that it's mid-ocean ridge itself lies beneath the NA plate in certain areas. It's is suspected to be one of the primary drivers of western american geology over the last 100 Million years and even now that plate is theroized to be related to the formation of the colorado plateau(grand canyon), yellowstone supervolcano, and most of the basin and range geology and topography.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, some important clarifications/corrections to these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Basically because the third plate involved, the Juan de Fuca plate, has been almost completely subducted, thus giving a fracture zone in the form of the Cascade Mountains, which are an average of 100 miles inland. There is also another fracture zone about 200 miles offshore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proximity of the Gorda, Juan de Fuca, and Explorer ridges to the Cascadia subduction zone is one factor in the lack of a clearly defined, deep trench (generally, trench depth will be positively correlated with plate age, i.e. older colder plates subducting will produce deeper trenches), but the larger factor is the extreme thickness of sediment that fills the trench. There is ~3-4 km of sediment in the Cascadia trench (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011GL050712" target="_blank">Heuret et al, 2012</a>) which is on the high end compared to most subduction zones with clearly defined trenches (which are more in &lt;1 km of fill). The fill in the Cascadia trench is largely a result of the geology/geography of the margin, e.g. many other trenches sit adjacent to small island arcs (e.g. Mariana) or have very narrow strips of continental material between the margin and the drainage divide (e.g. much of Nazca), where as the Cascade range is less continuous and the Columbia river has a large catchment, delivering a large volume of sediment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) The same countries that have had them in the past. Indonesia, Japan, US, Canada or Chile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That same Heuret paper goes through an analysis of the controls on megathrust events and suggests that these are more likely in subduction zones with relatively thick sediment fills and neutral upper plate strain conditions (as opposed to compressive or extensional). Within that, the Cascadia, Alaska, Northern Peru, South Chile, Hikarungi (N. New Zealand), Nankai (Japan), Andaman-Sumatra-Java, and Makran (Iran - Pakistan) are all in higher risk. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>3) The western 1/4 of California is moving northwest, not due west. The main boundary, the San Andreas Fault, is a strike-slip fault, with the Pacific Plate moving almost exactly parallel to the North American Plate (the almost is where the &quot;fun&quot; comes from). It will be many thousands of years before any type of subduction zone forms here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discussion of motions of plates is largely irrelevant without specifying a reference frame (i.e. all plates are moving, so to discuss motions we must hold one of them, or something else fixed). In absolute reference frame (e.g. considering the motion of the plates with respect to the mantle) western North America is <a href="http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/ftp/maps/plate_tectonics_simple.morvel.nnr.1.png" target="_blank">moving mostly west</a>. The relative motion of North America to the Pacific is variable along the boundary, but in central California, the velocity vector is essentially parallel to the San Andreas fault (e.g. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB095iB11p17315" target="_blank">Argus &amp; Gordon, 1990</a>). </p>
<p>Additionally, the history of the San Andreas actually records transition from subduction to strike-slip through the propagation of triple junctions to the north and south (e.g. <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article/81/12/3513/6712" target="_blank">Atwater, 1970</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always heard that thrust faults create the largest earthquakes and at higher frequencies than strike-slip faults. Since, I assume, most of the san andreas fault is a strike-slip fault, is california really right around the corner from a 9.0 like they like to imagine or is it more improbable than most believe? Since I've moved here I've realized it's a weird twisted sense of pride for a lot of Californians and they talk about it like they're living on the edge. Seems to me wildfires are going to destroy the state before an earthquake does, your thoughts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers, but one other factor in the lack of a trench is the sedimentation from the Columbia River is heavy enough that it helps to fill in any trench as it forms. This is also thought to be a factor in the tsunami risk from the Cascadia zone...underwater landslides from the collapse of piled up Columbia sediments along the shelf.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, thank you!  What are the main factors driving the heating in the first place?  It can't all be heat that's been in the earth for 4B years, right?  How much of the internal heat comes from radioactive decay, or from tidal interaction with the moon?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>About half of the Earth’s heat flow is primordial, from the collisions of planetary accretion and then the heat liberated when the planet differentiated to form a separate core and mantle. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How much of the internal heat comes from radioactive decay</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty much the other half. It is not well constrained on which provides more of the Earth’s present heat flow — primordial heat or radioactive decay, though a relatively new approach to quantify the latter via the flux of geoneutrinos emitted by the Earth makes it look like very slighty more comes from ongoing radiogenic heating. That is by no means settled though, you can read about the problems in narrowing down the numbers <a href="https://people.earth.yale.edu/sites/default/files/korenaga11nv.pdf" target="_blank">in this 2011 article from Nature Geoscience,</a> which I believe still applies today. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>or from tidal interaction with the moon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is indeed another source of heat being continually generated within the Earth, but it is orders of magnitude smaller than the sources mentioned above and is essentially insignificant for any discussion on Earth’s internal heat budget.</p>
<p>I have a textbook (which frustratingly gives no source references throughout) but states that <em>”The current rate of heating generated within the Earth by tidal distortion is estimated at 3 x 10¹⁹ J per year”</em> — which is about 0.05 terawatts, whereas Earth’s total internal heat flow comes to about 47 terawatts - so about 0.1% of the total heat flow or thereabouts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The earth is trying to cool down, so heat wants to leave the earth. A large portion of heat in the crust is due to radioactive decay of K (potassium), but in the mantle and deeper it is mostly latent or residual heat from early earth formation. I havent heard of the moon affecting the heat budget at all, i dont think the gravitational affect is strong enough to have any significant affect on the earths internal movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of radioactive decay also occurring in the mantle, from certain isotopes of K, U and Th. Although the crust has a higher proportion of these per kg of rock, the mantle is such a large volume of the Earth compared to the crust that most of the Earth’s radiogenic heat is generated within the mantle. The core contributes very little radiogenic heat as these elements were largely excluded from the iron-nickel phases present in the core. </p>
<p>Tidal forces in the Earth-Moon system do cause heating within the Earth, but they are essentially insignificant compared to the contributions from primordial and radiogenic heat.</p></div>		</li>
