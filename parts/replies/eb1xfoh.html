			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah. I'm pretty sure that blowing on the cartridges slightly re-ordered the atoms on the metal connectors so they were more conductive. This is very similar to how alchemy works, just on a micro scale, and without the need for complex reactors and what not. Blowing also 'shook loose' the data that was contained within the plastic cartridge, so that it could flow as intended from the cartridge to the console, much in the way water would flow from a pitcher into a glass. Finally, blowing into the cartridge also worked very much like 'scrubbing bubbles', in that your breath was like a miniature army that rushed into the cartridge and removed any free radical enemy troops that had tried to set-up road blocks on the connectors. So, in summary, blowing actually was probably way more useful than any theory involving actual physics. Your childhood was not a lie - it was practically magical!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it did deposit a bit of moisture from your breath on the electrical contacts.  The moisture makes the problem worse in the long run, but in the moment, might have provided additional conductivity between the cartridge and console.  <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/12589/did-blowing-nintendo-cartridges-really-help" target="_blank">http://mentalfloss.com/article/12589/did-blowing-nintendo-cartridges-really-help</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly correct. The other reason it helps is the time required to make the swap allows the batteries to rest and redistribute the chemicals inside.</p>
<p>The &quot;blow on it&quot; part of the cartridge process did two things. It cleared any dust that might be on the contacts and the moisture  helped close the circuit if the contacts didn't sit flush. (Water is a decent conductor after all)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Respectful counterpoint:</p>
<p>The thing with resting is it depends on a few things; battery chemistry and whatnot (with liquid chemical batteries like wet cell lead acid batteries being more susceptible), but primarily it depends on how hard the battery is being worked before you rest it. In the sort of low drain devices where people mess with the batteries and actually get a noticeable result; clocks, small toys, and suchlike, the draw is so low, resting wouldn't be doing a whole lot. In something like a TV remote (unless we're talking fancy Bluetooth remotes or something of that ilk) and a decent number of kids toys that take a few batteries, there's no power flowing at all until you press a button, so there's no resting to be done. In those instances, it's simply making a better connection at the terminals that makes the difference. </p>
<p>A flashlight however, which is relatively high power, you may well get a result that is partly down to resting the battery though if you switch off and leave it for a bit, that's true, if you've left it on in your pocket or something and it's drained it.</p>
<p>The blowing thing though, I'm going to respectfully disagree.</p>
<p>Blowing on a cartridge, sure it would remove some dust, but it still wouldn't be as effective as the physical wiping of the terminal on the connector. Try blowing dust off an ornament or something like that; there's no way you'll get it cleaner than you would with a light wipe of your finger, there'll always be a fine residual amount left. </p>
<p>The moisture was far more damaging ultimately than any possible benefit you'd get from its conductivity. Pure water, after all, is non conductive; it's only dissolved salts and other contaminates that give it the conductivity. Salts, as you'll know if you're in one of the places in the world where the roads get salted in winter, does wonders for turning nice shiny smooth metal into a corroded mess. </p>
<p>Metal on metal contact would easily win against any liquid contact when it comes to electrical conductivity, and if the contact between terminal and connector wasn't there in the first place, the liquid couldn't make any difference anyway. </p>
<p>What blowing certainly would be achieving though, would be transferring moisture to the internal connections in the console, which would exponentially speed up the formation of non-conductive corrosion.</p>
<p>Blowing into them might have been a widespread practice - I did it myself back before I knew better, but there's a really good reason why every manufacturer put warnings against blowing into the cartridge slots or cartridges themselves. The removal and reinsertion of the cartridge was what was doing the work, really, and would've worked whether or not you blew into it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid, I had never seen those warnings on cartridges. My cartridges still work, but I donâ€™t know what to use to wipe off the terminals if not canned air. Would a tissue work, or would that do some static electricity stuff? How about microcloth or something?</p></div>		</li>
