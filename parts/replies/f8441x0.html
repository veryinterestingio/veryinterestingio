			<div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason probably. The urge to poop, hence holding it back, costs you energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the rectal ampulla is lined with smooth muscle, expanding it causes it to contract—the same principle applies to your bladder, too. However, holding the sphincter and preventing the release of feces stored in the ampulla forces it to stop contracting and stay in the enlarged position. But as soon as another portion of feces is moved into the ampulla, the same thing happens. Because there's a limit to how far the muscle can actually stretch, there comes a time when you simply have to go, and no sphincter can hold the brown wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Peristalsis, involuntary movements of the longitudinal and circular muscles, primarily in the digestive tract but occasionally in other hollow tubes of the body, that occur in progressive wavelike contractions. Peristaltic waves occur in the esophagus, stomach, and intestines.&quot;</p>
<p>Basically, a few times a day your entire digestive tract makes a spontaneous, long, muscular, snakelike contraction that moves things along. You can't really feel it happening until things are near the exit so to speak, thats why you get the feeling of a &quot;poop wave&quot; moving through your lower abdomen a couple times a day (maybe, depending on the person) when it's near time to 'vacate'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't know being hungry used up energy. I always thought hunger was the the general feeling for the lack of energy from not having eaten for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be surprised if simply experiencing hunger uses anything more than a negligible amount of energy being a basic hormonal response. I think the stomach and epsilon cells of pancreas secrete it and the brain picks it up and interprets it as hunger, barely any energy used.</p></div>		</li>
