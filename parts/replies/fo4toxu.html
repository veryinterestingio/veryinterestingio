			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, transmissibility is the only selective pressure that viruses face. So long as the virus is able to spread, the outcome of its host is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Insofar as fatality impacts transmissibility -- that is, the virus kills the host before it has a chance to spread -- then high fatality is maladapative. But there are plenty of scenarios where a virus could remain highly transmissible while also being highly fatal.</p>
<p>A long period of latency would do the trick. Imagine HIV but transmissible through droplets and aerosols. Or even Covid-19 with a higher fatality rate across demographic groups. There's nothing preventing such a virus from evolving, per se.</p>
<p>One virus that epidemiologists and health officials have been watching very closely is the H5N1 bird flu. It has been transmitted from birds to humans on a handful of occasions, and the case fatality rate is about 50%. If it were to become transmissible via human-to-human contact, the resulting pandemic could be catastrophic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mumps can (rarely) cause a drop in sperm count, but it is extremely uncommon for that to be sufficient for sterility.  </p>
<p>I also think several STDs can reduce or eliminate fertility as a side effect.  </p>
<p>Basically what you would expect. Infection of the gonads is bad for your gonads, but pathogens don't have a reason to eliminate fertility as an end goal so it is as rare for them to cause sterility as it is for them to cause specific, total failure in any other organ.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps a type of human papillomavirus or herpesvirus is a good candidate then. A virus that can spread via mucous membranes or skin to skin contact, can lay dormant/undetected for years, is never really removed from your body, and has the potential to cause cancer of the gonads or sterility. There are tons of different strains, too. Most people get at least one of them at some point in their lives, especially chicken pox and common warts. If the HPV that causes common warts also caused cervical cancer, it could be very, very bad news.</p></div>		</li>
