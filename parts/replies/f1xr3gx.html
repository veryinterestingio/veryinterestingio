			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Worked at a water plant and the tanks were usually kept ~40% full in the evening and filled overnight; they were usually allowed to drop pretty low at least once a week to ensure chlorine levels stayed above the legal requirement.</p>
<p>Occasionally they would need to be cleaned to help keep turbidity down, but that was infrequent. </p>
<p>A few times I was called out to assist in emptying a tank whose chlorine levels dropped too low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do this too, a large cylindrical tank.  It made a sound that is almost indescribable.  We also used to throw handfuls of gravel up in the air over the corrugated steel roof of the nearby truck transfer dock, which sounded like machine gun fire and always pissed off the handful of guys working there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A private tank house, not a public water tank, but this post reminded me of something that happened when I was a kid.  We lived on a rural ranch, had a private water well that pumped water up into a large tank on the top of a 'tank house.'  Good system, worked fine for years.  One day we noticed a weird taste to the water so Dad climbed the ladder to the tank.  Found a decomposing barn owl floating in our water tank, evidently flew in through a hole in the wire screen that allowed air to circulate to cool the tank room.  Big yuck.  Tank was drained and disconnected from pumping system, thereafter we drank water pumped out of the well through pipes directly into the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ick. We occasionally had birds/mice get stuck and drown in the flocking tanks (once a dog =( ) but even then they weren't there for very long. And the filters and post chlorine shock was after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, you'd just add more chlorine for that problem.  If there was a different problem, like say high turbidity, it'd usually be dumped into the sewer system.</p></div>		</li>
