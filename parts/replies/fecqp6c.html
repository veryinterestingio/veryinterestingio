			<div class="markdown"><p>Ssds and mechanical drives have entire systems that help manage the data being written. So basically, what's happening is the system telling the SDD what to write or what to read and it does.</p>
<p>An SD card on the other hand is simply the memory and methods to write and read. Most of the equipment needed to write to an SD card are on the device, while the SSD has them embedded.</p>
<p>A core difference is that the SD card is a single memory, but an SSD is like having multiple SD cards together, you can write data to multiple cells at the same time, so you can write more.</p>

<p>For one, the reason that apps can't be installed to SD cards has absolutely nothing to do with the controller on the card: it's a limitation of the OS.</p>
<p>Second, there <em>are</em> MicroSD cards that do wear levelling using the onboard microcontroller:</p>
<p><a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/27619/is-it-true-that-a-sd-mmc-card-does-wear-levelling-with-its-own-controller" target="_blank"><a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/27619/is-it-true-that-a-sd-mmc-card-does-wear-levelling-with-its-own-controller" target="_blank">https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/27619/is-it-true-that-a-sd-mmc-card-does-wear-levelling-with-its-own-controller</a></a> </p>
<p>(The link is about SD cards, but here's a line of MicroSD cards that does wear levelling:  <a href="http://solidstatedisks.co.uk/Downloads/SanDisk_Industrial_Removable_SD_MicroSD.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://solidstatedisks.co.uk/Downloads/SanDisk\_Industrial\_Removable\_SD\_MicroSD.pdf" target="_blank">http://solidstatedisks.co.uk/Downloads/SanDisk\_Industrial\_Removable\_SD\_MicroSD.pdf</a></a> )</p>
<p>They don't all do it, but the claim that the microcontroller onboard the card just isn't capable of it, due to being too small, is false.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is close but not entirely accurate. More technical explanation first, and then ELi5. </p>
<p>There are in fact really good SD cards that can read/write at upwards of 300MB/s (and they're not even <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lexar-Professional-2000x-64GB-UHS-II/dp/B012PL6C62/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1579011197&amp;refinements=p_n_feature_keywords_browse-bin%3A3294062031&amp;s=computers&amp;sr=1-6&amp;th=1" target="_blank">that hard to find</a>). The main issue, as others have pointed out, is that SD cards are not optimized for the sort of random read/write processes that are involved in running software off of the storage. This is partially because it is all in 1 block, as opposed to being parallel and partially because of how the read/write process is actually managed-by the SSD on the one hand but by the device in the case of an SD card.</p>
<p>The Eli5 is to think of it in terms of actual storage. Imagine you want to store things in a warehouse. SSD warehouse and SD warehouse are both the same size, and with the same size openings to get things in and out. But SD warehouse is just that-you put things in, they aren't very organized, it's a mess if you start pulling things in and out without keeping track of them. Good for putting things in all at once, and then getting them out all at once, for ex. SSD warehouse comes with a logistics manager who will tell you where to put things, help you find them etc. and with lots of shelves and compartments so you can unload many different things, organize them, and pick them up in parallel.</p>
<p>A good video on this by LTT (entertaining while still doing a good job on the technical side): <a href="https://youtu.be/BrcBKpE9aQg" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/BrcBKpE9aQg</a> Where he tries to run Windows off of one of the aforementioned super speedy SD cards. Skip to 6:20 for the actual results and explanation, but basically it's still super slow (up to 9 second response time!) for the reasons outlined above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true with the new QLC Nand, i got a Samsung 860 QVO for 99€, that's a 1tb SSD. Sure QLC is a bit slower than the the other techs but it's barely noticeable. I'm going to replace my hard drives slowly but surely with those ones, it's perfect for my games storage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. If a hard drive is damaged you can still recover the data if it is important. You can't recover data from a corrupted SSD. The best option is still to use some 256-512Gb SSD for the OS and programs and maybe some games, and a hard drive for data storage.</p></div>		</li>

Although another huge advantage of an NVMe ssd over an HDD is the IOPS (Input/Output Operations/s) which can be as high as 500k compared to ~70 (yes, just 70, no k) on an HDD.</p></div>		</li>
