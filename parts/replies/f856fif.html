You commonly need to program to implement a technical concept versus just learning a specific language. In my <strong>opinion</strong> this is because you can take a certificate, evening course, or 2 year program, to learn to program in a specific language, as well as that languages are constantly evolving and changing such that it is hard to stay ahead as a learning institute.</p>
<p>This means you learn Internet routing protocols, data storage algorithms, programming architecture, etc. These result in it being possible that a computer scientist can have a career in a more general technical capacity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architect or Engineer: designing systems at a higher level</li>
<li>Analyst or Consultant: Translating business requirements into technical requirements </li>
<li>Administrator: Monitoring existing systems and keeping them running</li>
<li>Programmer or developer: Writing actual code</li>
<li>
<p>Management: Managing a mixed team of the above</p>

<p>A lot of graduates do go down the programming route but computer science can be a stepping stone into other fields.  A graduate degree like lawyer, politician, or masters of business, may lean on a CPSC undergrad to get work in a niche field and get a related pay bonus (e.g. Laws around personal data or becoming a CMO/CTO). A different undergrad may do a double major to also get employment such as a math or physics degree (e.g. programming models).</p>
<p>I have friends who now work in Sales, management, or business roles in tech companies due to their technical background. Programming is not the end-all of a CPSC degree.  On the other hand, nothing wrong with designing/writing software.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DevOps is pretty big these days.  The term is a bit overly nebulous, and different organizations use &quot;DevOps&quot; to mean slightly different things, but typically it's a sort of bridge between product development and IT/deployment.  As such, you need a wide variety of computing skills to be effective -- from coding to build to coding to deployment.  Because of this, good DevOps engineers are in very high demand; you have to know a whole lot more than your average cut-and-paste junior coder.</p>
<p>I do a lot of work in the realm of DevOps, and I'm routinely dealing with everything from debugging product code (and letting development know how and why they screwed up when they do), to how a product interacts with the operating system (so things like how runtimes allocate memory, system performance, thread and process allocation, etc.) to how an architecture is deployed to security issues to building packages to configuration and deployment (the latter two of which are handled by a separate operations team, but as the liaison between development and ops I have to know about everything, and often get to set the standards they both have to comply with).  Because of all of this, the job requires both an intimate knowledge of the languages and tools used, the OS and hardware environments involved, how products are built, installed, and deployed, and the ability to coordinate with multiple business units within the organization.  Because of this, I report to a level higher up than most normal developers, and am in a position where I have a say in multiple products developed by multiple different units within the organization.</p>
<p>I don't often get the joy of implementing cool and interesting algorithms, but at the same time I don't deal with a lot of boring boilerplate code common in a lot of business applications, and am frequently called into to debug odd low-level system interactions that development can't figure out on their own (although this latter part is likely less because I'm in DevOps, and more because I have a lot of background and education in this area).  So overall things balance out somewhat.  HTH!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started off as a pure developer, and even got some DBA certification under my belt at one point.  Both of which help now when I have to liaison with developers or our actual DBAs, as they learn quickly I'm not just some glorified build jockey -- I know as much (and sometime more) than they do.  In fact, there have been a number of times when development has got stuck trying to resolve some sort of persistent low-level problem, only for management to bring me in to look at it and let development know what they're doing wrong (they know I have no fear of virtually reading and debugging streams of assembly instructions if I have to).  And I love seeing their eyes when I sit down and whiteboard for them how something like LVM thinpools are used to create thinly provisioned filesystems for containers -- it's as if I were teaching them magic.</p>
<p>It's easy to become a specialist in our industry -- but its a lot harder to become a really good <em>generalist</em>.  &quot;Full stack&quot; developers often stop as soon as they hit the runtime environments underlying their code, but a good generalist has to understand the interactions at even the lower levels below the application layers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate on the pathway you took to get where you are? </p>
<p>Right now I'm teaching a vocational IT program for high school students. I'm not sure if it's right for me. At the same time I didn't really pursue internship opportunities in tech as much as I should have.</p>
<p>How do you recommend marketing myself and seeing what opportunities exist?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Part education, part many years of experience, and part dumb luck.</p>
<p>For education, I have both a BSc. (Hons) and an MSc. in Computer Science.  However, I didn't go directly from finishing my undergrad to getting my graduate degree -- I worked for several years in-between for a well-known Fortune 500 technology company, and also ran a well regarded open source project (which was based on the output of my undergrad thesis).</p>
<p>Experience wise I had my work history, but I also started programming back in the 8-bit era when you often had to know a lot about the low-level details of the systems you were programming for.  While not relevant today, that interest in low-level details of how systems work remained over the years -- as per my flair, my undergrad area of study was in systems software.  I thrive on those low-level details on how different OS's and runtime environments operate and integrate with the hardware, and curiosity gives me an edge.</p>
<p>But for my current position, dumb luck was probably one of the biggest factors.  It didn't feel that way at first -- I had taken a job with a startup that needed my expertise, but the company turned out to be having a lot of problems, and it wasn't long for this world.  People I knew warned me away from that job, but my wife and I had a new baby and the offer was for more than I had most recently been making.  Eight months after starting, it was bought out in a fire sale by a much larger corporation that wanted our technology.  But the project failed in the end, and it was eventually dropped, with the remaining staff let go.</p>
<p>I was the only one to survive the purge, and the reason for that went back to what I wrote earlier about curiosity.  When the mega-corporation that bought us out decided to sunset the project and project team, they did it in stages, and started by letting go our local manager.  We only had a handful of developers left on the project at that time, and they wanted to keep us for a few months to do some cleanup and maintenance.  I didn't actually have much to do, so I decided to undertake my own projects, and do the things I had long advocated that we should do -- vastly more innovative than the maintenance stuff we had been focussing on for far too long.  This got noticed by someone in senior management, and they asked me if I'd be willing to head up a project along the same lines for another project family within the company.  I took them up on it, and in the intervening years more project came under my purview, and was most recently put in charge of helping fix up problems and enhance the projects of another company they had acquired.</p>
<p>Getting to the place where I could do what I wanted was pretty much just dumb luck in the end.  I took a job people I respected warned me away from, and even though they were right to warn me, in the end purely out of boredom of having little to do while the project team crumbled around me I decided to do some stuff that just happened to catch the right attention.</p>
<p>So, my advice based on my own experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>Education opens a lot of doors.  Be willing to get as much as you can.  </li>
<li>Be curious.  Learn the details of how things work, and not just how to write code.  When you call <code>new FileInputStream(someFile);</code>, what happens?  How does the ClassLoader find the FileInputStream class?  What system calls does it make to open the file?  What does the filesystem do to find and read the file to open?  How and what memory is allocated to handle the data being read?  How does the hard drive queue and marshal the I/O?  Anyone can write <code>new FileInputStream(someFile);</code>, but fewer people actually <em>understand</em> what happens in the background when you do so.  </li>
<li>Get to know some technologies that few people know about.  Even some that are somewhat obscure or old, especially if they have commercial applications.  I got one job because I had extensive experience with OS/2 (and this was <em>after</em> OS/2s heyday had come and gone).  Experience with some bleeding-edge stuff helps as well.  It can be hard in the early days to know which bleeding edge technology is going to win and which one is going to lose, but my work with programming in Java when it was still in public beta worked out really well -- when others were just getting started, I already had a few years of experience under my belt and projects to show for it.  </li>
<li>Undertake your own projects.  Get a Github account, join some open source projects, and get your code out there.  Have something you can point at in your resume, and use it to network.  One paid project I once worked on was purely thanks to my old open source project -- a research group out of a major university wanted to use it, and hired me on as a consultant.  Working on projects like these can show pretty publicly that you can work well in a team and with other people, and so can look good on a resume.</li>
</ol>
<p>FWIW, I never did any internships during either my undergrad or my graduate work.  While the option was there, I didn't feel it was for me.  I don't feel like it ever hurt me any (although I should admit to &quot;dumb luck&quot; again, in that I completed my undergrad work just when the Y2K hiring bonanza was ramping up.  Those were good times to be graduating -- I had five different companies willing to make me an offer at the time).  And now I'm in a spot where I work a job I enjoy, where I have a lot of autonomy and control over what I work on and how it gets done, and where I work 100% from home.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I could replicate it 100% again if I tried, but hopefully this gives you some insights.  This...went on for much longer than I had originally anticipated, so hopefully if you've made it to this point you feel like you've been able to glean something useful out of it.  HTH!</p></div>		</li>
