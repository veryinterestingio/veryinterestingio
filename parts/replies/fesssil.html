<p>Bottom line is just don't get caught in an avalanche. Take a course if you have ANY inclination of going into the backcountry; AST 1 is a few hundred bucks and a couple days and you will be much better off afterwards.</p>
<p>You'll be taught how to recognize avalanche terrain and the likelihood of one happening given the conditions, how to read an avalanche forecast and make your own decisions off of it, and then how to use a avi beacon, probe, and shovel to rescue someone caught in an avalanche.</p>
<p>Supposedly you can &quot;swim&quot; while the avalanche is happening, but I know several people who have been in avalanches who say that doesn't work; you're too disoriented to &quot;swim&quot; in the right direction anyways. As soon as the avalanche stops, the snow basically turns into concrete and you're stuck. Outrunning is an option I suppose but chances are you'll be knocked down and caught. This was mentioned in the course I took, but only because someone asked the same question you did. It wasn't part of the syllabus because there's really not much you can do asides from hope your buddies will come get you in time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.avalanche.ca/" target="_blank">https://www.avalanche.ca/</a> (canada) and <a href="https://avalanche.org/" target="_blank">https://avalanche.org/</a> (states) are reliable forecast websites. I personally don't go in anything worse than moderate, and even then I'll choose the terrain I ski in very conservatively. Can't stress enough that the bottom line of avalanche safety is just don't get caught in one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The snow actually gets hot enough from friction in larger slides to the point it melts slightly and then when it stops it freezes back up, so its not like concrete, its basically packed ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're in it, there's not much you can do, but if you have any control you try your best to move out of it either to the left or right and stay above it. If you see it coming towards you you absolutely get out of the way if you can, absolutely don't stay put and take cover. If youre watching it and you see someone in it, follow where that person is as long as you possibly can and once it's subsided you make sure it's safe, and then you get the beacons out and start searching, using the last seen location as a reference point. There's way more to it than this but if it's something you're interested in or spend any time in the Backcountry I'd seriously recommend taking an avy course.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This will prevent the avalanche from happening when you are already in the area.</p></div>		</li>
