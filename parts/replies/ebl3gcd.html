<p>I had a feedback issue with my gaming headset where I heard a single echo of only my own mic and it produced a similar effect. I had to preplan the entire sentence beforehand and make a concerted effort to <em>turn off my ears</em> and spit the whole thing out at once. My online conversations became extremely terse.</p>
