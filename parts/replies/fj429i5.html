			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the sort of metaphor we're talking about. Something like &quot;don't judge a book by its cover&quot; is very straightforward. However, when you start looking at art, metaphors aren't always that obvious -- in fact, when the artist allows the metaphor to become that obvious, the art itself risks being seen as hammy at best, propaganda at worst, because what you're looking at is being made intentionally subservient to what the abstract idea is supposed to mean.</p>
<p>Backing it up, &quot;don't judge a book by its cover&quot; is on the literal level a scenario so trite that you can't find much meaning in it unless you go into the abstract with it. In art, though, what's happening on the literal level is usually meant to be at least partially appreciated on its own merits -- perhaps not exclusively, but at least partially. In fact, one could argue that if the story doesn't succeed on a literal level first and foremost, the abstraction's credibility is harmed.</p>
<p>Take the first 10 minutes of Up. You're not supposed to be thinking that what's shown is sad because it represents life-altering disappointment and the idea of being left behind after the death of  a loved one or whatnot. You're supposed to be thinking it's sad because what happens to the characters on a literal level is fucking sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it straight forward though? I'm not an English native speaker and not familiar with the saying &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover&quot;. To me, it leaves open different levels of concreteness where you start abstracting. It could mean that you should not draw early conclusions, or it could mean something more specific, having to do with the fact that the cover is very likely not made by the author, so the packaging is misleading because there are many people involved. I don't think it's straight forward to 100% nail it down from that one single example. When it comes to the exact meaning, often it's just learned from its contextual use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like, virtually every native English speaking American would understand the above idiom, or others like &quot;when the cat's away the mice will play.&quot; I believe every language has such idioms.</p></div>		</li>
