			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny you mention Tide. My father famously, before he married my mother, would wash his hair in Tide powder detergent, because then he had 1 fewer product he needed to buy (it was the 70's, and he was basically a drunk bachelor factory worker. I'm sure he smelled fresh every day, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My Mom has the oiliest skin and hair I’ve ever seen on a human.  I remember when I was a kid we were quite poor and instead of using shampoo she washed her hair with Octagon dish soap.  There was always some sitting in the shower.  Luckily she bought 99 cent Suave for the rest of us, it wasn’t much better probably but it had to be better than that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most accurate comment here. I’m in an intense cosmetology program right now and we just did a very thorough unit on the importance of ingredients and ph balance when choosing a shampoo for a client. It’s amazing how the slightest change of ingredient formulation can completely change the outcome of someone’s hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well clarifying shampoos have chelating agents to remove any type of metallic deposits like from swimming in a chlorinated pool or having hard water in your house but it’s not something to be used everyday.
A lot of shampoos have added keratin protein to strengthen the hair.
Probably the biggest thing is a Thio-neutralizing shampoo which is used after someone has a chemical service like a perm of a relaxer. It’s more acidic than a normal shampoo because a thio relaxer or perm is extremely alkaline with a ph of 10 so an acidic shampoo is needed to neutralize the reaction. It also removes all the remaining chemical residue from the hair.
So much of it depends on factors individual to the client, hair texture, hair density, oily or dry, chemical processes, hard water or soft water.</p></div>		</li>
