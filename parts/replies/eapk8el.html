			<div class="markdown"><p>While I understand that directionality breaks down, doesn't the hard cap of the speed of light give us a way to determine velocity? If one object was actually stationary (god's eye view, hypothetical) and one object was actually moving at, say, half the speed of light, wouldn't we able to make measurements to differentiate them in some objective sense? For example, wouldn't one of them appear to be, I dunno, &quot;heavier&quot; or somesuch, because of how the effects of relativity and the effects of gravity are similar?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remove the word 'actually'.  There is no such thing as moving actually half the speed of light.  You could only say - I'm moving half the speed of light relative to that star over there.  There is no objective sense.  None.  That's what relativity is all about - the lack of any objective frame of reference.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is no experiment that can be done to prove one frame of reference is more objective than another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this ...</p>
<p>Suppose you were moving at half the speed of light.  You might suppose that the light moving away from you in the direction you are traveling is only moving half the speed of light relative to you (just like if you were moving at 60mph on the highway, and were passed by a car going 100mph, they'd be moving 40mph relative to you), and the light moving away from you in the aft direction would be moving and 1.5c relative to you.  But that isn't in fact what we observe.  No matter how fast you think you are moving, light always moves away from you at the speed of light.  From your own point of view, it would be as though you were not moving at all.</p>
<p>And if you were on that star moving away from you at half c, light would also be moving away from you at the speed of light.</p>
<p>To put it another way, even if everyone else (in other reference frames) observed you to be traveling at 0.5c, you would feel as though you were not moving at all, except relative to those observers - which would all appear to you to be traveling at 0.5 c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're talking about is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reference frame 1: object 1 stationary, object 2 moving at half the speed of light, object 2 experiencing funky relativistic effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But without changing anything about the physical situation, you can shift to a different reference frame:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reference frame 2: object 2 stationary, object 1 moving at half the speed of light, object 1 experiencing funky relativistic effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or even</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reference frame 3: both objects moving at 99% of the speed of light, both objects experiencing even funkier relativistic effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's all relative, so no perspective is more correct than any other. You can pick whatever reference frame you want and things ultimately still work out the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hard cap of the speed of light wouldn't give you anything.</p>
<p>Let me give u an example.</p>
<p>If we take the earth's frame of reference, and a rocketship travels at 0.99c w.r.t to the earth's FOR, a light beam from the rocketship would look like it's travelling at c. From the rocketship's FOR, the same light beam would still be travelling at c, even though from earth's FOR both the light beam and the rocketship are travelling at similar speeds.</p>
<p>What this means is that the speed of light does not give you any reference point to determine velocity. No matter how fast or slow you are going w.r.t. a frame of reference, light still travels at c to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it basically means 'constant inertia' then?</p>
<p>No hang on I mean constant momentum. I'll have to go back to the difference between the two. Never quite had that pinned down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that why satellites &quot;age&quot; more slowly (their clocks will decouple with earth clocks)?  The acceleration?  I always wondered if speed is relative, why do they say an astronaut would age more slowly than someone remaining on earth.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s mostly because of a similar (but opposite) effect caused by the warping of spacetime, i.e. gravity, as described by general relativity. Both effects are in play. </p></div>		</li>
