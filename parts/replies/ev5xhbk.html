			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me, from just exposure to genetic tests, that while we describe a gene (allele) as &quot;causing this effect&quot;, it's pretty common for an allele to actually affect a variety of seemingly unrelated systems in different ways. Almost every time a genetic scientist has described the effect on an allele, there's almost always an aside about the other things it affects.</p>
<p>As a programmer, this doesn't surprise me. DNA is the most ugly source code imaginable. It's been randomly maintained for hundreds of millions of years and it appears that the vast majority is just &quot;commented out&quot; stuff that was replaced, but left &quot;just in case&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's highly variable depending on the type of gene you're looking at, but yes, pleiotropy is fairly common.  This is especially true for very &quot;high-level&quot; genes like the ones involved in the earliest stages of development.  And I think that is an interesting analogy about code.  Though to take it a step further, evolution can be sort of like trying to change your code from one function to another, except every time you alter a character you're still forced to compile and have it run successfully, with no failures allowed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tell people the reason that we have so much DNA in common with, say, pigs is that we're simply the Human front end app built on the mammal tech stack and a pig is just a different app built on the same stack.</p>
<p>The more I've written code to detect and call variants, the more I laugh at how much the genetic scientist work flow resembles the way I have to work with undocumented legacy code.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That kind of relies on an extremely loose definition of &quot;being used&quot;.  The <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/" target="_blank">ENCODE project</a> for example has suggested that up to 80% of the genome is functional, but their definition of &quot;function&quot; includes any observed protein binding activity in a region of DNA, which could easily be due to off-target effects or just non-specific binding.  For example, there are enzymes that scan through DNA checking for mismatched bases, and these could theoretically be found pretty much anywhere.  This 80% figure also includes lots of selfish genetic elements like retrotransposons which, while technically having a function (copying themselves and sticking the copies in other parts of your genome), have no particular effect on the cell as a whole (unless they break something important).  While it is clear that a lot of non-coding DNA is functional, it's still definitely a stretch to say that <em>all</em> of it is functional in my opinion (and that of many others; I recommend <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/9/7/1880/3952726" target="_blank">this paper</a> for a theoretical discussion of the subject for instance).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make a short version with the original example: being dominant doesn't make having 6 fingers &quot;better&quot;, it just makes it &quot;easier to see&quot;. In fact, if it was &quot;bad&quot; (selected against in biology parlance), being dominant would make it go away faster because it was &quot;easier for selection to see&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also like to point out that most mutations are neutral - they do not offer any significant advantage or disadvantage, at least initially. Sometimes though these mutations will spread and on their own or combined with other neutral mutations can provide advantages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that most mutations are generally neutral, but I'm not sure what you mean about how they can provide advantages on their own; by definition, this would make them non-neutral.  Though I think it is valid to say that an initially neutral mutation can become beneficial (or detrimental) in a different environment, since selection is always context-dependent.</p></div>		</li>
