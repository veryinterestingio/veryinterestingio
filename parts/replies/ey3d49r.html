But it probably formed way further out, closer to the orbit of Uranus and then kept sucking up dust and elements until it reached its current location.  </p>
<p>So there wouldn't have been any time for solar wind to push the lighter elements out to where Jupiter formed.  They were already there, and Jupiter was already fairly close to its current size.</p>
<p>What does seem unique about our solar system is that the inner plants may have started forming not all that long after Jupiter.  By &quot;sucking up&quot; all the stray dust in *their* area, they removed the main source of friction that would cause other planets like Jupiter to spiral even closer to the sun.  That's why you'd see gas giants the size of Jupiter orbiting closer than the Earth does in other star systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think astronomers get caught up in the origination perspective and think &quot;it all started when X happened&quot;  and their theories start
from there.  </p>
<p>In reality, you are totally right, jupiter, saturn, the sun and probably all the other planets and (hundreds) of planets that didnt make it were all formed to some degree before the sun ignited.  That should be obvious since our solar system had 2nd/3rd generation elements, which means we basically built our solar system on top of the ruins of earlier systems.   </p>
<p>The soup that made up the early system was a mix of large asteroids, protoplanets and perhaps gas giants that eventually coalesced into our sun and current planets.</p>
<p>It most likely was <em>not</em> a homogenous mix of hydrogen.  I think that is a dumb theory that wont survive scrutiny.</p></div>		</li>
