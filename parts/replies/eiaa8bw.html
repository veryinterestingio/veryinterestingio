			<div class="markdown"><p>Shiiittt. I think I might have sleep apnea. I'm at the upper end of the healthy BMI, but I'm in the process of losing some weight right now. I'll report back in a few months and hopefully I don't need a damn CPAP machine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This!!! Also there are rarer things like have a small chin, large tongue, stroke, or large tonsils that can contribute. Talk to a doctor and let them know if you snore a lot and are always tired! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was at over 100 incidents an hour... meaning I was losing O2 and my brain was &quot;waking up&quot; over 100 times an hour.  It meant a terrible quality of life, constantly falling asleep at my desk or even nodding off at the wheel; always dead tired no matter how long I slept.</p>
<p>I eventually ended up in the ER for related issues, and got a sleep therapist, had a clinic test, and got a BiPaP machine.  Quality of life improved as soon as my body could get used to falling asleep with a mask on my face pushing a ton of air into me (took a bit!).  Now I can't imagine life without it.</p>
<p>I used to snore loud enough to wake the neighbors, now I'm dead silent.  Plus there is a big CPAP/BiPAP community online, and my machine has all sorts of cool data for me to see about how I sleep!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome to hear! I think it's fairly mild for me. I am pretty sure my father has one of those machines because his snoring was insane. Sleep is so important, so it's good you are actually getting some now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True.</p>
<p>My dad snored his entire life and got the machine which has a mask and forces the air go down when he sleeps couple of years ago.</p>
<p>At first he couldn't even sleep with it, but now he can't sleep without it, even if he does he will wake up, because no matter how long he will sleep, he will always wake up tired without it.</p>
<p>Quite a life changer, since now his sleep is bearable within the same house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been snoring my whole life. I finally got it checked and was diagnosed with OSA last year. I learned just how terrible it can be for your health. It puts a lot of stress on your heart and  my primary care physician suspects it was affecting my hormones (low testosterone, etc).  I tried a CPAP machine for 3 months but it didn't work too well. Now I have a mouthguard that pulls my jaw forward and it has worked wonders. I've been told that I no longer snore. I'm no longer always fatigued. I haven't had new blood work done yet since I got the mouthguard but I am curious to see if any of the abnormal hormone results have changed.</p>
<p>Now I always recommend getting a sleep study done to anyone who complains about snoring. Sleep apnea could actually shave years of your life off!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad to hear that you've sorted things out!  I'm curious about the mouth guard because (as you described), it can be an easy fix that doesn't rely on a machine.</p>
<p>Without getting too complicated for a ELI5 discussion, I once read about a hospital patient who had low oxygen levels despite being given 100% oxygen.  Long story short, she was diagnosed with OSA which caused high blood pressure, enough to open a pinhole opening in her heart, causing blood to pass from the right side to the left side.  This meant that the blood didn't get to the lungs for fresh oxygen.  </p>
<p>She was placed on CPAP and immediate BP medications which sorted out her blood pressure, closing the hole and resolving the bypass issue.  This was an excellent example of OSA leading to a severe medical crisis.</p></div>		</li>
