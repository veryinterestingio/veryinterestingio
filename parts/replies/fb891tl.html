			<div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic here. Its uses in emergency medicine are dwindling. It used to be a great factor for things such as unknown drug ingestion and alcohol poisoning “back in the day”. Now more research is beginning to point towards the negatives of the non-discriminatory nature of the drug. You lose EVERYTHING and if it’s bad enough where you’re unconscious and don’t have a gag reflex there’s a high chance of aspiration even with manual suctioning. Not many departments even carry it anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Our ambulances used to carry it, but no longer.</p>
<p>It's been shown to not be effective for a whole pile of things to the point that you'd have to be *really* certain about what someone took, and that they took it less than an hour ago to even consider it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't eat activated carbon, period. While it in smaller quantities does absolutely nothing, it still absorbs a lot of stuff from our system. It is not a detox miracle or anything like that, if anyone got that idea: it does remove &quot;toxins&quot; but it has no intelligence, it will remove good and bad indiscriminately. It is not part of a healthy diet....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still think having a small bottle of the stuff is useful, but only in case of poisoning, be it alcohol poisoning, accidently ingesting something poisonous, etc. Cause I think getting the poison out of me is worth losing some important micronutrients</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never assume that will help; always call the poison control center before ingesting something else.</p>
<p>Many ingested poisons are less harmful if they are diluted by other contents in your stomach. Activated charcoal is indiscriminate, and may end up absorbing contents other than the poison, thus increasing the overall concentration of poison in your stomach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably better off with either a medicine targeted towards bloating or talking it through with your doctor. Charcoal isn't limited to just absorbing poisons and medicine, and can absorb digestive things you wouldn't want it to.</p>
<p>In other words, it's probably not good for you unless the alternative is being poisoned.</p></div>		</li>
