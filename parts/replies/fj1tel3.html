			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there you go, the other weird one I found was once I was sneezing uncontrollably, like 10 in a row and a guy I knew at the time told me if I sneezed once more I'd owe him 5 pound (was in England at the time) and I swear my body said to itself &quot;like fuck we're giving him 5 quid&quot; and I stopped sneezing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I feel a sneeze coming on and I get that ‘look’ and someone says “Bless you” before i sneeze then it goes away. But it always comes back and usually worse than the first time. I have to tell people not to do that. It pisses me off. Just let me sneeze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this, and some people think it's crazy that I tell them to look at a bright light if they have to sneeze. They don't understand why that would help. Apparently, PSR is not something that happens to them. Putting a fresh piece of mint gum, or a breath mint in my mouth also makes me sneeze. That one I don't understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I won (or lost depending on how you look at it) the sneeze lottery. I have PSR which I got from my dad, only mine is a lot more sensitive than his. My mom is also very sensitive to sneezing after eating and I got that from her as well. I don't think I've ever had a day where I haven't sneezed at least once, no matter what I do that day.</p></div>		</li>
