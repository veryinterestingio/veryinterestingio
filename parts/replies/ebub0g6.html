			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right but  but the important design parameter is precision not accuracy. You can zero a gun to move the sight to move where the bullet hit.  But you can fix a accurate buy inprecise gun because the bullets will on average be on  the aim point but can spread around it. </p>
<p>So it is the precision that you have to build into the gun. You can move the aim point by zeroing it but you still need to compensate for wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not that rare.   A H&amp;K G3, FAMAS  is a blowback rifles. For submachine gun  is is extremely common and weapons like a UZI,  H&amp;K MP5 is a blow back weapon.</p>
<p>Simple blowback  without and delay is rare in rifles but used in pistols and in some submachine guns.  like the Uzi.</p>
<p>Delayed blowback are the way it it done in most cases. So the weapons  above is roller-delayed and    lever-delayed.</p>
<p>Delayed blowback is still a blowback system just not a simple blowback</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Name a rifle, not a sub gun that has been devoloped in the last 3 decades that is running blowback. It's a extremely rare these days.  There are all legacy designs. Especially when it comes to precision rifle builds.</p></div>		</li>
