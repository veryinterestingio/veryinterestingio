			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Nerves have only two basic ways of responding: reduced signal (e.g. numbness), or wrong signal (e.g. burning feeling when gently touching). Many people with nerve injury have both, though reduced signal is often easier to live with. We use various names to describe these anomalous sensations. Allodynia is painful sensation from something normally not painful (e.g. a gentle caress becomes painful). Hyperestesia is exaggerated sensation of non-painful things. Hyperalgesia is exaggerated painful sensation (something normally only slightly painful becomes much more painful). Dysestesia is &quot;wrong sensation&quot;, e.g. something warm can feel cold. These names are not that useful in and of themselves. The particular pattern and time course of symptoms are sometimes helpful. For example, burning sensation in the limbs when having a fever in a young patient might raise the suspicion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabry_disease" target="_blank">Fabry disease</a>. Paresthesias (pinprick) in the first to third digits on wrist use is characteristic of carpal tunnel syndrome. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes though combined UMN+LMN do exist. If you think you have a nervous system problem, see a neurologist is a good rule of thumb. They can figure out if it's likely CNS/PNS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I'm aware of any scientific reports on these drugs and peripheral nerve disease. But some of these cause weight gain, which causes diabetes, which definitely can affect peripheral nerves. </p></div>		</li>
