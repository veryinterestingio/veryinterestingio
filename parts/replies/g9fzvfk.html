			<div class="markdown"><p>I discovered I couldn't while at a sports/camping event with some friends. One of them is a paramedic and could tell I was drinking a lot of water and asked me how I felt. After a quick conversation about the amount of water and whether I had been peeing, he said it was actually a salt deficiency. Sure enough, a little salt later and the &quot;thirst&quot; went away.</p>
<p>The way it was explained to me, your body is detecting &quot;thirst&quot; based on an imbalance of salt in your body. Modern diets are so high in salt that it is really rare for us to have too little salt.</p>
<p>Basically, if your urine is clear, but you're still thirsty, it is probably salt you need.</p>
<p>PS: in a similar vein, the feeling of needing to breathe while holding your breath isn't your body needing oxygen, it is sensing that you have too much carbon dioxide. There is no O2 sensor at all, which is why people suffocate easily in areas where the O2 is gone; they never knew there was a problem until they passed out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of water in food too.  Food chemistry is all about how to get more water in to bulk it up and sell you water.  Water is a cheap ingredient!  Vital to ones health too.</p>
<p>So eating doesn't feel like quenching your thirst either, but we get a lot of our water that way.  Don't stress about having to drink X number of glasses each day.</p></div>		</li>
