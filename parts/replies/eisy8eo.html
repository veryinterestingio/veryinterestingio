Luke (the leftie) was most likely separated from his mother way too early and and thus never fully grasped &quot;how to cat&quot;.<br />
For example, he doesn't understand play fighting and will often freak out to the point of turning it into a real fight. He also drools like a dog when he is happy, and never figured out how to bury his turds. He's a very loveable dork, tho. </p>
