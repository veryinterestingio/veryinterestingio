			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, to piggy-back your comment, the first 1/3rd of the air we exhale has not participated in gas exchange in the lungs. So the first air that exits our mouths is fresh air, containing no CO2. Just a fun fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun fact: most animals lungs work like bellows, with each breath not refreshing much of the air right down in the lungs where the gas exchange happens, but bird lungs work much more efficiently. Air leaves their lungs by a different route than it enters them, so they cycle much more of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also add that you don't really have time to consume the air you filled your lungs with when doing CPR.</p>
<p>And also... New CPR doesn't recommend mouth to mouth or focusing on rescue breaths. The compressions, when done properly, should still provide air exchange and it's more important to circulate blood than to send fresh air into the lungs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally, you call someone out nearby to assist you. One of you does breaths one of you does compression. Even better if you have a third, and you can all rotate.   </p>
<p>I was always told &quot;If you don't feel like you might be breaking something your are doing it wrong.&quot; Proper CPR is hard work, but might save a life. First aid and CPR cert courses are fantastic things to have, and look good on a resume (just make sure they are current).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. It's not recommended because stopping CPR to give breaths reduces perfusion to the brain since you have stopped pumping the heart (1 person CPR). it takes more than just the time to resume CPR to restore brain perfusion. Secondly, most people who collapse/need CPR still have enough oxygen on their hemoglobin to circulate for several minutes. So giving rescue breaths is not adding anything, and only decreasing cerebral perfusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EMT here. If it's a witnessed arrest, you saw person fall, its recommend you do continuous compression because there is still air in the RBC that can oxygenate the body. Also to note, even doing the best CPR you can it only makes the heart work at about 20% of what it can when it's spontaneously working. And to boot after about 2 minutes of CPR your compressions start sucking due to just pure exhaustion.</p>
<p>When it comes to breathing, ideally you insert a supergloctic airway (rests right above the lower airway) and you breathe for the patient every 5 to 6 seconds. If everything is being done correctly, this should keep the CO2 level to be between 35 to 45.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Red Cross lay person CPR does not recommend venthilations. </p>
<p>CPR for professional rescuers (i.e. lifeguards, etc, at similar levels of training and responsibility) still does, because they should have access to proper PPE and venthilations ARE better than not doing venthilations. But they found lay people were (understandably) hesitant to do venthilations without PPE and compressions only is <em>significantly</em> better than doing nothing, so it was worth changing the recommendations to reduce hesitancy to act.</p></div>		</li>
