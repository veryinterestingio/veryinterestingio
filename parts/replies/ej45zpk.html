			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, let me get this straight: your colleague got to using a needle one atom wide to dissect a live bacteria? As in, using one of the smallest things ever to cut open another of the smallest things ever? My mind is SHOOK by this level of awesome. I mean, isn't the word &quot;nanosurgery&quot; alone one of the most awesome things ever? Also, when did we as a species, and science in general, become so awesome that you can speak about mincing bacteria using ATOMS with a nonchalance a high schooler would speak with about dissecting a frog in their Friday biology class? Yeah, no big deal, I had cereal for breakfast, and then I took silicon one atom at a time to take a look what a bacteria's innards look like, you coming to the game on Saturday? What a time to be alive. You, my dear man, and your colleague are bloody legends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WHOA. So that's how molecules acutally look?! Like, not in a formula on paper, but in reality?! Damn they look really similar to them formulas, which means that science is double awesome for not only being able to see it now, but figuring their shape way back when microscopes were just glorified lenses!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes a live bacterium was dissected, no they didn't use a one atom sharp needle, their needle was few hundreds of atoms wide. I know it is super cool but! you can do much more! One can actually use these super sharp tips to dissect the DNA from a bacteria. Here is an image of a <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/molecular-art/art/Single-stranded-DNA-632651979" target="_blank">single stranded DNA I took few years back with controllable forces down to the theoretical limit at the room temperature which was world record breaking.</a> </p>
<p>Now hold on to your seat because this may blow  your mind: With this technology we are not only able to image and manipulate cells or DNAs we can see how the tiny pieces of cells work in real-time.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B-NYEJtdkw" target="_blank">Here is an high-speed AFM video of myosin which is a protein that facilitates muscle cells contraction by walking on muscle fibers.</a></p>
<p>On the non-biological side of things u/Remarqueable gave a good example of sub-atomic imaging of molecules which was used to observe the breaking and formation of hydrogen bonds in real time. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wicked cool. I remember seeing videos of them proteins walking around like they're showing off their best socks &amp; sandals combination at a Sunday stroll, but I always assumed that we just figured out how it works on paper and then made computer simulated animations. Which is probably how it's usually done, but we've actually SEEN the damn things, live! Like I said, you guys are legends!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Its not very long.  </p>
</li>
<li>If it were somehow long and rigid enough ...  its not very wide. It took a while to find but mechanical nerve receptors need disruptions on the micrometer scale and were talking about nanometer sized objects.  Also they are several micrometers wide themselves so you are only piercing 1 at a time.  If you felt pain from a single malfunctioning neuron ... my guess is you'd be in alot of pain all the time.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 - The realistic answer: You won't be able to stab your finger with such a tip. The tip and the lever that holds the tip would break. They are often made from silicon, silicon nitride or dioxide, which are very brittle especially at the fine geometries required for AFM operation. u/Named_Bort mentions that the tip is not long but this is actually long enough to &quot;stab&quot; you. <a href="https://www.brukerafmprobes.com/Product.aspx?ProductID=3958" target="_blank">Often the tip height is few micrometers for standard probes</a> and one can purchase or fabricate high-aspect ratio tips which can be several tens or hundreds of micrometers tall. If you were to be stabbed by such a tip, and assuming that it won't break, you may feel it depending on your expected pain awareness, sensitivity, hydration and ionic levels of your blood. A low aspect ratio tip on the other, even if not broken on contact won't be able stab you. And it is not so easy to explain why. There are several things to consider: First the surface physicochemistry and energy of tip. Depending on the hydro-phobic/philic state of the tip and the surface chemistry as well as charge distribution will define its interaction with the surface of your finger. They may be infinitely repelled like two magnets with opposite poles facing each other. Then the add-on layers of the surfaces. Everything that is exposed to air is coated with a thick (mind you that I am a nano-guy so my thick is very different than yours) layer of water. Often when two bodies get close enough, what happens is that at a critical point the two water layers jump to form a bridge also known as meniscus. And this bridge will act as a buffering zone between the object although at a macro scale we consider them to be touching. Let's assume that you push these the object even closer, some of the water will surely move out of the way but there will remain at least several atom thick layers of water in between. Now the freaky part is that no matter how hard you push you can't get rid off these water layers in between because the water will start to behave like ice i.e. solid. In addition to this, your finger secretes bodily oils and complex solutions (such as sweat). Which will further contribute to the thickness and complexity of the buffering zone between your finger and the tip. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2 - The hypothetical answer: Let's assume that you have an indestructible tip, and that you can control its position, velocity and load precisely. Then you would most likely feel nothing despite the tip punctures your skin cells. I am basing this on the simple fact that often when we do such puncturing studies even the single cell we are experimenting on doesn't realize being stabbed. What happens is that the cell membrane re-structures itself around the tip without losing any structural integrity and continues to live happily ever after. In order to kill the cell we need to move the tip as if to slice the cell open. But a vertical stab, with controlled position, velocity and load won't make it pop. Take this with a grain of salt though. These experiments are done in a petridish the actual behavior may be different in physiological environment, though in this case it is highly unlikely. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Since it is related, I will answer u/NoOneReallyCaresAtAl 's question here as well. Due to its height the tip will not likely pass through layer after layer of nerves and even if it did, the nerves will likely to reconfigure themselves to avoid being stabbed which doesn't necessarily mean that they will send a pain signal to the brain. </p>
<p>The function of the nerves are biophysicochemical meaning that they will respond to light, pressure, pH, salts, biomatter, chemicals etc. but the feeling of pain is a very complicated system and it has multiple different registries. What I mean is that even if you have stimulants recognized by the nerves it doesn't necessarily mean that it would be painful. A very short version of how we would feel pain in this situation is as follows: puncture signal recognized by sensory receptors of the skin then it is electrochemically transfer to the spinal cord via delta-A and C axons (nerve fibers)  then it is translated to the brain stem then to the somatocensory cortex (and possibly others) of the brain where it is processed and decided to be felt as pain and create a kinetic and hormonal response to it. But! it is not a flawless system and heavily depends on the individuals perception. Tickling would be good example. Tickling is a confused state of pain which makes us laugh despite being annoyed. Moreover, some people are ticklish some are not... </p></div>		</li>
