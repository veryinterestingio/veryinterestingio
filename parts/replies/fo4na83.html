			<div class="markdown"><p>Small-pox's close-relative animal reservoir is cow-pox.  More than 200 years ago it played a key role in Edward Jenner's invention of the small-pox vaccine!  More recently a team was able to recreate small-pox from cow-pox in a lab setting.  Nonetheless small-pox is considered eradicated in nature and the lab.  Seems like there are a few holdout labs and hidden reservoirs though.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1952414024" target="_blank">I just wrote a book about the history of pandemic.</a></p>
<p>Edit to correct my misremembered facts:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5774680/" target="_blank">Scientists recreated an extinct horse-pox vaccine to show it was possible, rather than recreating small-pox.</a>Supposedly some Russian labs have kept smallpox samples and there may be other sources.   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_virus_retention_debate" target="_blank">40 years ago the WHO called on everyone to destroy their samples.  There are probably still some out out there.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>US Gov Stance in 2011:  </p>
<p>[In 1980], the WHO called on all nations to destroy their collections of smallpox virus or transfer them to the WHO-sanctioned collections at one of two labs in Russia or the United States. The global public health community assumes that all nations acted in good faith; however, no one has ever attempted to verify or validate compliance with the WHO request…. Although keeping the samples may carry a minuscule risk, both the United States and Russia believe the dangers of destroying them now are far greater…. It is quite possible that undisclosed or forgotten stocks exist. Also, 30 years after the disease was eradicated, the virus’ genomic information is available online and the technology now exists for someone with the right tools and the wrong intentions to create a new smallpox virus in a laboratory…. Destroying the virus now is merely a symbolic act that would slow our progress and could even stop it completely, leaving the world vulnerable…. Destruction of the last securely stored viruses is an irrevocable action that should occur only when the global community has eliminated the threat of smallpox once and for all. To do any less keeps future generations at risk from the re-emergence of one of the deadliest diseases humanity has ever known. Until this research is complete, we cannot afford to take that risk.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very much so, poxviruses actually move between animals pretty well. It's often more luck that we don't see a really bad one. We've had run ins with monkey pox etc. Some early &quot;vaccination&quot; was in the form of cowpox, actually. Poxviruses are super unusual viruses. Almost like little cells. Just add ribosomes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other types of pox viruses that can spread to humans, like camel pox(from camels)or monkey pox(from rodents). While most are more benign disease, there is some concern about monkey pox being able to cause more widespread illness among humans</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All good points. However, we should remember that in the case of HIV, the &quot;pandemic&quot; will have less of an acute effect on the healthcare system as survival is measured on the order of years rather than weeks or months. One could argue that we have already experienced and weathered that pandemic (see Figures here <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5021a2.htm" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5021a2.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5021a2.htm</a></a>). </p>
<p>Regarding Ebola, one has to remember that it tends to kill people way faster than they can transmit it to a significant number of people. The R0 is low compared to these other viruses. That is reassuring - however, as global travel networks become ever more integrated, it will become entirely possible for a patient zero infected with Ebola in Kenya to reach a global transportation hub within hours, and for them to infect others within that time span. But it is also equally likely that given the relative rapidity with which Ebola kills you, quarantine measures would be effective. With one major caveat - that being that most Ebola is symptomatic. Studies have shown that there can be a non-trivial amount of asymptomatic Ebola.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However HIV primarily targeting &quot;undesirables&quot; delayed funding and research for a long time. It's now essentially a mild chronic condition for those on the right set of medications - maybe we would have got there sooner if it didn't have such a stigma</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV spreading like Covid19 sounds like an utter nightmare. And you couldn’t quarantine anyone with it considering it can take years before it presents negative symptoms. If a version of HIV like that had emerged before we had the drugs we have now we’d see at least half the people on the planet die right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, for HIV, and the Ebola strains we've encountered.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible for new HIV strains to mutate that kill more quickly and/or are resistant to our current drug therapies. It's also entirely possible for an Ebola strain to mutate to be less deadly, and thus spread more.</p>
<p>The likelihood of either of these happening is small, but it's present every time the virus replicates/reproduces. Which is, like, ALL the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's happened at least once before, fairly recently:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reston_virus" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reston\_virus" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reston\_virus</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. Which is one of the reasons it is so difficult to find a cure for HIV. We can suppress a patient's viral loads to undetectable levels, but we do not take them off HAART. But HAART has been highly effective for several decades now. While some novel strain can emerge that is highly resistant, we have not seen substantial amounts yet. Which is all promising. </p>
<p>I am afraid of novel Ebola strains though. Even if such a strain increases the transmissibility period by a single day, that would have astronomical consequences given the way global travel is so interconnected nowadays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By most accounts I believe HIV is currently the largest pandemic in the world. I done believe it’s the largest threat, but there are far more uncontrollable/untreatable cases of HIV across the globe than COVID-19</p></div>		</li>
