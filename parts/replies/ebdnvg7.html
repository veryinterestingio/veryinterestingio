			<div class="markdown"><p>For interest, you can spend 8hrs in an 80 dBA environment before you may suffer hearing loss. Every 3dB you go up after that you half the amount of time you get (4 hrs @ 83dBA, 2 hrs @ 86dBA etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also of interest, the dBA filter was intended only for signals in the range of the 40 phon equal loudness contour. Alternative ratings were created (B-weighting, C-weighting) which were all intended as a temporary solution to a loudness measure. When you say 83 dBA it is difficult to convert that to an actual loudness level as there is no indication of frequency content. While newer loudness scales are available ALL of the environmental rating boards are hesitant to choose the next standard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know there are other &quot;scales&quot; out there because i've also dealt with people that want the best sound &quot;quality&quot; out of instruments for other applications.  In terms of safety and hearing loss however i've never seen that they mean anything.  They have always been in terms of hearing &quot;comfort&quot; levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just in a bar and felt that the table I was at was near a speaker that was playing uncomfortably loud. I figured Iâ€™d trust my ears rather than just blot it out. Loaded up the NIOSH SLM app and saw it was averaging at 92dBA.</p>
<p>I debated sitting there and finishing my glass of wine - maybe about 30 mins - then changed my mind and moved further away. Looking at your summary of time/dBA, it now feels like the better call!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its the LAeq which is an average more or less.  Dont know about recovery time but I'd imagine at least 12hrs</p>
<p>For reference an 80dB environment would be like an industrial site with lots of loud running plant </p></div>		</li>
