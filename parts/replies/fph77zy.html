<p>Gaming monitors all aim for 1ms input delay (1/1000 of a second).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re confusing response time for input latency. Even top-end high refresh rate gaming monitors don’t have a 1ms input latency, more like quadruple that. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cheap TV’s can have extremely bad input delay</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Entry level TCLs (i.e. cheap) commonly have input latency in game mode of one to two frames at 60hz. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>20ms is very low input latency, barely more than a single frame at 60hz. Even competitive gamers would be unlikely to notice a difference between that and 5ms in blind testing. Your average 4K desktop monitor, as in not a high-end 144hz gaming monitor, is going to have input latency within five or ten milliseconds of 20ms. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>500ms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No television on the market has an input latency this high, and to my knowledge no consumer display ever has had input latency this bad. The worst of the worst are going to be as high as 150ms outside of game mode, and the worst game mode on the market right now is still going to be sub-60ms. </p>
<p>Input latency has nothing to do with why pricing is so different between televisions and monitors. It’s economies of scale, market demand, and target audiences that are the factors determining pricing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You didnt really define the difference well so here:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_lag" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_lag</a></p>
<p><a href="https://displaylag.com/exposed-input-lag-vs-response-time/" target="_blank">https://displaylag.com/exposed-input-lag-vs-response-time/</a></p>
<p>The time from pressing a button to input received is input lag, the time from the GPU to your monitor displaying it is input lag. Input delay/lag/latency are all the same term.</p>
<p>Response time is how long it takes for your monitor to actually change the pixel colors. So if you had an all black screen and wanted to flip to all white, how long would that take?</p>
<p>Gaming monitors advertise their response time, and normally dont advertise their input lag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn’t really bother getting into response time since it’s more or less a non-issue these days and is generally just used for marketing. Unless you’re extremely sensitive to LCD blur, it doesn’t mean much now. Thankfully the days of really shitty LCDs that ghosted and blurred like crazy (like the one in the original PSP) are mostly gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in the competitive scene for MoHAA on PC and then played Halo 2 on the pro circuit back in the day, actually. So I’ve got plenty of experience on both monitors and televisions. Back then, LCD TVs did indeed suck for gaming - high input latency, smearing, ghosting, you name it. I actually had a VGA adapter for my Xbox 360 and played Halo 3 on a CRT monitor. </p>
<p>Modern LCD TVs are way better now and just as good as monitors for 99.9% of people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the existing responses aren't really explaining properly.</p>
<p>The delay, if we're talking input lag comes from the processing the TV does to the image. This processing takes some amount of time and is supposedly to improve picture quality, and indeed on some TVs when you turn off the features to reduce input lag you can see a reduction in picture quality. </p>
<p>When a TV is being a TV, input lag isn't a concern - it doesn't matter that the TV is a 1/10 of a second behind displaying the incoming signal from your Blu-ray player or DVR or whatever, you just want it to look the best it can.</p>
<p>However when you are using a TV with a games console, or as a computer monitor suddenly that input delay matters, depending on the type of game. You are reacting to what happens on screen - so if what you are seeing actually occurred 1/10 of a second ago and the results of your key presses are going to take 1/10 of a second to to be reflected on screen, it can feel laggy and affect your performance in fast paced or multiplayer games. TV's usually have a 'game mode' or something similar to turn off most of the post processing effects to minimise input lag at the cost of picture quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lets say you were playing a fighting game and you pressed a button to punch.</p>
<p>If your TV had a 500ms input delay, the punch would happen on the screen 1/2 second after you pressed the button. Everything would feel Laggy.</p>
<p>if you had a 1ms input delay, the punch would happen 1/1000th of a second after you hit the button. </p>
<p>It's not so much it's ability to change colors fast, a problem with that causes ghosting/after images. It's the TVs speed at display an incoming signal.</p></div>		</li>
