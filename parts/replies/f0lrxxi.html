			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m 21 and have been having back and neck aches when getting up and sometimes, I feel like it limits my movement a bit. I know that’s it’s not common and I’m looking into getting an entire new mattress/pillows/covers/etc. Would this help me or is my back/neck fucked?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll put a cheap pillow under my upper back and let my head hang sometimes. It's really nice... I suppose it's because with cell phones and work stuff i spend a lot of waking hours looking down. Relaxing into a stretch isn't a bad thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have constant neck pain.  I figured out that my pillow didnt have enough neck support, so my neck was being strained all night.  I bought one of those curved memory foam pillows that supports your neck.  The new pillow coupled with trying to sleep on my back as long as possible made it go away entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Na, that was just an example. There's so many ways to sleep wrong. Side sleepers might need a few extra pillows to keep their arms and legs relaxed is all you need. As said elsewhere, fetal position is one of the best, as long as your spine is aligned properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So side sleeping makes neck and arm and leg tension, back sleeping makes back pressure and sleep paralysis, front sleeping suffocates.</p>
<p>How am I supposed to fucking sleep, divine creator? In the fucking sky?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just giving a few examples. There's no right answer for everyone, and each person's struggle for good sleep is different. Side sleeping CAN give you bad neck tension. Back sleeping CAN give you extra pressure and paralysis, and front sleeping CAN limit your breathing.</p>
<p>The trick is to find the way that works best for you to relax the muscles you want relaxed. </p>
<p>Also, TBH, I found skydiving to be an incredibly comfortable and relaxing position, if a little noisy for my taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jsyk, I wasn't calling you &quot;divine creator&quot;, I wasn't attacking you for that. Wasn't shooting you, the messenger. </p>
<p>Skydiving would be a fun sleep position, as I wouldn't have to worry about whether or not I'll die in my sleep.</p></div>		</li>
