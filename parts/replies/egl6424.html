			<div class="markdown"><p>Another difference between beer and spirits is the rate at which they are consumed. Gimme a pint of beer and I'll nurse that over a good half hour sometimes longer. If I have a double vodka and OJ It'll be gone in 10-15 mins. Basically double the alcohol in half the time. If I could drink 2 pints of beer every 10-15 minutes without being completely bloated I have no doubt I would be the same type of drunk</p></div>		</li>
