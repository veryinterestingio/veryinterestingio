<p>Things that don't have mass, and aren't interacting with other things that have mass, move at <em>c</em>. (If I'm wrong about this, I'd love to hear about it, but from what I can gather -- I'm not a physicist, just a nerd -- that seems to be the case.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. It should be note that interacting with other &quot;things&quot; does not mean one entire planet is one thing...each atom (as best as ELI5 should get into imo) slows down other atoms. </p>
<p>The smallest definition of a thing is the big mystery of what slowed down the first things to exist. See also big bang.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't exactly <em>true</em>, but it's a good enough analogy that it won't lead you wrong unless you're doing advanced grad work in physics:</p>
<p>Everything in the universe, including you, IS moving at the speed of light right now. </p>
<p>But time is a dimension just like height, width, and depth. Currently, you're moving very little in the spacial directions, and fully in the time direction.  Thus you experience the passage of time at the same rate as all the other chumps on this planet moving at the same speed as you.    </p>
<p>Photons are moving at the same speed as you, but all their motion is in the spatial directions, and none of it is the time direction.  A photon doesn't experience the passage of time.  From the photon's perspective, its entire lifetime passed by as an infinitesimal blink.</p>
<p>If you were a space captain, as your ship approached the speed of light, more and more of your speed would be in spatial dimensions, leaving less of it for your travel through the time dimension.  Thus the time dilation effect we see in sci-fi movies.  This has been confirmed experimentally, and GPS satellites actually have to take it into account when calibrating their internal clocks.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>We don't know that for certain though. It probably is that way, but general relativity can't be solved for exactly C, you get infinite results. The same way we get that infinitesimal blink result for time, we also get a spatial result of the photon being literally everywhere in the universe.</p>
<p>That doesn't make any sense of course, which is why General Relativity is, although incredibly accurate, still incomplete.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So does that mean time flows slower because you're moving faster in the spatial dimensions? How does gravity factor into this? I knew that satellites have to account for the fact that they're far away from earth and experiencing gravity differently</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By definition, yes.</p>
<p>Fun aside: Due to time dilation, anything going the speed of light experiences no time. Its entire existence takes place in exactly zero time, from it's point of view. Therefore, it can undergo no intrinsic change. There are particles called Neutrinos that are very difficult to detect and therefore we have trouble making measurements of them. For a long time we knew they existed, but many of their properties were theoretical guesswork and unconfirmed. We weren't even sure if they had mass or were massless. </p>
<p>However, we were eventually able to work out that Neutrinos coming from the sun were undergoing changes as they traveled to the earth. If they change, they experience time. If they experience time, they aren't traveling at the speed of light. If they aren't traveling at the speed of light, they must have mass.</p>
<p>Not really relevant but it does provide an example of your question working in the real world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it needs to be STRESSED that because a model &quot;Allows&quot; something does not make it in any way founded in reality.</p>
<p>In fact the models that state to get things like wormholes you would need negative mass, even if you did, the model could still be wrong. It may be fundamentally impossible to bend and warp space in those ways.</p>
<p>The thing is, turn a + into a - in an equation and you can get some funky results and predict funky things.</p>
<p>The unfortunate hard reality is while it's fun to imagine, while it's fun to mess around and say &quot;Nothing in X model prevents Y from happening&quot; that says nothing to what reality would do... Because those models are also incomplete, and nothing else suggests the thing you need to make Y happen exists in reality or would actually do what the model suggests it does. </p>
<p>Would it be cool? Yeah. Nice to imagine. But Fermi's Paradox has an answer and it's a cold one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just increase mass until the integer overflows and you get a negative. </p>
<p>Though take caution, this may cause problems in the simulation. Instead of weighing things down like normal mass, these overflow errors end up sucking everything in, where not even the 0-mass light can escape them.</p></div>		</li>
