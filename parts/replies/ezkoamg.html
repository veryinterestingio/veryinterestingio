			<div class="markdown"><p>It also (historically) meant that a commander knew exactly how far he could expect his men to travel in a given time.  </p>
<p>The pace stick carried by NCOs wasn't just to hold onto and point at things, it was a caliper and specified a set distance for your stride.<br />
That stride and pace dates back to the roman legions.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, we get our term &quot;Mile&quot; and &quot;pace&quot; from the Latin &quot;Mille Passus&quot; (1000 paces), so our standard of measurement in the west is based on (maybe just named after) the marching paces of ancient armies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drummers, aside from parades, used to also perform the task of relaying orders to the troops in battle.  </p>
<p>That's why &quot;drummer boy&quot; deaths in battle were a common thing.<br />
They couldn't leave them back at camp during battle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't unit formation still important? Moving in order (i.e leapfrogging) is very important nowadays. Just not marching, but it still builds unison and discipline. Which you need to run to the next building on command</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Marching is quite unlike movement in combat (squad tactics). In combat, movement is both hierarchically commanded but also individualistically autonomous. For example, at the lowest level, a squad leader may order an element to flank. The squad leader will specify the general movement of the element, but unless otherwise specified, the squad members will have to use their experience and knowledge to know how and where to move to and how to space out and find cover (or just advance without cover) given the situation, weapons, support, terrain and enemy positions/weapons. Thus, squads move as both groups and individuals.</p>
<p>So a good squad will drill to move &quot;together&quot; but &quot;together&quot; really means the individuals can all solve their own problems using the tactics they have been trained in to best support the squad.</p>
<p>Movement in combat involves a deep understanding of the squad tactics and the ability to adapt to a situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So highers-up give the command of how to proceed tactically, which is a direct order, but individuals must decide how to practically implement that command, based on their training and experience?</p>
<p>Presumably this is to allow for a level of flexibility?</p>
<p>I guess it would also be very difficult for a superior to have to micromanage every move</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A practical modern application of marching formations is in riot control. A group of soldiers or policemen acting as a single unit is very intimidating and effective. It also helps embed the instinct to stay together and not get separated.</p></div>		</li>
