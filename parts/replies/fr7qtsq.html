			<div class="markdown"><p>Refinancing is different to additional borrowing tho?</p>
<p>In the UK it's common to get a new mortgage every 2 to 10 years depending on the terms of your mortgage.</p>
<p>That's what I'm familiar with in terms of refinancing. </p>
<p>I can chose to do it at any point but waiting until the initial term of the mortgage agreement is over usually avoids additional fees. NOT refinancing is pretty stupid as the bank will just chuck you on some random variable rate that's defo not as good as getting a new agreement in place. </p>
<p>Refinancing to get cash out of your house or additional borrowing on top of an existing mortgage are probably bad financial decisions long term. </p>
<p>But that does depend entirely on why you're doing it. </p>
<p>Refinancing and borrowing 50k more than you need so you can go on holiday or buy a fancy car - probably not a great idea since those things aren't needed and you're risking your home. </p>
<p>Doing it because you need to pay a medical bill or to pay of another loan with worse terms or you're putting on an extension which will increase the value of your house etc. Not necessarily a bad idea.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Refinancing is just getting a new mortgage and using the new loan to pay off the old one. There are typically 3 reasons why you might do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>To increase the amount of the loan, and get the difference as cash</li>
<li>To get a lower interest rate</li>
<li>To reduce your monthly payments in exchange for &quot;lengthening&quot; the term (really just resetting it)</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it’s a very situation-dependent decision. In our case, we refinanced our previous house and got into a 15 year mortgage for only slightly more than we were paying on the 30 year mortgage, because the interest rate was so much less, and we built a lot of equity quickly over the next few years. In our current house, our interest rate is low enough that refinancing probably would never pay off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The argument could be made that increasing your cash flow is more important than paying off your loan ASAP, since you would now have more money available to make more money, though that assumes your interest is something like &lt;7%.</p></div>		</li>
