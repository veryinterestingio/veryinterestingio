			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! When you watch an aurora display you are looking at light emitted by atoms in the upper atmosphere.  They emit this light when they are hit by electrons accelerated into the atmosphere.  It's a complex process but it is the way that our planet protects itself from a &quot;wind&quot; of charged particles that comes from the sun - the Earth absorbs all the energy in its magnetic field and dissipates it in an incredibly beautiful light show.  You can find out more about the process and the emission of light on my website, where I have embedded some videos to show you what's going on: <a href="http://melaniewindridge.co.uk/what-is-the-aurora/what-causes-the-aurora" target="_blank"><a href="http://melaniewindridge.co.uk/what-is-the-aurora/what-causes-the-aurora" target="_blank">http://melaniewindridge.co.uk/what-is-the-aurora/what-causes-the-aurora</a></a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, and yes, it does always tend to be green.  That colour comes from oxygen and is the most common colour of the northern lights.  But if you are lucky and the display is more energetic then you might see pinks, purples, yellows and reds too.  </p></div>		</li>
