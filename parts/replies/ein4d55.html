			<div class="markdown"><p>well, its a lot of heat.  so much that the steam cant be forced away before its molecular bonds fall apart.</p>
<p>a large enough pile of ignited thermite, dropped into the ocean, would vastly out perform all the nukes on earth going off at once, in produced thermal energy.  say 1 million tons or so of thermite, vs all those gigatons of tnt yielding nukes.  the thermite would gasify AND render a ton of oxygen and hydrogen, and then set that off, and well, the ocean would fill the crater in, and repeat, until you ran out of thermite slag burning its way down into the mantle.</p>
<p>thereld be enough boom boom that day to drop sea level a few feet =D  maybe boil one of the smaller oceans entirely =D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is because outside of special fire extinguishers such as Potassium bicarbonate or certain class D fire extinguishers, blocking the chain reaction is not the most effective means of extinguishing a fire.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The reason why fire continues to burn once ignited, is that an exothermic chemical chain reaction is occurring between the fuel vapors and oxygen. This keeps enough energy in the form of heat to continue the reaction. It is basically rusting (oxidation reaction) happening at an accelerated rate.</p></div>		</li>
