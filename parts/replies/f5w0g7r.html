			<div class="markdown"><p>I built a pond along a channel of a wet weather creek and didn't have to stock it. When we received a deluge, the creek was fed from all the other ponds in the prairie which in turn stocked by flooding creeks or when the Arkansas river flooded decades ago. I went to watch my pond will up and saw a mud catfish flopping it's way down the creek, right into my pond. </p>
<p>My daughter caught a 4lbs bass out of it as well as black crappie, and all the perch and bream you could stand. Someone queue the Goldbloom!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also many reported stories of fish raining from the sky. The main theory is that water spouts are formed over shallow bodys of water and fly the fish up into the sky. </p>
<p>There is a festival in Honduras &quot;Raining Fish&quot; that they celebrate avery year. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/16/world/americas/honduras-rain-fish-yoro.html" target="_blank">NY Times Story</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, nearly all bodies of water are being fed by some sort of stream/creek/river and they flow out into another stream/creek/river etc that makes a chain to the ocean.  After enough time life finds it's way along that chain up to the top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes,  those are called 'closed lakes', or <em>endoheric</em>.  They are not connected via lakes/streams/etc waterways to the ocean.  Crater Lake in Oregon is an example, it is filled by snow melt and rain and has no outlet other than groundwater seepage and evaporation.  It has fish, but stocked by people, not naturally found. </p>
<p>Most times these kinds of lakes are really salty because the water evaporates over time and leaves minerals that accumulate.</p></div>		</li>
