			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add that when it comes to species like the African Grey who are extremely neurotic by nature, they get anxious so easily that you can be a really good bird owner and they can still overpluck. Especially with Greys, plucking doesn't mean there is emotional neglect or abuse. In the wild they range, iirc, up to 60km daily (source for this is a book I don't have on me), and I think the comparative lack of exercise in captivity does a number on a bird whose intelligence can best be described as &quot;Border Collie,&quot; aka kinda scary. ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		</li>
