<p>Sterilization is held to a higher standard than simple disinfecting, which is more powerful than cleaning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for the U.S. here's how the EPA classifies sanitizing, disinfecting, and sterilization.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/what-are-antimicrobial-pesticides" target="_blank">https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/what-are-antimicrobial-pesticides</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the EPA only regulates the killing of microorganisms on inanimate objects.  When used on a person or on something that goes into a person the FDA is the regulating body and they have different definitions.</p></div>		</li>
