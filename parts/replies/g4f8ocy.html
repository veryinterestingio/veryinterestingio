			<div class="markdown"><p>There's one other aspect as to why it's heard so frequently: The band doesn't own the rights to it. The record company is all too happy to sell it out as much as possible, which occasionally leads to its use in iconic movies, but also leads to it being in Wrangler jean commercials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When music is released on a major record label, historically the record label owned the music. That's in exchange for the label paying for record production, distribution, promotion, and tour support. The knife in the back however is that the artists generally have to pay those things back out of the royalties. (Read up on what happened to 90's R&amp;B act TLC) So what's really in it for the artists? That's why you've got things like Soundcloud and Bandcamp and people releasing things directly on Spotify.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, see how the record label sued John Fogerty for plagiarism because his solo songs on a new label sounded to much like himself (i.e. the Creedence songs they owned the rights to).</p>
