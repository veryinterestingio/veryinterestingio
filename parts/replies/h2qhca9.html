			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't even have to have a &quot;weird syndrome&quot;. Vessels can relax due to many factors.  Some people are prone to the vessels relaxing and not tensing when needed.  This can result in Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia.  Elderly are prone to a similar problem.  Essentially the vessels relax when sitting or lying down. Then upon standing our body shrinks the vessels to maintain equal pressures.  When the vessels don't contract properly then you develop hypotension (low blood pressure) and tachycardia (high heart rate).  This high heart rate is the body trying to correct for the low blood pressure.</p></div>		</li>
