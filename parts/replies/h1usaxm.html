			<div class="markdown"><p>[RA] STEM or not STEM, you are certainly an energy consumer :) You can find out where the energy comes from that you consume. You can find out if you have the possibility to purchase renewable energy or even produce your own energy - alone, or together with your neighbourhood.<br />
You can ask your local politicians to engage in renewable energy, make space available etc. Spread the word, make statements - e.g. you find wind turbines beautiful and actually like the idea, that you can even benefit from them as a citizen- and tell the renewable energy story.<br />
Also, if you work in a company, ask questions and make the company make sustainable purchase choices.<br />
Renewable energy is decentralised and as a result, many diverse decision makers can act on making the change to renewable energy happen.</p></div>		</li>
