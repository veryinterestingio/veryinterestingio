			<div class="markdown"><p>TV journalist here - Bozosonthebus is spot on - for my station, unless it's a police source that is basically trying to say &quot;this is reportable, but you can't use my name as the source because we aren't allowed to talk to media&quot;, trying to do off the record is a big red flag for us.<br />
And even then, if someone comes at us with a reasonable amount of authority (a police supervisor or a lawyer), we will throw that cop under the bus so damn fast.  </p>
<p>We have to agree to that, and we never agree to it.</p>
<p>Off the record basically means that the info is either damaging or false enough that the person will not verify it by attaching their name to it, and it's suspect at best.   </p>
<p>Most of the time when someone tries to do an &quot;off the record&quot; comment, they really just want to remain anonymous because they are worried about retaliation or being identified (ex: domestic abuse victim).</p>
<p>I don't think I have ever had a politician try that other than when they were trying to be cute, and it usually results in an eyeroll from everyone and a laugh from the politcian.</p>
<p>Edit: some of y’all are some nasty pieces of work with the dm’s.</p>
<p>Here is some clarification:</p>
<p>If a cop goes “off the record” with a journalist, he’s already putting his job on the line because there was 2 cops that were on the side of the police line where the media were standing and cop 1 was seen keeping his distance, but cop 2 was chatting them up and being friendly. This is never a “Deepthroat” situation, so clear that from your minds - it’s rarely hard for the cops to narrow down a leak and turn it off.</p>
<p>The information is also usually minor: it’s typically “double fatal, car vs semi, no kids, driver of the semi was transported as a precaution (shock). Roads gonna be closed until major collision arrives.
No one really cares about this info getting shared, but cops still want it off the record because they don’t want to be flagged as friendly to us.
We aren’t talking about identifiable information or something that will compromise an investigation or notifying next of kin.</p>
<p>And when I said someone of reasonable authority comes at us, we throw them under the bus, I mean that we let our station manager deal with it, he or she talks with them and finds out exactly how much crap is being flung around and how serious of a lawsuit we are talking about. Chances are its usually a fishing expedition to verify what they already know, but news stations typically don’t have a ton of capital lying around to deal with lawsuits - so it’s us or them.</p>
<p>Most of the time the beat cops in my city are terrified of us because we will put them on camera when they aren’t wearing their hat or some other trivial thing that they get teased about, the supervisors don’t want to deal with us because they have too much paperwork and the district commanders are more than happy to chat with us, but get so much flak from the media relations arm of the organization because it makes them impotent and useless. But otherwise we are pretty friendly with the cops and they understand we are just doing our jobs and we understand that they are just following rules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m confused: if someone wanted to share info but was terrified of retaliation, you wouldn’t agree to that, and instead throw them under the bus if you got called on the carpet? I guess I always assumed a journalist would discriminate whether info shared with them was worth pursuing, then verify it with named sources before publishing? And also that they wouldn’t out sources who requested anonymity for safety reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of people in this thread are thinking that being an anonymous source and “going off the record” are the same thing. Journalists quote anonymous sources all the time. If someone goes “off the record” they don’t want to be quoted at all, they’re just trying to plant information in the reporters head and they’ll deny ever saying it in the first place. </p>
<p>At least I think that’s what it is. Hopefully a journalist can go into more detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's worth keeping in mind the realities of journalism. We are primed by network news and the national media to think of journalism as involving major national stories, and so when we hear about whistleblowers, our minds naturally go to Deep Throat and Edward Snowden, and when we think about mishaps of presuming things are off the record, the story that might come to mind is the Rolling Stone article that led to General McChrystal's downfall when his aides assumed informal conversations were inherently off the record. While these examples are at the front of the public's mind, they just aren't something that fits into the day to day life of most journalists. When you take national security and the kind of gossip that a lot of high profile national politics leads to out of the picture, the number of situations in which anonymous sources are useful drops pretty precipitously.</p>
<p>Also, you should look at the context of the throwing under the bus comment a little bit more carefully. They are specifically talking about people who are in positions of authority who don't want to put their position at risk to stop things that they are already in a position to change. They aren't talking about throwing the beat cop reporting their supervisor or a paralegal working in the DA's office under the bus. They're talking about those people's bosses.</p>
<p>You actually answer your own question a bit at the end. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>There are two things here. First, most of the information gained this way is likely to not be worth pursuing in the first place. But even when it is might be worth pursuing, if there is a genuine safety concern, it is often going to be almost impossible to verify the story while maintaining the anonymity of the source. Unless the information is just sitting in publicly available records, the moment you start asking questions or filing FOIA requests, the subjects of the story will know what is going on and there is often a relatively small pool of people who they might look at as the source. Journalists don't have infinite time and resources to chase stories without obvious leads, and a source who is unable to provide documentation or other potential sources who can verify their information and won't even go on the record themselves is not one that most journalists will give time to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, working journalist here. When people say “off the record” that means you shouldn’t fucking print what they say after it. If you want to print that information you need to re-ask consent to the source if you can use it, anonymously. If they’re not comfortable with it? BE A GOOD JOURNALIST and find the information elsewhere.</p>
<p>I can’t believe a reporter just said “we’ll throw our source under a bus so fast.” LIKE WHAT? Where did you learn journalism? </p>
<p>That’s a hack move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a web journalist focused on entertainment.</p>
<p>I took a off the record ONCE. It was from a tv presenter that I  had a relationship with. And it was an early tip that one a book or a movie or something like that was going to be adapted by the networks.</p>
<p>Kept it to myself. Did my discreet investigation. When it was officially annonced, my whole article with the announcement, analysisof why it's was a good idea (or bad one), who was involved, who they wished to cast and the funny slideshow of our dream casting was up before the others could even start their own article.</p>
<p>Off the record should never mean you sit on it. It should means here the stuff to investigate so you're ready when it's time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Journalists have to agree, if you comment “off the record, BUT” without waiting for them to agree, it’s not off the record and they’re going to publish it anyway. Hence Elon Musk doubling down on the thai rescue diver being a pedo “off the record” to a buzzfeed journalist.</p></div>		</li>
