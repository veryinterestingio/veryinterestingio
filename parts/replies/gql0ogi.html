<p>The largest and heaviest component in these devices is the transformer that steps the relatively high mains voltage down to something that today's delicate consumer electronics can handle. Transformers can handle a higher load if they are run at higher frequencies, so to minimise the size and weight of things like cellphone chargers the transformers in them are run at very high frequencies. However, whilst running at a higher frequency allows the transformer to be smaller for a given load, it also increases the core and winding losses, making the transformer less efficient. In addition to this, some extra components have to be added to increase the mains frequency to that required by the miniaturised transformer, which results in further loss of efficiency.</p>
<p>We experience these losses as heat, which is why cellphone chargers and their ilk can get pretty hot when put under strain. This puts a design limitation on the minimum size a transformer can be for a given load before it melts due to its own inefficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you run a transformer at near their output rating, then yes, they are more efficient. But the problem is that current devices have a very fluctuating power need. They also need a wide range of voltages for maximum performance. While a simple transformer with a capacitor and a full bridge rectifier is good enough for some devices, it becomes very inefficient for others. For example, laptops and other mobile devices with USB-C communicate with the charger to get a higher voltage (some even up to 20 odd volts) which will allow them to pull more power at the same amperage (power loss is amperage squared times resistance, so higher voltage equals less losses). If you wanted to use only transformers, then you'd have to have devices that charge on the same voltage and power, or have a multiple output transformer. Also: don't leave your transformers plugged in with no load, they get pretty toasty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An OEM can specify a small form factor and pay to have a higher quality design that still meets their efficiency goals. Others simply allow the size to grow to not spend more on it. </p>
<p>The point is that there are different tradeoffs available.</p></div>		</li>

<p>a small form factor... higher quality design... efficiency</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get that you're trying to say that some companies don't want to pay more to have a well designed power adaptor, but the implication of this is that if enough money is thrown at the problem of miniaturizing a transformer anything can be achieved.</p>
<p>My point is that however well designed the adaptor is, however much money is spent on it, in general the smaller it is for a given load, the less efficient it is - money can only get you so far before physics gets in the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add there is no applicable law or a imposed standard regularization that covers that usability topics, such as the NFPA 70 does for safety reasons.</p>
<p>So give companies the choice to do cheap unpractical designs, and what will they do....</p>
<p>Same happens with usb, the USB. Some USB plugs actually work by standard regularization, but they make the adjacent USB ports unavailable due the the size of the device.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also as the transformer is what connects directly to the electrical grid it is what carry the burden of being UL or CE certified as long as the device its powering remains under a certain voltage.  So it often makes sense to just use an existing tried and true part rather than going through the work of developing and certified your own.</p></div>		</li>
