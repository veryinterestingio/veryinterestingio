			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not that complicated. You can intuitively think of it as: “Each time you add a new person that doesn’t have the same birthday as someone whose already in the group, there is now a new birthday for future members of the group to match with”. So when adding the tenth person there may be 9 birthdays he can “match” with, when adding the 30th person there may be 29 birthdays that person can match with. That’s all the intuition there is behind this problem, the rest is just calculation. There’s no reason to go into examining each relationship individually if you just want to know the WHY.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt in my mind that OP’s answer could’ve been simplified, there’s just no reason to bring AB’s and CD’s into this one if you just want the explanation</p></div>		</li>

<p>For three people, the odds that AB don't share a birthday is still 364/365, he odds for AC is also 364/365, and the odds for AC is also 364/365. To figure out the odds of NONE OF THEM SHARING THE SAME BIRTHDAY, simply multiply them together to give you (364 x 364 x 364)/(365 x 365 x 365), which is the same as (364/365)^3 = 0.9918. So the odds of NOT having the same birthday is 99.18%. That means the odds of having the same birthday is 100 - 99.18 = 0.82%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's actually a bit higher than that.  That math presumes that each edge is independent, but they're not.  That is, if A and B don't share a birthday, the chances of C not sharing a birthday with A or B is not (354/365)^2 -- it's 363/365.  When person D comes along, there are three blocked out days, so they only have a 362/365 chance.</p>
<p>This can be trivially demonstrated by considering 365 people -- (364/365)^365 is very small, but still greater than zero... but it should be fairly obvious that if you have 365 people (i.e. one per option), there will be shared birthdays.</p>
<p>The expression you want to use for N people taking D days is D!/((D-N)! D^(N)).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need 367 people to guarantee a shared birthday. One for every day of the year plus one (can't forget about leap days!). Of you just have one for every day of the year everyone can just have birthdays on every different day of the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(364/365)^365 isn't how you calculate the probability that 365 people will have the a birthday on the same day using that guys method. I'm not going to calculate the power you use but it's much higher. Also it's implied that once you get 366 people the probability goes to 100%. If you do it long hand it's obvious to see. So your final equation is flawed, actually for 2 reasons. You could use a counting equation like that to get the numbers to get a perfect probability calculation though and it would be more accurate than the first technique. </p></div>		</li>
