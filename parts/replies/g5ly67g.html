			<div class="markdown"><p>However if the receptors are already occupies by adenosine, the caffiene cannot plug into the receptors. This why coffee naps are a thing.
Drink the coffee,do this part quickly then go lie down for 20 to 25 min. If you can nap,great but even just resting will clear out some of the adenosine. Once the 20 min have passed the coffee has been absorbed and should be arriving at your brain just as you wake up resulting in a clear and focused mind.</p>
<p>Works like legal cocaine when you are over worked or doing long shifts. Got me through 7 day 12h shifts.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the ward. It is my 1st and I'm glad it involved coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man... You just described something I've been doing for ages and I never understood why it worked so well.</p>
<p>I actually enjoy coffee naps a lot. That is after I learned to accept that it's actually working and stopped myself from powering through the drowsiness</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My pleasure. Took me a while to master it. Works just as well with energy drinks(i prefer sugar free ones).
Alot of people don't get this, we force pilots to take breaks and recognise fatigue but somehow normal people just want to power through...not only does your focus start drifting but your critical thinking, memory skills and decisiveness starts dropping...
Taking a break allows adenosine to leave which should already boost you to where you were.
Be careful though, going over 30 min wil let you enter the rem cycle and the you will be stuck in sleep inertia or I can't seem to wake the frack up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also recommend caffeine pills for caffeine naps, same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee but it's quick and avoids any alertness placebo from the act of drinking coffee (taste/smell/routine/etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always find caffeine pills make me way more jittery and anxious than a coffee, even if the quantity of caffeine itself is around the same. Not sure if it's a placebo or something to do with the other alkaloids in coffee beans but it's been a pretty consistent thing for years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert but it could be because caffeine is also a diuretic, which means it makes you need to pee more often, leading to dehydration which can make you feel drowsy as well. It's also possible that your body is able to metabolize caffiene faster than average, and/or you could have a higher tolerance. Once the caffeine has been completely metabolized, the effect wears off, and adenosine will be able to make you sleepy again.</p>
<p>My guess is that adenosine is gradually accumulating in the neural synapse where it is trying to bond with a receptor that is blocked by caffeine, and your body is metabolizing the caffeine fast enough to experience more adenosine at once than you would if it was bonding to the receptors at its unblocked pace.</p>
<p>Again, I'm not an expert, so if anyone has info proving my guess wrong I'd love to hear it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine is an adenosine reuptake inhibitor in addition to adenosine receptor antagonist. It bonds to the adenosine transporters before it binds to the adenosine receptors. This causes a buildup of adenosine and, in turn, drowsiness until its adenosine receptor antagonism outshines it and wakes you back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stimulants affect people with ADHD differently. Probably not the only cause, but there does seem to be quite a number of ADHD folks that get tired when consuming caffeine. </p>
<p>Hence also why <em>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</em> is treated with stimulants. They make us less antsy and tone down the distractions so we can actually sit still and focus on boring tasks.</p>
<p>Although there does also seem to be some variance with these too. For me, caffeine makes me tired, Adderall calms the antsiness but gives amazing mental energy and focus and I can do things like remember people's names, Ritalin quiets distractions, but also everything, and makes me tired and dull.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how come we can’t supplement adenosine as a sleep aid instead of BS like melatonin that doesn’t do anything? (For me at least)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately I am not a pharmacist. Google leads me to believe that adenosine can be taken as an injection but it looks like it is used for surgical pain relief? </p>
<p>Melatonin is a hormone produced in the absence of sunlight to keep your circadian rhythm on track with daylight hours. It doesn't work as a substitute for adenosine in your neurons. While melatonin does affect wakefulness vs drowsiness, I'm not sure if melatonin actually influences the production of adenosine at all, since adenosine is produced as a result of energy consumption- your brain produces adenosine as a way of telling you it needs recovery time(for the record, this is brain specific- not due to physical exercise).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because of dependency effects. Coffee addicts have an increased amount of receptors which leads to tiredness and other things when im withdrawal. The receptor amount is increased because the body thinks there aren't enough even though there are, they are just blocked by the caffeine. Same thing should be possible in the opposite direction leading to sleeplessness.</p>
<p>But that's just an educated guess.</p></div>		</li>
