			<div class="markdown"><p>I figure it's because we have to get more fluid to the lacrimal glands rapidly, so the blood vessels/tissue in the area dilate to increase blood/fluid flow from the hormones your body sends out while crying.  </p>
<p>It seems to make sense, because like other things, if someone tries hard enough, they can sometimes dissociate the hormones from the act. I've known plenty people that can cry (usually on queue) without said puffiness appearing. I'm sure there's some psychological limitation to that, but mechanically it makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's part of it. It is also due to changes in the salt content of the tears. Initially, tears have a similar salt make-up like the surrounding tissues. But as you continue to cry, the salt content of the tears drops. Prolonged contact with the low-Salt tears causes the surrounding tissue to swell due to osmosis (similar to a gummy bear in tap water).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes a good deal more sense why crying for a short minute or two doesn't cause the same level puffiness as a ten minute or more sob fest. Thank you for chiming in!\^_\^</p></div>		</li>
