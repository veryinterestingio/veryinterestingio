			<div class="markdown"><p>Mmm not really to me.  If you're in trouble and scream you're going to be much more likely to be rescued.  It's why screaming makes us uncomfortable. </p>
<p>This also partly explains why the pain is reduced - you're being rewarded for screaming and calling for help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, loved reading this! I’m a psy undergrad senior right now. Got accepted into I/O gradschool XD. anyway, I love the sympathetic system.  I was always curious about something... I played tennis 2 years at junior college(IVCC in ILLINOIS) and I always yelled or grunted during my serves. My first serve was probably around 85mph with kick. Not a lot, but after playing multiple sets, you get tired. So I was grunting loud to hit my serves. </p>
<p>Can someone tell me why it helped me? </p>
<p>I felt as if I was able to exert more energy when I yelled.  I only yelled when I was tired. That has to have something to do with it, right? </p>
<p>Ps. I’m very drunk. Sorry for grammar. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to when someone yells while lifting heavy weight. It causes your core to tighten up, which helps with a lot of different athletic scenarios.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. I’ve done the same when I used to lift. Like I said, I feel like it helps. But why</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is my understanding the peripheral pain is within the sympathetics. Not all pain, if any, would be predominantly parasympathetic. </p></div>		</li>
