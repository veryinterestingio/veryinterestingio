			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen this question so many times that sometimes when I wake up the first thing I can think of is to see how my grip is. I haven’t noticed any weakness so I assume I am superhuman. I am beginning a training campaign so I can successfully fly through monkey bars 0.5 seconds after opening my eyes. One day I hope to be able to sleep while hanging off of my door arch with one pinky finger</p></div>		</li>
