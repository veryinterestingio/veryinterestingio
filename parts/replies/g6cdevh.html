			<div class="markdown"><p>Another powerful technique isn't just repeating the same lies over and over again, it's telling different, contradictory lies. You would think this would be self defeating, but the goal here isn't to convince people of falsehoods, but to convince them that the truth is impossible to find, and to just throw up their hands in confusion. Whatever is actually true becomes difficult to discover and people lose hope in being able to find it, and thus stop looking with any diligence.</p></div>		</li>
