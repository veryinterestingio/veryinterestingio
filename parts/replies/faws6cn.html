			<div class="markdown"><p>This is completely wrong.</p>
<p>Every time you wish to deploy an updated version of your game on Steam you must upload a new build. You then mark the new build as the active build, and the steam client will replace/update the required chunks on end users systems.</p>
<p>If it is the first time someone is downloading the game, they will always download the latest build.</p>
<p>It is not like the old days of content delivery where you would download the base version and then patch individual files to reach a current version.</p></div>		</li>

I stand corrected on this answer - I used to field this exact question all the time working in digital content sharing for a library system and let me tell you for anybody who does not have Valve's money to throw around this is still very much the current model.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most people don’t read the replies at all, even with an edit like that, and there’s no point in keeping up something that’s literally entirely incorrect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But wait, the updates do become part of the main download. If you were to just now buy Skyrim, you'd download the latest version including all the various updates that have come out since launch. I just recently did this and there was no follow-on update download, just the initial install download then I was ready to go. So op's situation does seem strange. Possible the update just happened to come down as he was doing first download?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's literally the only way that OP could have had that experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it was also redistributables for .NET or such. Companies include them and force you to reinstall them just to make sure these bases are covered. No harm in installing them again, crucial to have them for the game to work properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate, because I don't think I've been as clear as I wanted to be: </p>
<p>Imagine [developer] launches a new game on Steam, then does a weekly update for the first six weeks after launch, and then a monthly update for six months after that, and then at that point you buy the game 7.5 months after it originally launched, because you were busy and had stuff going on and you're finally getting around to checking it out. </p>
<p>As the system currently works, this whole process involves three transactions: one upload, one download when you buy the game, and one mass update when you install the game. The upload contains several sub-steps that I mentioned in my first comment, the other two transactions are pretty straightforward. </p>
<p>If [developer] uploaded each new update to Steam so that new purchasers were getting the most up-to-date version directly, that's a total of 14 transactions: 1 original upload, a dozen update uploads, and one download when you buy the game, and all but the last transaction are multi-part transactions that probably at least a handful of different people share partial responsibility for, and of course people who bought it at launch still have to get the updates as well so you're not saving anybody more than a few extra minutes in the long run. </p>
<p>Then if there's a problem with your game, it could potentially have occurred during any one of these fourteen transactions, making it MASSIVELY more complicated for customer support to identify the issue, fix your game, patch whatever needs patching to prevent it from happening again... you get the idea. </p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how steam's system works at all though. I work with steamworks, and not origin or anything else, but I can tell you for a fact that you will only ever get an update if there has actually been an update between the last download and the next time you try to launch the game. When you do download a game from steam, there is only the one download. </p>
<p>However, steam does have a record of every single version, and you can easily regress these changes  (even 14 times as you describe being logistically improbable) at any time without any issues. You can also directly update from any version directly to the latest version without wasting any data download via delta file changes.</p>
<p>What OP is describing is basically impossible on Steam, at least, unless there was an actual update.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’ve never had what OP described happen on either Steam or Origin. Maybe OP is confusing installing the game with an additional update step?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understood this correctly, I was lead to believe that when an update is going to be published, some stuff is already put into steam before the new version is even finished. If I remember right, it was some guy on YouTube keeping tabs on a early release game, and he knew the game developers hadn't abandoned it because he could see that they were incrementally adding pieces to the game on steam, but no updated version had come yet. Again, trying to draw from memory, but he explained that steam required the updates to be uploaded through them and completed before they would actually update the game, ensuring that there would only ever be updates from the steam client and none after the game starts up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put this another way: the developer uploads an installer which you can imagine is kind of like a zip file. The updates don’t know how to modify the original zip file, only the files which are contained within the zip file. Steam could possibly run the installer and then run each update, which would successfully patch the game... but they don’t know how to package this back up into the installer. </p>
<p>It’s technically possible to do via an altered process and likely a common install system that all Steam games use. I think this is how PS4 games are handled since Sony can dictate the entire process.</p></div>		</li>
