			<div class="markdown"><p>Read some thing recently that mowing the grass that early is bad for it as it shocks the grass and then it has to recover while also dealing with the heat of the day, whereas if you mow at night, it has all night to recuperate and then the morning dew to rehydrate for the day</p></div>		</li>
