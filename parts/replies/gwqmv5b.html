			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, that's brilliant.  I wish we had realized, but no, we took the Dal to the Vet that last time and she didn't come home to her friend.  </p>
<p>We have a Dal and a Dane now.  The Dal was the pup from the prior post.  When we get to that point in their lives, I'll take them to the vet together and give them some time to understand.  The Dane is an older rescue and I would guess her number comes up first.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To me there is no cost to thinking of animals as having needs and wants, it actually helps me to communicate with them quite quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some vets will do home visits for putting an animal down, and having done it with one of our cats I highly recommend it. It lowers their stress level and keeps them in an environment they're familiar with, and of course your other animal(s) will already be there.</p></div>		</li>
