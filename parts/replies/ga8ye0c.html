			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, genetic bottlenecking refers to the loss of variety in a gene pool due to low population numbers, not an event specific to human history. Cheetahs have also gone through a genetic bottleneck which explains why they're all very genetically similar, and any currently endangered species which used to have a larger population is going through one now, assuming it recovers rather than becoming extinct. This is a major problem, as members which may have had adaptive traits that would be advantageous in the future if not absolutely necessary for survival can no  longer help to prevent extinction should a rapid environmental change occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those population estimates you're describing are something called &quot;effective population size,&quot; which is a mathematical model parameter that should not be confused with the actual number of individuals in the population. The true size of the population is not recoverable using genetic methods. Effective population size, which is what we can reconstruct, is essentially the number of actual individuals it would take to produce the observed genetic pattern if the population was a nearly ideal Hardy-Weinberg population with truly random mating and no forces of evolution acting on it other than its size.</p>
<p>In real populations, there's always lots of deviations from true random mating. for example, people tend to choose partners that are geographically close to them or genetically closely related, socially powerful individuals tend to mate with more partners, there's natural selection, some groups have ecological advantages or disadvantages, etc. In almost all cases, these deviations from random mating <strong>reduce</strong> the effective population size compared to the actual population size, generally by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>There are things that can actually make the effective size larger than the true population size, though, and these would be what we'd want to use to help ourselves recover from a dangerous drop in population size. The most important would be reproduction between people as genetically different form each other as possible.</p></div>		</li>
