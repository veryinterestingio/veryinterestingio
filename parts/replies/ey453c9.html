<p>Swear words is your brain trying to manage the situation (hence the articulate words), whereas crying, screaming, yelping is just you being completely out of control and surrendering (which can be more dangerous, depending on the situation). If you notice people fleeing while saying &quot;oh fuck fuck fuck !&quot;, they still have a grap on the situation, they're not overwhelmed, whereas people fleeing while screaming are most likely to hit a wall without even realizing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's been a number of studies on this.  You definitely get more relief from bad words than neutral words.  The more profane you perceive the word to be, the more relief you get.  e.g., &quot;fuck!&quot; provides more relief than &quot;shit!&quot; which provides more relief than a minced oath like &quot;gosh darnit!&quot;  And the effect is amplified in people who don't normally use profanity in their everyday speech.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those who swear habitually reported significantly less pain relief from swearing than did those do not.</p>
