			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer, but how does bringing in more oxygen into the blood vessels help with eyes being less dry? Is it to help make eyewater/tears more easily somehow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it doesn't directly. Usually redness (hyperemia) is a general, non descript inflammatory response. Eye dryness has been better understood the past few decades; there are actually inflammatory markers on the ocular surface which causes that burning gritty feeling most know and love lol. The vessels dilate to bring in those inflammatory markers. The eye also makes more tears (through glands, not the blood vessels). Usually this makes no sense to people. &quot;if my eyes are so 'dry' then why are they always wet?&quot; - the eyes send a response to the brain to make more tears because they are dry. It's a way to bring moisture to the eyes. So yeah it's more the cascade of response that helps, not the dilation specifically. It certainly helps to see the problem although I would say not all dry eye would show vessel dilation either. It's not always black and white.</p>
<p>Usually oxygen deprived eyes and dryness are described together because of a very common scenario... contact lenses (can happen to non contact lens wearers too but I would say it's more common with lenses). The cornea is actually avascular so it just gets oxygen from the tears/inside the eye but the whites of our eyes relies on the oxygen from the blood vessels, so lack of oxygen triggers them to dilate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised you didn't say this explicitly but the reason dilated blood vessels are necessary when your eyes are dry is because your eyes aren't getting the oxygen they need. Normally the surface of your eyes gets it's oxygen from the back of the eyelids when they are closed but when they are open it gets it's oxygen from the oxygen dissolved into the liquid from the air. No liquid no oxygen dissolving so now we need to bring the blood vessels into play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it this way: your eyes need a certain amount of nutrients and oxygen to stay working properly. As you stay awake a long time your metabolism starts to slow and less nutrients and oxygen are going towards the eye. In order to compensate, the blood vessels dilate ( get bigger) so more blood and oxygen can get to the eyes and attempt to keep them working as best as possible.</p>
<p>The same theory works for essentially all other organs also. (I just know this because I recently took a grad level cardio physiology course.) </p>
<p>Hope that all makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, very possible to only have them in one eye :) and you don't see it all the time because your brain learns to filter out useless information (it's still there, you just don't see it). Also sometimes when the floater is on a white background you may notice it more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think when using weed the blood pressure goes up...and then blood vessels dilate as the blood pressure comes back down. So same thing as before; when vessels are more dilated the eye appears more pink!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other direction. Pressure goes down. That is why it is often cited as a way to relieve glaucoma which is when you have too much pressure behind your eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main psychoactive endocannabinoid in marijuana, THC, gets into your system and causes your blood pressure to decrease. As a result, your inner-eye pressure lowers and causes blood vessels and capillaries to dilate. This allows blood flow to increase and gives small blood vessels more room to expand, resulting in what we see when we look in the mirror.</p>
