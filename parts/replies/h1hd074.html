<p>so in this case, it would be cutting heroin with a non-active ingredient and adding fentanyl to increase the perceived purity of the &quot;stomped&quot; heroin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Stomping on sounds like the more extreme version lol, cutting the fuck out whatever drug it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I think this pretty much sums it up (assuming the pics and claim is accurate). If you simply look at the pictures, there is no way that you can use a “safe” amt of fentanyl mixed in with heroine to guarantee that the buyer won’t get the effect they are looking for. As someone stated, the reason this is used instead of some other filler and is that the dealer wants the buyer to think they are “getting the good shit.”  As a drug dealer, there is no way you can do that without ensuring that each dose they buyer gets has fentanyl in it. The only way to do that is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you have 100% heroine to begin with. </p>
</li>
<li>Add fentanyl to EACH individual package at the safe amount. </li>
</ol>
<p>But, if you look at the pics, that’s not going to save you very much heroine and it’s just too damn time consuming. So, you get way too much fentanyl mixed in. </p>
<p>Of course, idk why they don’t factor in the loss to n sales from killing a customer. I don’t know what the world is coming to when u can’t trust your drug dealer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thoughts are that the heroin is reduced significantly more and the added fentanyl makes it “seem” pure. So you’re actually able to use more inert fillers for increased profits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And smuggling bulk heroin is hard. A kg brick is easily found compared to a tiny sachet containing 5 to 10g of fentanyl. You could smuggle all the fentanyl you'd ever need through the postal system easily.</p>
<p>So it's the war on drugs that directly responsible. Cause drug smugglers are kinda risk averse after all. So if a more potent form of a drug can be smuggled, they'll do that.</p>
<p>Even if none of the customers but the fentanyl addicted even want that drug and would all prefer heroin or oxycodon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo it’s not 99% heroin and 1% fentanyl, it’s 50% heroin, 1% fetanyl, and 49% inert filler (all numbers are just examples, I have no idea what the ratios would actually be).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why don't I feel pleasure from opiates like so many people do? I had a back injury and had to take morphine for a few weeks but it just gave me a heavy feeling around my armpits and the pain reduced but didn't go away. I took myself off it as I didn't like the side effects and physical therapy helped me heal the most. I had a six week Pilates course for free on the NHS and it changed my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the individual, the type of opiate, and the way they use it.  I was the same way, I ate a Vicodin or morphine here and there for years, and while I liked how it helped my pain , and somewhat enjoyed the high, I never saw what the big deal was.</p>
<p>Then one day I was absolutely struggling at work with pain/no energy, contemplating quitting, so I snorted a  coworker’s 15mg oxycodone, and it was instantly my new favorite thing and the best I’d ever felt.  I was asking for one every morning <em>very</em> soon after.  Then one for lunch, after work, etc.</p>
<p>100% my biggest regret</p></div>		</li>
