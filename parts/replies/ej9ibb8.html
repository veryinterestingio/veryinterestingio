			<div class="markdown"><p>Emotional reactions can produce physical symptoms. Many people with severe depression may have major physical symptoms that mislead doctors.  </p>
<p>And I can tell you from experience. When ever I get major negative emotions or relapse in to depression, my right hand will stiffen and I will experience pain, horrible pain as if someone was cutting my hand open.   </p>
<p>It really isn't any different that bruxism because of stress, or tensing of shoulders because of anxiety. Hell some emotional reactions can be so powerful to some people they can cause heartattacks if you got an underlying issue.   </p>
<p>Hormones are hell of a thing for our bodies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have severe depression that will last the remainder of my life due to a serotonin deficiency and I get the worst pain in my chest during The Really Really Bad Times. I swear it’s like I can feel my heart breaking. </p>
<p>Edit: I guess we’re all doctors on reddit and I’ll have to mention that my depression is not solely caused by the deficiency - I had a fucked up childhood/first 20 years - but because of the deficiency, I’ll always be depressed. Always. </p>
<p>Edit 2: Drugs that stimulate serotonin don’t work but the reuptake inhibitors or SSRI/SNRIs help. I’m on my 5th medication at the moment, and this one has worked the best, though they say I shouldn’t get my hopes up, because I’ll build tolerances to each medication and have to switch when needed.</p>
<p>I’m deficient both because of the way my body processes serotonin, and the fact that it doesn’t make enough. It’s caused migraines and other issues when I was younger, and though I’ve been depressed as long as I can remember, I was diagnosed as a teenager.</p>
<p>It <em>maaay</em> cause issues when I’m older and we’re not sure for now basically. It’s like was said, I have enough to walk and talk and whatnot, but I’ll always be severely deficient. Fingers crossed I make it without Parkinson’s, honestly. </p>
<p>I am happy sometimes! I always have dopamine to get me by, and I can’t stress enough how much therapy and medication have helped (it’s important to note, - my depression is not solely from the deficiency, but it will never “go away” either <em>because of it</em>). I work really hard to find silver linings/happy things everywhere, and fill my time with things I enjoy - both in my work and personal life. </p>
<p>Edit 3: thanks for the silver kind benefactor! never gotten this before so at the risk of r/awardspeechedits, thanks a bunch!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious since I didnt know this was a thing that doctors diagnosed. Its just so very bleak. Do drugs that stimulate serotonin then have no effect on you? Also, do inhibitors not make it go further to even it out? Doesnt a deficiency cause things like Parkinson's and cant they use serotonin to manipulate that? I'm just so disheartened to think that you are going to live the rest of your days with depression but have enough serotonin to still walk and talk and we as humans dont have a strong enough understanding of happy chemicals to help folks like you out. Like you have to be happy sometimes, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Massage therapist here. Many times when the body feels emotional stress, yes a part of it will tense. Often it’s a part that you are not even aware of, which will put pressure on a nerve and which then refers pain down the line of it to a different area. I also see this with physical pain. I’ll be working on a tender area in the shoulders and the person will suddenly feel pain in their lower leg.  Hope this gives one additional explanation to y’all.  :)</p></div>		</li>
