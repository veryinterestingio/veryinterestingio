			<div class="markdown"><p>You're attempting to answer this without any application of atomic orbital theory. While concepts like the octet rule and charge ratios are a crude tool that leads to an answer, they are logical outputs of a first principles AO approach which has more rigour and isn't some opaque &quot;magic box&quot; solutions.</p>
<p>&quot;Octets&quot; themselves aren't relevant, what is relevant is the energy level of the orbital the added electron is being added to, or removed from. The octet rule is just an output from how the deeper relationships apply to a very limited set of atoms. You can't just &quot;avoid shielding effects&quot; and attempt to adequately understand ionisation or electron affinity. That's like &quot;avoiding adding flour&quot; when baking a cake.</p>
<p>Talking about &quot;1:1 energetically favourable configurations&quot; like that makes no sense as it suggests that any ion should be less stable than the atom it forms from, and ions with multiple charges should become progressively less stable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wel, yes, I know that's too empirical, but kinda works for those elements that doesn't have d or f orbitals, for these sets where this approach works, you don't need to know deeply orbital theory, that is a nightmare to teach in a reddit post. Now, if this guy need to understand orbital theory he can build over this image, and is way easier to understand and comprehend advanced topics with a understandable base. Sometimes accuracy is not all in an answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, AO theory is ideal in this situation,  but if you are simplifying, even basic repulsion/attraction rules gives you the overall general trend without talking about &quot;octets&quot; at all. You only really need to talk shielding when you start filling a new shell, and that's a concept people who have only been taught 2,8,8 should be able to grapple with. </p>
<p>OP clearly understands nuclear attraction to some degree based on their post, it's not hard to take that further. Even 9th/10th Grade explanations usually require some explanation based on relative attraction, though those are more often limited to periodic trends in group 1/7.</p></div>		</li>
