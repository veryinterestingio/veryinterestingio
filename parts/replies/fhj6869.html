Edit: it happens when you have a drying drop containing some dissolved solids. If the edge of the droplet is immobilized, then there has to be a net flow of liquid out towards the drop’s edge. Otherwise, the edge of the drop would move in. This carries and deposits particles near the edge of the drop, leading to the formation of a ring. There’s other ways it can happen, but this is one basic case</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I've seen it explained is that as the edge dries(liquid evaporating leaving solids behind), the inner liquid flows out, bringing more solids to the edge.</p>
<p>Kind of like a giant pile of sand, if you dig at the edges, eventually the higher center will collapse and cascade towards the edge.  Molecules of water react the same way, only with far far less friction so it spreads much easier.</p>
<p>Not that you're wrong, I'm just presenting it differently.  That and I wanted to say it's a shame this answer is 6 posts from the top when sorting that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your explanation too! :) it’s cool how much people actually research the drying of droplets, and how important and non-trivial some of it can be. It’s been over 20 years since Deegan’s paper on the subject, and there’s still novel research on the subject looking at more and more complex systems </p>
<p>Also, I looked back, and there’s definitely other answers along the same vein as ours. It’s pretty cool to see people talking about it</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>Dispersed</em> solids. Dissolved implies heterogeneous mixing has combined two phases into one, whereas dispersed implies a liquid with two (or more) phases intimately mixed.</p></div>		</li>
