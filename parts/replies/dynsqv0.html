			<div class="markdown"><p>No one buys cheap beer hoping to savor any sort of complex flavor. That's like complaining that your Mazda Miata can't tow your speedboat.</p>
<p>And as non-beer-snobs have mentioned in other threads, low-flavor refreshing beer definitely has its place. The last thing that anyone wants after working outside all evening in 100F sun is a coffee stout. I could almost puke thinking about such a situation.</p>
<p>Beer seem to bring out some of the tallest horses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah no shit. The problem with beer snobs is everyone thinks they’re one. Sometimes I want a coke, sometimes I want a bland and boring glass of water. Sometime I want a local brew poured so there’s some head and not ice cold, sometimes I want to crack open an ice cold light beer that was at the back of the fridge. </p>
<p>But most of all, I could give two shits what someone enjoys to drink. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me the problem with most low flavor beers isn't necessarily the lack of flavor, it's the lack of flavor to hide the off notes</p>
<p>I don't really like lagers but pilsners are the shit. They taste good and they're light and refreshing </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This thing is there are so many other inexpensive, refreshing beers that don't taste as terrible as Budweiser or Coors. This argument is always presented as Budweiser vs. exotic craft beers when there is a whole world of beers in between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was this period in my life where I had this cough that would often be so bad that it would eventually make me throw up. Sometimes after eating ice cream, I would throw up, and it actually tasted pretty good coming out, especially by throw up standards. Can't say the same for the other types of food I threw up. Luckily that shitty ass cough eventually went away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure. My wife and I occasionally make ice cream. For my son’s birthday, we made a dulce de leche vanilla ice cream. We were getting more excited than we should be when we smelled the custard as it was heating up. I’m surprised it made it into the churner, because we could have drank it at any temperature as it was cooling. </p></div>		</li>
