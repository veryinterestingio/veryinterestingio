<p>Arbitron</p>

<p>I've heard people within the radio industry say that Arbitron ratings are mostly trumped up; it kinda makes me laugh at the name...Arbirary...Arbitron... Anyway, I'm curious if there is truth to that or are they actually using models that predict accurate listener-ship?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extensive data models using extensive research protocol. Everyone likes to critique data when it doesn't seem to meet their own personal feelings but that's the very point of having a uniform metrics system that is not beholden to any individual media outlet or advertiser. Over 80 billion dollars per year are bought in advertising the vast majority of which relies upon Nielsen/Arbitron ratings to make sure it is spent in the right place at the right time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't fake per se, but their methodology is suspect.  Since they use hidden sounds in broadcasts, certain types of content hide the signal better than others.</p>
<p>Namely, it's really hard to hide in spoken content and light music.  There are a few lawsuits about it right now.</p>
<p>The biggest one is the lady who does &quot;love songs at night&quot;, which is basically just talking and light music.  Her ratings dropped significantly when they switched to using the electronic meters.</p>
<p>Another one was a bunch of black owned stations lost a lot of listenership when they switched to the electronic meters.</p>
<p>Some of that is suspected to be due to &quot;aspirational logging&quot;.  Back when they used written logbooks, you had to write down what you were listening to, and they suspect a lot of people would write down stuff they &quot;would be listening to right now&quot; but not what they were actually listening to.</p>
<p>So in some sense, the electronic meter is more accurate, but also it uses a signal that isn't equal across content types.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were in the music business in the 90's, besides Billboard, the three other data points that were your life would have been: Arbitron (radio), SoundScan, and Pollstar (concerts).   Prior to Soundscan, data was collected based on distributor shipments which was highly error prone and didn't accurately account for returned product.</p></div>		</li>
