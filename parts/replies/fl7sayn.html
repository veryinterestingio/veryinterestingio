			<div class="markdown"><p>I was sexually molested as a young child and didn’t recall the events until years later when I had joined the military and was in base housing (similar to where the assault had happened) and had starting drinking pretty heavily.</p>
<p>Even now, I only have vague images, nothing concrete about what happened, just that it did happen.  I remember the house, the room, and who did it (but no imagery of the person, thankfully).  I’m pretty sure that I remember being threatened with death if I said anything, but I don’t know how real that is since I was around 3 at the time.</p>
<p>I was looking on Google maps recently, and the whole area had been demolished, so the place only exists in my head now.  I still think about occasionally, but I’ve pretty much worked through it over the years.  I had a psychologist examine me and concluded that I don’t have PTSD from it, which is something, but it did have a huge impact on me.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the ramble, just wanted to share my experience with how memories can be slippery.</p></div>		</li>

I glad to hear you're doing Ok too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is your experience with something that already happened so long ago &quot;becoming&quot; a memory for the first time? I'm trying to imagine what that must feel like. What makes it feel like a memory when it first starts coming back, rather than just some sort of figment of your imagination? How do you know that it's an actual real memory?</p>
<p>I feel like I don't even have particularly solid memories of anything from when I was 5 or 6, nothing more than tiny snippets. Is the memory that came back to you stronger than your other memories from that age or does it sort of feel distant and &quot;not real&quot; in that way my normal memories of being that age do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone I love experienced a very traumatic event at age 5. When things came back for him it was the same— he couldn’t quite believe he had blocked it out, yet he knew for certain it had happened. It was something in the shadows that finally clicked into place. Therapy helped, I think. I hope it helps for you, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had almost the same experience. I (44F) too was molested I think I was 7, by my uncle. I remember details, who, what, where one particular time. Gross. Anyway I didn't recall until I was in high school, it hit like a ton of bricks. I've struggled from then on with questioning if it really happened.
My mom found a note to my human sexuality college professor and I had to tell her (her baby brother) who did it. I think my mom lived in denial, we never really discussed it and I could've gone my whole life with only my best friend knowing but she found the note.
My mom passed away 2 weeks ago, devastating for me. With services right around the corner I know he's (uncle) gonna be there. I hate him and the only reason I've never called him out is because it will due more harm to the rest of our family. I can't. I did however ask my dad 3 days ago if Mom believed me. It's truly haunted me thinking she didn't and now I can't ask. She did. She struggled a lot with it. I cried for hours. Anyway, I don't know where I'm going with this now. It feels good to be able to tell people who don't know me I guess. So thanks for reading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hey, your story mirrors mine in many ways (m46), at the time of my raping. (I was also 7,)
I called him uncle. I disassociated from that all through high school  The memories returned when at my Mums birthday he tried to man handle me and i lost my shit. Over the next 25 years Ive told myself I been dealing with it, coping with this substance or that habit. Recently (6 weeks ago yesterday) my body gave up. Unknown to me u til i dropped, I have stressed myself into switching on a recessive gene that makes my red blood cells attack parts of my body when I am stressed or anxious. This has also left me with a gastrointestinal condition that also stressed into existence. My Mum and Grandma always begged my siblings and I to protect the family. my Grandmother passed in june last year. When i told my Mum i was to fragile mentally to face my &quot;uncle touchy feely&quot; she lost her shit and hung up on me.
I protected my family's name for over 25 years, and its what will kill me. I just last week went to my first ever therapy session. And I intend to finally tell the police about it. Tell who you need to i say. from my first session i can say its helped me understand the long held defences i have built in place. sorry for rambling, never thought i would say any of that online, but i hope it helps you. your not alone.
good luck friend</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a BA in psychology and intend to enter a doctorate program next year. One of the most interesting classes I took throughout my entire college experience was cognitive psych. In it, we spent a good amount of time covering memory, false memories, and so-called &quot;repressed&quot; memories. Simply put, the evidence is not there to suggest that our subconscious minds have this ability to bury traumatic events after the fact in order to protect us. In fact, what we know about the way that memory works is that we have an increased ability to encode and retrieve long term memories during traumas. Consider, for example, how virtually every American who is old enough to remember can tell where they were and what they were doing on 9/11.</p>
<p>Very interestingly, in your case, you were of a specific age in which we're aware that certain memories that resurface are frequently mislabeled repressed. Very young children are significantly less capable of encoding memories than are older children and adults, so toddlers fall into this weird area in which they might encode traumas, but do a poor job of doing so. A memory that is poorly encoded is difficult to retrieve. That's why someone who experienced a traumatic event as a toddler might not remember the event until just the right circumstance triggers the memory. Essentially, it's as if remnants of the memory are left sitting, undiscovered, in a pitch black room, and something that happens in the present manages to illuminate those remnants just long enough to be discovered. The full memory is unlikely to be discovered because in all likelihood, it was never properly encoded in the first place.</p>
<p>This might sound to someone as if I'm describing a repressed memory, but the important thing to understand is that this isn't a defense mechanism the unconscious mind is utilizing to protect a person. This is a matter of a very specific age group encoding memories just well enough that they have the potential to be retrieved in the future given the right conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was abused systematically by my father from the time I was five until his death when I was 11, and I remember it vividly. I don't know if it was the first time it happened or not, most likely not, but I remember the exact words he said to me the first time I can remember telling him to stop. He told me &quot;When I was your age, I would have loved for my dad to do for me what I'm doing for you.&quot; </p>
<p>I never had the benefit of repressing the memories, because it was a constant part of my life for so long. I'm not saying that it doesn't happen. I guess I just wanted to share since I don't really talk about it to anyone. There's still quite a large stigma against male sex abuse victims speaking out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any sources on that? Because several studies have shown in detail that trauma affects memory formation. (eg <em>Nelson, Charles A., and Leslie J. Carver. 1998. The Effects of Stress and Trauma on Brain and Memory: A View from Development Cognitive Neuroscience. Development and Psychopathology 10, no.4: 793–809.</em>)</p>
<p>my response to your 911 statement is that that's vicarious trauma and a poor example, better to ask someone who was actually there if they can recall specific parts of their experience </p>
<p>The lines between repression and suppression are blurry - I have rarely seen anyone recover &quot;memories&quot; from out of a clear blue sky but we see memories patched together from blurred past events fairly regularly. </p>
<p>Good luck on your postgrad, embrace the uncertainty - it's really important to be able to hold that clinically :)</p>
<p>for the non clinical redditors who don't want to read a paper, an infographic from the National Institute for the Clinical Application of Behavioral Medicine, showing how trauma can affect memory formation. It's very very complex and variable <a href="https://www.nicabm.com/trauma-how-trauma-can-impact-4-types-of-memory-infographic/" target="_blank">https://www.nicabm.com/trauma-how-trauma-can-impact-4-types-of-memory-infographic/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please read this book. The author is one of the most prominent researchers and clinicians in trauma in the world and was part of the team that wrote about it for the DSM-IV and V, and documents how his submissions from his team were censored. In the book he also goes into why there's motive to counter evidence for repressed memories in the psych community.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SO in the science of it. Look up a bio of the author. He and his team (which I don't remember if he led or just was a part of) wrote the segments about trauma for the DSM-IV and V. Those segments were censored to omit C-PTSD from IV (later included in V) and information about repressed memories.</p>
<p>The book isn't really good to read from a self help perspective. It's not therapeutic in and of itself and if you've got a history of trauma it's difficult as hell to read, though it's empowering to develop an understanding of how trauma works. It's written to be digestible by both clinicians and the general public but it's really more for researchers and therapists/counselors who work with traumatized people. He began his practice working with recently returned Vietnam vets at a time when people were trying to claim PTSD didn't exist so they wouldn't have to provide adequate care for veterans.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of.</p>
<p>It has plenty of sources, but outs some of the more in depth stuff in text boxes. That way, you can see it's the detail at a glance and choose to skip it or not.</p>
<p>So yes, it's there's, but you won't 'have' to read it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, very much so! But in a way that’s easy to understand, which I was grateful for lol. He talks about things like how memory is stored in the brain, how different parts of the body interact when traumatic events happens, and all kinds of things. </p>
<p>The last third of the book is about treatment approaches to trauma (not in a self-help way, but from a research perspective) and I’d say the rest of it really focuses on the science of brain + body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My hypothesis about this is just that the events/time in childhood that we don't remember just weren't impactful. For example: a lot of the childhood memories I have were moments that ended up teaching me something. I don't recall things in such detail where I'd remember what I ate for dinner on some random night when I was five; but I do remember the conversation my older brother (he was in high school) had with me when I was five or six about how we didn't have the money to afford both things we wanted <em>and</em> things we needed, so he was trying to teach me the importance of putting need before want. </p>
<p>I do also remember some seemingly mundane things, but those memories were often triggered by something in a more recent experience. They may not have been impressive in the moment, but upon recall I would be like, &quot;Whoah. I forgot about that until now...&quot; and suddenly have new perspective on that moment in hindsight, thus making the recall of the memory impactful for my current situation.</p></div>		</li>
