			<div class="markdown"><p>Not any more. Bacardi 151 stop being produced in 2016.</p>
<p>You CAN get 151 proof rum however. In Canada, you can get Lamb's 151; I think there are other 151s available. Surprisingly it doesn't burn (instead will creep up from behind), but I can actually feel the alcohol vaporizing onto my lips as I drink it.</p></div>		</li>
