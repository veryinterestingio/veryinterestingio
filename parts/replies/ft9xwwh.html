			<div class="markdown"><p>Started in the 1600s when someone was playing with encryption and came up with replacing each letter with a 5-char representation. He used the letters instead of 0 and 1, so the letter O would be something like ABBAB; X would be BABAB. Leibniz then built a logical system on 0 and 1 (he was a nut for logic-based math, I believe) in the 1700's. Then FF to the 1930's, electricity was being used, and the 0 and 1 was the only real way to represent an on/off state electrically. Turing and others started building electromechanical relays to do calculations, and <em>poof</em>, computers.</p>
<p>edit: Oh yea, Morse Code is in there somewhere too, as using a set of symbols to represent a single symbol. All these ideas just got thrown together eventually.</p></div>		</li>
