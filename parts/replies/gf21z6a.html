			<div class="markdown"><p>You made me think that if the earth is moving and you project light in the same direction then it's speed will be added to the earth's speed and subtracted if projected in the opposite direction. Is this true? If not, why is that? (I already think it's not true but I want to know why)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's indeed not true. If you postulate that it's not true - that whatever you do, you will always measure the same speed of light - and take this postulate together with normal mechanics, then the simplest thing you get is the Special Relativity. That's a theory that basically says that the Universe goes to extreme lengths, in particular by changing the speed in which time moves and changing distances, to make sure you always measure the speed of loght to be the same. Our current experimental evidence says that this theory is valid extremelt precisely. It also has a lot of fascinating consequences, especially in paricle physics. So there is no reallt an answer to &quot;why&quot; because the invariability of speed of light seems to be a basic property of the Universe.</p>
<p>If I can speculate a little, the &quot;reason for the design choice&quot; of having it like that is that having a limiting speed is really good for establishing causality and then having it the same from every frame of reference means that no frame of reference is preferred - which seems to be an overarching motive of the Universe: the independence of laws of physics on your viewpoint for them, which really makes the Universe much more ... universal :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't seem to me like light having a speed limit is the fundamental thing and the universe accommodates that. The &quot;speed limit,&quot; despite being a definite number, seems to be a result of more fundamental properties of physics, of space/time. It's where that causality falls apart, and if causality falls apart we personally wouldn't be here to observe that. </p>
<p>The speed of light, the particular number that it is, doesn't need to be seemingly imposed onto a reality that has to change to keep it true. Fundamentally physics is still a mystery of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <em>reason</em> it's not true is what's called &quot;Galilean Relativity&quot; or &quot;Galilean Invariance&quot;.</p>
<p>Imagine you're on a sealed chamber in a spaceship travelling at an unknown speed (galileo used regular ships, but we have better thought experiments now :p) and you want to discover your speed. Is there any way to prove what speed you're moving at <em>without</em> looking out a window?</p>
<p>It turns out, there <em>isn't</em> - all the laws of physics must work the same in any &quot;inertial&quot; (non-accelerating) reference frame; so all experiments that don't reach outside your box can never tell you how fast that box is going - because it's only going anywhere <em>relative</em> to something else.</p>
<p>Einstein applied this known aspect of reality to the Maxwell's Equations and the fact that they produce the speed of light in a vacuum - meaning that light must travel at the same speed relative to you, no matter what speed you're traveling at.</p>
<p>Einsteinian Special Relativity and General Relativity are then the results of taking that fact and working out what it implies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're describing is basically what the Michaelson-Morley experiment that others have mentioned was trying to prove. They failed. The reason is special relativity. The idea that made Einstein famous. It's pretty complicated, but what Einstein discovered and we have since confirmed more strongly than pretty much any other observation about the universe, is that the speed of light (in a vacuum) is <em>always</em> the same. If I'm standing still and you're travelling past me in a spaceship at 99% of the speed of light, and we both measure the same photon, we both see it moving at the same speed. From your perspective, you're standing still and <em>I'm</em> moving past <em>you</em> at 99% of the speed of light in the other direction. We still both measure the same speed for the photon we are measuring.</p>
<p>It is incredibly counterintuitive, and doesn't work at all like throwing a ball from a moving car or something that we <em>want</em> to be able to compare it to. Things get weird when you deal with speeds near the speed of light.</p>
<p>The key to all of it, and what made Einstein so clever for thinking of it, is that if the speed of light remains constant no matter what, <em>something</em> else must change to make this all makes sense. The things that had to change, however, were space and time <em>themselves</em>. Meaning, the constant passage of time and the constant length of predetermined distances that we are so used to being fundamentally constant, are not constant at all, but entirely defined by the perspective of the observer. If you and I are moving relative to each other, we will fundamentally disagree about the passage of time and the distance between points in space, because both are dependent on our frame of reference.</p>
<p>The only reason this isn't apparent to us on a day to day basis, is that we don't interact with macroscopic objects that move a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to us. If we all flew around in star trek spaceships moving near the speed of light, we'd deal with the relativity of time and space on a daily basis and all of this would be obvious to us.</p></div>		</li>
