			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be misunderstanding what you're saying, but incretins are a major driving force in insulin release, whereas blood glucose levels by themselves don't do much despite insulin release being glucose dependent.  If you administer glucose intravenously, insulin release doesn't really budge that much (<a href="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fcc13737/MediaObjects/13054_2014_Article_2862_Fig1_HTML.jpg?as=webp" target="_blank">Graph</a> from <a href="https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/cc13737" target="_blank">here</a>). While insulin release is glucose dependent, incretins massively amplify the signal in the beta cells, particularly at the step where calcium influx causes insulin release (at least GLP does).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is inaccurate. Incretins augment insulin release, whereas the primary stimulator is glucose itself (direct). Beta cells have GLUT-2 receptors that are constitutively expressed and can sense glucose levels in the blood. The downstream metabolites of glycolysis and TCA cause a release of insulin (mainly through KATP channels, but also Ca-dependent methods).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which part is inaccurate?  Insulin release is glucose dependent or that incretins significantly attenuate insulin release?</p></div>		</li>
