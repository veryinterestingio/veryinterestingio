			<div class="markdown"><p>It was always influenza, but it has been different subtypes of influenza (there's not much immune cross-protection between different influenza subtypes). There's very little actual data to answer that question. Descendants of the 1918 influenza still circulate today, so we knew a lot about it even before the actual virus was rescued from victims who were buried in permafrost. But 1918 represented a sharp break with previous influenza subtypes, so there's nothing circulating and we don't know much if anything about previous subtypes. </p>
<p>Because it's believed that older people were at least partially protected against the 1918 influenza, it's likely that another H1N1 strain (or an H1Nx, or an HxN1) had been an important subtype something like 20-50 years previously and was then replaced. Aside from that, there's been some speculation about the couple pandemics before 1918 but nothing with much support.</p>

<p>Available evidence suggests that the 1889 pandemic was caused by H3 influenza, although other interpretations suggest that H2 influenza was responsible</p>

<p>--<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4148685/" target="_blank">A possible outbreak of swine influenza, 1892</a></p>
<p>The 1918 virus jumped into humans from birds, probably directly but perhaps with a swine intermediate, and then jumped back into pigs very quickly -- many swine influenza strains today are more or less direct descendants of the 1918 virus. (The 2009 H1N1 pandemic jumped into humans from swine, and that virus was similar enough to 1918 that the H1N1 vaccine protects against the 1918 virus, at least in ferrets.). That pattern, though, may have been a new one -- it's likely that before 1918 most human influenzas jumped from horses more often, with swine influenza being a surprisingly recent epidemic.  </p>

<p>...from the 1600s equine-influenza epizootics were extensively documented, with re cognisable clinical and epizootiological details. These epizootics were often associated with outbreaks in human beings</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Flu” is short for influenza. The take-home analogy here is that there always were cats, it’s just that one year, there was an explosion of black persian cats, and now, 100 years later, that’s why all cats we see are descended from those black persian cats, even though there are new breeds that have evolved since then from that founding population.</p></div>		</li>
