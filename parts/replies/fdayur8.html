			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body has a finite amount of energy to dedicate to homeostasis. If the caloric requirements for maintaining our body temp are increased then more resources are required and more work has to be done. Lowering ambient temp to sixty degrees away from our core temp increases caloric requirements, so does exercise. Why would making your body work harder to achieve these rather important goals not have consequences? </p>
