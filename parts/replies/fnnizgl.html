			<div class="markdown"><p>It would fall under secondary headache, since it has an underlying cause (sinusitis).</p>
<p>Tension type presents as non-throbbing constant pain on both sides of the head. Like a tight band is placed on your head. </p>
<p>Migraine type is throbbing, on 1 side, and includes secondary symptoms such as nausea. It may be preceded by an 'aura', which can be very diverse, ranging from temporary inability to speak to taste changes. But the most common one is visual disturbances.</p>
<p>Cluster type headache appears in clusters (obviously), so you could have no problem for years but suddenly you get multiple attacks a week, until it passes again. This pain is severe, to the point it has received the nickname 'suicide headache'. Typically it's a sharp throbbing pain centered behind one eye, many describe it as a knife being twisted in your brains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get cluster headaches. I had one today in fact. I noticed my vision got funny and took my medication right away and it helped lessen the pain a little. For me it feels like I have a golf ball behind my eye and it is trying to work its way out of my head. They're awful and can last hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much! I always thought I would randomly get a migraine every few months. It was always like a searing hot poker going through my right eye. It would hurt so much I would cry and even vomit from the pain. I was told it was migraines because light and sound made it worse and pulse. I haven't had one for a few years, but I would always take like 6-8 advil and shake until i could fall asleep. A few hours later I would be fine. Thanks again for the info!</p>
<p>Edit: the few months could be an exaggeration because it's been a few years now. Also, for context I never had warning before they hit. I also only vomited from the pain once. Nausea was never a symptom. As a dude, it was like getting hit in the nethers so hard you puked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain caused from pressure in the sinuses.</p>
<p>It's a headache in the sense that it occurs in the head. </p>
<p>But in a neurological sense it doesn't fall under the criteria. </p>
<p>They do at times trigger tension headaches.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Got a family member with severe facial nerve injury, this is a headache too, and thus is treated at a specialized headache hospital facility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suffer from migraines,  which have become rarer as I got older til now only maybe 4 a year. In my 30s I got 2 cluster headaches in a week and can confirm they are very different. I genuinely thought I had been shot in the head, which, as I was living in South Africa at the time, was not an unreasonable thought!</p></div>		</li>
