<p>It probably has to do with, first of all, what you hear. What you hear when you're growing up, what you hear with your friends. Your taste is especially the music you experience. </p>

<p>Someone once said (an author, perhaps) that the music you liked when you were 13 will always resonate with you, and I think that's true; you're going through a period when you're having a lot of FEELINGS about things, lyrics can express those things, and you're able to choose your own albums, etc. at this point rather than being stuck with whatever your parents like/put on the stereo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would have said 15-17 was the key formative period. Certainly was for me, but it was a long time ago (1970-72). I was lucky to be able to listen to the uber eclectic British DJ John Peel every night. He played everything, even stuff that he did not like, because &quot; he thought it deserved to be heard&quot;. The best of what he played has stayed with me for life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have found it to absolutely be the case for me. I recently rediscovered the music of my youth and I couldn't figure out why I ever stopped listening to it. The mid to late 90s were a golden age of music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think human beings have a genetic predisposition toward music and rhythmic sounds as a matter of survival, but it gets so much more complicated after that point.</p>
<p>I think a lot of musical taste is shaped by one's environment, and we can easily see that represented by the types of music most commonly heard in one community versus another.</p>
<p>Still, most people branch out a bit in their listening choices, including folks like myself that have regular playlists that include anything from metal, to old synthpop, to hip hop, to country, jazz, blues, indie rock, classical, electronic, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I noticed that my taste in music changed a lot as I got into my 20s and 30s and what I listened to was much less tied to my sense of identity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was almost completely a rocker/metal head for most of my teens but as I turned 21 I started listening to a lot, A LOT of hip hop and electronic music. But I feel like it doesn't specifically have to do with your environment. Due to me being a metal head I hung out with metal heads, not the other way around. And I started listening to hip hop after a good friend recommended Kendrick Lamar. Now you might say that's social influence but you'd be right up to a point because he and I live on opposite corners of the country so I was just following his recommendation because he assumed I would like it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed on the social motivators.  There was a span of a few years when I wouldn't listen to certain music because my friends and I used to rip on it in high school.  Pop music, party rap, dubstep, EDM etc was all for brainless jock square fratboy idiots, but underground hip hop, IDM, indie, all super cool, except for the stuff that was kitsch enough to fall into the &quot;hipster&quot; category, which we avoided at all costs.  Classic, I know.</p>
<p>It took me awhile before I met a really open minded guy who knew all the music I found interesting and appreciated it, but also appreciated the poppy stuff, too, and being friends with him kinda dissolved the whole &quot;us and them&quot; thing about music for me because it either just wasn't a factor where he grew up or he overcame it.</p></div>		</li>
