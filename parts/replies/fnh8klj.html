			<div class="markdown"><p>Great comment. Just to add something, it’s important to note that R0 is not completely an intrinsic value. Like omgu states there are social factors and “extrinsic” factors that can be done to lower the R0. For example the R0 in Wuhan for corona may have been drastically different before the lockdown of the city VS after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also means that we can affect the R0 - the whole idea of social distancing is to reduce the R0, and when areas start to reopen, they will be doing it while taking measures to keep the R0 down. </p>
<p>The R0 of every disease is based on cultural factors - Ebola spread in Africa because of cultural rituals like kissing the dead, and wouldn't spread nearly as fast in North America because we would stay away from someone with symptoms, even without PPE existing. </p>
<p>I imagine that if we had universal adoption of masks, reduced capacities of public transit, enforced distances while standing in line and similar measures, the R0 of CV would be far lower than it was before we shut down, quite possibly below 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>R_0 is a confusing number because it’s not a natural average. In the compartmentalized models (like SIR) it’s always some ratio of the infection coefficient(s) to the recovery coefficient(s) which works fine for an average. But in descriptions and our intuition it sounds a lot like just the infection coefficient(s). It’s really not that natural a number to use. </p>
<p>For my own simple modeling I have just used infected population doubling period, which is much more intuitive and easier to calculate.</p></div>		</li>
