			<div class="markdown"><p>I know all that. </p>
<p>What I want to know is have we seen an uptick in IQ I'm a generation that has seen less lead exposure? Like can we see a measurable difference in the population as a whole. </p>
<p>I know the effect is real. I'm not questioning it. I am just curious if a study has shown that we bassically have a more intelligent generation of zennials (I was born in the late 80's so not me)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a case of IQ going up so much as fewer children were suffering developmental and cognitive issues. So it's like asking &quot;are we running faster now that we've stopped putting landmines everywhere and blowing off legs?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;children with blood lead levels of 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (μg/dL) score four points lower on IQ tests than children with blood lead levels of 2 µg/dL.&quot;</p>
<p>Although since so many children were affected it may result in an overall average increase over the decades of high exposure :</p>
<p>`The findings lend credence to an estimate that, in the U.S. over the last 40 years, interventions to reduce lead exposure may have &quot;raised the mean IQ in adults by as much as 4.5 points.&quot;` -- David Bellinger, a neuropsychologist and environmental epidemiologist with Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School and a longtime researcher of lead's effects.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Other results put the number higher at 6 IQ points:</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, who found that since the removal of lead from gasoline in 1976, there's been an 80% drop in blood lead levels, and in that same period a six-point gain in children's IQs.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IQ increases within-country as that country industrializes. Tests have to be re-normed periodically. The best example of this is the Netherlands, which had mandatory military service including IQ testing between 1930s and 1960s. They documented a rise in IQ such that your typical 1930s conscript would be too stupid to serve by the 1960s. Virtually every male was tested during that time: it's not just that smarter people were getting tested.</p>
<p>It's called the Flynn effect. More about it here: <a href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/langsdorf1/" target="_blank"><a href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/langsdorf1/" target="_blank">http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/langsdorf1/</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So tl;dr at the population scale, the effect of lead would probably be hard to tease out.</p></div>		</li>
