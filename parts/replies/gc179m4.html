			<div class="markdown"><p>Melting is <strong>not</strong> an increase in vibrations. </p>
<p>Melting is the release of atoms or molecules from a solid phase into a liquid, where individual molecules can move around more freely. It is thus the molecular translation (movement), not vibrations or rotations that is important in this context.</p></div>		</li>
