			<div class="markdown"><p>Weirdly related, but this was a tactic my grandfather told me they used in the war to burn down crop fields behind enemy lines to try and starve them out. Tie a long string to the cats tail, and at the end a piece of wire wrapped around a rag. Set the rag on fire, let go of the cat, watch the world burn.</p>
<p>War was cruel, but he was a fierce animal lover, which is why he insisted on a long string, so the cat would get hurt......just fucking traumatised.</p></div>		</li>

Then lit the string on fire then walk away, you can get the fire to start in strange locations and on massive delays so you can set up so your on record somewhere far away when the fire starts.</p></div>		</li>
