			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not really a thing that happens naturally. The beekeepers have special screens that are too small to allow the queen to pass though, but large enough for workers. They normally allow a few sections of the hive for bee production, and keep the rest blocked off from the queen. This blocked off part contains only honey, and that’s the part the beekeepers harvest.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much it, you probably want a bee suit as well. The overall process is pretty painless and low maintenance. Getting the bees to live past a winter can be tricky as they're quite vulnerable to cold weather and parasites.</p>
<p>My dad learned by reading a few books (this was back when the Internet was just getting started), and then talking to a local Amish beekeeper. I highly recommend talking to a bee keeper in your area if you can, they'll have lots of tips that are local to your area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also might not be obvious, but the beekeepers also deliberately do not harvest larvae, and they also do not harvest <em>all</em> the honey (the bees need a lot of it to survive!).</p>
<p>Usually, the harvest would be just a portion of a hive's honeycomb at a time, to give them time to rebuild before harvesting more.  This keeps things healthy and safe for the bees so that they can keep producing honey and, potentially, growing the hive larger to make <em>even more</em> honey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some beekeepers do harvest all the honey, and replace it with a cheaper substitute like sugar syrup. It isn't as healthy for the bees but it increases profits. I'm guessing this mostly happens in commercial honey production though.</p></div>		</li>
