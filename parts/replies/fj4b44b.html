			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what's already mentioned, some frogs have anti-freeze proteins, which bind to ice crystals as they form to prevent the damage ice crystals pose to living cells. There can also be manipulation of the sugars in the blood, which can lower the freezing point of the solution. So the frog must reach several degrees cooler to actually freeze.</p>
<p>Edit: to clarify, the temperatures where these frogs hibernate is typically stable toward the lower end. So it's not like the frog necessarily reaches -20 degrees like winter air temperatures can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is well beyond my knowledge, but the practical applications for anti-freeze proteins have been of interest since anyone has been able to prove it has marketable qualities. For instance, the ice cream industry uses anti-freeze proteins to help their products maintain a creamier state after transitioning between thawing and refreezing (which promotes ice crystal formation).</p>
<p>Cryogenesis, however, isn't something that most people currently consider practical. Medical applications on the other hand...???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their body temperature drops very low and their metabolism falls to a very low rate. They are capable of cutaneous respiration (breathing through their skin) and will stay buried in mud or water and get all their oxygen through their skin. They donâ€™t need to eat because their metabolism is so slow. Then when spring comes and temps rise again they return to normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to see these antifreeze frogs in action, there's a new Netflix doc called &quot;Night on Earth&quot; (I think) and you can see the frog freeze and thaw in episode 2. It's mind blowing. I think 26 minutes in? I think I wrote it down because it was so awesome but not sure.</p></div>		</li>
