			<div class="markdown"><p>Weŕe not sure. Some have postulated it has to do with competition with flying vertebrates and that giant insects were in some way biomechanically disadvantaged to pterosaurs, and now birds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer why there were eras where a lot of creatures were bigger may be as simple as the idea that gargantuanism begets gargantuanism, i.e. that the reason there were so many gargantuan organisms at one time is because there were enough other gargantuan organisms at that time that the foodwebs could support organisms that big. A huge insect would have a hard time finding enough to eat in our time, but in a time where many other insects had coevolved to favor size, it would have an easier time meeting its energy needs.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question specifically - no, insects as big as those in the paleozoic would be really unlikely to evolve in our time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insects are squishy, crunchy, and stupid compared to their vertebrate counterparts.  An equivalently sized insect would have harder time moving than a bird, a harder time thinking, and would probably end up being a fat easy target for virtually all other animals. This is the primary reason they got so big in the first place, there wasn't anything to out-compete them.  Once vertebrates got tough outsides (rough skin), tough insides (vertebrae), and powerful bite force(teeth, jaws and claws), the game was over. Slow stupid giant arthropods don't stand a chance with out better armor (which has a limit on thickness on land, or they won't be able to move fast enough to compete, in the water its a different story though).   Still, Insects on land are smarter than their ocean cousins, ants for example have 250,000 neurons, while lobsters have a mere 100,000, and while this does scale with size with animals, a lobster is a whole lot bigger than an ant, though compare that with a rats 200,000,000, and it doesn't even compare. </p></div>		</li>
