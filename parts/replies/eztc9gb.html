			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worse than that. Essilor bought luxotica and satisloh. Essilor now owns most frame brands, lens Crafters, the machinery for lens manufacturing (to my knowledge, no other manufacturer of these machines exists), as well as at least one eye insurance company. It's the worst monopoly I'm aware of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, kinda. For one, laws need to be enforced, and the type of company that establishes a monopoly is exactly the type to employ lawyers that argue in court that it’s not technically a monopoly. Also, though I’m not sure if this is relevant with the glasses industry, but cooperative oligopolies, where a handful of companies circumvent monopoly laws by not having a majority share themselves, but are able to benefit by basically not competing with each other, essentially granting the same situation as a monopoly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not a monopoly (yet). There still are competitors. Problem is they own so many brands but most people have no idea that it´s all from the same company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer.  All of the &quot;technology&quot; in glasses was perfected years ago.  They should be a commodity, however there's basically one company that owns all the glasses companies.  They make it look like ALL the glasses are similarly priced so the consumer feels he can choose between companies, but the price will always be about the same.  You don't feel like you are getting ripped off since everything is in the same price range.  The other reality is that most of these optometrists are doubling the cost on top of your already high prices.  They get away with this because they know you have some insurance to cover part of the price.  For example, I recently bought a set of frames from Simon Eye for $300 minus $120 from my insurance.  When I got home, I found the identical frames on Amazon for $180.  I wish some brave lawyers would go after these guys with an antitrust suit that would stick.</p></div>		</li>
