			<div class="markdown"><p>Kidneystones are primarily caused by dehydration, not drinking enough water. If you're not drinking enough then the salt in your urine can crystalize and form the foundation for kidneystones. Drink when you're thirsty and a little bit more than that and you're fine.</p>
<p>Severe hypercalcemia (ie, having too much calcium in your blood) can also cause kidneystones, but that's genererally caused by a cancer or a disease causing body imbalances...and rarely due to Vitamin D toxicity (getting too much vitamin D. A very very rare thing in todays society. Generally only if you're overdosing on Vitamin D supplements. The normal population tends to be Vitamin D defincient).</p></div>		</li>
