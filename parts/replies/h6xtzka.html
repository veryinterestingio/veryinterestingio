			<div class="markdown"><p>It would also depend on the shape of the water hitting the ground. If there's a big flat spot like a raindrop, it's just like hitting water normally except with water on top of you too. If the water has broken up during the fall, there might be enough bubbles to be crushed before you are. In any case, being on the top of the water would be best, every centimeter of water above you is another 10 Kg of water trying to crush you when you land.</p></div>		</li>
