			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's a common misconception that needs to be addressed here- something that makes a lot of people believe that vaccines can cause mutations in viruses. Since antibiotics can cause resistant bacteria to evolve over time, it's easy to think that something similar can occur with viruses and vaccines. However, this is a fallacy. Unlike antibiotics, vaccines don't create selective pressure for resistant strains of a virus. At least no more-so than naturally acquired immunity does. </p>
<p>This requires some explanation. Bacteria are living organisms that reproduce on their own. Bacteria that can cause infection in humans can also exist and grow in any suitable environment. Antibiotics are chemicals which can kill certain species of bacteria but which are not harmful to human cells. As enough bacteria are exposed to an antibiotic, occasionally one might have a mutation which gives them a resistance to it, and this resistance allows that bacterium to outcompete their sisters which do not have that gene, and eventually become dominant, thus making an antibiotic less useful over time. </p>
<p>On the other hand, viruses are not living cells. They cannot reproduce on their own. Instead, they reproduce by attaching themselves to another cell and injecting genetic material into it. This material hijacks the cell's protein and RNA or DNA making machinery and turns it into a &quot;virus factory&quot;, and preventing it from doing its normal job. The cell then releases the viruses into the host's body and then viruses can infect other cells. In the human body, your immune system identifies infected cells and kills them. It also creates antibodies which can bind to virus particles and destroy them. But it takes time for your immune system to &quot;learn&quot; how to make the proper antibodies for a given strain of virus. During this time, many cells become infected, creating more viruses and damaging tissue. And as viruses are created, occasionally your cell's machinery leaves a transcription error, or &quot;mutation&quot;, which can change the way the virus attacks the body. Usually the mutations are irrelevant or cause the virus to be unable to infect a cell. However, very rarely a mutation can cause a virus to be able to do something very different than previously possible- like infect new types of cells or even jump species. Or, in some cases, to evade antibodies which were effective against prior strains of the virus. </p>
<p>A vaccine gives your body a chance to recognize proteins in a certain virus and make antibodies without actually infecting you with the virus. This way, if you actually are exposed to the virus, you will fight it off without it having as many chances to reproduce. Fewer reproduction events means fewer chances to create a mutation which will evade the vaccine. Vaccine derived immunity is very similar to &quot;natural&quot; immunity. It's not doing anything to the viruses that your immune system wouldn't have done anyway, but gives it fewer chances to mutate.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to highlight the fact that vaccines kill viruses in the exact same way as your immune system already does, so there's nothing special for them to develop resistance to versus natural immunity. Antibiotics are a completely separate mechanism. You can kill a petri dish full of streptococcus with some penicillin, and the bacteria can also evolve resistance in said petri dish. If you take a vaccine and mix it with a vial of virus particles, it will have no effect on it. In fact, some types of vaccines are designed to PRESERVE virus particles so that they can be put in your body without being destroyed.</p>
<p>Edit: Please don't treat this post as authoritative in any way. I am not a virologist, and this explanation is based on mostly general knowledge, and may have errors. This comment was inspired by a now deleted comment that suggested that the existence of vaccine-derived variants is propaganda and misinformation. I was trying to point out a logical fallacy explaining why antibiotics are not analogous to vaccines at all. I didn't expect to get so much attention, and some of the responses correctly pointed out that vaccines actually can and do create selective pressure on viruses in certain circumstances. However, for various reasons, from a public health perspective, it's better for everyone to get vaccinated while it's better to limit antibiotic usage as much as possible. There has been a lot of great discussion generated from this post, including from actual virologists who you should all take with more confidence than what I've said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer. One quibble: using the term 'attaching themselves'.
I think it is better to say that  the virus 'becomes attached'. </p>
<p>I know this is a nuance, but I read variations of 'attaching themselves' a lot and it gives the impression that a virus is acting in some deliberate manner as though it was self-directed. It isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just natural and easier for us to use language like that sometimes. Like I understand how natural selection gives an <em>illusion</em> of intelligence but its much easier to just use common language and assume everyone knows the virus isn't consciously scheming with the brain it doesn't have. </p>
<p>I mean we all remember from high school biology (well OK most of us remember) that natural selection can produce something as complicated as the human body simply through random mistakes that occasionally do something advantageous. It's kind of like giving a complicated math problem to a random number generator. Given enough time (like hundreds of millions of years) and enough wrong answers (which we don't see because they die) it'll get the right answer. Time + death (naturally weeding out mistakes or even inferior solutions) + chaos = order. Death and chaos are what allow life and order.</p>
<p>Our brains and language just make it easier to sort of anthropomorphise them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An adverse environmental condition is going to place selective pressure on an organism whether it is a bacterium or virus. There is no discrimination.  The more organisms exposed to the negative stimulus (antibiotics/antibodies), the greater the number of random mutations and the better the chance of selection of resistance. </p>
<p>Following from this, vaccination would decrease the risk of development of resistance compared to infection in an immunologically naive person as the immune system is primed following vaccination. Infection would result in very low numbers of replicating viruses and proportionally low numbers of random mutations and hence reduced chance of an advantageos mutation being selected. A naieve individulal would have many more viruses undergoing many more replicative generations before naturally acquired immunity controls the infection.</p>
<p>The other factor to consider, that I've not seen mentioned, is the importance of the epitope in the viral protein to which the antibody attaches, and its importance to the viral protein's function.  If an antibody targets the functional portion of the viral protein then it is likely to remain effective as mutation occurring in this region would result in protein inactivation which would be deadly to the virus and not selected.  On the other hand, in other regions of the viral protein where amino acid sequence is not so constrained, some mutations are allowable with preservation of function.  If the vaccine is targeting this region, then there is a chance of resistant strains developing.</p>
<p>The best vaccines will target these non-varying regions of the viral protein and provoke an immune response to any varients that arise. However, the part of the target protein that the body is able to mount an immune response to is not necessarily theoretically the best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's much simpler than this. Vaccines and antibiotics/antivirals select mutations in exactly the same way, and with exactly the same frequency. </p>
<p><em>This does not mean what the Dunning-Krugerites of Reddit think it means.</em></p>
<p>The key point is that vaccines target many different sites. The COVID spike protein, for example, has well over a dozen distinct antigenic sites where antibodies bind (<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247\(21\)00506-4" target="_blank">Epitope profiling reveals binding signatures of SARS-CoV-2 immune response in natural infection and cross-reactivity with endemic human CoVs</a> identified 17). </p>
<p>That means that vaccine escape mutations need to mutate multiple different sites simultaneously. Each simultaneous mutation is exponentially less likely. </p>
<p>Here's why this is like antivirals. Look at HIV antivirals. In the early days of HIV treatment, people were treated with a single antiviral, and the virus escaped from it very rapidly, because it only needed a single mutation to do so. Today, people are treated with a combination of multiple antivirals (HAART), and this works for a lifetime -- the virus cannot simultaneously find an escape for all the antivirals at once.</p>
<p>It's just the same with COVID. Treatment with a single monoclonal antibody is a short-term solution, and the virus is very likely to find an escape from it, because it will only need a single mutation. Escape from a combination of several monoclonals is much harder. And vaccine responses are polyclonal, broadly targeting many different sites, and to escape the virus will need to mutate all at once. </p>
<p>That doesn't mean that escape is impossible. But it's improbable. It needs a huge number of viruses for one to find the solution. That's why vaccination is protective - reducing the total number of viruses reduces the chance of stumbling on this highly improbable solution. </p>
<p>(That's especially true since the COVID vaccines are by and large sterilizing, blocking both infection and transmission, in spite of the new anti-vax push claiming that's not true.)</p></div>		</li>
