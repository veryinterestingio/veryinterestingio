			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, black holes can in principle be used as mass conversion generators. They emit hard radiation (like gamma) so you need a way to absorb that and turn it into electricity. You also need a way to force new matter into the black hole faster than it can radiate, which is harder than you'd think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I never understood why people pretend this is unique to nuclear power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with matter/antimatter annihilation is, where do you get antimatter to collide with normal matter? If you had a black hole, you could always feed it any mass, and we have plenty of that available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say...even something that small wouldnâ€™t be a stable black hole, as there isnâ€™t enough matter/gravity to overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure.  That did get me thinking though...what could be the smallest stable black hole size/diameter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order for it to gain mass though, it would have to have an immense amount of gravity, and to do that it would...well...whereâ€™d the initial mass come from?</p>
<p>I guess thatâ€™s where the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit comes into play. </p>
<p>Anything smaller couldnâ€™t collapse into a black hole because of neutron degeneracy pressure. Could it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A black hole small enough to dissipate nearly instantly, yes.  Above that point it'd just be radiating a lot of energy, at an increasing rate, until the point the remainder went up at once.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank">the wikipedia article on the subject,</a> a black hole small enough to dissipate within one second could mass as much as 225 tons and produce 5 million megatons of energy in the form of radiation.</p></div>		</li>
