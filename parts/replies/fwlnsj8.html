			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I could tell you without a picture/more detailed description! The folks at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/" target="_blank">r/whatsthisbug/</a> might be of more help here. If you can get close enough to see whether the bugs have two wings or four wings, though, that's a pretty good way to tell flies (two wings) apart from bees (four wings).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it's still edible for humans! I've personally never tried it, but I'd imagine it's similar in multiple ways to &quot;regular&quot; honey (i.e. ripened, concentrated nectar). It tends to be thinner in consistency than the stuff produced by honey bees, though, and some keepers report that it's lighter in color as well.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0102695X16301843" target="_blank">this scientific paper</a>, both &quot;regular&quot; honey and stingless bee honey &quot;contain unique and distinct types of phenolic and flavonoid compounds of variable biological and clinical importance.&quot; There's also some evidence that stingless bee honey is more nutritious. I haven't dug deep enough to provide an extensive list of sources, but IMO it's pretty cool stuff!</p></div>		</li>
