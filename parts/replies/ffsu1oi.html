			<div class="markdown"><p>$4000? A little dishwasher for small plates and glasses at the bar might cost that. </p>
<p>The big ones that are part of a dishwasher line (stray station, washer, cooling station) cost $10k for the machine and probably $5k for installation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I install them. Install costs very greatly, but you are right in that some washers cost insane amounts. The $4k was representing an average cost smaller washer. Larger ones blow out considerably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is getting a higher price domestic dishwasher just buys stylish design and a bunch of electronics and extra moving parts that always break.  It would be nice if the higher prices actually bought quality and durability.  Same thing especially with washers and dryers.  My next washer is probably gonna be a cheap laundromat washer if I can find one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh that’s interesting and makes total sense. Honestly.
Most places I’ve worked buy their own, but commercial kitchens aren’t a big part of my job, so I’m probably seeing the minority.</p></div>		</li>
