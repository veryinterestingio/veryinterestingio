			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Itâ€™s also worth noting that co2 is regulated by surface to air interaction/agitation and therefore in rivers and lakes etc. the water is better regulated by this. In aquariums it can be beneficial to have something to break/agitate the surface area as well as having a large surface area in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
