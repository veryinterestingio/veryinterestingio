			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>A:</strong> The answer is yes and yes! Communication between traditional computers can be enhanced using quantum key distribution to be more secure. You’re right, intercepting a message will be immediately detected since any quantum measurement perturb the quantum state. In this case the quantum states are photon states (polarization or time-bin for example). This technology is already somewhat mature and available commercially. </p>
<p>But in the lab, we are trying especially to develop communication between (very very small) quantum computers. This is much more challenging because this requires not online entanglement between photons, but also entanglement between a photon and a state of matter, such as the spin of a particle. I believe that communication between quantum computers is the most important feature of quantum communication, since in some way multiple small quantum computers could be equivalent to a single large quantum computer then.</p>
<p>We are interested in both satellite and ground based communication, with an emphasis on ground based communication using commercial telecom fiber optics to reuse the existing classical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Thanks for participating and for being interested in the future! (Gary)</p></div>		</li>

If it’s possible to build a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/i0k2cp/askscience_ama_series_we_are_building_the/fzrhd1t/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf" target="_blank">quantum repeater</a>, why couldn’t the repeater know what it’s transmitting?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify: you are <em>not</em> attempting to build what science fiction would have most people thinking of as &quot;quantum communications&quot;, that is using entangled quantum particles to <strong>instantly</strong> communicate no matter the distance? Because while I'm not physicist, my understanding is that that doesn't actually <em>work</em>, as while the entangled quantum particle changes state instantly, it's impossible for the sender to determine what state their quantum particle (and thereby the receiver's quantum particle) collapses into, essentially scrambling the message. The information about how the sender's quantum particle behaved needs to be sent to the receiver (by conventional means) to unscramble it.</p>
<p>What it sounds like is that you're actually trying to take advantage of that &quot;quantum scrambling&quot; to create a more secure communications system?</p></div>		</li>
