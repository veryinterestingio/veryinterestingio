<p>The short version of the long story below is yes, they can get aggressive, however, 9/10 that’s our fault for not doing our job appropriately. </p>
<p>The idea that their anger because we’ve taken their high away is a misnomer. Overdose patient tend to be combative for a couple of reasons, all of which can be easily mitigated through the practice of proper medicine. For starters, they’ve just woken up in a strange place surrounded by strange people. This is understandably frightening and very confusing for the patient. On top of this, there’s some physiology at play depending on how well the patient has been reoxygenated. When these patient overdose, they often quit breathing or breath far to slow. As a result, the oxygen levels in their blood drop to dangerously low levels (hypoxia), which will eventually kill them if not corrected. When the brain does not have enough oxygen, it tends to manifest as delirious and aggressive behavior, which is likely how they would be acting if it weren’t for the potent CNS depressant effects of the opiates they’ve overdosed on.  I say all that to say, if a patient is given naloxone prior to being adequately re-oxygenated via a BVM with supplemental oxygen, then they will awake in a hypoxic state and become aggressive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypercapnea (increased CO2 levels) is also very common with hypoventilation, and has very deleterious effects on cognition independent of hypoxemia. Although I can't comment on which of these is more important in opioid overdose, I'd assume that both are a factor in the delirium we see when Naloxone is administered for hypoventilation. That's probably why just providing more oxygen for these patients doesn't help as much as Naloxone does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. It can throw an addict into a physiological withdrawal instantly and those pts can become very combative. It can also induce a nauseated state for the pt to so alot of times protocols usually only let you give enough to increase respiratory drive rather than make them fully alert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not that they are no longer high, it’s that they are thrown into precipitated withdrawal since they are addicted, which is usually described as far worse than the peak of normal withdrawal even.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks, that's really what I was wondering.  I now wonder how often people administer naloxone, then worry that it isn't working when the patient doesn't immediately sit up.  Certainly, prior to asking this question, <em>I</em> would have expected a virtually immediate response, and might not have known that rescue breathing was the next thing I should do, or that I might have to do it for several minutes.  (Although I guess if you go through the checklist: is patient breathing?  If no, start rescue breathing... you'd be doing that even if you didn't expect it to help.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It happens quite often. I’ve seen as much as 12 mg, which would be equivalent to three of the single-use OTC sprays, administered to a patient by law enforcement. </p>
<p>EDIT: funny enough, no more than an hour after posting this, I responded to an overdose where law enforcement gave a total of 8 mg of intranasal naloxone within a period of 60 seconds because they didn’t think it was working. The patient awoke shortly after my arrival without any further intervention and was in complete withdrawal due to the excessive dose. </p>
<p>For healthcare providers, ventilating the patient via a BVM  with supplemental oxygen would be the very first step when dealing with an overdose who’s respiratory drive is compromised, because once you’ve done that, you’ve effectively stabilized the patient. Giving naloxone is much further down the list. However, ventilating a patient, whether via a BVM or pocket mask, is a perishable skill - one that is often performed incorrectly, even by healthcare professionals. Not to mention that laypeople aren’t going it carry a BVM and are likely to be hesitant to put their mouth so close to the mouth of a drug user, even with a barrier device. So, rather than attempt to teach laypeople to perform rescue breaths, which would have likely yielded poor results, we opted to teach them to administer naloxone. There are of course risks that come along with the high doses that are provided, but I imagine that this was a calculated decision where the relatively low risk of adverse side effects was preferable to the likelihood that laypeople would have done nothing at all.</p></div>		</li>
