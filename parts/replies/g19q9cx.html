			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah QAM is sweet and still pretty easy to visualize with <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/QAM16_Demonstration.gif" target="_blank">this gif on Wikipedia</a> and therefore generally understand.  But then you get into some standards like DOCSIS 3.1 or now even 4.0 for stuff like cable modems and it supports 4096 QAM, which to me is just impressive your SNR is that good to be able to handle it even on coax let alone what some wireless setups can handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is great and I have taken similar courses before but they didn't really explain how a signal is transmitted either over the air or over the wire.  It is one of the areas where I was seriously confused even though I had a master's degree in signal processing.</p>
<p>Gave you an updoot.</p></div>		</li>
