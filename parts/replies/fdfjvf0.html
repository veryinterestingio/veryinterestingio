			<div class="markdown"><p>The ('shorter') length of antibiotic courses in the first article have been used as standard in the UK for years, I wouldn't advise taking less than that without a doctor's advice. There are almost certainly times when people would be fine with a shorter course (or didn't need antibiotics in the first place) but you really need a doctor to tell you when its ok to do this as some infections do need the longer courses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting and important that this is now being applied to human health. </p>
<p>It's common practice in veterinary medicine to only administer antibiotics until symptoms are gone for the reason you described. </p>
<p>In most Western countries it is still suggested by healthcare providers to take them to completion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>studies show that for community-acquired pneumonia, 5 days are as good as 7 to 10; for pyelonephritis, 7 days are as good as 10 to 14; and for cellulitis, 5 days are as good as 10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If pneumonia takes 5days to get into the state where the antibiotic can kill it, then taking it longer is indeed not very usefull and could help the selection /and reproduction) of only the strongest ones.. But isn't this common knowledge? The big problem here is, that a doc does not identify every bacteria before he gives antibiotics. So giving it for 5 days, but the bacteria is pyelonephritis (which needs 7 days) would be a problem. Therefore we go for the save route and give it for 10days. </p>
<p>All this linked studies so far have the problem that they compare the prescribed time, which is indeed often too high. </p>
<p>Interesting would be, what if you stop antibiotics after 3days on a pneumonia infection (which would need 5days). The problem here - at least from my level of knowledge is, that the remaining bacteria can repopulate. So you need to take antibiotics for at least 5 days to kill enough so they can not repopulate anymore. If we take it longer, we make sure to kill enough, even if it's another bacteria that would require 8days, if we take it for 10days, it will cover that too.</p></div>		</li>
