			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This is why modern building construction techniques place A LOT of attention on not just adding insulation, but also doing the air sealing work to make sure infiltration isn't happening. Your home can be extremely well insulated, but if air is leaking out (or in...) it's providing a vehicle to bypass that insulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're actually making them too air tight now with spray foam insulation that we need to add outside air into the system mechanically in residential construction. It's been a requirement in commercial construction for outside air requirements but in residential windows were considered the OA. Now in many circumstances when a new home is well insulated and in a cold environment where windows aren't being opened often were not seeing enough 'leakage' so we need to <a href="https://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/article/spray-foam-insulated-homes-need-ventilation" target="_blank">introduce outside air into the system.</a></p>
<p>Edit: that article is old, it's a requirement now, but only recently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually working on a OA project on my house right now, where I live it gets humid and my house in slightly negative (bathroom exhausts and return fan) which leads to me having to bleach the door casings and around the supply vents every year. I am going to add OA to the house to create positive pressure so I donâ€™t have the moisture infiltration.</p></div>		</li>
