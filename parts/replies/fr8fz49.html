			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a handful of technologies out there that can help reduce the rate of plastics into the ocean.  Here are some examples: </p>
<p>-I’m a fan of Mr. Trash Wheel (and all his relatives) in Maryland that scoop floating debris off the surface, it also uses river currents to power the system! <a href="https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/" target="_blank">https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/</a></a> </p>
<p>- SeaBin is a floating trash can that sucks in debris, often used in marinas and harbors: <a href="https://seabinproject.com/" target="_blank"><a href="https://seabinproject.com/" target="_blank">https://seabinproject.com/</a></a>  </p>
<p>- Autonomous robots can be used too! Here is trash shark, which patrols surface waters in rivers like a hungry hippo looking for debris to capture: <a href="https://www.ranmarine.io/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ranmarine.io/" target="_blank">https://www.ranmarine.io/</a></a> </p>
<p>- The folks at the Ocean Cleanup project have two different systems, one is the large floating boom that was deployed in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and the other is the recently launched Interceptor system which is very similar to Mr. Trash Wheel: <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/rivers/" target="_blank"><a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/rivers/" target="_blank">https://theoceancleanup.com/rivers/</a></a> </p>
<p>There are many more! Keep in mind that it is far easier and more cost effective to collect debris in coastal waterways BEFORE it enters the ocean. Obviously the most effective measure is to not let it get there in the first place. In regards to buisiness models, it’s tough to make such companies that collect ocean plastic a sustaining, cash-flow positive business, simply becuase plastic is cheap to make, so why bother using dirty recycled plastic (which in some cases actually costs more to buy than new plastic). If you can find a good use for ocean plastic there are lots of folks that would like to talk to you. One group to check out for interesting business models on plastic recycling is the Plastic Bank: <a href="https://plasticbank.com/" target="_blank"><a href="https://plasticbank.com/" target="_blank">https://plasticbank.com/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to respond! It just hit me when you mentioned everything is about business and making money. There's really no monetary incentives for people to collect plastics!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or rather what are ways in which we can stop plastics from getting into our waterways in the first place? Furthermore what business models are there around doing so, since it seems we ignore taking action on anything that is not profit oriented?</p></div>		</li>
