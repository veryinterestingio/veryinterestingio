<p>While OP specificies the caliber, they did say Ammo Size so i thought it was worth a mention</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When referring to ammo of common sizes (7.62 being a prime example), people that know what they are talking about always reference the cartridge size as well.  7.62x39 is standard AK ammo.  7.62x51 is just metric .308 ammo.  7.62x54R is the ammo used in Mosin Nagant and PKM rifles, as well as a few others.  7.62x25 is Tokarev pistol ammo.  </p>
<p>Just saying &quot;Seven six two&quot; ammo is nearly meaningless, since the type varies wildly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it's not just caliber, there are multiple names for the same cartridge (.308 Winchester is the same 7.62x51, .223 Remington is the same as 5.56 NATO, 9mm parabellum is the same as 9mm Luger is the same as 9x19mm), though there can be differences in powder and pressures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These are all technically different. IIRC correctly, it's safe to use 7.62x51mm in a .308Win gun, but not the other way around. And it's safe to use .223 Remington in a gun chambered for 5.56 NATO, but not the other way around. The fact that a cartridge *fits* doesn't make it *safe*.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you're using 7.62 in a .308, and you have cheap reload, the case might be just a little <em>too</em> long to fully enter the chamber, leaving you unable to lock the bolt on your kar98 (mine is a re-barrel). </p>
<p>Glad I could just remove the bolt for transport home from the range, and had a 1/4&quot; dowel rod on hand at home to push the defective round out, and had my 10/22 so I could still ring some steel and go bowling at 100 yards...</p>
<p>Yes Arizona is weird. We bowl with rifles across football fields...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the spec for .223Rem is not the same as 5.56 NATO.   you can fire a .223Rem round in a 5.56NATO gun.  but vise versa, a 5.56NATO round in a .223Rem gun could blow up.     the .223Rem is a lower pressure spec.  but identical in size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likewise that a 7.62 is just the diameter, it doesn't equate to powder and casing length. That's why the 7.62x39 is a very different cartridge than a 7.62x52R. The x52 has a lot more powder (and punch) behind it.</p>
<p>The many types come down to a couple arguments about velocity vs size of the bullet. A bigger bullet needs more powder to get the same velocity as a smaller bullet. This makes them usually bigger and heavier, meaning less shots in the same magazine or ammo can. You can also get into arguments about penetration / armor piercing, or hollow points and tumbling for bigger wounds and internal damage. Then you can also argue effective range and trajectories. In the end, different bullets exist for different purposes and situations. This is why most militaries include weapons with huge rounds like a .50 cal used in a sniper rifle, a .556 for the average assault rifle and a breaching shotgun for urban warfare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The different calibers are about range and power.</p>

<p>I saw a documentary of the development of a new military fire arm. In it they talked about how much impact, at what distance, the round had to have. Then back calculated the projectile mass and velocity. Then how big a powder charge needed. They wound up inventing a whole new caliber. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.408_Cheyenne_Tactical" target="_blank">.408 Cheyenne Tactical</a> That specific caliber was from the trade off calculations on the impact and flight needs.</p></div>		</li>
