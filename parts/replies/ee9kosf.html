			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense, I guess. But why a number so huge? 70281562 is in the 70 millions.....is this to ensure the number is unique? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A database needs a unique ID for each row, so each &quot;show&quot; would be stored as a row within a database table and that ID of the show is how the scripts would pull the information from the database, sometimes the ID's are generated manually e.g. via a ISBN or in most cases it's an automatic process (using the tools built into a database system) that will generate the next available ID. You could in theory make up a number and input it into the url and it will find a show. So 702891562 may seem random to you but it was possibly the next available number in the table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>might not be consecutive; like how ISBN can be broken down (ie some characters refer to the publisher, some to the territory etc) it's possible that there's some metadata in the ID, ie in 702891562,  &quot;7&quot; means TV show, &quot;02&quot; means &quot;Disney&quot; etc. It's more likely to be a uniquely generated ID or consecutive numbers though </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, the number has to be unique. Also you have to keep in mind that they probably have all the shows from all the different countries catalogs in the same database. There are far more shows existing I'm Netflix than what you have access to.</p></div>		</li>
