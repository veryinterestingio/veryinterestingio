			<div class="markdown"><p>I often worked late at my second job. I usually started about five and after eightish when the cleaners left I would be the only person on my floor until I left, usually after midnight. </p>
<p>There was one switch that controlled every light on the floor, except for the toilets and lobby. Usually 70+ people working there, so a lot of lights.</p>
<p>I asked my manager who was one of the partners for a desk lamp so I didn't have to waste electrity. He said don't worry about it. So I didn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a skyscraper in Boston, we had lights that would turn on automatically (motion detected) for maybe thirty minutes at a time, usually it would be about 1/4 of the floors lights for each sensor. If I got up from my desk to use the bathroom the entire floor would light up.</p></div>		</li>
