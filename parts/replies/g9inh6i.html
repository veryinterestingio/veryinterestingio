			<div class="markdown"><p>There's more to it than that though. People who make under $200k are very rarely audited bc the potential revenue to recoup is relatively low. But I imagine the massive headache of dealing w a team of tax lawyers and following money across various tax havens like Panama, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, even Delaware also factors in. The IRS is very much resource-limited and they go after low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>Tax havens are a big answer to OPs question too, the tax lawyers know how to route money to the right areas and obscure that to the IRS. When you have enough resources that becomes worth it for you to hire them to do.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/19/925501102/the-wealthy-getting-less-scrutiny-on-taxes" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/19/925501102/the-wealthy-getting-less-scrutiny-on-taxes" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/2020/10/19/925501102/the-wealthy-getting-less-scrutiny-on-taxes</a></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A decade ago, nearly 1 in 4 of those ultrarich taxpayers was audited. By 2017, that rate had dropped to 1 in 38.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The IRS is particularly aggressive about auditing people who claim the earned income tax credit. While that tax break for working families has been plagued by reporting problems, the IRS says it accounts for just 6% of all unpaid taxes. Nevertheless, people claiming the credit were more than 10 times as likely to be audited last year as multimillionaires.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>7 dependants is probably an automatic red flag.  I'd guess less than 1% of returns have this many and it would be the first thing a uneducated tax cheat would go for, wouldn't you think?  So it's not surprising they would pay close attention to that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does takes more time and effort to audit a rich person but the payout if they find wrongdoings is much much higher. Also since their tax returns are much more complicated to do properly since they tend to make complicated investments there is also a bigger risk of them making mistakes.</p>
<p>Controls of average workers are easier sure but mostly don't bring in much either and are therefore a waste of time because you have a lot of legal procedure to audit someone which takes some time and effort and which is the same whether it's a high income person or an average Joe. The average Joe's tax revenue is also mostly filled out automatically by the administration with the known informations communicated by employers and so they mostly just need to check that there is nothing wrong, maybe add a couple of things that are missing and sign it, this leaves a much smaller room for errors. </p>
<p>They do control average worker but it's mainly so there is no feeling of impunity, most of the time the payout is mediocre at best and they generally target files with red flags on them (tons of deductibles relative to your income for example).</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the US corporations like Turbo Tax have lobbied hard to keep the US from doing something like that as it would heavily eat into their profits.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Rich people can afford to have more assets and investments, and also, critically, can afford to pay someone to manage their taxes, write offs, and investments by navigating the complicated tax code.</p></div>		</li>
