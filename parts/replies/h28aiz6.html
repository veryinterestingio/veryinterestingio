			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent my teenage years in a “whiplash” style choir. What we often did to practice diaphragm activation was to lay down flat on your back and place a book on your stomach. The aim was to displace the book higher from its resting state as you breathed in “pushing the air down to your stomach.” I thought it was all useless to till we heard the difference in clarity in our voices. There’s a clip of Harry Styles belting notes and on his back.
The biggest difference being your mind muscle connection to your breath. Once your master your diaphragm it expands the length of your phrasing, gives you the ability to let out just enough air to hit different timbres of your voice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you ever laughed <em>hard</em> until your sides hurt? That laugh comes from your gut.</p>
<p>You can get a lot of power by properly using the air in your lungs. Singing isn't just knowing how to shape notes with your vocal chords, it's knowing how to use your full instrument and put the right amount of force and air into each note.</p></div>		</li>
