			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory... maybe? But a) bone marrow transplantation is not a trivial procedure to undergo, and b) there are tons of other factors here not directly linked to it (cytokine and chemokine production in various tissues, lymph node and spleen composition and status, tissue resident cells...).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if it were an autotransplantation (autologous) from your younger self, maybe.</p>
<p>But in general, grafts are generally a procedure used as a last resort. Why? </p>
<p>Because of a significant risk of developping Graft-versus-host disease (look up the major histocompatibility complexes to learn more). You basically destroy the original bone marrow to replace it with a new one which might start attacking its new host (which is now defenseless because of chemiotherapy). </p>
<p>IMO, a transplant isn't the right solution to &quot;boost&quot; your immune system with the actual technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ridiculous thing is; There's been a study that demonstrates, it's the dilution of old plasma with new proteins (saline and albumin solution) that not only rejuvenated the test mice but did so better than &quot;young blood&quot;. So Thiel is basically being a rich nutcase if that's true. </p>
<p>Heres an <a href="https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/news/amp/diluting-blood-plasma-reverses-aging-and-rejuvenates-tissue-336135" target="_blank">article</a> about it, and I'm pretty sure that the study was shared in r/science last month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't really explain it, though. Why is it that your white blood cells (T cells are white blood cells as well) can't function at the same efficiency?</p>
<p>One theory I read about is that the number of white blood cells in your body remains constant throughout your life. Some of the white blood cells are memory cells, which are specialized to produce specific antibodies. Now, as you age and are exposed to various antigens, you keep building up memory cells. Since the total number of white blood cells is constant, this leaves fewer and fewer naive B cells and T cells to develop new antibodies.</p>
<p>Another theory I heard is that as we age, old cells that should die but do not (called senescent cells), visceral fat cells, and white blood cells that develop antibodies against self but do not get weeded out by the usual processes keep pumping out low-grade inflammation signals. This keeps the immune system fighting the low grade inflammation, reducing its efficiency.</p>
<p>Not sure how true either of these are, but it's something to consider.</p></div>		</li>
