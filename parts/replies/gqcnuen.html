			<div class="markdown"><p>Two way-different processes.</p>
<p>Dyeing fabric involves using chemicals on it and having those chemicals &quot;stick&quot;, ideally, instead of washing out the next time you wash it. So some chemical reaction or other is usually involved. The new chemicals absorb their own set of wavelengths, leaving a different set of wavelengths reflected, almost always a smaller set.</p>
<p>(Reflected-color works subtractively; the more wavelengths that get absorbed, the less is left to reflect. So when you mix paints they get darker, browner, and finally end up pretty black.</p>
<p>Combining light from glowing beams or pixels works additively; more wavelengths glowing means more in the final product. Mix enough colors of light together and you end up lighter and lighter, and then at white.)</p>
<p>The titanium thing is different; it's a metal, so doesn't have the same kind of atomic bonds that molecules do. Instead, its atoms pretty much share their valence electrons over the whole piece of metal, in a &quot;sea&quot; that fills up to a particular energy level. And sometimes in &quot;bands&quot; of energy levels with gaps between them.</p>
<p>(This is why metals are conductive, basically; they've already got free-roaming electrons all through them, not bound to single atoms or molecules.)</p>
<p>When you apply that voltage, it'll interact with the sea, or the bands, of electrons, and apparently in this case will move the top or the edges enough to change what wavelengths do or don't interact with those electrons and get absorbed ... changing the color. (Most metals don't really do this, so it must be a particular feature of titanium's sea or bands.)</p>
<p>--Dave, and anything that's got a temperature is also emitting light; infrared, scaling to visible as it gets hotter, and on up through ultraviolet if hot enough, at which point it just looks blue-white to us. The radiative spectrum is continuous, not just discrete colors from different electron transitions. You see it in, for instance, the Sun, or a fire, or old incandescent bulbs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Ti thing is actually a result of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_interference" target="_blank">thin film interference</a> within the oxide layer, which can be grown by putting a current through the metal and into an acid. What you're describing is more like a solar panel.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration" target="_blank">The phenomenon is more broadly called structural color</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nice explanation. </p>
<p>&quot;The radiative spectrum is continuous&quot; you mean from our perception right?<br />
udont want another UV catastrophe</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dye fabrics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing to add that there are lots of different ways for this to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many clothing dyes are absorbed into the fibers/materials.  I have heard that &quot;exhaust dying&quot; is one example of this approach, but I'm not expert on that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other dyes stay primarily on the surface of the fibers instead of being absorbed.  Indigo is an example and this surface-deposition is responsible for the unique fades on blue jeans.</p>
</li>
<li>Bleaching (not technically a dye, but similar idea of changing a fabric color) works by releasing oxygen in a way that breaks up the chemical bonds on many things which are strongly colored.  By breaking down the color molecules on something, they can change its color, often to white or near-white.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks to quantum mechanics, particles can't have just any energy...it's quantized: there are discrete amounts of energy a particle like a photon or electron can have. With photons it only depends on their wavelength (shorter wavelength = more energy). With electrons there are multiple energy &quot;bands&quot; they can be in, but there's a finite number of bands. If the amount of energy in the photon matches the difference between the current energy of the electron and one of the higher energy bands, the electron can absorb that photon and jump up to the higher energy band.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>think of electron energy levels of any particular material only coming in say chunks of $5 or $1 each etc, whereas light can vary more smoothly at cent by cent increments .. and since energy can't be destroyed, and electron energy levels cant easily give out change, they only perform an energy transaction if a lightwave with the exact same amount in energy becomes available</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy required for an electron excitation (an electron hopping from a lower energy orbit to a higher one) has to match the energy (basically wavelength i.e. colour) of the photon, for the photon (and thus also the respective colour) to get absorbed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not going to be adamant about this, but aren't most electronic excitations in the uv+ region?</p>
<p>Visible light usually contributes to vibrational excitations, which can be explained as the atoms in the material being &quot;kicked&quot; by light so that it vibrates faster, but only the correct wavelengths of light are allowed to &quot;kick&quot; a given material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand, the ability to kick it relates to the allowable energies in the inter atomic bonds...it’s still quantized energies, just not necessarily electrons jumping shells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is still quantised. But there is a difference in wether the excitation is electronic, vibrational or rotational. I seemed to remember that visible light primarily contributes to vibrational excitations but on thinking about it I remember that the colours of d-metal complexes are due to the special energy spacing of the eg/t2g orbitals, so I guess it makes sense that electronic excitations contribute to the colours we see :)</p></div>		</li>
