			<div class="markdown"><p>worth adding- this was also the time when the catholic church had way to much power and killing cats (because they were tools of witches) made the problem worse as cats kill rats which were a major spreader, combined with...well it isn't as if just recently the church decided that science is a bad thing, but back then they did far worse than whine on social media.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overall the catholic church tried to oppose superstition. That included the belief in witchcraft.</p>
<p>Yes, there were individual popes that believed in witchcraft (for example Innocent VIII.*) but witchtrials were a much later thing (a full century after the great black plague) and mostly a protestant thing (since the various inquisitions had a much higher standard when it came to trials and evidence. For example any confession extracted under torture was inadmissable as evidence).</p>
<p>*Innocent VIII was also a compromise pope where the election politics were vicious and devisive, so everyone basically agreed to elect a pope that wasn't a political threat (ie, not very bright). The 15th century was also the most corrupt century in church politics, with for example Callixtus III, pope 1455-1458 and Alexander VI, pope 1492-1503. You might recognize them more easily by their pre-papal names. Alfonso and Rodrigo Borgia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you are saying, but isn't it kind of silly for an institution that is founded on superstition to be credited for opposing superstition?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But....it was basically still cool to torture people? Like you get tortured, but then you can’t be found guilty if you say anything to make it stop....that seems fair and balanced. Or wait, I guess they could’ve also tried leaving people alone INSTEAD of torturing them. Nah, that’s crazy right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As had already been pointed out, the medieval world was much more chill about witchcraft than popular imagining. That stuff all happened during the Renaissance.</p>
<p>The point <em>I</em> want to make is: This has to be a creation of the modern imagination. There can't have been a Europe-wide shortage of rodent control, because rodent control was very important. Cats weren't pets; they were working animals. This is one of those things like birth control in the modern world—people would have just not listened and kept cats anyway, <em>because that grain in the granery is for</em> <strong>us</strong> <em>not the</em> <strong>rodents!</strong> Even if cats fell out of favor somewhere, they would have been replaced by ferrets or terriers or something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not gonna argue with you about the church making things worse but that rats were a major spreader for the plague is a myth. It was all humans and their own parasites that spread it. </p>
