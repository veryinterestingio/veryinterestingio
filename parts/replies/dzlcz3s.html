			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that the reason the night sky isn't flooded with light, is because the majority of stars is beyond red shifted and moving away from us faster than the speed of light due to the expansion of the universe. I don't think empty space has enough natter in it to absorb light enough to cause this effect. </p></div>		</li>
