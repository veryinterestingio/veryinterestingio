<p>The bicycle drawing test proves this. Most people think they know what a bicycle looks like but could not even draw a basic ugly one that would work no matter their drawing skill level without a reference. I can't remember where I saw this test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought I could draw a bicycle from memory because &quot;I am an artist&quot;. Many years later I can draw a good bike from memory because I have studied them and practiced. I am not good drawing ears. I think I am getting better because I study them.</p></div>		</li>
