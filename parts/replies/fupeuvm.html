			<div class="markdown"><p>However, A. flavus is a disease for the maize but can't infect a human; what's harming is their metabolite which must be produced within the plant before consumption. So, technically this doesn't check ü§î imho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you misread my comment - I specifically point out that we mostly care about it due to mycotoxin production, but that it can <em>also</em> opportunistically infect humans. <em>A. fumigatus</em> is the most common cause of Aspergillosis, but <em>A. flavus</em> can colonize lung tissue as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for aflatoxin, or aspergillosis, which are both produced by fungi, not bacteria, so antibiotics would not be the correct treatment.  An antifungal would be called for in this situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like u/Gibberella mentioned, it can infect immunocompromised people or people previously infected with tuberculosis. It can grow these funky <a href="http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Radio/curriculum/Harrisons/Pulmonary/Aspergilloma2.jpg" target="_blank">fungus balls</a> in the lungs (and sometimes even in the brain)! They can look kind of like a tumor on imaging, so they are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergilloma" target="_blank">aspergillomas</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, the question was about diseases jumping from plants to humans.  Fungi are not plants or humans.  I suppose you could argue that someone with aspergillosis could have gotten the fungus from a plant, therefore a fungus jumped from a plant to a human.  But that's not really anything new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am confused - do you not consider Aspergillosis a disease? A. flavus is a pathogen that causes disease in both a number of common crops as well as humans. A human with compromised immunity who encounters infected plant tissue in the field (or in a lab setting perhaps) would become infected by the pathogen directly from the previous plant host. And I don‚Äôt understand what you mean by something new? I am (1) describing a somewhat uncommon phenomenon, since mammals are famously resistant to most fungal pathogens, and (2) something that occurs in nature, so I don‚Äôt see how I could describe something ‚Äúnew‚Äù here.</p></div>		</li>
