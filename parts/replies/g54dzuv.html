			<div class="markdown"><p>To be a little more in depth: After the 16-cell stage, the morula begins to differentiate into the inner cell mass and trophoblast cells. After a few more divisions, the totipotent cells differentiate into the three germ layers. </p>
<ul>
<li>Endoderm (inner layer) - forms the digestive tube (pancreas/liver) and respiratory tube </li>
<li>Mesoderm (middle layer) - bone marrow, skeletal/smooth/cardiac muscle, heart and blood vessels</li>
<li>Ectoderm (outer layer) - skin, nervous system (neurons, brain), eyes, ears.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adults have stem cells too, cells that give rise to skin, blood, and epithelial cells, but are very limited in comparison to the early embryonic stages.</p></div>		</li>
