			<div class="markdown"><p>This. It is just guesswork and that's shown in the data. That's why people (including Warren Buffett, possibly the best known trader ever) recommend you buy an index fund and hold it until you are pulling the money out of the market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not just guesswork. Buffett recommends that the average individual buys index funds, not that it is impossible to beat the market beyond just being lucky. The point being that it is extremely difficult to beat the market when you have another day job, family, etc., and no access to the type of information and data that institutional investors have. The story about fund managers not being able to beat the SP 500 is generally true, but people on reddit like to take this to mean that the entire finance industry is inherently stupid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Define &quot;beat the market&quot; 1 time or every time? A few years ago when several states were cracking down on daily fantasy sports as gambling, they argued it was a skill contest not pure luck. They hired a firm to analyze performance over time to judge whether skill could impact outcome. They tested their model against 2 &quot;poles&quot; to see it it was accurate, chess which is essentially a pure game of skill and the stock market which is a pure game of luck. The difference between gambling and the stock market is that gambling skews to loss over time vs the stock market skews to gain over time. DFS fell in the middle of that scale depending on sport, NBA requiring the most skill to consistently win and NHL being mostly luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Data, analytics, machine trading, etc are all making it less necessary for there to be a lot of active traders. </p>
<p>Also, interestingly, it should end up in an equilibrium. Here's a thought experiment - if, everyone only indexed, then no one is actively trying to figure out how much a company is worth or will perform in the future. This opens an opportunity for active traders to take advantage of this imbalance. But as soon as you reach a critical mass of active traders all agreeing on the right price of each company, adding more makes no difference and it makes it cheaper and better to index again. It's a push-pull.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would imply that the entire global economy is a bubble about to irrevocably collapse. The entire point of an index fund is that you aren't betting on individual companies winning and losing. You're not even betting on particular industries (like aviation) which can be impacted by global events.</p>
<p>Your S&amp;P 500 fund is betting that out of 500 of the most successful American companies across all industries, most will continue to grow and be profitable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hedge fund I sell has averaged just shy of 15%/yr since 1999.  Net of 2 and 20.  The VC/PE fund we run has done close to 18% since the same time.  Net.  There is absolutely a place for active.  You just have to be a qualified purchaser to get in.  $5m+ investable.  </p>
<p>All the PMs on the fund have advanced degrees that would make your head spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking VC/PE you're talking about something different than what was asked and what I was addressing. Sure, when there's tens of millions to splash around and risk on one in twenty companies making it big you can get better returns. However the question was about investing in stocks which isn't remotely the same.</p></div>		</li>
