			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but they are harder to match to recipients. The more donor blood and organs you have exposure to, the more baggage your organs have. Makes it harder to match to recipients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is slightly incorrect, recipients who have received blood transfusions or donor organs (or have been pregnant) often mount antibody responses to specific HLA alleles which makes subsequent transplant to them harder. As for them being donor this shouldn’t theoretically make a difference (outside of ABO matching) but I can’t see any transplant unit wanting to use organs from a prior recipient, you usually have to be pretty healthy to be a donor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re slightly incorrect about HLA expression here, the donor organ retains its original HLA expression even when placed into a recipient. It’s why recipients will still mount a rejection response against it without immunosuppression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The kidney cells retain the HLA type from the donor, that doesn't change. </p>
<p>What changes is that cells from the immune system of the host will have settled in, which obviously have a different HLA than the organ does. </p>
<p>So, yes and no.</p></div>		</li>
