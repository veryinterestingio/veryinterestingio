			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but Jesus has an alright powerset for a superhero.</p>
<p>He can bring people back from the dead and his ability to turn water into wine and feed 5000 people suggest he’s got some sort of reality bending powers. Both of those would help a lot in a post snap universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, heroes like Batman and Superman go through completely relevant Jesus-like morality arcs (power/responsibility, refusal to proliferate circle of violence to the point of self-sacrifice, can't enforce change other than by example / from within, trying to redeem bad guys etc.), which is unsurprising for heroes of an essentially Christian culture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ability to rise from the dead a few days after being killed would definitely end up as a plot line in the movie.</p>
<p>Avenger Jesus would be killed off by the Big Bad and then forgotten about.  Big Bad would capture/seemingly defeat the other Avengers a few days later when out of no where Avenger Jesus would rise and be the wildcard that frees the others and is the Big Bad's downfall. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bifrost crashes down, but JC is fine - running across the water, he grabs a small fish from the air and approaching Hela, multiplies it into a mackerel machine gun.</p>
<p>Well, the Goddess of Death is surprised, as you would be, but it isn't a very effective attack. Luckily for JC, it was only a distraction, as a wave of leper troops pours around the corner to join the combat. </p></div>		</li>
