Basically oil can bend more light than water given the same amount of liquid. They also reflect differently if you are referring to the odd colors like purples and greens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would make sense considering fact that single pixel â¬œ of white background on this site actually consists of 3 narrower sub-pixels emitting all 3 basic colors ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¦ at equal rate. They're small enough for your eyes and brain to not see sub-pixels, but only combined result of their work. Now take a magnifying glass and look at some surface: it magnifies  area in the middle at cost of narrowing areas at edge of magnifying glass. Same happens here. A droplet will magnify one or two sub-pixels at some ratio, making you see color different than white.</p></div>		</li>
