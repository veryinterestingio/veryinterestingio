			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes. </p>
<p>If you discuss the deal privately and it's not recorded, you can always just say. </p>
<p>&quot;I was going to support that bill anyways&quot;</p>
<p>The actual deal is negotiated by someone who's willing to take the fall, and then you just throw them under the bus if you're caught, and pretend that you had no idea that a deal was being made, and you can still use the above excuse to dismiss it. </p>
<p>Then you can just pardon them. </p>
<p>It's seriously way too easy for people to do...</p></div>		</li>

<p>its like this: someone robs a bank, and the cops takes the suspect of that robbery into custody. Well, that's how it should work. But, in politics, the robbery suspect is not taken into custody because the robbery makes everyone a lot of money, including the people should be watchdogs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there's always a fall guy for it, sure, but the people who are benefitting from the deals generally walk away completely fine. </p>
<p>There's nothing to prevent a quid-pro-quo deal from being made in person, or through proxies who the real parties claim to be unaffiliated with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This politician is going to get me more money. I give them some money. Now I have more money. This other politician is going to get me even more money. I give them a lot of money. Now I have even more money. If I become the politician, I can give all the money to myself, then all the money will be mine and the galaxy will finally be at peace.</p></div>		</li>
