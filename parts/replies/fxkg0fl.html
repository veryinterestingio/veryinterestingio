			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this... The electrical inspectors in my area will make us rip out and redo any actual wiring we install before the structure is &quot;dried in&quot; by the roof/windows/doors/sheathing. So you add that wait time in before we can even start on the biggest chunk of our work. Plus the work plumbers and HVAC have to do, while we're all getting in each other's way and potentially squabbling. THEN we all have to pass inspection on that work before it can be covered up</p>
<p>...it's sometimes quite a while between framing and drywall.</p>
<p>In my experience, almost all moisture/mold problems on new structures has been due to faulty weatherproofing on the exterior.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The building I work in was torn down and completely rebuilt in 58 days, and set some sort of record for something. (Idk what, it was 10 years ago at this point)</p>

<p>I worked for a production builder in Denver and from trench to COE was literally 160 days or less. The last neighborhood I worked in was throwing up 3500sqft+ homes in a golf course community for $750k in the same amount of time....wonder why their product quality was in shitter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its so reckless, because it doesn't have to be that way. Its honestly just bad planning and incompetence.</p>
<p>Those cookie cutter house builder's sometimes just make really stupid moves entirely out of not giving a shit, not even as a cost or time-saving measure, just not caring at all... Which, can you blame them? Modern consumers really don't give a shit either, they soak up marketing and don't bother to do real research.</p>
<p>I know of one large cookie cutter builder that i won't say as to not shill, that I've seen do a lot of those little easy extra mile steps... But then they go and make the same two mistakes, every single fucking house they build:
I don't know why it happens, but the baffling for the vent on the side of the house always drips dirt/dust and makes a hideous drip line down the siding (from the 2nd story)...
And they use the soil from the foundation as topsoil for the lawns, then spray shitty hydroseed. So the only thing that takes is weedy looking annual grasses. Dumbasses, there was already nutrient/organic material rich topsoil before you got there, just use that! </p>
<p>I'm both a realtor and a lawn care professional... And these things regularly affect my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually <em>could</em> still be okay. If wood <em>is</em> wet , it's only the very very top layer of wood, so there is very little moisture in the actual materials. As the new, dry materials go up, the vapor pressure difference will pull moisture from the wet materials into the other materials. So as long as the rock and the insulation (assuming it isn't spray foam or something) are bone dry at installation, it probably would cause much of an issue, especially if the HVAC is up and running. That said, this FAR from a best practice when building a structure.</p></div>		</li>
