			<div class="markdown"><p>A pickle is more likely to refer to something like Branston's pickle or piccallili. Like a pickled sauce or relish. Though the American thing of calling a gherkin a pickle is becoming more common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife is from India, and they call anything pickled a &quot;pickle&quot;. Pickled mango? That's pickle. Pickled chili? That's a pickle. Pickled peppercorns? That's a pickle.</p>
<p>Of course they also use the words &quot;lime&quot; and &quot;lemon&quot; interchangeably, so clearly they're insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can mean any pickled cucumber here, not just true gherkins. It's a bit like scampi in that regard.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any pickled cucumber is called gherkin in the UK. Technically it's supposed to depend on the variety of cucumber being used but we don't have another word for it other than &quot;pickled cucumber&quot; so everyone just calls any picked cucumber &quot;gherkin&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
