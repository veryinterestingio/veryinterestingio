			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it’s out of the scope of the study. This research is from early last year. The study does not offer any evidence regarding Delta and using such evidence would likely break key assumptions given just how much more the contagion it is.</p>
<p>The research is for the strain at that time last year. Using it as evidence to explain anything about Delta is assuming it behaves the same as last year‘s visit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for linking this fascinating study. </p>
<p>The paper says &quot;The majority of passengers who sat within two rows of an index case were not contact-traced, in part because contact tracing for some flights was ceased as England transitioned from containment to delay phase ...&quot; </p>
<p>Can anyone tell me, between what dates was England in a &quot;containment phase&quot;?</p></div>		</li>
