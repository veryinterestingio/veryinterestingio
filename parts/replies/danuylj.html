			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong on the first. There are 2 leading theories for the rise of allergies.</p>
<p>The first is the Hygiene Hypothesis. This basically says that you have two types of T cells in your immune system: Th1 and Th2. You're born with a primarily Th2 dominant system. As you face infections, your body starts making more Th1 cells. When you have too sterile of an environment, your body has the wrong ratio of Th1:Th2 cells, causing your system to go crazy. (Allergies are mediated by Th2)</p>
<p>The second has to do with parasites. Pretty much the same logic as the previous one, but here it's because we don't come in contact with parasites. Our Th2 cell-mediated attack is supposed to attack parasites. Because we don't get exposed to them, the system attacks harmless things instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From an old guy with picture proof of being a dirt-eating toddler, I too believe we are too clean with our small ones.  Did you know in Okinawa, Japan kindergartens there is only one cup for the kids to drink water? Did a mental picture of a snot-nosed kid 'sharing' his snot via cup come into mind?  It did for me when I was told this.  Anyway, the idea is the young child's immune system is ramped up to learn, much like the young mind can grasp new language much better than an older brain.  So the one cup 'teaches' the immune systems of the kids in a crash course fashion.</p>
<p>On the gluten intolerance symptoms may be on the rise due to Roundup <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/" target="_blank">abuse</a> where the farmers use Roundup to force-ripen the crop at the same time.  Remember folks, it's all about the profits! :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The milk thing is caused by homogenization and I don't recall purchased milk ever not being homogenized in the 80's or 90's where I grew up.  Homogenization is a process where the fat is broken up into smaller pieces so it remains suspended and doesn't separate like larger pieces of fat would, it's done mechanically.  It's not a mystery and it's clearly stated on milk bottles that it's homogenized usually.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Thank you.
I too remember it always being homogenised but it still happened when I was delivering it to people in the late 80's and early 90's. So even if it is just a case of the process has been better refined it still fits with what my original comment states, that there's been changes in the way food is produced and therefore could be a contributing factor. </p></div>		</li>
