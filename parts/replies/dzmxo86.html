			<div class="markdown"><p>You can have a straight line on a curved surface, like a piece of string laying on a balloon. But I’m not sure you could have a flat line on a curved surface. Since the surface molds the shape of the string, it won’t be flat. I guess what I’m trying to say here is that using straight would only imply a direct line from point to point. Using flat defines more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Straightness is a property of the line, flatness is a property of the space, which then affects the geometry of the line.</p>
<p>Afaik there isn't a good linguistic term for describing the geometry of <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/files/2013/10/Curved_in_3D.jpg" target="_blank">a 3D region in 4D</a>, so it ends up getting described by the analogous term for the shape of <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-58bd46b69d692c048dd85c78ce1fe298" target="_blank">a 2D region in 3D</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: As a caveat, the pics are of the curvature of spacetime due to a specific mass (local curvature), not the curvature of the universe overall (global curvature, or maybe universal curvature?). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because straightness is a concept that exists independent of the curvature of space.  A straight line is still straight regardless of whether it exists in a Euclidean (flat) geometry/space or a Non-Euclidean (curved) geometry/space.  In fact, the curvature of space affects how these straight lines behave and interact with each other.  </p>
<p>For example, if you take three straight lines which intersect each other, they form a triangle.  In a Euclidean/flat geometry/space, the triangle has interior angles which add up to 180 degrees.  In a Non-Euclidean/curved geometry/space, the triangle has interior angles which either add up to less than 180 degrees (which is called an <del>&quot;Elliptical Geometry&quot;</del> &quot;Hyperbolic Geometry&quot;) or add up to more than 180 degrees (which is called a <del>&quot;Hyperbolic Geometry&quot;</del> &quot;Elliptic Geometry&quot;).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the only reason why we call Non-Euclidean geometries &quot;curved&quot; is because when we project these geometries into a Euclidean geometry, straight lines look curved.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes -- consider the surface of a ball.  An ant could start at a point on the ball, go in a straight line, and eventually end up where it started without ever turning around.  The surface of a ball is a curved 2-dimensional space, unlike an (endless) flat sheet of paper, which is a flat 2-dimensional space.  </p>
<p>I'll leave it to physicists to say how many dimensions the universe actually has (I've just heard of fancy words like &quot;string theory&quot; and &quot;holographic principle&quot; and vaguely know that there might not &quot;really&quot; be 4 dimensions after all).</p>
<p>But when cosmologists say the universe is &quot;flat,&quot; what they mean is that the &quot;grid lines&quot; are straight, like on graph paper -- there's such a thing as parallel lines, going in a straight line doesn't get you back where you started, etc.  Such a thing could happen in any number of dimensions.  Something like the surface of a ball, where parallel grid lines don't work too well on a global scale, is an example of curved space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  An example would be that if the universe were much smaller (and finite), you could potentially see our own galaxy on the cosmological horizon.</p></div>		</li>
