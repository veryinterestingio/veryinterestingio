			<div class="markdown"><p>ICU nurse here- difficulties in weaning sedation and waking someone up are most often caused by issues with the ventilator (breathing machine). Someone who is in a medically induced coma can't breathe safely on their own- they need a breathing tube and a breathing machine. When someone is very deeply sedated, the ventilator does 100% of the breathing work. To safely take the breathing tube out, the person has to be awake enough to do most of the work, with the ventilator helping only a little bit. Ideally, you can wake someone up gradually and they can do more and more of their own breathing work until they can breathe fully independently. But sometimes, when you start to decrease sedation and the person starts to wake up, they can't work with the ventilator at all- they actually work against it and they don't get enough air unless you turn sedation back on and let the ventilator do 100% of the work. Adjusting the types of sedation meds used can help with this, and sometimes it just takes time. </p>
<p>There are other issues that can happen too- sometimes when you decrease the doses of sedation, people became very agitated- their blood pressure and heart rate can get dangerously high, they may try to pull out their breathing tube or IV lines or climb out of bed. Again, time and adjusting the sedation meds can help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can swing it, I really recommend talking to an RT and having them set a ventilator up for you to try. Place the ETT in your mouth and use a nose clip too. It's really eye opening to feel how it works and can help you to suggest new settings or describe the situation to family/patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RT here, that’s an interesting idea.  A lot of times we know better settings are available but may have old school Critical Care docs that suggest the least friendly patient settings. Can be frustrating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you lower the levels of sedation, patients can become agitated/restless which can be dangerous. Or the blood pressure/heart rate could spike dangerously. Or they could have seizures (if the sedation was a benzodiazepine). Or if they are intubated you might try to wean them off the ventilator but their lungs or respiratory drive might not be strong enough to take over. All of these reasons would be reasons that waking someone up would &quot;fail&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who takes two heavy dose benzos, would they be supplemented while I was out? Or Would my body go through withdrawals? Would I be more prone to seizures during awakening?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you would probably get doses of the benzos to keep you from withdrawing. Depending on the reason you take them they might be tapered off. You're more prone to seizures whenever the dose of benzos is reduced so if it's reduced to wake you up you'd be more prone to seizures then. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of ice cream is a bad thing. &quot;The worst part about being sick, is that you get all the ice cream you ask for. And the worst part about that is that there's nothing more they can do for you. Ice cream isnt going to make everything OK&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s an interesting situation you have described. No patient should be ventilated and stay in “induced coma” when they have a routine tonsillectomy. Either something has gone really really badly surgically or you had some rare anaesthetic complication eg anaphylaxis, sux apnea or malignant hyperthermia etc (but for any of those usually the family would have been told quite clearly as it carries implication for future anaesthesia). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the family pediatrician was much later slammed for something in his work (general gossip), but even 3 decades later my family freaks and worries about me having any anaesthesia or even downers in general (while experimenting in my teens a Xanax amount my friends would take for fun knocked me out for an entire weekend).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long ago was that? There is a condition called suxamethonium apnoea, which is a genetic condition that means that you take much longer to metabolise one of the paralysing drugs. Usually this drug wears off in a few minutes, but with sux apnoea this can take many hours. Could this be what happened to you?</p></div>		</li>
