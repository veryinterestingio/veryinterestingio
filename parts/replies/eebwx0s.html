			<div class="markdown"><p>I've low carbed on and off for years, and they knock me out of ketosis every time. Might as well be eating regular sugar... at least real sugar doesn't cause shit pains. Erythritol isn't too bad, though. It's kind of expensive, but there's a brand of chocolate sweetened with erythritol and stevia called <a href="https://lilyssweets.com/" target="_blank">Lily's</a>. I can eat that and have no issues at all. Maybe it would work for you, too?  </p>
<p>Edit: Were you talking about the regular sugar alcohol candy or those gummies I linked to? I read it like you were talking about sugar alcohols, so that's what my reply was based on. If you're talking about the gummies, that's good to know, because they ARE expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it's just specific types of fake sugar. Because I just lost 50 pounds in <em>2 months</em> doing keto. All I drank was water and Diet Coke. I was in such insane Ketosis that my doctor told me to stop or I would surely develop gout from high uric acid levels in my blood.</p></div>		</li>
