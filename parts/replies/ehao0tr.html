			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I were to step out into space without a suit, my body would not immediately lose all its temperature, but it would be a gradual (if quick) process. So where does that energy go? If it’s leaving my body as heat, but is not going into the surrounding space, what’s the other half of the equation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy leaves your body as light, mostly infrared. It then propagates away, staying in that form until it is absorbed by something else.</p>
<p>This happens all the time, but it's not the dominant method of heat transfer since conduction and convection are much faster. It's how infrared cameras can see people in the dark; there's no reflected light but there's light coming from the person if you look at the right wavelengths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. It makes perfect sense, but I somehow never saw it that way. I always imagined the camera somehow working... I dunno, not like that. My infrared thermometer I use almost daily I thought of as being active, like radar. </p>
<p>Now, IR security cameras do tend to have a bunch of IR LEDs like an invisible spot light and recording the light that is returning, but that's because most objects would otherwise be too dull to see on a cheap camera. Bugs can see IR though, which is why spiders on security cameras are a problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>IR thermal cameras pick up radiated light, but are less common. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were directly in the sunlight say orbiting the earth, your biggest issue would be overheating.  Recall what it feels like to be on a hot sunny day in the desert, now realize you would don't have 60+ miles of atmosphere to block the sun.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The  back of you would feel cold, but in space you only have radiation to expel heat generated by biological functions which is not very efficient and human body temperatures.  sweating via evaporation would still work very well to regulate your temperature.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the movies where they show you freezing immediately is completely false. Space suits are painted white, and have active cooling systems which used evaporating water to help moderate body temperature. To my knowledge they don't have an active heating system as cooling was the bigger concern.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Final note:  Their has been research and even vacuum trials of unpressurized space suits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_counterpressure_suit" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical\_counterpressure\_suit" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical\_counterpressure\_suit</a></a>  The vacuum of space is not inherently damaging to the skin so long as sufficient pressure is applied to prevent embolisms, and there's enormous benefit to non pressurized space suits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the freezing in space became a trope with confusion about what happens to water in space.  If you're holding a glass of water when you get shoved out an airlock the water is going to immediately boil and then freeze because of the drop in pressure.  Hence the beautiful ice shows astronauts enjoy when they do privy purges.<br />
Hollywood probably thought something similar happened to the human body, but our bodies are pretty good at keeping fluids at pressure inside of us without (hopefully) squirting them all over the place.  However there was one case of a technician accidentally exposed to heavy vacuum while testing a space suit.  He was fine, but did report the disturbing feeling of all the saliva boiling out of his mouth before he lost consciousness. </p></div>		</li>

Concavities or small folds in the fabric could lead to fluid pooling in the gaps; the groin area proved extremely difficult to tailor successfully. »</p>

<p>So a better question would be, how close would you have to get to the sun for an ideal black body to be at room temperature? Spoiler alert: close to where the earth is.</p>

<p>Wow, of course this makes perfect sense. And it's so obvious once you realize that.</p>

<p>if the earth were a perfect blackbody it would be about 40 °C colder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure where you're getting that number - maybe you assumed that Earth still has the same albedo in that calculation?</p>
<p>Earth's planetary equilibrium temperature with its current albedo of 0.30 is 255 K, some 34 K cooler than its actual present surface temperature. A perfect blackbody would have an albedo of exactly 0, which means Earth would be absorbing 1 / (1 - 0.30) = 1.43x as much sunlight as it currently absorbs.</p>
<p>By Stefan-Boltzmann, that perfect blackbody should have an equilibrium temperature of 255 K * (1.43)^1/4 = 279 K, or about 10 degrees colder than present, not 40.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes me wonder... what is the actual relation between albedo and emissivity? There isn't really one, is there?</p>
<p>Like, a &quot;perfect black body&quot; would have an emissivity of 1 and albedo 0, and asphalt is 0.88 and 0.12, but snow is 0.9 and 0.8. Is there a name for an object with emissivity of 1 and albedo 1?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, whatever it is, it's really cold since it's absorbing no radiation, but emits it perfectly. I've informally heard the term &quot;white body&quot; for anything reflecting all radiation, but it's unclear to me what its emission would be.</p>
<p>Albedo and emissivity are ultimately dependent on the electronic, vibrational, and rotational transitions available to molecules at the surface on an object...and what the corresponding electromagnetic wavelength is for the energy of those transitions. As a general radiative transfer rule, if something absorbs really well at a particular wavelength, it will also emit at that same wavelength just as well.</p>
<p>We usually only consider albedo in the visible and emission in the mid-infrared, but that's only because our Sun emits most light in the visible, and things at room temperature emit in the mid-infrared. If an object has an emissivity of 1 at a wavelength of 10 microns, then it will also perfectly absorb all light at 10 microns (i.e. an albedo of 0 at that wavelength).</p></div>		</li>
