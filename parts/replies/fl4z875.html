			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything you said is correct.  However, a bigger picture perspective is that the <em>architectural</em> decisions made by the systems architects who designed the router allow for fairly long boot times.</p>
<p>This got passed down to the people who choose the actual components for the device and the programmers who wrote the software.</p>
<p>It's not <em>required</em> to boot faster than a few minutes or so, and so the company making the router is saving money on the SOC component cost, on the flash media component cost, on the board routing, and on developer time for software optimization.</p>
<p>Source: I worked for a Tier 1 automotive infotainment supplier, and now work in a related field for a chip vendor.</p>
<p>Note that essentially instantaneous boots are technically possible.  The hardware can be verified later.  You could use an CPLD to do the router logic and skip any boot-time hardware checks.</p>
<p>Some aerospace/defense hardware is like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further upstreams it boils to marketing decisions, which do not value the 10$ per unit it would take to optimize arcane, undocumented shit. You also need to support 5 different wifi chips as your Shenzen suppliers change model every 6 months.</p>
<p>Source: I got told that 30 seconds was ok for a video camera firmware to boot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Note that this does give an advantage to the bigger vendors.  They <em>can</em> afford to spend a few million on software and board layout optimizations (things that won't affect the per unit BOM) because that cost gets spread over many more units.</p>
<p>This means their products perform better, which tends to make the bigger vendors even bigger.</p>
<p>See Samsung for it's dominance in flagship Android phones.  This is essentially why.</p></div>		</li>

I honestly thought that the owner was going to hire me away from the contract company I worked for on the spot....it took a week. I literally got a job and double my salary for typing the following two commands.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spanning-tree is a system to detect and prevent loops in networks. Like when some idiot finds a disconnected cable in the conference room and plugs it into the open port on the wall jack even though the other end of the cable is already connected to a different wall jack. Network loops are bad because some traffic will keep flowing around the loop endlessly until the network switch is overloaded or the loop is removed.</p>
<p>Normally spanning-tree will not allow any traffic for a few seconds when a new connection is made while it verifies there are no loops. The port-fast command is used to override that delay because some end user devices sometimes have issues with that delay and fail to detect a working connection. It allows a short window of a loop existing but its relatively safe because it should be quickly detected and stopped.</p></div>		</li>
