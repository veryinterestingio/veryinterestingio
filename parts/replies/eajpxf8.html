			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with the overall definition and share the concern about the weakening of rights, this doesn't specifically answer the second question about what it means for Ukraine. It ought to be clarified that the martial law in this instance covers specific regions where the threat of Russian invasion is greatest. Ukrainian law allows for a long list of provisions for martial law, but it's up to lawmakers to decide which ones to implement. Also of note is that martial law has only been declared as of now for 30 days.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the martial law expands, then yes, it's a much larger cause for concern. </p>

<p>I am not Ukrainian, nor am I an expert in their laws, so I would love for someone with better qualifications to jump in here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ukrainian....it is in effect especially in the eastern regions where Russia has led a proxy war to take more than just Crimea. Although this could be a martial declaration to formally surrender to RF. Give one man the power and it can stop a war. If it escalates passed ukraine v russia there will be assured mutual destruction of the globe. Finally will see Samat-2 in action against the Iron Dome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read, this time around it's more of a preparation in case Russia decided to escalate situation further: they are not limiting civilians, not implementing drafts, just getting military ready to take over faster <em>if</em> situation escalates further.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I deliberately didn't speculate on that, but if you insist:.
The current president, Poroshenko, is incredibly unpopular. There's an election just four months away, and he's going to lose bigtime.   </p>
<p>If I were the suspicious type, I'd be worried he's going to use his new powers to influence the outcome of that election.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally fake! Poroshenko's rating is something like 12-14%, same as his main rival on upcoming elections - Julia Timoshenko. And yesterday Poroshenko said that he made and order to implement martial law for only 30 days so the elections will be not cancelled. Meanwhile, deputys voted for an order that elections will be exact on the last sunday of March, as they were supposed to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Putin's ratings are also at one of their lowest points because of the reforms to the pensions system. He also has a lot less to lose and more to gain by igniting the crisis.</p>
<p>So really I'm not sure why, in the absence of evidence, you're pointing to Poroshenko as the likely culprit.</p></div>		</li>
