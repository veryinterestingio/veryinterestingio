<p>If you magnetize a cobolt-60 atom such that it spins with the top turning left (counterclockwise), the beta radiation will be preferentially emited downward. Gotcha</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But direction of spin is dependent on the vantage point as well. If you spin a top on a glass table, from above it could appear to be spinning clockwise. But if you got under the table and viewed it from below, the spin would look counter-clockwise. Your definition still isn't as clear because it's not independent of the observer's position. &quot;Up &amp; down&quot; can be defined without any reference to a vantage point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spin of the atom defines an oriented plane. You can pick an arbitrary direction in that plane and call that forward. Because the plane is oriented, you can now pick another direction in the plane, perpendicular to the first, in the direction of the spin, and call that up. The preferred emission direction now defines a third direction, perpendicular to both of the two, call that left.</p>
<p>Note that the direction we called &quot;left&quot; does not depend on which direction we identified as &quot;forward&quot;. We only needed to pick &quot;forward&quot; so that we could break the oriented plane down into independent &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;up&quot; directions.</p>
<p>This works because Cobalt-60 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_experiment" target="_blank">violates chiral symmetry</a> (left-right symmetry).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that the same? </p>
<p>I usually hear that described as mirroring and mirrors don't flip left/right. They flip Front/Back. </p>
<p>And people have no problem distinguishing front/back, due to that axis being asymmetric like up/down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll address both the asymmetry of direction thing and the mirror thing as best I can.</p>
<p>Well, front and back, up and down, left and right, are all essentially the same. For instance, if you were rotated 90 degrees clockwise with respect to me, what I call left and right you woud call up and down. </p>
<p>Up and down and front and back etc are only apparently asymmetric for all cases not involving weak force interactions. When you say up and down, you mean up and down relative to the surface of Earth that I'm standing on. However that up and down is down and up respectively for someone standing on the opposite side of Earth. And for someone standing at 90 degrees of longitude away from you, your up and down is their right and left (or left and right) or forward and backward depending on how they face. It may be hard to see without some drawings but I hope you can imagine.</p>
<p>Mirrors &quot;flipping front to back&quot; is a special case in which your perspective is facing into the plane of the mirror. More generally their action is to take in a point in space and produce a corresponding point opposite the first in the axis of the mirror plane. </p>
<p>More explicitly, a mirror in the y-z plane takes in (x, y, z) and produces a new point, indicated by ' symbols, which is related to the old one as follows: (x', y', z') = (-x, y, z). Aka, it flips positions in the direction perpendicular to it's face (which when you look straight at one is front to back). (This is also not quite the exact mathematical understanding of what a mirror does but it provides the right sense).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But then your left and my left are different depends on what side we are facing.</p>
<p>That's the point, on Earth, no matter what side you're facing, there's always ground and sky, and gravity that always pull you toward the ground.</p>
<p>Left and right? You just have yourself to refer to.</p></div>		</li>
