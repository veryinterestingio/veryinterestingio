<p>It's unintuitive, but the direction doesn't matter (as long as it is not downwards). Anything that points even a little bit upwards works in this ideal scenario where we ignore the atmosphere and Earth's rotation. Only the total energy matters here, which means the direction is irrelevant as long as you don't crash into the surface immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This relates to my question. I would have thought that going directly up would be the most inefficient way to escape the earth since you're making absolutely no attempt whatsoever to establish orbit, you're just brute forcing your way out of earth's gravitational well. Surely you can escape the earth far more easily by going at a 45 degree ish angle and so aiming for an LEO with a lateral velocity of 8000 m/s ish around 200k up? Or are you saying that establishing stable earth orbit does not count as escape velocity? </p>
<p>So what does? Getting into solar orbit? Or do you need to be going in orbit around the milky way or have even escaped the milky way's gravitational well to be considered as having reached escape velocity?</p>
<p>Because surely unless you're going absurdly, near relatavistically, fast you haven't actually &quot;escaped&quot; anything you're just in orbit around something bigger?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Escape velocity is the velocity where you leave Earth forever and can reach an &quot;infinite&quot; distance in an idealized universe where no other objects exist. In practice the velocity required to leave Earth permanently doesn't change much from these other objects.</p>
<p>If you are in an orbit you didn't escape. You cannot enter a stable orbit from the surface without additional propulsion anyway. Orbits are closed ellipses. If you launch from the ground then your orbit intersects that ground, and you crash before completing the first revolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If KSP has taught me anything, the easiest way is to establish an elliptical orbit, and then continue to do burns at the periapsis on the orbit (the point closest to earth) to push out the side till you're instead orbitting the sun</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is……. Is earths gravity a perfect sphere? Or is it shaped….. well like earth?</p>
<p>I’ve never thought about it and everything I saw in school depicting gravity was a circle around the planet……. But I’ve long since learned not to trust models shown to me in school</p>
<p>I ask because if the effect of gravity isn’t in a perfect sphere around the planet then there would have to be an angle where you would leave the effect of said gravity sooner…… I think</p>
<p>I’m both asking and explaining my question poorly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A sphere isn't a bad approximation. A slightly oblate spheroid (wider at the equator due to the rotation of Earth) is an even better approximation. That means the escape velocity is a tiny bit lower at the equator. But more importantly you can use the rotation of Earth as starting speed (~450 m/s), making it easier to reach escape velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth's (and other planets) gravity does change with the variations in planet's density and mass distribution,  which is not uniform. Granted, it's minor and you need a very well calibrated detector to measure it. The lunar GRAIL mission used the distance between a pair of probes flying in precise formation orbit to measure tiny accelerations due to these mass changes. The probe pair could measure distances of one <em>micrometer</em>  when the spacecraft were 100-140 <em>miles</em> apart. It is the best gravitational map of the moon we have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick question: does this object need to maintain that velocity at all times, or just at the point it leaves the surface? In other words, is the object being slowed by gravity as it tries to ‘escape’ Earth’s gravity? So, in effect, the velocity acts a ‘reserve’ of propulsion, which is eroded as the object ‘escapes’ and ultimately proves sufficient to get the object clear of Earth’s gravitational influence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That speed is required just as it leaves the surface.  During its ascent, the object is slowing down - gravity is &quot;draining&quot; its speed as the object climbs, and at 11,186 m/s at the surface, it slows down enough that it effectively just barely squeaks out of Earth's gravitational well, and is essentially moving away from Earth at a very slow speed.  All of this ignores differences in elevation at the surface, slight differences in gravitational field strength in different locations, atmospheric factors, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also, by the same logic, the minimum speed at which  something from space will hit the earth. It is the speed that the earth's gravity will accelerate an object to if it falls from a high enough height (anywhere outside the earth's gravity well) to the surface.</p>
<p>As with escape velocity this is an approximation that ignores a lot of details that can have a significant impact on the results. Like the drag caused by traveling through the atmosphere at around 35 times the speed of sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just at the point it leaves the surface</p>
<p>Objects at or above the escape velocity will never slow to a velocity of 0 away from the earth no matter how far they travel. The earth's gravity becomes weaker faster than the object is being slowed down.</p>
<p>Think removing 1/4 km/hour from the speed, then 1/8th, then 1/16th, it can approach a velocity that's greater than zero with infinite subtractions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a theoretically empty universe, wouldn't the object still turn around at some point? Since gravitation doesn't end, but just gets weaker, and the projectile doesn't get any more energy, it should at some point have lost all energy, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is going above escape velocity, then the point at which it slows down to a halt before returning back down is infinity. The object will keep getting slowed down forever, but because it is also moving away at the same time, it will always be far enough away that earth's gravity is too weak to slow it down completely.</p>
<p>It is true that gravity goes on forever, but it gets unbelievably weak at long distances.</p>
<p>Now as others have pointed out: in a non-empty universe the object will not escape the solar system if it is going at this speed, as there is much more mass in it. As soon as it gets far enough away from earth, say maybe a million km (but don't quote me on that), the gravitational forces from the sun and other planets will have a much bigger influence.</p>
<p>(And we're also completely ignoring that there is no object that could even survive being launched at 11km/s, and that there is quite a lot of atmosphere in the way)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Escape velocity is the speed at which the rate of energy loss perfectly matches the rate at which the gravitational force weakens.</p></div>		</li>
