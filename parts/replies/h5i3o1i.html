			<div class="markdown"><p>I will read it later, but maybe you can answer faster.<br />
<strong>is this 340 vs 480 including base energy consumption of the body, or excluding?</strong></p>
<p>Because if including:<br />
1600m with 5km/h takes 0.32 hours. if my energy consumption is like 1000kJ per hour, then this would be 320kJ - walking would only contribute 20kJ. For running however, it would take half the time (0.16 hours) and thus (with the 1000kJ per hour base) my base energy consumption would be 160kJ - running would contribute 320kJ and therefore 16times as much as walking. </p>
<p>Even if the base energy consumption was lower than 1000kJ, which was chosen for easy calculation, then the benefit of running would decrease, potentially by a lot.</p>
<p>If exluding:<br />
480/340 \~ 40% more energy consumption if you run the distance and not walk.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>hope my question is clear..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the answer regarding this particular study, but I might say that it doesn't matter. You would still be alive 24h a day, thus the base metabolism consumption can be safely ignored.</p>
<p>If you run for 20 minutes and then sit down for 20 minutes or walk for 40, you would still make 40 minutes of base energy consumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You won’t necessarily just sit around though. Say you’re lost in the woods and need to conserve energy. If your camp is at point A and a bush of berries is at point B, what’s the best way to reach point B?   </p>
<p>Is it better to walk because walking consumes less energy or is it better to run because while you consume more energy in the first minutes, you still spend less time and total energy on that specific task (go from point A to point B). So when you reach point B, you wouldn’t just waste the extra energy (the difference between energy required to walk from A to B and energy required to run the same), you’d use it to start another activity, like picking berries and eating them or something. So now you did 2 tasks: travel and pick a bush for the same time and energy it would take to travel by walking.  </p>
<p>Though all this doesn’t have to be true because the base energy consumption may not be that high to make that difference. And of course the original scenario doesn’t imply these circumstances.  I’m just pointing out that the follow-up question is relevant in many scenarios.   </p>
<p>Oh, and also the run or walk dilemma would be a bit weird because you can still be productive while walking. Thinking, relaxing, exploring, remembering some spots on the way etc are some of the productive activities you may do <em>while</em> walking so it’s pretty hard to evaluate all of the factors to come up with an answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you keep the same speed as you get fitter I'd assume you'd expend less energy running 1 mile. Generally, as we get fitter, we run the mile faster - using roughly the same energy over a shorter period of time. Can people in the know confirm or deny for us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are more efficient ways of running, which you get better at the more you run. And you increase aerobic capacity, which is a more efficient method of energy production. It also takes time (~20 minutes) to warm up your aerobic capacity. They only had a 3 minute warm up period in this study</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Up to a point, but the the increase in efficiency will always run up against the laws of thermodynamics. Doing something faster will generate more friction and lose more energy than doing it slower, even if a small amount, it would never be more efficient to run than walk.</p></div>		</li>
