<p>I didn't, but I caught a flight back home when I had a bad sinus infection. The plane landing was a torturous experience as the air pressure rapidly shifted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi,  A dive buddy of mine once burst his eardrum underwater whilst trying to equalise. The result was a badly perforated drum and several nasty infections. He had to have some form of membrane put in to assist the eardrum in growing back. </p>
<p>He said the pain was as if a knitting needle had been rammed into his ear.</p>
<p>He regained his hearing after 6 or 7 week irrc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I blew out an eardrum at less than 5m, and your friend is totally right. It's the pain of it immediately upon rupturing, plus what i can only describe as a feeling of vertigo and everything spinning. It was the first time I puked underwater, from both the pain and disorientation. Worst feeling ever.  </p>
<p>I never had it as bad as your friend with needing to have a membrane added, but my eardrum on that side is fucked to this day, and has a bit of scarring, and also gets infected easily now so I have to take extra precautions with it.. all because i was in a rush to descend.</p></div>		</li>
