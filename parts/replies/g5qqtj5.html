			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to add regarding lighting. The lighting used back in the 70s actually was in many ways cheaper than today’s lighting. The thing was, the cameras lens and capabilities compared to the human eye were so low, that things had to be brightly lit indoors, or shot outside. Inside, the lighting plan was basically “as much light as we can get everywhere” and they could adjust down with the camera Iris. </p>
<p>Now, cameras have gotten significantly better to where cameras are picking up a much broader range of light intensity than before, getting closer to what our eye can achieve. So now, film shoots are more mobile, more easily shot on site, and often involve fewer but more specialized lighting than before.  </p>
<p>In regards to lighting costs, typical LED film lights today can cost well over $5k, even basic stuff can easily cost over $1200; a 1969 catalog from one of the largest manufacturers back then, lists most of their lights as costing less than $40 USD. </p>
<p>So, cameras got better, lighting became more dynamic and changeable, and more expensive.  </p>
<p>I guess what could be said is that the change to video from film did drastically lower the barrier to enter the business, and a lot of lower quality films were significantly cheaper to produce than before. For major studio motion pictures, the lighting differences aren’t really cost cutting measures, as the cost to produce a wide release film keeps rising.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Lights can get <em>way</em> more expensive than $5k, too.  A Skypanel S360 is like $18k.</p>
<p>And if you move away from LEDs, I could find some HMI’s that are $25-50k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note: Old film lights consumed a crazy amount of electricity (which costs money of course) and were often major safety concerns because they were so heavy and extremely hot. So as a whole system leds are probably cheaper overall than old school lighting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, way off there.  </p>
<p>Back in the old days, electricity was significantly cheaper and no one cared how much coal was being burned somewhere. A lot of generators would be used as well, that just burn diesel. </p>
<p>Now it’s actually hardly different, we can just get a lot more lights on the same power source. Many venues charge several thousand dollars to “turn on” a power source- and other older venues, have about as much electricity as they did in the 60s. In larger, older venues that were created with the old style of production in mind, there's actually a surplus of available power, and we need to decide which power points to turn on, and then design around that. We will run hundreds of feet of cable, to put a light 5' away from another power source, that we don't want to pay the $$ to turn on. </p>
<p>A big part of why you see more lights these days is that energy efficiency has allowed us to have more and more lights, somewhat removing the old power limitation. </p>
<p>A simple example. A venue in 1970 has 1-200A power connection. It can power let’s say 80 $40 floodlights back then. Or in 2020 power 300 led and arc source units that cost anywhere from $1600-6500. As designers we really do appreciate the energy efficiency steps, and don't not care about the environment- but our job is to make the lights pretty, and so we'll use the available power as much as we can. It's part of why shows keep getting bigger and venues don't get rebuilt every 5 years, we're becoming more efficient with the resources available to us, so we can add in that much more stuff. </p>
<p>Edit- to add regarding heat and weight. Lights today are actually heavier. The large fresnel soft lights you’re describing are 100% still around today. They are big. In terms of weight, if you go with an old school incandescent unit, it will be real big and not heavy by comparison. A newer HMI version of that same light is <em>slightly</em> smaller, and weighs about twice as much as the other, but it uses less power for the same effect. </p>
<p>Now with leds and other sources, there’s so much expensive computing, and then protection for that computing equipment that the lights are just a lot heavier now, in general. </p>
<p>The heat issue has gotten significantly better across the board, but again, that’s at the cost of weight, and our safety measures regarding heat and fire hazards is the same between cold and hot running lights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons those sources are watched today is <em>because</em> they were shot on film, and we were able to go back and digitize them. Lots of old shows that weren't look terrible, and aren't popular today for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, one begets the other in some ways. </p>
<p>A good side by side example of film vs early videotape is the second season of The Twilight Zone. They experimented with videotape in six episodes to cut costs around 1960. One I can think of off-hand is <em>The lateness of the hour</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great one for this, too, is comparing <em>Star Trek: TNG</em> to <em>Voyager</em>.</p>
<p>TNG was shot on film, so a modern transfer of it is extremely sharp, whereas Voyager was shot on tape, so there's a softness to it.</p></div>		</li>
