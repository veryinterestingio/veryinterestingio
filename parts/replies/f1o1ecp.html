			<div class="markdown"><p>To give a real answer, a lot of it comes down to how neurons work.  In specific, they're binary.  You want to do a thing, it triggers appropriate neurons, and they operate by dumping an electrical potential in a chain reaction.</p>
<p>Your muscle control thus comes from firing fewer neurons, producing a weaker signal, and not activating muscles as much.</p>
<p>We already have a pretty insane dynamic range -- doing a bit of science with a couple scales and my right index finger, I can reliably maintain 10+/-1 g (i.e. between 9 and 11 grams).  I can also exert &gt;5kg with the same -- so a roughly 5000:1 dynamic range.  (Note that 5gk is at a +/- 100g stability or so.. it's not full detail across the range).</p>
<p>That being said, if we make that muscle set bigger and stronger, a few things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's more weight that must be carried around, and moved around whenever I want to do something.  This limits my agility (consider a &quot;small and nimble&quot; person vs a &quot;large and lumbering&quot; one).</li>
<li>The effects of muscle activation scale up along with the muscle size -- I lose the ability to do small movements as well.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>In more close to home terms, consider how carefully you can manipulate things with your arms vs. your legs.  Some of that is practice and training; some of that is brain makeup; some of that is that they're bigger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calling neurons binary is common but probably misleading...everything from vesicle release probabities, channel densities, nt affinities, nt spillover, adaptation, saturation, and a thousand other mechanism all regulate how strongly cells respond to inputs. </p>
<p>Cajal was probably first to describe dendrites and Soma's as analog and axons as digital. This really downplays computation that may also happen in the axons from a chemical and axonal transport perspective. </p>
<p>Even when an action potential has been initiated the response is nauanced by the subthreshold activity that preceded the AP...the conduction velocity could change, the quantity of vesicles available for release may change, depending on other external factors, the ability of a signal to even completely conduct through an entire axon terminal arbor may change. </p>
<p>Lastly, there is also the extracellular space to consider. Local field potentials can be a few mV up to infinite voltage at zero distance (hypothetical but important to think about) and most definitely represent a non-binary mode of information transmission and noise. Work in several parts of the brain, but notably in the hippocampus show that neuron-neuron interactions through the extracellular space can reinforce oscillatory activity. This may be one important mechanism that underlies observations that there are slow oscillations in this region when we are not actively learning and faster waves when we are. </p>
<p>Even some of this discussion is a simplification. But it should help to see how calling neuronal signally binary is misleading.</p></div>		</li>
