			<div class="markdown"><p>This just happened in my town last year.  They were digging a 12ft trench in sandy soil, had one guy in the bottom and it collapsed.  The excavator operator tried digging him out and ripped the guy in half.  The news really cleaned the story up (said workers were able to remove the man but he had already succumbed to injuries and made no mention of the excavators error).  I understand why they wanted to clean the story up a bit, but people should know how dangerous situations like that can be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh dear God. I can't imagine what that must have been like for the guy operating the excavator.</p>
<p>Though I do have to wonder, are they not told this while they're being trained to operate them? It seems like a really important piece of information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I talked to one of the responding paramedics and he said it was the worst call he'd ever been on, I can only imagine the excavators horror. </p>
<p>I imagine they are trained to not try digging people out, but adrenaline and panic can throw that out of the window in a hurry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work as a heavy equipment operator. We’re absolutely aware that the machines we are in will maim, decapitate, crush, or sever a person from another large part of that person with ease. It’s a big source of stress for me as I struggle with paying attention at times and have poor depth perception. I’ve heard many stories of death and disfigurement, I’ve seen lots of close calls and survivable injuries.</p>
<p>All that said, I know many guys whom I’d trust to remove rubble from overtop survivors, excavators do not need to “push” to remove rubble as someone else tried stating here. Excavators have attachments specifically for tasks like grabbing and moving large objects and demo work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It must have been hell for the guys/gals running the excavation equipment when cleaning up after 911. Never knowing when you would scoop up someone mixed in with the rubble.<br />
I heard that all the material from the salvage operation went to a sorting site where every bit of the rubble was sifted and any identifiable stuff such as body parts, clothing, wallets and purses, etc. were separated.<br />
Doing something like that would take a certain type of person and I'm sure we have many traumatized people who participated in the cleanup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They weren't going to run into someone who was alive during cleanup, though. There were only a handful of rescued survivors, and the final one was rescued 27 hours after the attack. It's a different kind of morbid ordeal compared to risking a terrible accident while racing to save someone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a tour with a volunteer run 9/11 museum separate to the official 9/11 museum. They talked about how for months and years after, there would be... pieces recovered from the wreckage that was finally identified and they would have to contact the next of kin of that person every time unless they specifically signed a document stating that they no longer wished to be notified.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Incidentally this is often the mistake people make when workers are trapped by mounds of dirt in collapsed trenches, or other dig sites. Trying to dig them out with an excavator is more likely to get them killed than not. You have to use a shovel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering how easily those excavator shovels cut through compacted dirt, it's easy to imagine you might accidentially dig out only your coworkers top half with that rescue effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess now my question is are cranes not used in structural collapse rescue efforts? I feel like picking up debris directly upward would alleviate some of those concerns. </p>
<p>Is it due to not being find stable ground to anchor the crane to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grab a bag of chips.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Squish it a few times so that there aren't any full size chips left, but most pieces are still pretty large.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Shake the bag up a bit.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Open the bag, dump it on a table.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now... pick up all the chips and put them in a bowl.  But try to make sure no chip or piece of a chip moves AT ALL except for the one you touch.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Even with this imperfect case (there won't be various large pieces connected by rebar or other linkages, few things will be layered/woven) it is unlikely you can succeed.  And if any shift of any piece can mean a lost life, you have your answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can still cause the remaining debris to crumble and shift. Maybe think of it like Mikado sticks, one side of a column may be above another, and other side can be beneath yet another one, holding its weight. It’s still risky. </p>
<p>Unless they know for sure that no one is in the collapse, they won’t remove any debris</p></div>		</li>
