			<div class="markdown"><p>This incorrect unfortunately, the 687 trillion would never be settled it’s notional not value. Value for many derivatives or settlement value will be a very small fraction of notional. In swaps for example, the largest derivatives by notional value, the notional is only a basis of calculation for the legs of the derivative.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes the market value of derivatives is &quot;only&quot; 12 Tn vs the notional headline figure. This is still far larger than the M1 &quot;real money&quot; supply (5 Tn) available to settle these contracts and only just below m2 (14Tn)</p>
<p>Market value is not fixed until settlement (or sometimes by ISDA years after) but notional is fixed which is why it's used in popular discussion.</p>
<p>If you have a good simple answer for a five year old on the derivatives market pls post it here. I had to wade in as I work in the field and saw a lot of very quant-y answers. notional vs market value, the ISDA definition of a swap, and settlement are so  far beyond ELI5 making those distinctions pointless.</p>
<p>Edit: u/wdshi's answer uses the same concepts (bets) as mine but takes the time to explain notional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>12 tn is a Gross Market Value estimate to be clear I.e an estimate of ‘absolute’ market value of loss making contracts and profitable ones without cross netting. Since at any given time contracts are marked to market in most jurisdictions it may or may not be an accurate number relative to settlement (most derivatives by value are accrued for settlement) and it will overstate exposure because it’s gross.</p>
<p>If you take an interest rate swap which is the largest derivatives segment by notional, that starts its life by definition with a value of zero. As the respective legs accrue interest you will either be due to receive or pay that value to the counterparty. However nearly all interest rate swaps are used to hedge interest rate risk on loan/funding requirements. The interest rate payments on those liabilities would obviously not be included in the calculation for the derivative market value.</p></div>		</li>
