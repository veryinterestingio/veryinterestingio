			<div class="markdown"><p>Muscles don’t move themselves. You use your bicep and triceps to move your <em>fore</em> arm and your shoulders to move your upper arm for example. You use your quads and hamstrings to move your lower legs. To move your entire legs or upper legs, you use your ass muscles or muscles located around the hip if I’m correct</p></div>		</li>
