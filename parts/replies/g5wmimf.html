			<div class="markdown"><p>Point 5 isn‚Äôt exactly correct. Newer WiFi standards are easily capable of delivering a 100 Mbps to a 100 Mbps connection assuming the modulation rates and SNR can support that. </p>
<p>Source, I deliver WiFi services to MDUs for a living. 100 Mbps packages are as fast as we tend to deliver. Since our throughput limits only apply to traffic going out to the internet, we can actually speed test the LAN performance or wireless performance. The goal being, always design the AP placement to outperform what we actually deliver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because when uploading and downloading stuff, the transfer has to confirm every chunk that's been sent, so if you're using a large amount of download, it can't download the confirmation that an upload succeeded because the &quot;pipe&quot; in the usual bandwidth analogy is already filled by you. This causes it to slow down because it has to wait for confirmation before more can be sent.</p>
<p>Sorry just wanted to try and explain why maxing out your upload or download will slow the other one down, since not many people know this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how common it is but in a community of duplexes I lived in briefly our local cable company had a 100mbps line to the &quot;common building&quot; and another 100mbps line from the common building to each house. We built a community internet (shared with 20-30 neighbors) by buying 4 100mbps internet connections but our theoretical max of 400mbps was limited by the singular 100mbps to the common building (we bought 4 lines for the data limit).</p>
<p>So it could just as likely be the neighbors girls' fault.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point 2 is usually not correct. Speed test sites and apps usually use Mbps.</p>
<p>E.g. the post popular is ookla/speedtest.net and they use Mbps.  </p>
<p>Point 5 is oft forgotten. Especially true when you put 2.4 and 5ghz on the same SSID, and most devices go with the stronger signal. If you keep them as separate SSID's and explicitly choose the 5ghz one from your device, then you'll be able to get much higher speeds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Read the fine print, you're paying for &quot;up to 100mbps.&quot;</p>

<p>Really wish I could pay 'up to' the amount on my bill at the same ratio as my IP gets 'up to' that 100mbps.</p></div>		</li>
