			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct, but for simplicity I switched the sign of the variable in the definition of the Riemann zeta function. Indeed the &quot;critical line&quot; is at a=1/2, but in my post it is a=-1/2.</p>
<p>Edit: the sign of the critical line</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that you switched the signs but the critical line is Re(s)=1/2 not -1/2 in standard notation (so -1/2 in your switched notation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was afraid that someone was going to ask this. In principle, any set of axioms could lead to &quot;different Mathematics&quot;. In particular, one could assume the Riemann hypothesis as one of the axioms. I hope someone else could give a more detailed insight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The story behind that is quite interesting I guess. At the beginning of the 20th century there was a movment in mathematics trying to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics. You can read more about that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In 1931 GÃ¶del then proofed that finding such a system of axioms is not possible and that there will always be undecidable problems. To cite from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems" target="_blank">wiki</a>:</p>
<p><em>The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of the natural numbers. For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.</em></p>
<p>To now get to the &quot;realm of standard mathematics&quot; - normally we take here the system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory" target="_blank">ZFC</a>, the Zermelo-Franklin-theory with the axiom of choice (AC) included. Now one could take for example the Zermelo-Franklin-theory without the AC and ask, if the AC can be proven by using the other axioms. And I can not give you the proof for that, but it can be shown that the AC is undecidable in the Zermelo-Franklin-theory... That is why in modern mathematics we have the AC as an additional axiom in the system. In this new system AC is obviously provable true, because it's an axiom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really interesting question I've never heard anyone pose. Godel tells that for any mathermatical system that satisfies certain properties, there will be certain problems we can't prove within that system. What if we used another set of axioms? Could this make a proof viable? Are there alternate sets of axioms we could use?</p></div>		</li>
