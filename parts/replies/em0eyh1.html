			<div class="markdown"><p>So as the son of a pool cleaner who has serviced many a pool in my summers, I can say that chlorine isn't the culprit in burning eyes. It's the pH. Your eye's pH level is naturally around 7.6, so true neutral water (7) or slightly basic (8) is going to cause your eyes to sting. The chlorine concentration in the pool should be low enough (about 5 parts per million) that its effect is negligible.</p>
<p>Same thing with the &quot;chlorine smell&quot;. What most people attribute to chlorine is the smell of chlorine that's reacted with stuff in the pool. A pool that smells like &quot;chlorine&quot; likely doesn't actually have any in it. Actual chlorine smells nothing like it, the only way I'd describe actual chlorine smell is burning. </p>
<p>Chances are any salt pools you've swam in likely have better pH balance. The salt pools literally produce chlorine with the salt and as far as I know it's the same type that would be poured in. </p>
<p>So yeah, that's my pool knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muriatic acid or pure baking soda. Salt water pools use electricity to split sodium chloride into sodium and chlorine.  This reaction causes the ph to constantly rise so some salt water pools have acid drip that constantly lowers the ph.  High or low ph can damage pool surfaces and equipment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chloramines also cause cloudiness and eye irritation.  Chloramines are chlorine molecules that are “attached” to contaminants.  The opposite of “free” chlorine.</p></div>		</li>
