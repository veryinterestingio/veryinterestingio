<p>Too much detergent without enough rinsing and hard water can also cause clothes to be crunchier/stiffer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very important bit!</p>
<p>Most of my shirts are at least 90% cotton and I've stopped using a dryer to help them last longer, but I think they're still just as soft. However, I'm VERY careful with the amount of detergent I use and don't add fabric softener.</p>
<p>Like with all cleaning products, the recommended dose of detergent errs on the side of too much. It doesn't make them cleaner, it just leaves a residue in the fabric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I always use the bare minimum detergent unless the clothing is particularly soiled.</p>
<p>It's always a little dubious when the company selling you the product is also the one telling you how much to use. It's in their best interest to get people to use as much as possible and buy more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This, and also that they just don't wanna risk recommending too little and have people think their stuff doesn't work. Erring on the side of overindulgent caution is a win-win for them.</p>
<p>And this isn't some issue restricted only to cleaning products. Most things either recommend an unnecessarily large dose, or at least <em>shows</em> using too much in their ads even if they technically (and in very small text) recommend less. Have you ever looked at how little a recommended dose of toothpaste actually is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told something that blew my mind, because it hasn’t been described to me that way before - and it made perfect sense. Use an amount of detergent relative to the amount of water you’re going to fill the washer with, not the amount of clothing. Obviously, you also adjust water/loads size, but to then assess the volume of water - not the volume of clothing to determine how much detergent to use. My clothes have never felt better, are cleaner and I use less detergent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mainly my towels that come out crispy. I don't care about them like I do my clothes so for convenience, I'll often machine dry towels and linens while I hang the rest. The ritual of hanging clothes is nice too - especially outdoors, but indoors has its benefits too. It's very easy to dress or put away clothes from a drying rack. The mixed pile or basket from a machine... can stay that way for some time.</p>
<p>I've been experimenting with using less. I can't say I've had a load come out smelling unclean. More detergent can definitely leave them smelling more like soap, but also never had skin irritation. My data sucks though because I keep switching soaps and washing machines lately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do the same, actually! As far as I am aware, a more worn fabric - especially in the case of terrycloth, which all my bathroom towels are - also has better absorption. Since that is the main deal with towels I'm willing to sacrifice longevity for function. Another pro tip: Fabric softeners inhibit absorption, so never use it on towels.</p>
<p>Similarly, I've never ever pulled something out of the washer and have it smell bad. But I have on several occasions found white stains on my dark clothes, which is the powdered laundry detergent not being completely washed out. It goes away if you rinse them thoroughly, but the last thing I wanna do with fresh laundry is to hand wash it again.</p></div>		</li>
