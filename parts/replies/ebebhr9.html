			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I remember fighting my old college friends about this. They had math/classical music backgrounds and I was (then) tending towards anthropology. They would SWEAR that no, music (modern Western music) was mathematical and not subjective. They refused to think that our idea of what &quot;good&quot; music is could have been influenced by culture. </p>

<p>Daaaamn those arguments were frustrating...</p></div>		</li>

<p>But those conversations were really good at forcing me to clarify my thinking and be creative in debate. The biggest learning was figuring out how to tell when two people think they're arguing but actually agree on a basic principle (just not the lens through which to view it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. I think Jazz is a great example. Jazz used to be the go to pop music, and these days it's an acquired taste because pop is different now.</p>
<p>All music is an acquired taste, really. I think for the most part people enjoy music the most if it's similar to what they have been listening to. At the same time, if you initially hate something, whether it's metal, electronic, noise, classical, experimental and so on, you will probably eventually start loving it if you spend enough time listening. The more familiar you become with the vocabulary, the more it speaks to you.</p>
<p>Theory is a great way to deepen your relationship with music, whether you are listening or creating. But if you wanted to use theory alone to create something good, you would need to have a specific good you were aiming for, which at that point is no longer theory alone.</p>
<p>That all being said, as an artist, you could use theory over the course of a longer piece, say a full album or even an opera, to essentially train listeners to identify certain patterns as pleasurable. Maybe you start by presenting variations of something widely popular, and then present something new at a moment when you know listeners will invest a great deal of emotional value. Now the listener understands new vocabulary, and you can continue building from there.</p>
<p>Sorry if that last bit didn't make a lot of sense. It's like how when you solve a puzzle in Zelda, you hear a very specific musical cue. Later in the game when you're working on harder puzzles, you know you've done something right when you hear it, and it feels good.</p>
<p>Sorry for the wall of text, too. Just a fun topic to think about. Tl;dr: Theory describes and can be used to create, but music really is just good because we like it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This. I ended up acquiring a taste for drum n' bass by listening to a lot of it, trying to put my finger on what it is about that genre of music that rubbed me the wrong way. Ironically, it was only <em>after</em> acquiring this taste that it became clear to me what it is about DNB that I didn't like, and it had nothing to do inherently with the music itself: it was the culture of badassery surrounding the music. I learned the hard way to be very careful who I told I like this music, lest they make some very wrong assumptions about what they and I have in common (or don't have in common) value-wise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not <em>purely</em> subjective. There is art that's more skilled, deft, trained, complex, layered etc. </p>
<p>A good artist, in the paraphrased words of Miles Davis, will balance the predictable with the surprise, giving the listener enough that they're comfortable with so that they can throw in interesting surprises. A good musician will know the sophistication of their audience and play the right amount of surprises for them. </p>
<p>Whether you <em>like</em> it may feel personal, but a lot of likeability is craftable. For another example, the Beatles honed songwriting with the golden ratio (verse chorus verse chorus bridge verse chorus, with the bridge at the golden mean-point of the song). It doesn't matter if it's death metal, chamber pop, or dubstep, if you put the bridge 1.61 through the song, it'll be more accessible then if you don't; again, knowing your audience will inform your decision how closely to adhere to that rule, but no skilled songwriter can, in 2018 (or even 1978), ignore that rule. (The Beatles didn't invent that, they just perfected it.) </p>
<p>I don't mean that every listener will like the same thing, that's absurd. But an artist can intentionally increase or decrease the accessibility and likeability of their creation, as a that's part of what makes an artist good. </p>
<p>In summary, likeability is a craft, just like performance and technique, and you can use objective methods to increase it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>1.61 what? Minutes? Because if you just mean normal ratio, that wouldn't make much sense considering 1 would equal end of the song.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This - I don’t think people have really considered the fact that if it were PURELY subjective, they would have to agree that a toddlers scribbles are, in essence, no different in value than the Mona Lisa.  Or that a garage band of middle schoolers attempting to learn how to play together on $100 instruments has as much value as the deepest, most beautiful piece of music they’ve ever heard and connected with. Our brains have evolved to appreciate certain patterns, and as you point out, there are objective qualities that almost universally must be met for people to determine that a song is good.  Or to even recognize it as a song, for that matter.  If there were no objective criteria, the sound a bunch of pots and pans make while falling down / static on an old television / me banging my head on piano keys til I’m unconscious (from the frustration of this argument) could all be considered songs. And anyone who challenged that would be wrong, because hey. Purely subjective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Just no. This is a whole of bullcrap. This comment sounds oddly simmelar to that one Tedx talk of that guy who said music is about all surprizes. But actually it isn't. That guy was utterly wrong. Listen to this:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/0dtkfpTwDxU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/0dtkfpTwDxU</a></p>
<p>Does that sound good to you or not? I'd bet you wont like it, simply because it's very different and unusual. Now let me ask you this: How often have you heard your favorite song? Now, why would you dislike the example I've shown you, which is surprizing, but like your favorite song which has absolutely no surprizes because you know it in and out? The answer is simple: You are familiar with your favorite kind of music while you are unfamiliar with the song I showed you. Music builds alot on what already exists. It builds on culture and on previous songs. The artist has his own style which is dependand on his origins and the music he listens to. People take samples, the same sounds and chords from previous music and remix it to something new. People take old and new ideas and generate music from it.</p>
<p>The reason why you like certain music is solely because you are familiar with it's building blocks. If you follow an artist or band, you know what to expect. You may not know the theory behind it, but you instinctively know how music works, even if you cannot explain it. Your favorite band creates a certain sound, song structure, genre and a whole other stuff and while individual songs may sound differently, you are experienced in their style and are familiar with it and thus like new music that your favorite band produces.</p>
<p>There is no theory that explains good music and there is no trick or techique that makes good music. The only thing that makes good music good is how familiar you are with it. There is nothing that makes music objectively good. It is purely subjective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can sometimes calculate this, but it's in the frame of cultural context and more importantly, personal context. For example, resolution is often involved with those types of shiver moments, but if it's in a piece of music you just don't connect with personally in any way, it's unlikely to cause that reaction for you. I remember the first time I ever heard the muted guitar noise in Radiohead's &quot;Creep&quot;, or the rhythm that switches between the left and right headphone during build up at the end of Nine Inch Nails's &quot;Closer&quot;, I had massive chills but it had to do with the fact that it was rhythmically unexpected, no melody/chord resolution involved. On the flip side, I get chills for basically the entirety of the time I hear Miles Davis's &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; or Claude Debussy's &quot;Suite bergamasque&quot; because I listened to them during emotionally potent periods of my life. In that case, it doesn't even have to do with any specific musical attribute, it's just a catalyst for chills-inducing memories.</p></div>		</li>
