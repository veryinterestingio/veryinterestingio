			<div class="markdown"><p>In a electrical conductor you can do the same with low and high voltage like if you flip a switch and turn a lamp on and of.</p>
<p>In practice in faster protocols in electrical conductors you instead of on and off might might have multiple levels to increase throughput.  The levels might be negative and often you might send 10 bits on the wire for 8 bits of data in a way so the average is 0 so there is no DC current in the line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think that the guy you were responding to was talking about frequency multiplexing.  It sounds like they’re talking about using multiple voltages.</p>
<p>I’d be interested if they have an example of one.  For example, USB uses three voltages but there’s only two states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. It takes too long to turn on and off a light source. It is changes in brightness (either brighter or dimmer) that are measured as a 1 and equal brightness over 2 (or more) clock rates results in a zero. A clock rate is the time value assigned to 1 bit of data. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I understand this stuff at a high level, something I’ve never understood is how a processor or modem “separates” commands in the form of 1’s and 0’s to execute and push the data correctly. </p>
<p>If I’m coding in a high level language like python:</p>
<p>print(“hello world”); </p>
<p>That’s rather simple and I can understand how a computer can process that. </p>
<p>What I can’t understand is when billions of 1’s and 0’s are coming through my modem or processor for the web page I’m looking at, while my partner is watching Netflix, and not to mention all the background apps that are constantly running on each computer. How does it “separate” each command so seamlessly if a modem only receives only 1’s and 0’s. A telegraph uses “STOP” at the end of each line, how does a modem or processor know to “STOP” in order to properly differentiate and execute that chunk of data for the correct program or computer, as opposed to pushing that data to the incorrect program or computer. Does that make sense? (While I understand computers to some degree, I do well with building on ELI5 definitions)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, you need a clock for the data to make sense. Otherwise, if you had a sequence that had many 1s or 0s in a row, the computer wouldn't know how many bits corresponded to that time length of signal on/signal off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that how a signal is able to have consecutive 1s or 0s?  If a 1 equals “on” (for simplicity’s sake), then you couldn’t have two “on”s in a row without an “off” in between. So would the stop bit you mentioned basically reset the signal after the “on” info has been sent to a neutral setting? Sorry, that’s not worded the way my brain is thinking of this, but I think you get what I’m saying. </p></div>		</li>
