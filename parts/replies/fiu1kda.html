			<div class="markdown"><p>The best example is spicy food. A chemical (most commonly capsaicin) stimulates thermoreceptors (receptors that sense heat) and they send a signal to the brain that something is “hot.” Capsaicin does not necessarily stimulate other receptors that are responsible for sending other signals. </p>
<p>Another way to think about it is that you can’t hear with your eyes or see with your nose. There are specific types of receptors that are built to communicate different things to the brain. You can think of chemical sense, pain sense, temperature sense, etc. as different from each other the same way that sight, smell and hearing are different.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Why does spicy food give some people the runs? </p>
</li>
<li>Why would it be spicy on the way out, after it’s digested?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I understand the difference in setting off a receptor with one chemical vs another.  But mechanical sensors get activated by physical deformation.  So why doesn't a cut count as physical deformation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my GOD this sub is <em>not</em> for literal 5 year olds. It says that right in the sub guidelines. Even if that were the case, I explicitly explained what a nociceptor is! Also, it’s ‘sentence’, not ‘sentance’.</p></div>		</li>
