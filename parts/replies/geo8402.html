			<div class="markdown"><p>So how does an excercise differ for a marathon tunner and a body builder? Forgive me for my ignorance but marathon runners definitely get sufficient energy and protein and they train muscles by running, so how can they not trigger hypertrophy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So without getting into a long explanation, there are a lot of ways to train your muscles, hypertrophy is only one of them others include muscular endurance, maximum strength, power and so on.</p>
<p>Marathon runners train almost exclusively in muscular endurance, which does not produce hypertrophy, in fact the body cannibalizing it's own muscle mass is an issue that hardcore marathoners, especially among those who do ultra marathons, ironman competitions and the like.</p>
<p>Sprinters also train by running and tend to have more muscular bodies, because they train with a narrow focus on power and not endurance, which will produce more hypertrophy than extended endurance training.</p>
<p>Bodybuilders generally have terrible cardio and endurance because they train almost exclusively for hypertrophy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the ‘pump’ i think they call it where muscles swell and pop after intense workouts, why doesn’t the tongue do that after you give a speech or do something that overworks it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the &quot;pump&quot; is the leftover byproducts of a workout that have not yet normalized, which is why it is temporary. Increased blood flow as well, which continues for some time after a workout.</p>
<p>The reason a tongue doesn't get this is again because its not really the same sort of exercise for your tongue. Eating and talking isn't the equivalent of a weight lifting session for your tongue, it's the equivalent of getting up off the couch, which generally doesn't cause a &quot;pump&quot; even for the most unfit individual.</p>
<p>If your tongue got a &quot;pump&quot; you would be in danger of suffocation every time you ate or had a long conversation, presumably no species which evolved a tongue which did this would have survived more than a generation.</p></div>		</li>
