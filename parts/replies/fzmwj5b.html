			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely it will. Probably enough that it will sputter and ignite a little if combusted. Vacuum nozzles that fit on a tap are cheap, add a vacuum flask to it and problem solved quickly.</p>
<p>Works with other naphtha like solvents as well (hexane, etc.), though with those it's much, much better if you wash in an extraction flask first. Don't use charcoal unless you are looking for extreme purity though, it kills all the aromatics in a single wash.</p></div>		</li>
