			<div class="markdown"><p>The apparent change in the color of your iris is caused by how dilated your pupils are, because dilation causes the pigments in your iris to stretch or compress, changing their apparent color. Your mood and or how tired you are both effect the dilation of your pupils, therefore changing the color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eye color is based on the amount of melanin. People with less melanin in their eyes reflect a higher wavelength of light (blue). The more melanin the less light is reflected until you get to brown eyes where light can't escape as easily and appears to the human eye as brown-ish (melanin). Likewise this applies to green eyes. Whatever light is being reflected from the Iris is what the human eye will observe. For example if you are on a boat in the ocean, or in a dark room.</p></div>		</li>

The same effect that makes the sky look blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. But the scattering is dependent on the amount of melanin in the Iris</p></div>		</li>
