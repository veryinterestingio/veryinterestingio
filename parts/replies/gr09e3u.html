<p>Part of the problem with modern media is that scientific discovery used to go through a process of confirmation by independent scientific peers who critique and more importantly repeat many times experiments and observations.  This still happens but unfortunately for a variety of reasons new exciting discoveries are now widely and quickly spread often before they have been firmly confirmed and established - so yes gut bioflora does have amazing effects that we are discovering but we are still discovering and yes at times people (especially on social media and the press) hype up and sadly sometimes misinterpret the science</p></div>		</li>
