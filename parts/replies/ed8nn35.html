			<div class="markdown"><p>Dolphins, if I recall correctly, are also real jerks. They've been reported killing for fun; not in a &quot;let's go hunting even though we're not hungry&quot; way, but more of a &quot;let's play underwater volleyball with this animal until it stops moving&quot; kind of way. I also read somewhere that rape is common, and some believe that males killing infant dolphins is to make the mother available to breed again. </p>
<p>I can't say they're more cruel than humans, but they have their list unsavory habits. </p></div>		</li>
