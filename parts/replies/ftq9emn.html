			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even programming. It is most often just oversaturated with tasking.</p>
<p>For instance, I assume you are a fairly knowledgeable person and can do basic human tasks with ease. I ask you to tie to your shoes, it is no problem. I ask you to make a sandwich, no problem. I ask you stand up, turn around, clap three times, then sit back down; you'll be able to do it. Now, if i told you to do all of those at the exact same time, you are going to clap peanut butter into your shoelaces and make a mess of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like those little robots that follow steps. Turn right, go five feet. Pick that thing up. At some point something didn't go right. Maybe a tire slipped, maybe the thing didn't get picked up but now things are a little bit off and when you turn it off and turn it back on it starts over again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think &quot;bad&quot; is even the proper word. More like &quot;shit happens&quot;. A bit could get flipped randomly, ram and many other memory forms are not 100% stable, a slight power surge or dip that causes a &quot;hiccup&quot; in the processor, but doesn't outright shut it down. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The device itself is obviously fine, because if there was an actual issue, power cycling wouldn't do anything, its just so rare that there is an actual issue as opposed to something &quot;weird&quot; happening which is why power cycling fixes the issue 99% of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all fairness it can absolutely be due to software bugs. There are a ton of devices out there with garbage software but even good software will have corner cases that someone failed to anticipate and the system can get into a weird state and start failing. Physical data corruption is definitely always possible but I expect it's way more likely that the manufacturer cheaped out on their software/QA process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experience as a student cybersecurity, embedded systems &amp; software engineering, The issue hardly ever lies in the hardware. The kernel, the OS and the applications often have thousands, 10s of thousands, possibly even millions of bugs in them. Some don't matter much and are hardly ever noticed and some crash your entire system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Side note, the proper term is instructions, like you used. The collection of which instructions are which, is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings" target="_blank">instruction set</a>.</p></div>		</li>
