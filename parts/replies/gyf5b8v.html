			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it's <em>incredibly</em> common for enthusiastic new climbers to end up with finger injuries because they try and do too much too fast.</p>
<p>Things like fingerboards are phenomenal tools for training finger strength, but I would never recommend it to a beginner because they just won't have the baseline strength and conditioning required to do it safely.</p>
<p>Also there's evidence that specific low-impact exercises with well controlled rest does significantly more than max-weight pulls do. Rest is mad important for the ligaments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually just happened to me after a six-month, pandemic induced bouldering break.</p>
<p>Got back to the gym, had about two or three sessions of slow acclimation, and after that decided to try hard on a permanent route that I've done tens of times. I knew from the pop in my hand what was up. Fortunately it wasn't a complete tear, but I'm sidelined for at least three months now. Google &quot;trigger finger&quot; for fun pictures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's talking about what not to do or how to get injured, but what should you be doing to avoid injury and increase strength safely. I've always wanted to get into climbing and I've been looking at climbing gym memberships lately. I would've thought the best way to get better and stronger was to practice climbing. What should I do instead?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tendons have poor blood supply. Muscles are very well innervated, and have excellent blood supply, that's why mild cardio can be awesome for recovery from heavy lifting as it gets blood moving in and out of the affected muscles. Tendons just don't have the blood supply needed for fast recovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very low blood supply.  Muscles get a lot of blood supply, so repairs are easier for your body to do on them.  Tendons and ligaments are springy, stretchy material that doesn't have much blood supply to them, so injuries and repairs take a lot longer to work.</p>
<p>You can increase your general blood flow and that seems to help a little bit, and low impact/light weight work seems to help it build strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From when I first started climbing someone told me it takes about 3x as long to train your forearms for grip than it does other muscles for an appropriately difficult climb.</p>
<p>From my experiences that <em>feels</em> about right. You have to be super careful too as a finger injury can take you out for over month if it's particularly bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I spend time practicing specific guitar workouts that leave me with a similar feeling to a workout-if I’m working on something regularly I can definitely notice an increase in strength over about a week or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been using pickupmusic a lot recently-Justus West’s “how to play fast” was a really great workout!</p>
<p>Otherwise just focussing on specific elements like bending with my pinky or tremolo picking is good. Using a metronome is really good for pushing yourself too. I’ve tried a similar approach to working out where I’ll play x reps at one tempo, then rest, then go again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the guy you replied to, but one I do often is doing trills between all 4 fingers around the 5th or 7th fret, depending on how much stretching you want to do. Basically going finger 1 and 2 for X amount of measures, then 2 and 3, 3 and 4, then switch it up and do 1 and 3 and 2 and 4. Doing it to a metronome and focusing on making sure each note comes out clearly helps build a bit of strength and helps work on hammer on and pull off accuracy too.</p></div>		</li>
