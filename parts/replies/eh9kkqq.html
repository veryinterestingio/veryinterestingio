<p>An extra weirdness is that I'm right handed naturally. However, due to having a weak right eye, there are tasks I perform left handed and others for which I have no preference.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha :) Eating is one of things I have no preference for. </p>
<p>It wasn't something I noticed about myself naturally. I only realized it after so many people would ask why I was eating with the &quot;other&quot; hand (which would be my right or left hand depending on the specific instance).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s very interesting, and it clears up some of the curiosity I’ve had about how people with wonky eyes see things. Also, while we’re on the topic, I have a tendency to look people mainly in their left eye, and it throws me off when they’re not able to look at me with that eye. So not only do I have to remind myself to look at their good eye, I keep defaulting back to the bad one, and I worry they’re thinking I’m staring at their bad eye. Anyway, thanks for sharing</p></div>		</li>
