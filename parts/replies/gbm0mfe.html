			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it is more efficient to target the source. The animals are the carriers of the disease, and it is cost-effective to vaccinate a few thousand cows than millions. It hinders the spread of a Salmonella reducing costs in the healthcare area , and that money can be used for disease prevention too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I recall the salmonella vaccine doesn't last that long.  You're supposed to get it re-administered every few years.  Don't think people would like that. Typhim vaccine says re-administer every 2 years in people at risk for salmonella</p></div>		</li>
