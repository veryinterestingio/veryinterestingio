			<div class="markdown"><p>Canada recently (probably a few years ago) revamped their food guide to not include dairy products as an “essential food group”.</p>
<p>Apparently it ended up on there because of intense lobbying by the DAIRY FARMERS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US they said you needed something like 7+ servings of grains per day...</p>
<p>Like I don’t think, in a modern non-heavy labor world you even need any.  I routinely eat no processed grains in a day and I am not trying to do Keto/Gluten free, just trying to keep my calories down.  Way easier to cut out bread/cereal/etc than to cut out meat and such.</p>
<p>I also consume almost no milk directly, though I do love cheese and occasional ice cream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah! There's a reason plant-milk producers aren't really allowed to call their stuff &quot;milk&quot;, but &quot;oat drink&quot; and I honestly don't think it's about true labeling of foods... The dairy industry is right up there with big pharma and the Coke/pepsi war. It's interesting that it seems even stronger than the meat industry, because people are still allowed to name stuff &quot;plant burger&quot; or &quot;soy sausage&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Milk” is a protected label. If you call something “oat milk”, then a lot of people could mistake it for dairy milk with added oats.</p>
<p>Its the same reason they arent allowed to call meat substitutes “plant meat”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s common both on reddit and in America to want everything to be based on lobbying and stuff and that’s partially true. The strong dairy industry was and is important to America.</p>
<p>BUT, milk is one of the only products that contains the 9 essential amino acids. This means a glass of milk can provide fat and protein making it a great calorie dense choice. Nowadays we don’t generally need or want calorie dense foods, but for families that don’t have much to eat a glass of milk can provide children with a good number of nutrients.</p>
<p>Edit also so I’m clear it is certainly not essential</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah milk is an absurdly nutrient dense food. It's not essential for survival in any way but its extremely useful. Especially in poor countries where enough food can be scarce, 1 milk source can provide dense calories and essential nutrients to supplement food insecurity</p></div>		</li>
