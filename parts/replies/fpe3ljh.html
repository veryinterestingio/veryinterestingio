			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the lion's share of why glass dries faster. </p>
<p>Glass holds heat a lot better than plastic, but not enough to make it dry by the time you open the dishwasher. It takes an almost unbelievable amount of heat to evaporate water. If as much water dried off of glass as the amount still stuck to your plastic dishes, it would be cold to the touch by the time it dried. Not just cool, but genuinely cold, for anything thinner than a mason jar.</p></div>		</li>
