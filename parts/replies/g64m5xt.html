			<div class="markdown"><p>If your shopping for beef for that days dinner, buy the beef starting to brown. </p>
<p>It will be tossed @ the end of the day as being unsellable, however it it the tenderest meat in the case.</p>
<p>It still has 2 or 3 days shelf life if refrigerated and will cook to a tender steak, like warm butter tender.</p>
<p>Aged steak is the best buy at the meat counter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Meanwhile, your average beef cow is kept out on the grasslands. Grass = cheap.</p>

<p>Idk most cows can barely move and are fattened up significantly with grain/corn in CAFOs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily true.</p>
<p>Many pastures (mine included for my horses) are seeded with a high quality grass  designed to bulk up your herd with quality meat.</p>
<p>Add corn feed and you have some of the best beef in the world coming right out of America's midwest.</p></div>		</li>
