			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important issue. i feel that we should take concerns with algorithms and AI seriously but we should recognize that it's often better than the alternative. For example, in my book A Human's Guide to Machine Intelligence, I say that:</p>
<p>&quot;the biggest cause for concern, in my opinion, is not that algorithms have biases –humans do, too, and on average, well-designed algorithms are less biased – but that we are more susceptible to biases in algorithms than in humans. ... because algorithms deployed by large tech platforms like Google and Facebook instantaneously touch billions of people, the scale of their impact exceeds any damage that can be caused by biases introduced by human decision-makers.&quot;</p>
<p>Meaning that a biased judge might affect the lives of (say) 500 people but a biased algorithm used to guide sentencing decisions of judges all over the US will affect the lives of several hundred thousands of people. So I believe we should raise the bar a bit more for algos than for humans. When deploying them in socially critical settings, subject them to an audit by a team other than the one that built the AI. Then deploy them. </p>
<p>While I say we should raise the bar, I am against some fear mongering going on. In fact, in an article, I argued that &quot;I would argue that it’s not acceptable to reject today’s AI due to perceived ethical issues. Why? Ironically, I believe it might be unethical to do so. At its core, there is a “meta ethics” issue here. How can we advocate halting the deployment of a technology solely because of a small chance of failure, when we know that AI technologies harnessed today could definitely save millions of people?&quot;</p>
