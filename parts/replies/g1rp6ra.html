			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just noticing some interesting stuff about NE-US! Western CT fits your theory nicely whereas southern NYS is very different. The Hudson valley is rocky and has some sparse pine trees. By comparison, CT has humid soil and much more undergrowth.
My theory is that the Hudson valley was largely logged at some point and topsoil runoff changed the soil composition. Trees of a certain critical mass can pull nutrients from large root systems but small plants have trouble getting started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who lives in the Hudson Valley, the variety of forests we have is always somewhat impressive. For example the neighborhood I live in is dense old growth packed with hardwood and virtually no undergrowth. However, about five minutes away in my grandpas neighborhood the forest is mainly softwood (mainly cedar) with and incredibly dense undergrowth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really?  I'm in the northeast (Adirondacks) and the forests are so thick you can't even walk through them.  I had to bushwhack for a couple hours about a month ago and I literally had to crawl under most of it as it was impossible to push through.  I don't remember it being like this as a kid...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Adirondacks have a lower density of deer than most other regions in NYS. But there is a noticeable gradient (in my experience) from north to south and especially toward the blueline where undergrowth really diminishes, and that correlates with deer density but also a shift in the forest communities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in the NE US</p>
<p>Slightly off-topic, but have you noticed more wildlife over the past few years? I'm wondering whether they're just coming deeper into the city or it's actually some kind of population boom</p>
<p>Especially predatory birds. I went decades without really seeing any and now I'm seeing them everywhere. Hawks/falcons galore, a couple of bald eagles, and even some owls</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The return of bald eagles is due to restrictions on ddt pesticide, they cause eagles to have thin eggs resulting in fewer chicks, im not sure if this also carries over to other raptor species</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say there's definitely some more wildlife. Not as crazy as it was when hunting was banned and you'd have deer kamikaze into houses out of hunger.</p>
