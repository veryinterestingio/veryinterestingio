			<div class="markdown"><p>Wonderful question! Something I've thought about doing myself... I would say if you were really serious, it's time to start collecting gobs of tree resin! Tree resin is wonderful at keeping oxygen, bacteria, and other agents of decomposition off a carcass. Through time, tree resin will harden (called amber), trapping the carcass inside. So, sure, we could talk different about a variety of other settings to bury yourself in that are more similar to a bulk of the fossil record; but if you are serious about being preserved - grab a 50 gallon drum and head to the forest!</p></div>		</li>
