			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that platypuses and other monotremes still have a true cloaca, whereas most of the remaining mammals (marsupials and placentals) have the separate digestive vs urinary tract openings that we may be used to seeing. Sometime in the past (likely about 66 million years ago), our placental ancestors split from the monotremes and developed the different openings that most mammals have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be knowledgable:</p>
<p>&quot;Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with faeces as a semisolid waste.&quot; -Wikipedia</p>
<p>Why is the ostrich special? What is it doing differently?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the ostrich is flightless, it is subject to many of the same evolutionary constraints that apply to mammals. There isn’t the same evolutionary pressure to control excretions in birds that can fly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>precise excretory control (i.e. urinate or defecate purposefully to reduce predation).</p>

<p>Also to signal to others of the same species.  Scent marking with urine is very widespread among mammals, although there's no way to know if the need for more effective scent marking drove this adaptation in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
