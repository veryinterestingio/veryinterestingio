			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, while correct, the answer is incomplete.</p>
<p>When you move your hand up to your mouth, the air hitting it comes directly from your exhale.
Further away, the air hitting your hand is a mix of your breath and the air between your mouth and hand - which is significantly cooler.</p>
<p>The further you go the colder the jet will be because the heat from your breathe disperses and dilutes more.</p>
<p>The slower haa flow, on the other hand  doesnt mix as harshly with the air (it pushes it away more, mixes with it less). This mode of flow preserves its temperature for longer than the hoo.</p>
<p>Both this and the convection effect factor into the final &quot;temperature&quot; you're sensing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shape of your lips also enables the breath to travel faster. It's not just the throat. You can make cool air with the &quot;haa&quot; sound as well if you purse your lips and say it hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your lips certainly can change the fluid dynamics of the air. I would argue your mouth and lips are probably the only thing that significant change the velocity of the air coming out, aside from the effort of exhaling. If the volume of air exiting your mouth is the same, tighter lips will increase the velocity because it's the same number of particles moving through a tighter space (higher pressure). </p>
<p>I'm sure something in Bernoulli's principle covers this. It's fluid dynamics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious about a secondary cause and would like your opinion.</p>
<p>By creating a small aperture with your lips there's a pressure difference between your mouth an atmosphere. Could the expanding of your breath as it moves to atmosphere contribute to the cooling or is it such a small change that it's negligible? Or am I just completely wrong on this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expansion is negligible because of atmospheric convection.  Air flow is what people are experiencing.  If expansion was that impactful, your would freeze your hands in winter blowing on them to get warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You will often see this principal illustrated with an ideal gas in a chamber. As the chamber is made larger, the gas expands, and the temperature drops. The temperature drops because the gas pushes on the chamber walls and does work on them as they move (work = force x distance). The energy to perform this work must come from the gas, this loss of energy from the gas results in a reduction of temperature.</p>
<p>But, in our blowing example, there are no moving parts, the air being blown does not perform any work. There is therefore no reduction in temperature. The gas follows the ideal gas equation (P*V = n*R*T) where the volume simply goes up to offset the reduction in pressure.</p>
<p>But, you may say, &quot;What about propane tank regulators that get cold? What about refrigeration cycles?&quot; These are both examples of <strong>evaporating liquids</strong>. When a liquid evaporates, it needs additional energy to facilitate the phase change and it will pull energy from its surroundings. This is an entirely different phenomenon that applied only when there is a phase change.</p>
<p>One final nuance possibly worth noting is that there can be a phase change associated with a single constituent within a gas mixture. Swamp Coolers that use evaporative cooling are an example of this.</p>
<p>Edit: In anticipation of being corrected, I must state that ambient air is not 100% an idea gas, therefore the Joule-Thomson effect will cause some temperature drop. But air at standard conditions (1 atmosphere and 25°C) is 99.99% ideal. So the Joule-Thomson effect is negligible.</p></div>		</li>
