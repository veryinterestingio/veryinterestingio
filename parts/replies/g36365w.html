			<div class="markdown"><p>We had Skodas in Canada back in the eighties, did not have the best reputation, they were basically sold alongside Ladas as the cheapest, basic transportation available.  I knew a girl who had one in high school, it was a bit bizarre, I think it was a compact four- door rear engine vehicle.  It was different but we had fun with it, when it was working.  They basically disappeared from the market once Hyundai entered and displaced them.</p>
<p>How are they now?  Can I assume they've come far?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skoda is now (still, since the 90s I think) owned by VW, it's basically positioned as the Smart and Economical brand in the VW family - a little under VW itself, which is under Audi and so on.</p>
<p>Arguably a bit above Seat which is the &quot;sexy Latino&quot; of the bunch</p>
<p>in any case quality is on par with most European manufacturers, a lot of Octavias are used as Taxis thanks to a huge trunk and probably reliable</p>
<p>Here in Israel I think government ministers get a Skoda Superb which is quite nice</p>
<p>I myself thoroughly enjoy my Mazda CX30</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are entirely different cars now. Only the brand remained. They’re owned by Volkswagen/Audi and the cars are basically like VW cars, except cheaper and/or more spacious than their VW equivalent cars in the same segments (and less prestigious). The same technology, engines, platforms, electronic systems, etc.</p></div>		</li>
