			<div class="markdown"><p>The mountain pine beetle has an impact in B.C.  There are lots of dead trees around and it doesn’t take much to get them burning. I’m not an expert by any stretch, but there are lots of articles out there.

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister is an entomologist with Alberta environment, but also involved in bc to an extent. The massive fires we are seeing is hugely aided by the pine beetle. Dry, dead forests that take as simple as a lightning strike to erupt. Though populations of the beetle are declining, these fires pave the way for fresh growth. Hopefully these massive fires start to see a decline as the dead areas start fresh. Every year fire season is worse than the last. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Bark beetles, which have proliferated due to...you guessed it...warmer temperatures and specifically, winters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh fuck, this is awkward. My dad is one of the main researchers(?) when it comes to tracking mountain pine beetles. He's been all over BC, The territories and Alberta covering it. Weird as fuck to see people talking directly about what he does, and even weirder to see his co workers names in articles you referenced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add Montana to that list, too.  Hell, we have a 24k acre fire that's only barely contained and we're <em>still</em> sending teams to help California.  Smokejumpers originated partially from Montana, too.  The Mann Gulch Fire in 1949 actually directly lead to fire suppression being reconsidered as the primary method of forestry conservation, as well as the 1988 Yellowstone Fires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can also confirm.  Had AQI's north of 450 several days this summer.   For reference, the AQI scale stops at 500.</p></div>		</li>
