			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I always assumed this was just slick marketing on the cup-stackers' part. I don't buy that this is better for hand-eye coordination than any other PE activity, or other random competition. The people who made it got school districts to purchase _cups_ at a ridiculous markup for the brand (and, of course, for the aerodynamic holes in the bottom)</p>
<p>&quot;I'll dump out these crayons and the first person to arrange them in order of color is the most athletic in class!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one said it is better, it's just good for entertaining a large group with a smaller space. Also, my PE teacher got cups from Wal-Mart... I am a teacher, and I have never, ever seen a sales pitch at our school. Minus the chocolate bar fundraiser, when they're showing the kids all the cool prizes they could win.</p>
<p>What are some activities you would suggest to replace the hand-eye coordination, space, cost, and dexterity skills?</p></div>		</li>
