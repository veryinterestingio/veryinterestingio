			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they select a queen?? Is it just a big bee out of all? And why do they have to keep it warm, why can't they just abandon it? I mean, is it all programmed in their DNA to do this?or any other explanation? Everything i read in this thread is fascinating to me, my mouth is just wide open of the facts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They create a queen by feeding a larva bee royal jelly! Worker bees (females) can lay eggs without mating, but the eggs will only hatch into drones (males). Only the inseminated queen bee can lay eggs that turn into worker bees! If the queen died and only worker bees started laying eggs, the hive would fill up with drones (who never leave the hive to collect pollen/nectar) and everyone would starve! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually in most species workers lack the developed ovaries to produce eggs. All larva are fed royal jelly, but after about 3 days when all the jelly is gone normal worker or drove larva are switched to straight honey, The queen larva is fed nothing but royal jelly for the entirety of her larval stage. It is believed that the straight royal jelly diet it what allows for the fully developed ovaries</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is no queen (old ones fly off to start new hives) the workers will feed one baby royal jelly only (looks like snot) and no honey.  She will turn into the next queen.  After flying out to mate and return  she'll smell different and the workers feed her and keep her warm while she lays eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's...awesome. how did they know to do all this? They just know it or is it trial and error method that every species do? I'm kinda sounding stupid may be, but I'm so curious to know this stuff, or you could point me in any direction so i could just read mind boggling facts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't just feed one baby there are many. When hive gets too over populated and ready to swarm the current queen will build special wax cells called queen cups. The queen cups are needed because a queen is much bigger then a worker and can't develop in a normal cell. If a Queen dies before making any queen cups the hive is doomed with out human intervention. The worker then feed the new larvae on a diet of pure royal jelly.  </p>
<p>When the first new &quot;Virgin&quot; queen emerges she will open other queen cups and kill the developing queen that's inside, as a queen's stinger is not barbed she can sting as many times as she wants. In some cases if more then one virgin queen emerges the worker will keep them from fighting until after the swarm has found a new home. </p></div>		</li>
