<p>Its the same thing that happens in a battery, just inside our body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sue which process you're refering to, could you be a bit more specific? In wires the atoms of copper that act as a conductor are not moving, no, only the electrons are moving from atom to atom to generate current. In your body however the atoms very much are moving from place to place via methods such as sodium and potassium pumps and channels. Batteries are more complicated but my understanding is that yes, electrons are simply moving from an area of high potential to an area of low potential, and the atoms are not moving.</p></div>		</li>
