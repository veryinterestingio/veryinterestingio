			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in the auto industry on the software side and this is the most accurate answer I've seen so far. Realistically if we wanted to do this without the car randomly loading the battery itself to test, we could design a feature that checks cranking amps during normal startup and compares it to an experimental value that is near the operating limit, but this isn't done because if the operator is requesting a startup they are probably in the vehicle, minus remote start. and if the turnover feels/sounds sluggish, then your battery is probably getting old and is ready to be replaced soon. It's easily implemented to check but very near the bottom of features that sell a car. When we're working on a new program, so often do we scrap a feature I think is awesome simply because market research says it's not worth the money.</p></div>		</li>

One thing that I thought was cool that got nixed was a free service to provide slippage/drifting data (anonymous) to cities so they could identify their most dangerous roads/roads needing resurfacing/roads that got slippery when wet or snowed on. </p>
<p>People often don‚Äôt realise that EVERYTHING in a modern car is available via metrics. It might not be stored on board for very long due to the insane volumes but there‚Äôs telemetry for anything you can imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my thought, why not have the computer check the power under regular starting load and if it is marginal set a warning on the multipurpose display like it does for oil life. I get it's not a critical selling point but it seems so simple to implement and would save in warranty work at the dealership.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My car actually did this accidentally. When my battery was near dying, starting it in cold weather would cause a race condition where it would self-test the airbag system while it was still cranking, decide the voltage was too low, shut it off and throw on a warning light until I restarted the engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like for oil, cars have service intervals anyways. If you follow those it really shouldn't matter. You don't need to be able to test the battery because the car company already had a set time where they think the better would most likely be working then you should replace after.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>How so? It's likely going to have to be replaced anyways, and if it's covered by the warranty then it would be covered no matter who discovered the battery was dead/dying. If it's not covered by warranty it's also a reason for the customer to take the car in to the dealer and possibly be upsold on more (preferably necessary) work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. And u/theluckydom touched on this. I expect this is something that could be done, but there would be a lot of environmental variables (ambient temp, engine temp, oil viscosity, etc) that would affect the load and thus affect the voltage drop. In other words, without software knowing with some degree of certainty the ‚Äúamount‚Äù of load, it would be though to know whether the measured voltage drop could correctly indicate battery health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't an average over time effectively negate those variables? And if not, you still have advanced warning of SOME problem. A lot of mid range cars can get the name of the road I'm on, The local temp isnt a far jump. Most can pull date/time and see what season it is. Engine temp is already measured as well. Even on lower end cars, a rolling average of the last dozen starts would likely suffice</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems redundant. If you have enough voltage and amps to start the car, the car would start, and the circuit would read what the alternator is pushing out. If it doesn't have enough juice, it won't start at all. Why do you need an extra thing to read the circuit when the starter is used, when the outcome is pretty telling of what you want to measure in simple terms such as the engine starting or not.</p></div>		</li>
