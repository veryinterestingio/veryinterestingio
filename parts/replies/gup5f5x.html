			<div class="markdown"><p>The new Lost in Space did as well. A character had to do an exposed EVA for about 30 seconds to move from one place to another and survived just fine. Not great on the blood vessels, eyes and lungs though. Short term damage, nothing permanent. Definitely didn't turn to a popsicle or have their lungs blow out their brains in 5 seconds flar.</p></div>		</li>
