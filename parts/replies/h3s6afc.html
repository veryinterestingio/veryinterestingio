			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also &quot;fingerprint&quot; scanners now that don't actually read your prints, they use that crazy near-infrared vein imaging technology to read the pattern of blood vessels under the pad of your finger - it's called &quot;finger vein authentication&quot; if you want to read on it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use the VP-II X from TechSphere. It scans the vascular pattern on the back of your hands.</p>
<p>According to their research (or research they have referenced), vascular patterns on the back of your hand are in the same tier as fingerprints, only easier to read because there is no oil on the back of your hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if that's a great system. The veins on the back of my hands move around. I've got a couple that go over the tendons, and when I move my fingers, the veins move to one side or the other. I wonder if that scanner will be able to recognize my vein pattern even if it moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a TED talk about a group that was using new forensic techniques to catch child molesters. One of the examples was a girl who set up a night-vision (infrared) webcam to catch her step-father coming into her room at night. They had a clear view of his arm and the veins made a distinct dark pattern in the infrared light that they were able to match to a later scan of his arm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey. My PhD in studying the genetics of retinal vascularization finally comes in handy!</p>
<p>Um... Y'know, I'm actually not sure.</p>
<p>I can tell you that the science of the genetics of retinal vascularization is pretty unpredictable in general. Most of the phenotypic features we're able to measure and capture are related measures like vascular density, twistyness (tortuosity), and rough zones of where vascular features appear.</p>
<p>I can say that there are broad features like pigmentation that are definitely more similar between parents and offspring, but mostly I'm unaware of a specific study about retinal similarity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the group I worked with was unable to find good genetic evidence of retinal vascular disease for extreme cases. I did a cursory search for other papers related to this and came up empty, too. So I think it's a good though that's probably not super well investigated yet!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also hand vein scanners that do the same with the back of your hand. Slightly more comfortable than holding your eye up to a machine.</p></div>		</li>
