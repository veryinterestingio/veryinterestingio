			<div class="markdown"><p>it has <em>some</em> hydrogen, but only trace amounts. not nearly enough to convert significant amounts of the atmosphere to water. this would be a MASSIVE amount of hydrogen though, and the energy required to bring it to Venus and add it to the atmosphere would be mind boggling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about blasting the atmosphere away? What if we got lucky enough to find an asteroid almost heading toward venus and, instead of launching probes to move it into our orbit for examination (a plan that already exists, iirc), we used a probe to nudge it into Venus?</p>
<p>Could we possibly change the trajectory of an asteroid large enough to scatter Venus' atmosphere? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>James Pollack and Carl Sagan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming_of_Venus#Direct_removal_of_atmosphere" target="_blank">calculated that it was possible to do this</a>, but that it would require 2,000 impacts with asteroids that were each 700km in diameter.  Afterwards you'd presumably need to wait a few thousand years for the planet to cool down since it would now be an ocean of magma with a superheated rock atmosphere from the massive bombardment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For combustion you need an oxidiser and fuel. Venusian atmosphere is made of carbon dioxide - which is a combustion product. You can think of the atmosphere of Venus as essentially exhaust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A number of things had been proposed. One fun one was to blast the atmosphere off with mass drivers. This was before we actually knew how dense the atmosphere was. That plan went from taking theoretically decades after we had the ability to start it, to taking millenia if at all. Another solution was to introduce bacteria that would disolve it somewhat. It would still take a long time and be somewhat of an irreversable step that we'd have no way of predicting the effect. Besides, what they digest has to go somewhere. It's just too dense. More than we imagined. Once that fact hit, terraforming plans went from fringe science to practically scifi. The interesting thing is, it's so dense that we could potentially float cities on it. It's more on the fringe than mars terraforming, but less than venutian terraforming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way one might eliminate the atmosphere of Venus might be to install sufficient solar shades at the Venus-Sun L1 point that the planet receives next to no solar radiation and the atmosphere precipitates onto the surface as snow and dry ice, where it could then be strip-mined and shipped off the now-airless surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in Kim Stanley Robinson's 2312 they have factories that use solar power to condence a lot of the atmosphere out and then bury it.  This is combined with the use of a sun shield to reduce the amount of solar radiation hitting the planet.  A scifi novel, to be sure, but an interesting take.  Kind of like carbon sequestration on Earth but on serious steroids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did not realize that it was that dense. I always thought that we might be able to refine most of it into fuel and water. The fuel would be used to power the refineries. The water would transmit heat into space and gradually rain down on the surface as it cooled. I guess that isn't feasible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There may be someway in the future, but as far as we are in technology, it just seems easier to work with Mars. Maybe a combination of these solutions, or we could find a way to scale them up. It's not a totally abandoned idea, it just gets less attention.</p></div>		</li>
