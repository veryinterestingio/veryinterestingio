			<div class="markdown"><p>It‚Äôs actually about 5 laps aka cycles, and a full lap looks like this:
N1 stage-&gt;N2 stage-&gt;N3 stage-&gt;N2 stage-&gt; REM sleep -&gt; N1 stage </p>
<p>N1-N3 stages are non REM(rapid eye movement) sleep, this means you have some cognitive consciousness before falling into deep sleep..</p>
<p>REM sleep is deep sleep.. it‚Äôs also the one that your mind has the most dreams.. waking up post-REM sleep after 5 cycles is the most ideal for the average human to feel rested so about 7-8 hours for adults.</p>
<p>Interestingly, waking up post-REM cycle also increases your chances of remembering your dreams.. Being so, I like to think that if I remember my dreams, then I should feel well rested if near the 7-8 hour mark.</p></div>		</li>
