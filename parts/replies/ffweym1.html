			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, though the LHC didn't discover those. They're called quarks, and they make up protons and neutrons. They were discovered in 1968.</p>
<p>The big thing the LHC was looking for and found was the Higgs boson.</p>
<p>You know how magnets attract or repel each other, and how gravity makes mass attract other mass, right? Those are caused by two different fields that affect things in the universe (the electromagnetic field and the gravitational field).</p>
<p>Well, if you think about it, how does mass itself work? The big thing about mass is that it takes a force to move it: you have to push harder to move something the heavier (more massive) it is. And stuff can't travel faster than the speed of light. What does this? There has to be some &quot;force&quot; that makes stuff that isn't moving want to stay put and resist motion.</p>
<p>That thing is the Higgs field, which is a field but for mass. And it's everywhere in the universe, which is why everything that has mass, well, behaves like it has mass. Stuff that interacts with the field has mass (like atoms) and stuff that passes right through doesn't (like light). It's like a sea of goop that stuff has to wade through to move, which slows it down. That was the idea anyway, nobody knew if it was correct.</p>
<p>But the thing about fields is that due to the way they work, they come along with particles. If you put enough energy in the same place, out can pop a particle that is related to the field. And so there was this theory that there must be a Higgs boson (particle) that is associated with the Higgs field. By smashing stuff together with a ton of energy, the LHC managed to find it and show that the theory was correct.</p>
<p>Edit: clarified phrasing a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So do the particles themselves ever exist in nature?  What does the particle do?  </p>
<p>Also in that doc on Netflix that came out way back they said something along the lines of &quot;if the particle is at <em>this</em> energy it means there's one universe and if it's at <em>this other</em> energy it means that there are infinite parallel universe (or something)&quot;, and then the particle was discovered like half way between those energies.  What does that mean?  How much of that is just pseudoscientific garbage they made up for the doc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No idea how to explain this how you would explain it to a five year old but here we go.</p>
<p>Protons and neoutrons consist of 3 different kvarks (or however you spell it in english). These even smaller legobricks are called up, down, charm, strange, truth/top , beauty/bottom</p>
<p>A proton has 2 ups and a down which results it being positive as up is 2/3 e and down is -1/3 e</p>
<p>Neutron is neutral as it has 1 up and 2 dows so it's 0 e.</p>
<p>Electron is a lepton (no idea is it spelt like that) and there are also 6 of those.</p>
<p>These 12 are the standard particles (if someone knows these in english please correct me)
Which are the base for particle physics and the standard model.</p>
<p>There are some other particles such as foton glyon etc. But I'm not educated enough to talk about those.</p>
<p>Excuse the terms that might be wrong as I haven't studied physics in English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, for not knowing the terms in English, they were all pretty good. It would be quarks in English and we call them up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom. I've never heard top and bottom called truth and beauty before, I suppose other languages may refer to them differently. And the spellings are photon and gluon. Lepton was correct.</p></div>		</li>
