			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think birth control is the biggest priority given the typical indication for activated charcoal is drug overdose, typically requiring hospitalization. Also charcoal is only given once, which is immediately after ingesting the overdosed drug. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your right for when it’s indicated in a drug overdose. They definitely wouldn’t be concerned about something like birth control in that case. </p>
<p>I was referring to the fad of using activated charcoal in drinks or food to “remove toxins” or because their a cool color like charcoal ice cream. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that necessarily classifies it as harmful. Kind of like saying eating a tub of ice cream every day is harmful. It's really just people not researching the mechanisms of what they're putting into their body.</p>
<p>As far as reducing your ability to absorb vitamin C/B, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-4557.2004.tb00647.x" target="_blank">as well as biotin and niacin</a>, the charcoal will only grab those molecules (as well as just about everything else in it's path) until it's completely saturated (doesn't take long) - at which point, the effect ends. But it's mechanism doesn't change something physiologically in your body that makes your body unable to absorb nutrients or other medications. If you're concerned about your body not absorbing vitamins/minerals or even other medications because of activated charcoal, you just need to wait an hour or two between when you eat and take your charcoal. Even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11139541" target="_blank">this study</a> done on 11 women to observe the effects of activated charcoal and birth control showed no correlation between it's use and &quot;follicular activity&quot; when they took 5g of activated charcoal 4 times a day, but starting 3 hours after they took their birth control.</p>
<p>Medications frequently interact with one another and that's why doctors and pharmacists exist to watch out for those potential interactions and weigh the risks for you (or at least warn you of side effects). The problem is that supplements aren't regulated and can just be bought off the shelf with all kinds of &quot;promises&quot; but &quot;Sally's sister's cousin's mom's friend said that this natural remedy takes care of <em>this</em>&quot; isn't a reliable source for what/how/why that supplement actually does what it does, and how it may interact with your body and other medications you're taking. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, always ask your doctors, folks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But at the end of the day eating a tub of ice cream every day is harmful. Not everyone has the desire and/or capability of being an amateur dietician. &quot;So just don't consume activated charcoal [unless] you really need too.&quot;, is completely valid advice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't the question at hand become, who decided that you really need to take it though?</p>
<p>If it was a doctor (as OP suggested), they'd tell you how to take it safely. If it's just some random person, then you should probably consider a better source or do some serious research.</p></div>		</li>
