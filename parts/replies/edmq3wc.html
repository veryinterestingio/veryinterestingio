			<div class="markdown"><p>SUre that there is a link between isolated melanin aggregation and hormones? </p>
<p>Especially East Asian women have very dark nipples, even though small breasts and the same goes for men as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Following up on that - nipples <em>may</em> have an evolutionary reason to be a different colour than the surrounding area as they are a source of vital nutrients for infant mammals feeding via their mothers. Following this logic, it would make sense that they are clearly differentiated for ease of spotting visually. Note that this is something I've heard conjectured and isn't necessarily proven, but I thought it made sense.</p>
<p>Pregnancy tends to darken nipples, at least in female humans, which is theorized to be from the large change in hormone production during this time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting!</p>
<p>But if that was the case, wouldn't it be found in other mammals that have litters, like cats and dogs? IIRC their nipples are basically the same color as the rest, and don't really have areaolas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats and dogs are born with their eyes still closed as they're still developing. (This is why it's important to not force them open: you can cause permanent damage including total blindness if you do.) A difference in color wouldn't help them find the nipple. By the time they open their eyes, they know how to find mom through smell and how to find the nipple by feel.</p></div>		</li>
