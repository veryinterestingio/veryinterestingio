There is a nearby hot water spring which could heat up a bunch of houses in the winter, but we can only use heat pumps which use the surrounding air, it is illegal to use the hot water which is just flowing into the river...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you can use them here too, but specifically using the spring water for it is forbidden. You can drill holes, but that is quickly very expensive.</p>
