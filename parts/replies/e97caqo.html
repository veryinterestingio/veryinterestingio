<p>Quantitative IR is gaining some steam for dosage testing -- tons faster than chromatography</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why can't you do IR on the finished product? Surely it's fairly constant too. We can do NMRs of mixtures so IR seems fairly straightforward </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for answering! In quantitative IR, is it via ATR techniques since the drug is more likely to be a solid sample? I can't imagine it would be productive to be dissolving large quantities of samples in dichloromethane </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How well distributed is the active ingredient within a given tablet that has filler or another much bulkier ingredient like acetaminophen?</p>
<p>I take Percocet occasionally (5/325) and will often split the pills in half to gain a lower dose and stretch the prescription.  My impression is that there is some variance in how much oxycodone I get in a split pill, even though I use a widget that splits it very evenly. </p>
<p>I’m conflicted about this.  Logic suggests that the mixture is made in bulk to very high standards of uniformity.  But I also wonder that if the target pill has a large volume that the homogeneity target maybe be at the pill’s volumetric scale, and that variance within the individual pill is tolerated because they expect the entire pill to be used at once. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a pill is scored and intended to be split, the uniformity is such that each half or quarter will meet the intended dosage (100mg, each half delivers 50mg +/- 2% for example). </p>
<p>If the drug is not scored and you're splitting it, then this detail was never validated and you risk getting nonuniform dosages. </p>
<p>Often the dosage uniform is checked in samples of the unpressed mixture (the blended powder mix of all ingredients) before being pressed into tablets. Then the tablets are checked as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a standard tablet. 99% likely yes.<br />
If it wasnt a large uniform mixture it would be almost impossible to have each tablet correct.<br />
Most tablets esentially are Mix everything together uniformly and then press into tablets.<br />
Some will even have breaklines to allow for splitting. it is often to ease swallowing also.<br />
In this scenario the concentration will be uniform.<br />
There is content uniformity tests for some products which tests tablets compared to each other for assay (closeness to 25mg or whatever ot says).<br />
Generally this test is as per other commenter - when the tablet is meant to be broken up.<br />
If the assay was 98% the ideal result for the cu is actually to show all tablets are 97-99% or evenly distributed. You dont want 98, 102, 97, 103% etc.
If the tablets are comparable with low range, then the mixture is very uniform and consequently it could be argued the tablet is uniform throughout also.   </p>
<p>Other tablets can be different. Some are bilayer or trilayered. Esentially 2 or 3 different layers are put together and compressed. Iv even discussed layered one with a ballled up different tablet inside the centre which has a second purpose (painkiller). Think similar to a dishwasher tablet or something but on a minute scale for humans. Depending how you break them they could differ.<br />
There are some crazy technologies out there!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do uniformity of dosage testing with a batch (beginning, middle, end, with each of those having a beginning, middle, and end) so every pill is tested for uniformity within the batch.  The batches are usually quite large, but we don't necessarily test different parts of one pill (depending on the pill).  We have dissolution tanks which measure the time it takes for 1 pill to dissolve, to make sure it dissolves at a rate that won't kill someone or give them a huge dose at once, depending on the drug.  For the most part, they're mixed quite well in the bulk tank, and many are made with the indents so you can split them, because they're made to be pretty uniform.<br />
I'm sure it happens, but probably not by a large margin, though I can't say for certain, as I generally don't deal with content uniformities.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What's the sample size taken from a given batch?  Is it based on volumetric proportions of the final pill, or is it some mass much smaller?</p></div>		</li>
