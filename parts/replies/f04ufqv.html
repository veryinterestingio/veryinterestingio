No matter what i threw at them, they made it better. The drummer plays now in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjXtz1iSFM" target="_blank">Winterborn</a>, and an awesome guy. I simply don't have a negative story to tell, which usually is great sign ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. This is why I have my drums at the side of the stage facing inward. Audience gets a good side view of what I'm doing, and I can see the rest of the band. A lot of what we do involves tricky changes though, so it helps a lot of I can see everyone's pedal boards so I know when they're setting up for something. </p>
<p>They also look at me a lot. If I'm having fun and the audience is enjoying a section, band can see me set up to repeat that section, or spin it a different way.</p>
<p>Not sure why drummers are always at the back. Other bands we play with look at our stage setup and hate it initially. But when they actually use it (often bands share the drums here, and we're usually the headline act so they have to use mine) they come off stage going &quot;oh shit! That was awesome! Why didn't we think of it before?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does that mean to stay in time? I have noticed, especially during live performances where they can extend a solo longer and pick right back up as if nothing. Is staying in time just knowing where to keep going once they’re done?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's an interesting question. It can get very complex and each genre has its own nuances of what &quot;staying in time&quot; means. But basically, music can be broken up into what is called bars (or measures). These are then subdivided into beats. Most pop or rock music divides a bar into 4 beats. Before the song starts someone (usually the drummer) will count to 4 in rhythm. This gives the tempo for each beat that all of the musicians are expected to follow. This ensures that everyone is playing the right thing at the right time. </p>

<p>This goes even further than just staying in time. The ability to do this comes with learning and understanding harmony (the chords and their progression throughout a song) and form (the repetition of the chord progression, where it starts and where it repeats). There are famous chord progressions in pop music, such as the 12 bar blues. This is a form that repeats every 12 bars. And since every musician playing must both be able to stay in time and know the chord progression, they can repeat it as often as they want (like in a solo) and all know where they are. When the soloist wants to end, they just need to give a visual cue (a wink or nod as an example) as they are getting to then end of the form. This lets the other musicians know to play the next section.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever listened to music and started tapping your foot and nodding your head? That's roughly what keeping in time is all about. There's a set &quot;beat&quot; to most music that, especially in a band, everyone is aware of and following along with. In a drummer's solo, there's still that underlying beat. </p>
<p>Keeping time starts to get complicated when you turn that into phrases. Any standard rock song is going to be in some 4 -beat pattern, meaning that in each &quot;bar&quot; of music (or small section) there will be 4 beats. A chorus phrase might be something like 16 or 32 total beats when everything is said and done. A drummer, doing a solo, will be counting up through that entire &quot;chorus&quot; phrase while drumming and then can settle back into the groove after they get through that 32 count. This is, again, dependent on what the song is and what the genre they're playing around in. </p>
<p>The rest of the band will be counting as well. A guitar player, while letting the drummer take their solo, will be aware of the same beats and be counting up as well. That's how bands can typically pick up where they've left off when doing any solo from any instrument. Drummers and bassists need to be going through the same exact counting and phrasing when playing through each section of a tune.</p></div>		</li>
