<p>Just kidding! Don't do this at home or anywhere else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dentist recommends me swishing a very diluted mixture of bleach and water in my mouith.  One and a half teaspoons of bleach to an 8 ounce cup of water, though you don't put more than a couple of ounces in your mouth.  Swish for 30 seconds, spit out and don't wash out your mouth for another 30 seconds.  Do that twice a week.  </p>
<p>There's a published study that finds this effective for Gingivitis, though I don't have that.  </p>
<p>I tried this for a couple of months and there were a couple of interesting things different this time.  The depth of the gaps for my teeth still increased (bumming), but there was basically zero bleeding.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a shame not everyone shares your interpretation of a resistance to generalizing. I expect that people with some exposure to science recognize the norm of favoring understatement vs overstatement of certainty to preserve credibility. Others read it as leaving oneself an “out” to avoid taking responsibility when wrong, and so tend to distrust people who talk this way. And thus the problem of communicating scientific findings to a broad audience...</p></div>		</li>
