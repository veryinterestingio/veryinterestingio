			<div class="markdown"><p>More info, just to make things more complex! Some materials have a practical limit on the cooling rate. High alloy steels (like you would make knives out of) especially, will crack if cooled too quickly. Quench cracking as its called depends on a whole slew of things including the shape of the piece of metal, what it is alloyed with, how &quot;clean&quot; the steel is, etc. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! The solution determines the cooling rate. For example O1 steel needs to be quenched in oil so the cooling rate isn't as extreme. </p>
<p>Also metallurgy is a really cool field that a lot of engineers tend to overlook. Check it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, sorry for my english and gramma mistakes, it is not my mother tongue .In order to be precise, I'll use the chemical symbols to talk about elements.</p>
<p>You have what is called TTT diagram, a diagram that shows TÂ° against time, which allows the metallurgist to know what ratios of cooling he needs to do in order to obtain certain quantities of each phase on the solution. Those diagrams marks where the martensite appears, what is his %, where the bainite appears, and the fine and thick perlite and other things. This diagram is affected by two factors: What is on the solutions and how much of every element is on the solution. </p>
<p>The fact of having alloys helps to change the TTT diagram, which many times is used to obtain certain properties easier, for example, adding Cr will create what is called &quot; Cr nose&quot; in some countries, which helps to make the process of obtain martensite easier. There is the Mn nose, etc. </p>
<p>At the same time, how much of each element affects the times on the diagrams, for example, the full martensite on a hypoeutectoid(0.022%C&lt;X&lt;0.77%C) steel is obtained with a cooling much faster than a Eutectoid (0.77%C) steel ora hypereutectoid steel (0.77C&lt;X&lt;2.3%), which is even slower. At the same time, the % of each material will change propperties like the hardness,etc. For example, if you increase the %of C the steel will be harder than another steel with less C and the same thermic process.</p>
<p>To help you with that, you have books like the Callister, which explains the process very well, had exercises about it.  It helped me a lot to pass the exams! ??</p>
<p>I hope my comment helps you, and again sorry for my english.</p>
<p>Pd: I'm a engineering student too! Good luck with the exams!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add two things:<br />
that there's also quenching distortion.  Steel will bend/distort when beeing cooled rapidly. The faster you cool it down, the more distortion you'll get.<br />
.<br />
You can also use interrupted quenching. This means you'll cool down the steel rapidly for a short time and then switching to another solution, that doesn't cool as rapidly.<br />
E.g. hold it in water for 5 seconds, then switch over to oil.<br />
This reduces distortions and the chance for cracking.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will make it brittle.  After a heat &amp; quench you get something that is almost like a plate of glass when talking about most steels that are used for a blade.  You would need to then temper the steel afterwards.  Generally speaking, that means you'd put it in an oven ~400F for 1-3 hours, depending on the result you want in the end.  I'm basing that off of the likelihood of HF being a cheap carbon steel, different alloys would need different treatments possibly.  There is also a chance that its such low carbon content steel that hardened or not it may not make much difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what its made out of. Chances are it will get harder and brittle so be careful of chipping or breaking it apart. You could give it a try for the lulz... and wear safety equipment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can always consult a TTT (time, temperature, transformation) diagram to see exactly how cooling rate will affect an alloy. It tells you what phases will be present after cooling at a certain rate for a certain amount of time. Each phase in the metal is formed of different crystal structures and possibly different elements. Because of this, phases behave differently and have different physical properties (like hardness). If you form a lot of a phase, the overall material will likely have some of its properties. In steel, if you form more martensite, you generally get higher hardness. This is essentially what /u/Pascal2803 explained, except now you can get that same information, about any phase of a material, from a diagram. It's all very interesting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that's almostly completely true, but there are a couple of things I'd like to clarify, particulularly about &quot;grain size.&quot;</p>
<p>When you solidify a metal, you are causing it to form crystals which metallurgists refer to as grains. Metals with finer grains will be harder than the same metal with coarse grains. When you solidify a metal quickly, you cause more crystals to nucleate, resulting in smaller grains (harder metal). </p>
<p>In the steel example above, the higher cooling rate does give you more and more martensite, but you can also get finer martensite when you cool faster. </p>
<p>In the amorphous example, you are cooling so fast that the atoms don't have time to arrange themselves into crystals, resulting in the very high hardness. </p>
<p>Precipitation hardening in Al alloys is actually done during separate heat treatment. You'll get the highest hardness if solidify it quickly and then heat treat it later to get the optimum precipitation hardening. </p>
<p>There are all sorts of details that change from alloy to alloy, but in general yes, faster cooling = higher hardness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because in powder metallurgy, you're effectively starting with individual grains already. Hence, you can control powder size to control grain size. </p>
<p>Additionally, defects like pores and inclusions (which are quite common in PM) can act to limit grain growth.</p></div>		</li>
