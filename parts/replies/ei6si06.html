			<div class="markdown"><p>The mental /psychological effect of temperature perception is fascinating.</p>
<p>Leave a cup of coffee and a glass of cola at room temperature for a few hours so they will be at the same temperature. When you taste them the coffee will taste cold, whilst the cola will taste warm,  due to the temperatures your brain has been conditioned to expect them to be.</p>
<p>Another cool trick is to run one hand under hot water, and another hand under cold water for a few minutes, then plunge them both into the same bowl of lukewarm water. Both hands will feel the water at different temperatures </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time i microwaved some dinner, and the plastic lid had warmed up a bit, but not enough for it to be uncomfortable to hold. I could easily keep my hand on it. I then put a cool metal fork on it, and when i grabbed the whole box to move it, my hand touched the warm lid and cool fork at the same time, and for a second, the fork felt scalding hot, i nearly dropped the whole thing. ^^7/10</p></div>		</li>
