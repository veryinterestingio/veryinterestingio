			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: This comment is talking about the Monster Hunter series up to (and including) Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate. Some aspects are confirmed to not apply to Monster Hunter World (such as the small monster syncing), and I’m unsure whether or not it uses any client/host tricks to reduce impact of latency (although it’s extremely likely that it <strong>does</strong> plan out the Monster’s actions a few seconds in advance).</p>
<p>Making an addition to this (since they mentioned this game series specifically): One of Monster Hunter’s methods of reducing the impact of latency is to only have the MAIN target/s (the various behemoths that you embark on hunts to fight) be handled “server-side” (since the games do not use dedicated servers, the role of the “server” is instead performed by the “Host”), while <strong>everything else</strong> such as the locations/actions of the many smaller creatures you encounter, are handled client-side (resulting in other players appearing to strike thin air for no reason, and then suddenly one of the small raptors 50 feet away goes flying and dies).</p>
<p>In addition to that, the “Host” determines the actions and movement of the Monster several seconds in advance and communicates them to the clients, so that the fight feels smooth even without a strong connection.</p>
<p>This is why the Monster will often “stutter-step” briefly when stunned/mounted/paralyzed by a client (this is more noticeable at high latency): the “Host” now has to suddenly adjust for new conditions, as the (predetermined) next few seconds will instead have to play out differently (and it has to update the clients with the new “schedule” for that Monster).</p>
<p>It’s pretty effective at reducing the impact of latency and works well due to the nature of the game. I was rather impressed when I read about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there's cheating. Edited savefiles, broken weapons, generated items and all that. Nothing is done to ban cheaters. The community frowns on cheating though, and some players will actively remove suspected cheaters from their sessions. But you're far likelier to have a game ruined because someone messed up instead of from a hacker. </p>
<p>No, because if you're playing Monster Hunter for a prolonged period of time, it's likely you're doing it because you prefer whacking a something to death in this game over others. It's the process, not the end result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In Monster Hunter World, all data is shared to the client, and anything reported by the client is trusted. As a result, this means you can manipulate the game state in pretty much any way you want.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can set the hp of any target monster to a custom value.</li>
<li>You can send the 'Quest Complete' flag to the session and all clients will accept that the mission finished successfully without checking actual game state.</li>
<li>You can edit your vendor shoplist to contain every item in the game.</li>
<li>You can edit your forgemaster to have every recipe, even custom ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is <em>zero</em> anti-cheat, though the game can sometimes crash or disconnect the session if an impossible gamestate occurs due to tampering.</p>
<p>That said, relatively little of the community seems to actually cheat, and you can limit your game sessions to only people you know.</p>
<p>It also means you can mod the game however you want. QoL mods that improve matchmaking, social areas, visibility are all super popular and have helped overcome some of the developer oversights. It's even possible to add custom monsters.</p>
<p>While MH:W doesn't directly support modding, they left an 'override' feature in the engine where you can supply files to the client by placing them in a specific folder that take precedence over the stock files, allowing you to do almost anything to the game itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since there isn't a pvp mode cheating is much less problematic and is fairly rare. The game is very coop focused so many people only play with friends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they run out of actions to do, large monsters revert to an idle or roaring animation. They may completely stop moving while the remaining online players are free to move and heal up. In this state damage and status calculation are paused when a new session host is being decided. </p>
<p>That doesn't mean MH does a flawless job of dealing with lag, it just hides lag better by generally not giving you negative feedback (like delayed knockdowns). The difference is easier to notice when I go back to the older 2DS systems and games. Teleporting monsters and co-op players, shots not registering, delayed hitboxes, excessive delays joining quests. I've last-hit large monsters online without being visually shown that I've hit them on my side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it’s definitely not flawless. I just think it’s a pretty clever way to reduce the negative impacts that occur as latency increases, since it (indirectly) increases the number of “viable” potential team members by effectively raising the “maximum limit” on what latency can be comfortably tolerated.</p>
<p>Since handhold devices (and I’m including the Switch in this, due to it using WiFi by default even when “docked” if you don’t have the dongle) need to rely on WiFi (which is less reliable than a wired connection), this technique used by Monster Hunter is especially valuable for improving the online experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I probably should have said in my initial comment that I was talking about3/3G/4/4G/G/GU (only played Freedom Unite offline, and not played the first game), but I forgot about MHW when I was writing that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t know if the monster’s actions and movements being scheduled in advance to reduce the impact of latency is a thing in MHW or not, as I’ve never actually played that version. It’s possible that it’s still the case, but I have no idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right?! It makes it very frustrating to play online. The more experienced you get, the easier it is to recognize when a player is relying on online lag / unreliable netcode gimmicks to win.</p>
<p>Every new upcoming release I hear the same questions. Characters, balance, and netcode. It really is make or break in some cases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I'm reading this correctly, that's where the server/host predicts what players will do, and if it doesn't match, <em>rolls back the gamestate to the last correct frame and tries again</em>?</p></div>		</li>
