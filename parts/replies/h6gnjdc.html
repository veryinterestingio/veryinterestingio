			<div class="markdown"><p>Well with head phones there is no front tit back all of the sound comes from the side. In real life it's never exactly right behind you plus it's reverberates off walls, plants, the ground, etc and you ears detect a slight delay from those version of the sound. Between all that you're brain can determine it's behind you on your left it right.  Usually this will be enough for you to turn around then fucus on the sound to more accurately determine it's location.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't be the case for <em>all</em> sounds you hear out of your headphones. The sounds would need to be specifically designed/engineered to simulate 'surround sound' through headphones. As the other person mentioned, this is most noticeable in things like video games.</p></div>		</li>
