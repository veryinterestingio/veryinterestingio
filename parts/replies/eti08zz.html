			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what the lady was told by Scientists and Doctors, so it is right to include it in the show, even if the conclusion that was reached then was wrong. The family of the firemen were absolutely told that they were isolated because of the radiation, and the hospitals did take extra steps to avoid radioactive contamination around them. Did they need to? No. But that's what they did.</p>
<p>Her testimony can be read in the book &quot;Voices of Chernobyl&quot;. It's truly gut wrenching. Keep in mind that the goal of the show is not to showcase scientific facts, it's to tell the stories of people who lived through one of the biggest catastrophes in modern history. In that sense, yes, the facts expained were wrong, but it had to be that way because otherwise it wouldn't be faithful to the events that happened</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with it is presenting it as fact (the female nuclear scientist character states it who up until that point had been one of the truth-tellers in the face of authority in the series) without later explaining the difference between radiation, contamination, and how exposure leads to cancer vs acute radiation sickness is irresponsible. The vast majority of people who watched <em>Chernobyl</em> have no clue how radiation works and since the show presented itself as scientifically and historically accurate, they’ll accept that “fact” as truth. </p>
<p>The show did an excellent job of simplifying how nuclear reactors and coefficients of reactivity worked to caused the accident, it could’ve spent five minutes showing both the truth and what Ludmilla was told.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The issue is you not understanding how narratives work. You and the &quot;mislead&quot; public have a duty of responsibility to understand that a TV drama based on an actual event has no scientific responsibility. At no point does the the TV show state that it is a documentary or that they are presenting ANYTHING as fact. You and the viewer do not get to abdicate your responsibility because you are a lazy, drip fed couch potato who demands everything be done for them, freeing themselves of the responsibility of critical thought.</p>
<p>The show was about what happened in 1986. End of discussion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have seen some sources say that the material still was radioactive enough to penetrate their skin and expose others to radiation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The firemen being treated in the hospital were not dangerous to be around.</p>

<p>You have any source for that? Because then why were the put in lead coffins and cement?</p>
<p>Also, why were all the animals killed in the zone?</p>
<p>Every bit of radioactive material they have taken in (like breathing in burning graphite), would stay in their body, no?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This explains and offers proof.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Another error [in HBO’s “Chernobyl”] was to portray the victims as being dangerously radioactive,” UCLA’s Robert Gale <a href="https://cancerletter.com/articles/20190524_3/" target="_blank">wrote</a> in “The Cancer Letter,” a subscription-based newsletter.   </p>
<p>“I spent the next two years mostly in the  Soviet Union working with my colleagues at the Institute for Biophysics  and Clinical Hospital 6 dealing with a bit more than 200 persons with  acute radiation exposures,” Gale writes. </p>
