			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's really cool. If the object being cut is metal, would sensor still be able to pick  up a finger? The link you said seem to indicate that metal obscures the sensor. </p>
<p>For people that were saying electrical resistance is measured, I've been wondering the same thing because wouldn't metal cutting just cause a short circuit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you can not cut highly captive materials like wet wood and metal. The sensor value would be all over the place as it cuts. Even a staple in a piece of wood will trip it. </p>
<p>SawStop specifically, has a disable mode when you need to make such cuts.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Depends on how big the staple is and if it's touching the user or the top.  A small staple alone generally won't be enough to trigger the saw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can’t cut metal with one of these devices enabled because it will trigger the stopping mechanism. Some of the SawStop saws have a feature to temporarily disable the stopping mechanism if you need to cut something conductive.</p></div>		</li>
