			<div class="markdown"><p>Great description. Similar to one I use in my line of work all the time ..... </p>
<p>&quot;Which is faster, a Ferrari or a Bus?&quot; ... </p>
<p>&quot;Mmm, the Ferrari&quot; ... &quot;Well, I didn't tell you the job we're doing today is taking 50 kids to school.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;ahhh, ok, so the Bus!&quot; </p>
<p>This allows you talk about bandwidth vs latency. Then I'll let the smartass in the room say, &quot;the correct answer is 50 Ferrari's!&quot; .... which is great because now I can say, &quot;well the road to school is a single lane dirt road with tons of pot holes&quot;.... which now opens the door for protocol discussions and serial vs parallel architectures. </p>
<p>Then we go from them and talk about wide highways with synchronized self driving Ferrari's and then expand into multi-dimensional lanes above and under ground. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Id probably extend the analogy to something like : if the task is to get 2 people to destination A, then 2 people to destination B, then 2 people to destination C etc, the supercar would win.</p>
<p>However if the task is to get 400 people all to destination A the bus would win easily </p></div>		</li>

<p>So to make an analogy:
The CPU is a supercar: two seats, 200mph top speed. The GPU is a Articulated bus: 400 seats, 30mph top speed.
If you wanna do one (or two) things really fast, the CPU wins. If you want to do the same thing over and over and over again a billion time (and don't care how long it takes to do it just once), the GPU wins.</p>
