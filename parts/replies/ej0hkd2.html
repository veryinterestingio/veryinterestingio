			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure it does, in the first paragraph, if you accept as given that the frequency range starts at 88.0 MHz and each channel is 0.2 MHz wide. The math dictates that each channel will have a center frequency with an odd decimal.</p>
<p>The FM frequency range is shown in the graphic to lie between frequencies used for other things (the usable range for various radio technologies is really crowded, one of the reasons analog OTA transmissions were phased out for digital).</p>
<p>It doesn't really say why they chose a 0.2 MHz width, but it's easy to assume that was found to be wide enough to prevent interference while allowing the maximum number of channels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Europe, the frequencies are separated by 0.1, and the range is 87.5-108MHz.</p>
<p>Also: bandwidth is not 0.2MHz, bandwidth is actually sound volume dependent, as the technology is frequency modulation, so an amplitude of sound will make frequency deviate from a center frequency - and the volume of a sound will determine how much it would deviate. There are standards, and it is actually forbidden for a broadcaster to ‚Äúbe too loud‚Äù which would cause too much frequency deviation - and would interfere with station that has its frequency near.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is actually called bandwidth, and it's determined by the maximum amplitude of the modulating signal. That's what's limited at 0.2 MHz (with FM stations in practice limiting themselves at 0.15 total, to avoid interference).</p>
<p>What you're talking about is called instant frequency deviation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Europe, the frequencies are separated by 0.1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some EU countries space them by 0.1, others by 0.2 - and Italy allows them to squeeze in at 0.05, which is crazy, but hey, to each his own.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Will reply more soon, but in the meantime; I am not licensed HAM operator but am electronic circuit designer and builder and service, and have built (and repaired) more than I could imagine of transmitters and receivers.</p>
<p>Also: you have to understand that laws in Europe are different, and that we (here in my country) have a licensing body which takes care of delegating frequencies AND EIRP - so that two radio stations don‚Äôt overlap; therefore, Italy can have .05 separation.</p>

<p>Good intentions, but you're wrong. </p>
<p>The bandwidth is 200 kHz, or 100 kHz each side, and it's clearly defined what is beyond the voice: stereo at 38kHz, RDS at 57kHz, and rarely there's one more subchannel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is that we fight over wording; you‚Äôre stating ‚Äúallowed bandwidth is X‚Äù and I am stating that bandwidth is broadcasted sound volume dependent.</p>
<p>So, we‚Äôre both right.</p></div>		</li>
