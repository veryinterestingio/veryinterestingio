			<div class="markdown"><p>Young animals of any species seem to be an exception - they have a very important job to do, calibrating their muscles and senses. I raise sheep and while the ewes doze in the shade, their lambs are running, jumping, chasing at full speed. The same behaviour is seen in puppies, kittens and young humans as well.</p>
<p>Some animals never seem to grow out of this, like the small yappy dogs. This is a trait called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoteny" target="_blank">neoteny</a> that we often breed into our domestic animals, and it also appears to be an important human trait that allows us to keep learning throughout our lives.</p></div>		</li>
