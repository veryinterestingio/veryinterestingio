			<div class="markdown"><p>I never really got this. When I go to watch a movie, I want my undivided attention on the movie. It's what I'm paying for. Going 2 hours without a snack is something we do every day, it's not a challenge. No salty food, no need for a drink, no need to pee, no movie interruption.</p>
<p>I don't get why people encumber their movie experience so much. Why go to a theater to spend half the time shoving food in your mouth, taking a drink, looking at your phone, leaving the theater entirely to use the bathroom, chatting to people...just watch the movie, it isn't hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I did in pandemic lockdown was up my home popcorn game.</p>
<p>1/3rd cup kernals, 3 or 4 tablespoons neutral oil, half teaspoon of salt. Make sure you've run the salt thru a spice grinder or coffee grinder first.</p>
<p>Mix, cover loosely, heat, eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat the oil first over medium ish heat. Add a few kernels and cover pot. When you hear popping, open the lid and dump the rest of the kernels in. Remove from burner for 30 and give a couple of tosses. This gets all the kernels evenly heated/fat distributed. Put back on heat and shake every 15-20 seconds. Crack lid a hair to let out steam and have really crisp popcorn.  Toss a bit more often toward the end so you don’t burn. </p>
<p>When pops are 2-3s apart, pull from heat, salt and dump in bowl. </p>
<p>For best results, skip the oil and use ghee. You can skip having to melt butter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://Davemanuel.com" target="_blank">Davemanuel.com</a> has a 1930-1932 movie ticket at $0.35 and s<a href="https://Southernliving.com" target="_blank">outhernliving.com</a> has a bag of popcorn at the movies at $0.05-0.10 per bag for the same years.</p>
<p>So, that puts the ratio at 3.5:1 to 7.0:1 -- so given the average $9.47 ticket per AMC, a bag of popcorn should be $1.35-2.70.  per AMC, a small popcorn there is in the range of $6.09-7.09.</p>
<p>Lets just take the mid-point on both ranges-- $2.03 vs $6.59, or +225%.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But then my next question is, how big was a $0.05-0.10 bag of popcorn in 1930?  Per AMC, their small is 11 cups, so if the 1930s street vendor was handing out bags that were around 3-4 cups, then proportionately the price of popcorn (adjusted for &quot;serving&quot; size) hasn't really changed.</p></div>		</li>
