<p>In some places it's legal. But you need to be super careful that it isn't abused. Not only inheritence, but also people who don't want to pay their relatives care anymore for example.</p>

<p>This is a great observation and it's missing from a lot of euthanasia discussions I've heard. It ties into the other issue of a sick person wanting to be euthanized because they feel like they're a burden</p>
<p>Any chance German judgements are also published in English? Id love to read it</p></div>		</li>

<p>In short they say our first line of the constitution &quot;human dignity is untouchable&quot; applies here. They specifically say you don't even need to be sick or old to have a right to die. It must only be made sure you're mentally able to understand the implications. Our legislation is currently working on casting this into a new law to prevent uncontrolled euthanasia services (someone made a comparision to Futurama's suicide booth)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For historic reasons it's also a topic that's approached with much care and some hesitation. But more and more european countries allow for a self-determined, dignified death, under certain conditions, but it's a good development. </p>
<p>It doesn't even happen all that often. Once people have the option to end their suffering if they really want to, many keep on going. It is a safety line, and it's easier to face such a difficult situation when you have a choice not to anymore.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He said his goodbyes to his collected family, asked the doc to proceed, and he was gone shortly after.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I considered it when I got a plumbing bill I thought was excessive, but I dunno, I went ahead and paid it, but it was 50/50 there for a while.</p></div>		</li>
