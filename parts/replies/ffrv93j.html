			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as for deep learning.  GPUs are really good at solving more or less the same linear algebra equations (which are required for rendering vector images) over and over.  Deep learning requires solving a shitload of linear algebra equations over and over.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like one big thing you can slot into a motherboard that includes a CPU and GPU. Or will it always be separate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a while, yes. Now, ASICs are better for the task.</p>

<p>ELI5: you program your software into hardware and it is super optimized. Instead of any program running on a general-purpose CPU, a specific program runs on a custom-built CPU.</p>
<p>GPUs are still good at mining cryptocurrency, but ASICs are better (cheaper).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, unlike many of the other top answers, it's also correct.</p>
<p>It's not that GPUs <em>can't</em> do complex, branching logic, it's that they're much slower at this than CPUs. And it's not that CPUs <em>can't</em> do a bunch of identical parallel operations over a giant array (they even have specialized SIMD instructions!), it's that they don't have the raw brute force that a GPU can bring to bear on that kind of problem.</p>
<p>It's also really hard to give good examples, because people keep finding more ways to use the GPU to solve problems that you'd think only work on the CPU. One that blew my mind lately is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToCozpl1sYY" target="_blank">how <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em> uses the GPU to do procedural placement</a> -- the GPU does most of the work to decide, in real time, where to put all the stuff that fills the world: Trees, rocks, bushes, grass, even enemy placement at some point.</p></div>		</li>
