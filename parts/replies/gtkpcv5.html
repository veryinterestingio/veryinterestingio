			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew from a young age that I wanted to go into the field of science, but I had no idea that it was anything more than beakers and mixing together solutions even into early college courses.  I did an internship at PNNL during my undergraduate work and was introduced to the world of robotic laboratory automation.  I was star struck, hooked, and determined to make this my career.  I started working with analytical equipment initially, but eventually made my way into the robotics group at PNNL.  The rest was a robotic match made in heaven.</p></div>		</li>
