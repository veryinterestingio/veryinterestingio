			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't even need that much. Stainless steel cold welds extremely easily, it's often called &quot;galling&quot;. If you use SS nuts and bolts without lubrication and overtighten them, or if there's vibration they can gall and become impossible to undo, due to cold welding.</p></div>		</li>
