			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhh I see! My textbook simply mentioned fireflies as an example of bioluminescence before diving into quorum sensing (ie V. fischeri) in squid. That would make more sense though. I've been sitting here wondering to myself about how in the hell a firefly would induce quorum sensing to their advantage lol. Thanks for clearing that up!</p></div>		</li>
