			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify here, the U.S. doesn’t give everybody free flood insurance. There’s FEMA disaster relief, but that might get you $15k on $200k worth of damages if you don’t have an insurance policy. I witnessed that happen to a lot of people in my hometown after Hurricane Sandy. </p>
<p>You still have to pay for flood insurance under the a National Flood Insurance Program. Perhaps a subsidized rate, but your post makes sound like the Government guarantees it for all, which it does not.</p>
<p>The program was fully funded by its premiums up until Hurricane Katrina in 2004. Since that time the NFIP has gone $25 Bn into debt. It’s definitely an unspoken problem that’s getting worse.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you're missing their point. If the government didn't guarantee flood insurance, insurance companies would outright refuse to insure a lot of homes, which means you couldn't get a mortgage on the home and it would really lose its value</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not how flood insurance works, though the fact that people think “The US government has guaranteed every citizen flood insurance” may explain why they buy in flood-prone areas.</p>
<p>The reality is that flood insurance is expensive to offer because floods, when they happen, tend to hit lots of properties at the same time. That’s hard to hedge. So the federal government offered its own product, which was underpriced and drove virtually all private carriers out of the market.</p>
<p>You still have to buy the insurance, which not everybody does, and there’s no guarantee it will pay out (it’s notorious difficult to collect on these policies even if you have them).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also expensive because some areas are flood prone, I would think. Subsidizing it encourages building there, which is the wrong thing to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My county doesn't participate in the federal flood insurance program, because people here don't want regulations on building in floodplains, etc.  Our five hundred year flood still didn't convince them otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is that a &quot;once in five hundred years&quot;?</p>
<p>ETA: all of the possible responses are why I asked to clarify. Depending on the phrasing it could be a 1/500 chance per year or once every 500 years.
The 'normal' phrasing would be a hundred-year [event]. As this is not the specific phrasing used and we don't which county- it's important to clarify. The likeliest answer is a 0.2% per year chance of that flood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a &quot;0.2 percent chance of occurring annually based upon local geography and historical weather patterns&quot; flood. On the average, with stable weather patterns, they happen at a rate of 1 every 500 years. However, the incidence of one does not impact the likelihood of the incidence of another, as per the gambler's fallacy. Additionally, if climate is changing, then a flood that <em>was</em> labeled a 500 year flood becomes a more common occurrence. I believe the flood rating maps are currently undergoing an update to account for this fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's 1/500 chance of a flood of that level every year. That means that on average, it's pretty likely to happen once in a 500 year period. However, just because there was a 500-year flood last year doesn't mean you're &quot;safe&quot; for 500 more years. Houston, TX has experienced several 100-year floods in the past decade or so.</p></div>		</li>
