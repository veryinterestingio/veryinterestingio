			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but it requires people to pay attention, care, and take the time to report you.</p>
<p>And people just don't have those kinds of shit to give. I remember a long time ago as an experiment some guys filmed themselves stealing bikes (that they owned) on busy side walks in NYC. They started with yellow vests and bolt cutters, nobody said anything. Eventually they just did it in street clothes with angle grinders, still nobody even said a word to them (they even did it in front of a cop).</p>
<p>People are pretty apathetic to things that aren't their problem.</p></div>		</li>
