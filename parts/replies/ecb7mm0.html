			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with Fortnite streamers. I dont irrationally hate them, but it feels unfair that other gaming talents and content creators struggle to make a living while some Fortnite players roll around cash. The game has also become so popular that it har shifted the entire industry. And I am concerted that every game will try to include sillyness, dances, and microtransactions in the future. </p></div>		</li>
