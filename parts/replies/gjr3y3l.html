			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the numbers and the thoughtful answer. Is this primarily because COVID patients need the transplants? Or are those dying from COVID offering more organs and have cleared the virus by the time they die?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider regional differences too. Places that were hit hard by COVID-19 to start (NY and NJ) diverted their organs to other locations. I was at one of those areas that benefited from differed organs and our transplant numbers skyrocketed as a result. I’m not sure how things have changed over the last half year though as I’m no longer with that job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>COVID-19 patients aren't likely <em>receiving</em> organ donations either.</p>
<p>But the pandemic sadly also worsened deaths from other causes too. Consider the increases in isolation, sedentary behavior, worsened diets, substance abuse, record spikes in shooting deaths over the summer, and even record levels of depression and anxiety. Studies on many of these have been posted on this very sub, and they just keep coming....</p>
<p>So being able to save more patients who need organ donations is a bittersweet silver lining to this tragedy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's your location though? Because here in Canada,  our transplant programs have been halted during the last year (on and off) so this seems pretty location specific. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/organ-transplants-paused-ontario-1.5512989" target="_blank">Ontario paused theirs last March</a> <a href="https://profedu.blood.ca/en/organes-et-tissus/covid-19/national-covid-19-impact-data" target="_blank">If you take a look ytd, we're way under the regular benchmark</a>.</p></div>		</li>
