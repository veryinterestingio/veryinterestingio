<p>Less than 30 years after IP was invented, and well before the internet became so ubiquitous, we were already having to adjust routing architectures to accommodate growth.</p>
<p>With the Internet of Things growing as it has, IPv6 will allow for more fluid development of new technologies without stressing the infrastructure too much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know if this is true or not, but a greybeard network engineer told me once that if NAT has not been invented, the internet would have ground to a halt before 1995.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea that's the thing though when people say stuff like this. Its not like the internet was on the brink of suddenly stopping. Like sure technically hes correct in his statement but its extremely sensationalized.</p>

<p>Its the same thought process as thinking if a certain inventor of something was never born that said device would never exist. A silly thought as someone else could just invent it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a byte perspective, an ipv4 address is 4 bytes, containing relatively few addresses, instead you can just quadruple those bytes to hit the huge ipv6.</p>
<p>It made sense in the 80s, but by the 90s, it was already being exhausted rapidly. When I first heard of the issue, I realized how large the Internet is and made me feel like we were too late to the party</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes IPv4 (with clasful networks) was the first version deployed for production in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">ARPANET</a> in 1983. And only 10 years later, in 1993, they had to introduce classless inter-domain routing because of the Address space exhaustion. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bit of related trivia: </p>
<p>There was a similar question posed in the mid 2000s when the ZFS file system was created with a max volume size of 2^(128) bytes, which many thought was overkill. Oracle gave <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/bonwick/128-bit-storage:-are-you-high" target="_blank">a pretty great response</a> to one particular comment which also serves to answer this question relatively well, and provides a bit of a reference for the sheer size of 2^(128).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one of those numbers that is really hard to comprehend. Breaking it down a little bit, if we imagine a future where our population hits 100 billion we'd still be able to give each person 3.4 x 10^(26) IP addresses (if my maths is right).</p>
<p>If we ever need to upgrade IPv6, then we could look at 2^(256) addresses but that only puts us just shy of the lower limit of the estimated number of atoms in the known universe. If we adopt 2^(512) then we'll be able to freely assign an IP address to not only every atom in our universe but every subatomic particle and still leave plenty of scope for expansion into multiverses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favourite one is:</p>
<p>Take the number of IPv4 addresses.</p>
<p>Multiple that by the number of planets in our solar system (8).</p>
<p>Multiply that by the number of stars in the Milky Way (circa 250 billion give or take 150 billion).</p>
<p>And you still don't have as many addresses as IPv6.</p></div>		</li>

<p>not quite. IANA hasn't issued all 2^128 addresses, they have &quot;only&quot; specified the first three bits 001, and then 64 bits are reserved for interface ID's you get about 3.8x10^8 addresses. then you have the OUI's in the IP's and the number drops again, and then if you take into account SLAAC, and then and then and then... the number drops to about 2^41 for currently valid IPv6 IPs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overall addresses isn't really relevant though. It's network addresses that Registries/ISPs actually hand out.</p>
<p>When you get a 2^64 network address at your router, you'd have 2^64 addresses behind it (though some are taken out for SLAAC, etc) and by design you'll never use most of them. Even if your name is Google and you have a DC with 250k servers in there you won't make a dent in the address space of a single network address.</p>
<p>When talking about allocations you should only think of the 2^64 network addresses that are actually allocated to end-user routers.</p>
<p>We've still got plenty of those, though not if we make a habit of handing out huge blocks, The US DoD has a /13 block, which is enough for trillions of LANs. It's 64times larger than the /19 blocks assigned to Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom.</p></div>		</li>
