			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually what the linked article is mostly about, our progress in using these hormones and processes in a medicinal way. Short answer is yes, but it's complicated. Appetite suppressors are used to varying degrees of success, but they often don't address the underlying causes of obesity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem has always been that the involved hormones are not solely impactful on hunger, but have other functions. So if you mess with them, you tend to mess with other systems as well. </p>
<p>This is actually the problem with most drugs..they are simply too general to address the sole condition they were designed for. Most neutransmitters, enzymes and hormones serve multiple functions, so ALL those functions are impacted by the drug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's kind of like vitamins in a way? Like if you have a deficiency of a certain one but take a multivitamin, you bring your deficiency up to par but overload the rest? Totally not a professional here, I was just recently reading about it and was curious. I know hormones can totally throw you out of whack so I'll leave those to the Endo Docs.</p></div>		</li>
