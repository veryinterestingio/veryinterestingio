			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing happened in America. The &quot;broadcaster&quot; or &quot;Nebraska&quot; accent was a neutral way of speaking that no one in the country had any trouble understanding, and they taught it to radio announcers. Something similar happened in Hollywood, where the &quot;<del>intercontinental</del> transatlantic accent&quot; (a somewhat artificial mix of east coast and generic British) was the default for decades. </p>
<p>The high-pitched, nasal tone we associate with classic news broadcasts was actually a product of the low quality of audio broadcasting and recording at the time. High pitched voices were easier to distinguish on the low-quality mono radio broadcasts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High pitched nasally voices also stems from the time of giving speeches to crowds without amplification. High pitched nasally shouting carries better over crowds than lower bass tones in voice and the crisp staccato enunciation makes the words more discernable than a conversational pace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, &quot;Mid Atlantic&quot; has come to mean 2 things in terms of accents. The traditional way you're thinking of, which is the cultivated accent blending American and British English, and the now more common meaning of the regional dialect of the Delaware Valley (Philly - Baltimore). The American regional Mid Atlantic accent is very distinct, and is pretty much never used in film or television with a few exceptions (The Wire).</p></div>		</li>
