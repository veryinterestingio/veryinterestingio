			<div class="markdown"><p>There is something called smooth pursuit, and then there are saccades. The point is to minimize optical flow on the retina (blurry images). So you can track smoothly to fix the image on your fovea, or you can focus on one thing while rotating your body/head (smoothly rotating eye against revolution direction) thus fixing it, then quickly jerking the eye rotationally in the opposite direction to fix on a new object and initiating smooth pursuit.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would having a significant discrepancy in vision from one eye to another make smooth tracking difficult as the eyes try to maintain focus on a moving object? I’ve noticed all my life that I can’t smooth track a baseball pitch no matter how hard I try to “keep my eye(s) on the ball” when batting. It feels like my eyes “jump” and leave a blind spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes can move smoothly,  look at the corner where your wall meets your cieling and follow the crease from left to right or right to left without moving your head. </p>
<p>You should be able to move your eyes very smoothly. </p>
<p>I used to do this a lot when I was kid as I found it fun,  for some reason, and I can do it without tracking anything now.   </p>
<p>When I do it while looking at my girlfriend she tells me off cause she finds it creepy,  like I am an android or something.  I'm fairly certain that anyone can do it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, when I do what you asked, I find that I don't actually follow the crease smoothly. It's more that my peripheral&quot;sees&quot; the crease and then my eyes &quot;center&quot; to the next spot where I continue the cycle. This may just be me, but I tried this with multiple stationary objects where I tracked something on the object.</p>
<p>If it's a moving object, like a swinging string, I can track smoothly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird.  The more I play around with it just now,  the more I realize I am definitely not just following the crease as I am imagining a target moving along the crease.   </p>
<p>I'm kind of imagining a little black dot running along the crease where wall meets cieling.</p>
<p>If you can track a moving object smoothly, I'm sure you can do it on command with a little practice. I remember when I was a kid I could only do it left to right for some reason,  right to left was always choppy, after a long time I was able to do right to left almost as fast and left to right.  I still can't do them both at equal speeds.</p></div>		</li>
