			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you're running an SSD with internal garbage collection, and/or a TRIM-enabled Operating System.</p>
<p>Those flatten the area previously occupied by the deleted file. An HDD can write both 1s and 0s on the fly, and thus can &quot;overwrite&quot; a previous file. SSDs only write the 1s by energizing bits, so they need everything de-energized (set to 0) prior to writing. That's what garbage collection &amp; TRIM do in the background (flatten deleted files). This keeps the SSD running efficiently. </p>
<p>After the deleted file is flattened, recovery is unlikely, and it happens fairly quickly in today's systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. It's also worth noting that these days there are so many background tasks running on your average system that even with an HDD it can be tricky to avoid deleted data being overwritten</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they do this pre-emptively? Or do they do it on the fly when new data needs to be written? I figure it would be the latter since it's possible that a bit wouldn't need flipped so it wouldn't to preserve the drives longevity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why it's important to properly dispose of any digital media storage you use. Even if it has been overwritten there is a not 0% chance it can be recovered/reconstructed. The only way to totally insure it's gone is either to use a special program that writes over the area with useless info multiple times (shortens the life span of most devices), or smash it to bits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on what you're doing. For me, with a hard drive full of recursively nested back ups of old documents about trash pandas, it doesn't matter. </p>
<p>If you're somewhat important, rewriting it even once will be good enough. </p>
<p>If you work in engineering with Boeing, chances are that you're not doing your own disposal anyway. </p>
<p>I think a lot of people overestimate the desire for others to steal their hard drives.</p></div>		</li>

<p>you should, but not exactly for the reasons you've given. even if you <em>have</em> with all meaningful levels of assurance digitally destroyed your data, you should still dispose of it properly because 1) why the hell not? do it out of an abundance of caution, and 2) it should be recycled properly</p>
<p>how you erase data, and the level of assurance you can achieve, also differs between storage media and even individual products.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if it has been overwritten there is a not 0% chance it can be recovered/reconstructed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there's no known instance and no evidence that any data can be recovered after a single overwrite on modern HDDs. and by modern we are talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-response_maximum-likelihood#Hard_disk_drives" target="_blank">since the 90s</a>.</p>
<p>Gutmann himself <a href="https://www.killdisk.com/blog-gutmann-method.htm" target="_blank">pointed out back in <em>2001</em></a> that higher data density of &quot;modern&quot; whopping <em>200GB</em> drives make it practically impossible to recover anything <em>even if</em> you're not sure that you've actually erased everything.</p>
<p>hypothetically i guess extreme edge cases are possible. the most obvious example would be if a bad sector just got skipped entirely. but recovering a few bits does not give you any coherent data.</p>
<p>even if you're extremely paranoid, even the DoD considers 3 passes to be safe. and again, there's really no evidence that this is necessary at all.</p>
<p>to guard against really unlikely cases where the overwriting process itself is not comprehensive, you should, indeed, still physically destroy the media after overwriting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>writes over the area with useless info multiple times (shortens the life span of most devices)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there's really no appreciable degradation from repeatedly overwriting HDDs beyond the basic wear+tear of the components and those are rated for <em>far</em> more than a few overwrites can do.</p>
<p>SSDs are a different beast, but the way to securely erase them is also very different, and it's also harder to make <em>sure</em> that the entire drive is actually erased.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>or smash it to bits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>physical destruction is also a lot harder than it sounds at first. you need to destroy <em>all</em> physical parts that store the data. this is relatively easy with HDDs (just take sandpaper to the platter) but grinding down NAND chips is going to take more effort that merely destroying the enclosure. if all you did was put a nail through a drive, chances are lots of data are still intact. even thermite, which is often named in a tongue-in-cheek way as a dramatic and overkill method of destruction, is actually surprisingly terrible at actually destroying drives. you probably shouldn't rely <em>only</em> on physical destruction, but a combination of overwriting and then physical destruction. of course if you were planning to repurpose the drive then just overwriting it is plenty good enough for all intents and purposes. just destroy it at EOL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but this is also why you should have that software installed first so that it doesnt overwrite the data you are using it to retrieve. Although the chances of the overwrite would greatly depend on how much spare space you have on your system when installing the recovery software</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These programs typically work based on assumptions of how the file system removes data.</p>
<p>The OS typically won't guarantee you access to specific disk segments when doing IO (edit: the disk reads and writes), as far as I know.</p>
<p>You would want to scramble the data in-place, but even that's not guaranteed... The OS (or disk driver / firmware) could decide to move or fragment your file for whatever reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's why apps exist which allow you to recover deleted files. Which is why if you accidentally delete critical files, the best thing you should do is cease using the computer. You can take it to a professional to attempt recovery (unless you know what you're doing and can do it yourself).</p>
<p>Additionally, that's why when you sell a computer, you should wipe it using the option which does something like write 0's over the entire drive.</p></div>		</li>
