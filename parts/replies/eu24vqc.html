			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. My partner have a tumor or a cyst near his breast tissue. Even he is flat but they still find a way to squish it as possible. He said it is incredibly painful experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup and even more painful if you've had surgery in the area. Although they don't tend to do a mammo for a year after surgery-still hurts like a bastard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just speculation (and some friends have confirmed it) that it's more painful for small breasted women (which I am not). I don't find the compressions painful usually, and if there is any discomfort, it seriously lasts only a few seconds. What I don't like is how you feel intense pulling from the top of the chest area, like the skin might tear right off. Also, being &quot;handled&quot; to get everything properly placed on the machine was quite disconcerting for me. The first few times, I was always shaking during and cried afterwards, but I don't think most women react like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small-breasted women can still get mammograms. If they truly have little to no tissue (which is common after a mastectomy), then they will do an ultrasound. </p>
<p>There are also some breast cancer protocols that use MRI scans, but it’s not used for routine screening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think maybe you misread that (or maybe I wasn’t clear)? </p>
<p>I have not had a mastectomy. </p>
<p>I said they will do mammograms on even very small/flat breasted people, but they <em>wouldn’t</em> do a mammogram on someone who had no breast tissue, such as after a mastectomy. </p>
<p>I was trying to make the distinction between the two, but probably could have been more clear in my phrasing, sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a mastectomy due to breast cancer I think in my country there’s a 6 month, 1 year and at least 2 year control. You can even mammogram the side where the mastectomy was done if there’s enough of a ”lip” left behind from the surgery - but it’s a tight fit. But we at least mammogram the breast that was left behind.</p></div>		</li>
