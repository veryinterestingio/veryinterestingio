			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for the noob question, but what does 4% herbal extract refers to? I thought the dried herbal extract would be let's say 90% purity herbal extract + 10% residues from water and alcohol. Thank you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes sorry to confuse, I just meant the 4% from the original mixture 96% alcohol + 4% herbal extract.to work out the exact purity you will need to know the mass and  number of moles of each reactant and product etc. 90% purity would be very good</p></div>		</li>
