			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s “only” two packs a day. It’s a lot, but the people that smoke that much got there over fifteen years of smoking. It becomes a habit like cracking your knuckles. Idle hands? Grab a smoke. It’s wild. </p>
<p>I smoke about a half a pack a day, but I’ve been as high as a pack a day before. Then realized how fast I was burning through them and cut back. But stubborn people don’t cut back. And it just gets worse. A couple rough weeks excuse the initial incline in smoking and then you it becomes your normal intake. Rinse, repeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What mentality do you hold that you continue to smoke? Do you think it won't happen to you? My stepdad died from smoking from neck cancer and it was exactly like you see of those gory advertisements saying &quot;smoking does this to you&quot;. It was a huge rotting tumour about the size of a mini football protruding from his neck that smelt really bad. Then he was in hospice care, it hemmoraged and he died from blood loss. He was 45 and smoked ten a day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So let's say you're awake for 16 hours a day.  40 cigarettes is 2 and a half per hour.  Let's say 10 minutes to smoke one, and you're spending 25 minutes out of every hour smoking. That's insane.  How do you function in life? I can see in the old days maybe when you could smoke everywhere, but how does someone just stand around outside doing that now?</p></div>		</li>
