			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this. The sensation of &quot;hot&quot; is actually &quot;warm&quot; + &quot;pain&quot;. The damaged area is more sensitive to &quot;pain&quot;, and since the area is also filled with warmth from the blood, it feels &quot;hot&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good catch. I didn't bring up additional details that would make the picture more confusing, but one possible way to reason about this is that the cold receptors in your skin respond to low temperatures... and also to very high temperatures. This is something called the paradoxical cold sensation. This means that when your brain decodes &quot;hot&quot;, there's usually &quot;pain&quot; + &quot;warm&quot; signals coming in, but sometimes also &quot;pain&quot; + &quot;warm&quot; + &quot;cold&quot;, or even &quot;pain&quot; + &quot;cold&quot;. This can potentially confuse your brain into thinking that you feel &quot;hot&quot; even though you're in a cold environment.</p>
<p>Now if you're asking why your cold receptors respond to warm temperatures, it's just because our receptors didn't evolve to handle every single stimuli on Earth. They've adapted to respond to stimuli that covers common situations that your ancestors would have faced, which means that things get a little wonky at extreme stimuli.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of that is we don't have nerves that sense &quot;hot&quot;.</p>
<p>We have nerves that sense &quot;warm&quot;, and nerves that sense &quot;damaging temperature&quot;.    The latter ones get set off from hot or cold.</p>
<p>Something that's hot triggers the &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;damaging temp&quot; nerves.  Something that's too cold triggers the &quot;damaging temp&quot; nerves.</p>
<p>Something that's really cold triggers the same &quot;damaging temp&quot; nerves, but will not trigger the &quot;warm&quot; nerves.</p>
<p>They figured this out with a neat apparatus, where two tubes were twisted around each other a few times.  If they ran only cold water through one pipe, people felt the pipes were cold.  If they ran only warm water through one pipe, people felt the pipes were warm.  When they ran cold through one pipe and warm through the other pipe, people touching it thought it was hot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kinda interesting. I once got some mild frostbite in my hands because I'm retarded. And I remember feeling like my hands were burning after warming up. And a fuck ton of pain, 2/10 don't recommend.</p>
<p>Also, who knew an industrial flow freezer at -20 is so much fucking colder than a storage freezer at the same temperature? o.0 Probably should have worn gloves..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can attest it is not fun... may or may not have spilled scolding coffee from my yeti a few years ago... very awkward emergency room visit, and worst pain of my life for a few days (and Iâ€™ve been shot).</p>
<p>Edit: Holy crap I came back to Reddit 5 hours later and couldnâ€™t figure out why I had so many notifications. </p>
<p>The experience definitely made me feel for the lady who spilled McDonaldâ€™s coffee. </p>
<p>Gunshot happened accidentally when I was a teen and moronically thought a pistol was unloaded when it was in fact loaded. (I  know itâ€™s literally the first rule of gun safety)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not related to ELI5 as I'm not smart enough, but if you have a not too severe burn but don't like the pain you can cover it tightly saran wrap (after cooling it etc)</p>
<p>This tricks your brain into thinking there is ok skin there (or something) and the pain lessens. Source: lots of kitchen accidents. Works particularly well on burnt fingers, as their shape (and burnability) is almost designed for this hack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago I had full thickness burns on 23% of my body from a fuel explosion. A massive part of my treatment was Manuka honey soaked bandages changed regularly. </p>
<p>It (ironically I guess) burns like a motherfucker for a few hours after fresh application but after that it's a few days of relief! Incredible stuff, noticeably better in feeling and result than any other treatment I had.</p></div>		</li>
