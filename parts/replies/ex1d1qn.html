			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that the spider uses different methods to deconstruct its web was fascinating to me. That means there's not just one method hardwired into the spider's behaviors. I wonder whether there are multiple instinctual methods based on outside factors, or if the spider makes a conscious decision to do it one way or another the way a human might based on a whim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had an orb spider who made nightly webs IN MY DOOR FRAME.  If I hadn't had my porch light on the night I discovered it, I would have walked right into it (and proceeded to have a heart attack).  I considered displacing it so it'd build webs elsewhere, but once I discovered how orb spiders work, I left it alone.  It was a gentleman's agreement between me and the spider, who I named Kurt - he made sure the web was gone by the time I left for work in the morning, and I wouldn't take a flamethrower to it.  It worked out well for a while before Kurt stopped making his nightly webs and disappeared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a spider that made a web about the size of a door on a tree in our front yard. There was one branch that hung out about 7 feet over the ground and it was between that and the ground about 4 feet wide. The spider would build it every evening and it'd be gone in the morning. The spider itself was about an inch wide/tall legs and all, big round'un. Not huge, not tiny.</p>
<p>One Sunday when I sleepily stumbled through the yard going for the morning paper and ended up walking right into it. I was instantly covered in spider web head to toe and felt it draping down along the my back and arms.</p>
<p>I blacked out. But I didn't just collapse. When I came to I was in a full sprint two blocks from my house. I might be slightly arachnophobic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one I had was about the size of a quarter. Not huge, but much larger than an regular spider you’d see inside. And porch light was on a motion sensor and right next to the door. When it was on, it attracted a buffet of every type of flying bug imaginable. I assume the spider was very well fed.</p></div>		</li>
