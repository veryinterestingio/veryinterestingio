			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to switch to electric heating and cooling. 1 day to get a mini split system with heat, or can buy wall heaters, and as far as hot water those can be converted in a day. </p>
<p>Consumption endpoints will change when prices make it obvious enough to do so. </p>
<p>I bought a home heated with oil. One of the first things I did was I got rid of it because of the cost and annoyance of oil heating systems and converted to natural gas heating</p></div>		</li>
