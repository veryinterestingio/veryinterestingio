			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean yes, but the two movements are not entirely disjointed. A 4 day full-time work week (i.e. 32 hours) would in theory lead to salaried workers getting the same pay but for fewer days. Pair that with a 20% increase in minimum wage, and you could theoretically continue to see the same benefit for wage workers as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I've seen it asked but haven't seen anyone cite a source in an answer.  Are they proposing 4-8 hour work days for a total of 32 hours a week or 4-10 hour work days for a total of 40 hours a week still?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basic economics would dictate that if you increase the cost of business (20% minimum wage boost) then costs for everything sold will also go up to compensate for the new cost. That cost is passed to consumers (a good chunk of whom are the ones receiving the wage boost). In practice, the minimum wage workers are in about the same place, since everything costs more. All that accomplishes is pulling down the value of people’s pay at any point <em>above</em> the minimum wage threshold since they don’t get a pay boost but now have to contend with higher prices. </p>
<p>I’m not saying you’re trying to accomplish the wrong thing here, we’re all hoping to see positive change, but a flat minimum wage boost across the board will not have the desired effect. The reason it works in smaller venues like certain cities but not across the board is because the surrounding areas don’t get the same artificially inflated costs and thus the money will actually get you more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also assumes general adherence to the 4 day work week. Businesses would try to gain a competitive edge by sticking with the 5 day work week, and many already operate 24/7 out of necessity or to gain that edge. The 5 day 40 hour work week is not as common as it’s made out to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a lot of industries you can't just &quot;pay the same&quot;... For example waitresses who make the majority of their cash from tips.</p>
<p>Likewise many job types require operating 7 days a week, I feel bad for the schmuk the company has to hire who only gets the other 3 days from the 4 day work week....</p>
<p>He either has to get payed even more to equal out the four day work week, or he has to go find a second job.... Completely negating all that extra 'free time' he/she has.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you think that working less hours automatically equals less productivity then yes. However there are studies that show, counterintuitively, that productivity goes <em>up</em> because people are less stressed, tend to not have the &quot;thank fuck it's Friday&quot; feeling, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on company... Call centers, help desks, kiasks, restauraunts, fast food joints, etc etc all require being staffed usually 7 days a week. No amount of &quot;productivity&quot; on the prior days will be enough.</p>
<p>Then we have the people working these jobs who will now be working LESS hours and taking home less money.</p>
<p>Then there are the saps who don't get the 4 day work week and they only get the three day one..... So then they need to go find another job to make up for the lost hours, completely negating all that 'free time' that they now have.</p>
<p>EDIT: I suppose the argument <em>could</em> be made for established careers, like Software Developers, office jobs, etc... Good middle class jobs and above.... Which would only further drive the income inequality between the lower and upper classes lmfao.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would also establish &quot;full time&quot; as 32 hours, so companies who want a worker for that fifth day of the week would basically just pay overtime for that fifth day if the employee wants that.</p>
<p>Which still fulfills its intended purpose of helping the working class via either more leisure time or more pay.</p></div>		</li>
