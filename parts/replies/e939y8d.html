			<div class="markdown"><p>From JR: I have other editors and proofreaders who look over each article once the fact-checking process is complete. But no, there isn't another person like me re-checking every piece of information. That would of course be welcome, but isn't realistic given the time and resource constraints of publishing. Still, readers — especially anyone quoted or cited in a piece — will point out if we've gotten something wrong once a story goes live. If that happens, I'll go back and check my records to see whether I did indeed miss something and issue a correction if needed. </p></div>		</li>
