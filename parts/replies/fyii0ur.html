			<div class="markdown"><p>Newer meaning this is the one that made its way West from China back at the start. It's the same strain we've been dealing with, but the new part is that it's worse than the other one that was around nearer Wuhan at first. That one stayed localish, this one spread globally within months.</p></div>		</li>
