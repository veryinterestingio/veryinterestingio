			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for letting me know that this does indeed contradict itself! I was thinking that maybe I got one of the two wrong, but not being able to pick a truly random number from an infinite set of numbers does explain the contradiction.
Thank you for the great explanation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is one other technical point that I want to make sure is clear. Y'all are discussing the fact that there cannot be a UNIFORM distribution on the natural numbers (this means they are all equally likely). I think this is what a lot of people mean when they say truly random, but this is not a technical term because if you, for example, rolled a die with six sides labelled 1,2,3,4,4,4, it would still be random. But it would be a different distribution than a standard six sided die.</p>
<p>So you CAN have a nonuniform distribution on the natural numbers. For example P(k)= 1/2^k. So there is a 50% probability of picking 1, a 25% probability of getting 2, a 12.5% probability of getting 3, and so on. For this distribution the sum of the probabilities turns out to be 1, even though it is an infinite sum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to respond to see if my understanding of calculus is correct. </p>
<p>Couldn't you argue that the probability of picking a given natural number isn't zero exactly, but approaches zero at the limit? That is, 1/x -&gt; 0 as x -&gt; infty. This is very related to your original answer of the question, but looking at it from a limit perspective. </p>
<p>As for the summation, you could look at it as the limit as x approaches 0 of the sum from k=1 to x of 1/x_k. Since there are always x terms, 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = x, so it sums to x/x = 1. </p>
<pre><code>\lim_{x \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{x} \frac{1}{x_k} = 
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{x} 1_k}{x} =
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1_1 + 1_2 + \dots + 1_{x-1} + 1_x}{x} =
\frac{x}{x} = 
1</code></pre>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is the common meaning of the informal (and formally nonsensical!) statement that a random natural has property x with probability y. To be precise let <code>P(x,N)</code> be the probability that a natural number uniformly selected from the range (0,N) has property x. Then if <code>\lim_{N \to \infty} P(x,N)=y</code> as shorthand one says that the probability of x is y.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that functor7 point doesn't relate to this question, since the event space is <em>countable</em>, as opposed to the real line.... different sort of infinity!!</p>
<p>There is the  same probability,p, for any number, but infinite sum of it is 1 ... Can't happen</p>
<p>As another person has said, you could define a probability over integers based on eg geometric series (  the probabilities have to decrease as you go to infinity)</p></div>		</li>
