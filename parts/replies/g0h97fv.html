			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't as simple as that.  Though it originated among the wealthy (because they were the ones who owned land), it was not purely a gross display of wealth.  It had more to do with the concept of dominion over nature, which was still seen as a hostile force at the time.  Lawn was part of a manicured aesthetic that people considered beautiful and representative of purity, discipline, sophistication, and other aristocratic virtues of the time.  There was a subsequent counter-movement to show a poetic reverence for nature through a wilder, more rugged, &quot;picturesque&quot; aesthetic.  These movements have competed throughout history.</p>
<p>Sprawling pastures, believe it or not, were actually a <em>step down</em> from the tight, geometric control that was expressed over the European landscape during the Renaissance.  Think mowed lawn versus hundreds of trees lined up in star patterns and carved to look like cubes.  But even that approach is an embrace of nature compared to the Medieval perspective - where everything &quot;natural&quot; was locked outside the walls.</p>
<p>As technology has progressed, the fear of nature as an adversary and the derivative ideal of humankind's triumph over it has gradually faded.  It has even reversed, because now we are the ones threatening nature not the other way around.  </p>
<p>These days, we tend to focus on the downsides of lawns - high maintenance, unsustainable, unsupportive of pollinators - and they look as ugly to us as smokestacks.  In Victorian England, both lawns and smokestacks were associated with progress and everyone thought they were gorgeous.</p></div>		</li>
