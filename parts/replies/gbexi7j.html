The water will turn into humidity in the air, which gets picked up by the air conditioning system, condensed into water, and then eventually will make its way back into their drinking water! Pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They probably wash themselfes in a compartement where it's safe to do so. If any liquid floats around the station where it's not supposed to, they have special napkins to soak it up and pockets to collect it.</p>
