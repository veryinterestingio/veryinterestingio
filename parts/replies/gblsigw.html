Here's a good video on how vaccines work. Also a small correction, bacteria and viruses differ way more than just surface area and number of antigens. They are made of completely different things and work differently. Even among bacteria or viruses,
there's a wide range of differences. This write up, as well, isn't the full picture but a small part of how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/Atrx1P2EkiQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Atrx1P2EkiQ</a></p></div>		</li>
