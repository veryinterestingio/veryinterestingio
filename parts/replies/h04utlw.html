			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have been more specific, but I was writing in a bit of a hurry.    </p>
<p>I mentioned the balloon only to show how the universe expanding is essentially the distance between 2 arbitrary points is increasing (ie. the distance between two of the dots will increase as the balloon blows up).    </p>
<p>I didn't mean it as an example of the structure of the universe.  The balloon in this case is just a 2d surface (but one that does &quot;wrap around&quot; with the exception of the opening).  Whereas the universe is spatially 3d, and may or may not wrap around.  It could be infinite too.  Other comments here have gone into more depth on that, and I'm not sure what the general consensus is in the physics community anymore.   It's been a few years since I've left school and moved into an unrelated field!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the criticisms of the rubber balloon analogy.  The analogy captures the basic idea behind expansion, but it also gives athe wrong impression that the universe must be curved intrinsically and have a finite total volume.</p>
<p>Two better analogies I have heard are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Imagine an infinite oven in which you are baking raisin bread.  The raisins are the galaxies; the bread is spacetime.  As the bread bakes, the yeast causes the dough to &quot;rise&quot; and expand, but the raisins stay the same size.  Overall, the dough just gets less dense and more fluffy, and takes up more size.  However, you have to imagine this oven and bread as already infinite in all 3 dimensions of space in order to capture the fact that <em>everywhere</em> is expanding away from everywhere else.</p>
</li>
<li>Imagine an infinite 3D kitchen sponge that extends forever in all directions.  The universe is like this sponge, which starts out in a &quot;compressed&quot; shape â€” as if the sponge were being squeezed, but since it is infinite, it's not being squeezed by hands on the outside, each part of the sponge is being squeezed by the other parts immediately adjacent to it.  Now, over time, the sponge relaxes and stops squeezing so much, causing it to expand and get less dense.  If you think of the actual &quot;spongy material&quot; as galaxies/clusters and filaments, then the empty space between the spongy material represents the voids between galaxies and clusters, which grow in size overall (but the total amount of spongy material you have remains the same, it just gets less dense).</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>
