<p>I get frustrated as soon as I am at someone else's house and they just watch those damn ads every couple of minutes. </p>
<p>That's one of the reasons why I don't watch TV. To watch a movie I have to watch 30 minutes of ads in total. </p>
<p>And as soon as I see the same ad from the same company over and over I start to hate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly correct. OP exhibits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect" target="_blank">consensus bias</a>. The internet behavior and culture of redditors is not representative of the general population, and the original assumption is false.</p></div>		</li>
