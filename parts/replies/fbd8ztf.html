			<div class="markdown"><p>Even assuming the air itself doesn't instantly turn into a black hole, the sun will gain mass so rapidly that it will become a black hole with infinite mass in about <strong>26 hours</strong>. </p>
<hr />
<p>Let's assume the gas is stationary relative to the Cosmic Microwave Background. Then, initially the sun is moving through the gas at about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#Orbit_in_Milky_Way" target="_blank">370 km/s</a>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Any gas captured by the Sun's gravitational potential would change velocity to the Sun's velocity. Then by conservation of momentum, at any time <em>t</em> we have:  </p>
<ul>
<li>m(<em>t</em>) <em> v(<em>t</em>) = m(0) </em> v(0), . . . . . . . . . (1)</li>
</ul>
<p>where m(<em>t</em>) is the mass of the solar system and v(<em>t</em>) is the speed of the sun relative to the CMB, at time <em>t</em> seconds after we introduced the gas.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity" target="_blank">escape velocity</a> equation, we know that any gas getting within 2G m(<em>t</em>) / v(<em>t</em>)^2 of the centre of the sun will be captured. Call this distance the <em>capturing radius</em> r(<em>t</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>r(<em>t</em>) = 2G m(<em>t</em>) / v(<em>t</em>)^(2) . . . . . . . . . . . . (2)</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>So the sun gains mass at a rate of</p>
<ul>
<li>dm/dt = ρ <em> πr(<em>t</em>)^2 </em> v(<em>t</em>), . . . . . . . . . (3)</li>
</ul>
<p>where ρ is the gas density (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_air" target="_blank">1.225 kg / m^(3)</a>), and πr(<em>t</em>)^2 is the area from which the gas will be captured.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Substituting equation (2) into equation (3),</p>
<ul>
<li>dm/dt = ρ <em> π </em> 4G^2 m(<em>t</em>)^2 / v(<em>t</em>)^(3)</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>Using equation (1) to express v(<em>t</em>) in terms of m(<em>t</em>), m(0), and v(0):</p>
<ul>
<li>dm/dt = ρ <em> π </em> 4G^2 * m(<em>t</em>)^5 / m(0)^3 v(0)^3</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>Collecting all the constants:</p>
<ul>
<li>dm/dt = a * m(<em>t</em>)^5</li>
</ul>
<p>where a = <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4+*+pi+*+%28gravitational+constant%29%5E2+*+%28air+density+at+sea+level%29+%2F+%28solar+mass%29%5E3+%2F+%28370+km%2Fs%29%5E3" target="_blank">1.723 x 10^(-127) kg^(-4) s^(-1)</a>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Put this equation into WolframAlpha, with initial condition m(0) = 1.9885 <em> 10^(30) kg (mass of the sun):<br />
[We see that m(<em>t</em>) goes to infinity at 92 800 seconds, which is about 1 day 1 hour 45 minutes.](<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=dM%2Fdt+%3D+%281.723" target="_blank">https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=dM%2Fdt+%3D+%281.723</a></em>10%5E-127%29+<em>+M%5E5%2C+M%280%29+%3D+1.9885</em>10%5E30)</p></div>		</li>

Where would the event horizon start on a big arse blob of air?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But having an area with air density mass with a diameter of 11,455,067,484,050 meters fullfills the Schwarzschield equation. So from outside it would be an immediate black hole... what it would look like on the inside, to be really honest we have no idea if it all would be sucked into the singularity or what happens. But it certainly be a black hole right away...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The equation for the radius of the event horizon has only one term other than constants; and that is mass. </p>
<p>Another thing to consider is, what is the gravity of a ball of stuff? If you are far enough away, all that stuff just looks like a point and pulls on you as uniformly as you can tell.... but if you are inside it, then some of its gravity is opposed by the gravity of other parts; The deeper you go, the less gravity you experience. </p>
<p>Imagine you sent a probe to a cloud that was so far away that we couldn't measure any other gravity but the cloud. As the probe approaches, the cloud appears to expand to take up the probes entire view. As it does, the vector of gravity might wiggle but stays mostly to the center. Once the probe moves into the cloud, gravity begins to reduce, as there is more and more mass behind the probe than in front of it! </p>
<p>So, this massive gravitational effect that bends space and creates a black hole, it doesn't exist at the center of the cloud; because most of the cloud is outside of it and pulling in the wrong direction...in every direction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, and the volume... it's a fact, the bigger a black hole (Schwarzschield radius) goes the less the density, if you fill the orbit of Saturn with water, you get a black hole, and with air I calculated 0.1 light years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Instantly turn into a black hole&quot; Means you won't escape its gravity. It doesn't immediately end everything. Still plenty of time to arrest earth's momentum aside from the pull to the center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly!  But that means that light can't escape, not that there's a singularity at that moment. It'd still take time as everything is pulled together from gravity.</p></div>		</li>
