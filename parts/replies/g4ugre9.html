			<div class="markdown"><p>Came to say this. I worked at Wal-Mart in a small town back in the 90's in the Electronics dept. We sold a crap ton of cordless phone batteries. There was an entire section devoted to them due to all the different models of batteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same.  I'm guessing they must have gotten a lot better in the 2000s or something.  All the cordless phones I had in the 80s and 90s had terrible battery life if you charged them too much or just left them on the dock.  It was an issue that everyone complained about.</p></div>		</li>
