It looks like the cost is $0.045 per credit transfer for the bank - letâ€™s see how much we will get charged...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have OSKO in Australia now, (well, we have for a while actually) participating banks have instantaneous transfers. I send rent to my roommate and he has it in his account before I can even exit the app and lock my phone. No fee's or anything, for the consumer anyways. Transfers are instant 24/7, even on weekends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Banking anywhere isn't perfect, but when I was in Australia (I'm a Yankee) I LOVED it. The transfers (even before OSKO) were SO much faster. And no one used checks, ever. Not to mention, you guys got RFID cards about 5 years before the US even got around to starting to roll them out.</p>
<p>It shocked me how antiquated the US banking system is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My German bank (Deutsche Bank, yeah those scumbags) actually offer instant transfer. It costs about 50ct extra I think, but when you're late for a bill paying 50ct extra is usually cheaper than late fees. I know from experience... That is actually the only reason I am keeping that account instead of using my newer one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Old infrastructure has inertia. Itâ€™s often easier and cheaper to keep going with an old system that still works than to upgrade to a newer one, even when the new one is more efficient. There are a lot of examples of this outside the banking system including the energy grid, telephone infrastructure, transit systems etc. Lots of other countries will overtake the pioneers because they didnâ€™t have as established a system to begin with. They can just pick and choose from the newest technology available.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How do you explain Europe? I'm sure the old continent has had as old, if not older, systems than the new continent. Yet, it's possible to do almost instantaneous transfers in Europe, even between two countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because people in power resist change as it threatens their power directly or indirectly. Imagine you and your buddies of bank CEOs were told that there's a new system that allows better transfers but doesn't change the bottom line. Would you be inclined to implement it knowing that it will cost the company some amount to change their procedures, if not simply time itself which is also a form of money?</p>
<p>This is why governments and structure is important. And why systems need to be updated every couple of years to plug loopholes and problems that come up. But then again, you're now a politician in power, do you make changes or resist it as it could also indirectly affect your power, your standing with others who are powerful in the industries it would affect? </p>
<p>It's only when shit hits the fan, people die, the rest of the world has moved on, or there's money to be made, that most people in power will actually try to do something about it if it matters enough to them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, because then I can advertise that my bank is technologically <em>50 years ahead</em> of all of my domestic competitors, and Iâ€™ll be able to pull customers away from my competition because, as my market research has shown me, customers want to be able to transfer money instantly. By meeting that demand when none of my competitors are able to, Iâ€™ll gain an advantage in the market.</p>
<p>Of course, this line of thinking requires banking executives to actually give half a shit about what their customers want, which they are pathologically unable to do.</p></div>		</li>
