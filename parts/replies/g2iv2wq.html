			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad did these kinds of jobs, and he said he was able to turn almost all of them into workouts. Picking up pipe, do a deadlift and curl. Need to put something over your head, execute a shoulder press. the only thing he couldn't make work was hauling drywall. Though he had the &quot;3/8's grip&quot; or something like that, where he could hold up a double stack of drywall with one hand. He used to do pullups in the basement by grabbing the joists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My arms were huge when I loaded trucks at UPS. I miss random people commenting on how nice my arms looked, but the long term lower back pain and shoulder impingement definitely isn't worth it. </p>
<p>Manual labor can get you ripped, but it's still hard on the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started loading UPS trucks back in March, I've lost so much weight here it's insane. Not package cars, but business bulk loads. So like heavy Barnes and Nobles boxes or home depot or other such BS. I thought I had a back injury a few months ago but it went away somehow, thought it was a nerve thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also most manual labor jobs require the same motion repeatedly. Twisting and jerking is really bad for the joints. Why there are no gym equipment that has you doing these motions with weight. Except for cross fit from what I heard.</p></div>		</li>
