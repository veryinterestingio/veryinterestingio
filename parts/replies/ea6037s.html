			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.bl.uk/the-language-of-birds/articles/how-birds-sing" target="_blank">Birds do not sing only when exhaling. A grasshopper warbler may “reel” for over two minutes, a nightjar may chur continuously for eight minutes, and a skylark may “pour forth its full heart” in completely unbroken song for 18 minutes. To replenish their oxygen these birds must breath in, and must do so while singing. In the case of the nightjar, the bird discernably alternates soft short trills with loud long ones and these short trills are believed to be when the bird inhales. Less continuous singers may also use air travelling in either direction. The white-rumped shama, for example, is believed so to do.</a></p></div>		</li>
