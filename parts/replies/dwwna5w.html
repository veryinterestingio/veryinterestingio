<p>It could be magnetic force, electric force, gravitational force, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly doubt it.  </p>
<p>I think there's a reason why students are told that &quot;this is how things work&quot; when learning Newton in high school, but day two of college/university physics typically starts with &quot;most of what high school physics taught you was a lie (or a half-truth)&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehhh, it's still arguably true-ish in that the observations will always still apply (under certain conditions and use cases). The college course simply goes into the deeper mechanics and explanation of why, then throws some curveballs at you now that you know more. But the information (e.g. Newton's formula for the force of gravity between two objects) still holds until you get to a spot where we have since learned more (specifically, when relativity gets involved). </p>
<p>Another way to put it, one of my stats professors once said during syllabus week &quot;In high school they taught you the best possible knowledge we had up until the early 1800s. In freshman year you were brought up to the late 1800s and the prerequisite for this course got you to about 1920. Our next stop is 1950 or 1960. You can take a 400-level elective to get up to 1980 and a master's thesis for the 1990s, but if you want anything past the year 2000, there are PhD applications in my office.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's better that way. </p>
<p>I jumped straight into AP Physics C as my first physics class, and our teacher was known for being very smart and quite eccentric. He taught us things that you would learn in an advanced college physics class, and while it was interesting and all, I found myself floundering a bit as I didn't already have the basis on Newtonian physics that he was expounding on or showing the &quot;true&quot; definition of.</p></div>		</li>
