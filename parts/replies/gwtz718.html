			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it's pretty hard to tell. Think of how things sounded on the coldest day you've ever experienced vs. the warmest. You could probably tell the difference if you somehow switched back and forth really fast, but I myself couldn't tell you what cold/hot weather really sounds like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water and air decibels aren't the same thing. I can't remember the exact relationship, but I remember thinking that it was very interesting!</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> ok, I did a quick Google because I was curious. To convert water decibels to air decibels you subtract 63. So that 235 in water is the equivalent of 172db in air. It's the result of a difference in reference pressure and medium impedence.</p></div>		</li>
