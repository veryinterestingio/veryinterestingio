			<div class="markdown"><p>As we age, there is a deterioration in the quantity and quality of immune responses to infection and vaccination. This concept is known as immunosenescence. There is an evolving understanding of this phenomenon but much is yet to be known. Some of the factors that contribute to immunosenescence include: reduction in the number and function of phagocytes (cells that gobble up and get rid of bacteria, dead cells and other weird stuff), reduction in the cytotoxicity of the so-called Natural Killer cells (the most badass name in biology), impairment of antigen presenting cells that play a role in displaying antigens to other cells of the immune system, reduction in the populations of B cells (cells that produce antibodies), and many other age related changes. </p>
<p>Given the ubiquitous role of the immune system in human health, development of deployable interventions to mitigate, or even reverse, age-related immunosenescence will be a major breakthrough.</p>
<p>It is not recommended to check the MMR titers of vaccinated individuals. I discuss the need for boosters elsewhere in this AMA.</p></div>		</li>
