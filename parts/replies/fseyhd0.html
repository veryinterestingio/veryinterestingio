			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people who know the meaning of Chinese characters will also know their Pinyin (the Chinese word written in Western alphabet, like &quot;ni hao&quot; instead of 你好)</p>
<p>Generally in China, if you're typing into a phone or computer, you type the Pinyin and use the keyboard or interface to make sure that the characters with the correct tone/meaning are being typed. </p>
<p>So assuming a deaf person is familiar with these, they'd probably recognize that two different Chinese characters have the same Pinyin.</p>
<p>However, in pre-globalization China--before Pinyin existed--my (uneducated, uninformed) guess is that a literate deaf person would be much less likely to pick up on written puns like these. Especially because speakers different dialects of Chinese will find one piece of text mutually intelligible, but if they were to read it aloud to each other, they would sound completely different and likely not understand each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering if you can expand on the mutual intelligibility of written text between dialects of Chinese. I've heard before that Mandarin and Cantonese are written in a very similar way, yet pronounced totally differently. So hypothetically, if a Mandarin and Cantonese person are trying to converse, they won't be able to understand each other, yet they could write down what they're saying to each other and be able to understand each other's writing.</p>
<p>How does that work, exactly? As an English speaker that's hard to wrap my head around. Every dialect of English is grammatically identical for the most part, they only differ in pronunciation. Even dialects like Jamaican English, or Scots English, which can sound quite different at first, are actually just regular English with a lot of slang and can be easily understood by any English speaker who is used to the accent and knows the slang.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly. In Cantonese, 布吉岛 is read as Bow-Gudd-Dou, but 不知道 is read as Buut-Zii-Dou.</p>
<p>EDIT: Try it out <a href="https://www.chineseconverter.com/cantonesetools/en/cantonese-text-to-sound" target="_blank">yourself</a>! Just copy paste the two phrases and listen it for yourself!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could almost do something like this (Japanese not Chinese but the same principle applies to both):</p>
<p>令臼の夫汽は睛れです。朋臼の牛煎申まで诜瓘臼知です。</p>
<p>The characters are totally wrong but if you kinda squint it’s approaching readable.</p>
<p>For comparison the correct sentence is:</p>
<p>今日の天気は晴れです。明日の午前中まで洗濯日和です。</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually can do this in Japanese with kana. It looks like the below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>こちにんは みさなん おんげき ですか？ わしたは げんき です。 </p>
<p>この ぶんょしう は いりぎす の ケブンッリジ だがいく の けゅきんう の けっか にんんげは たごんを にしんき する ときに その さしいょ と さいご の もさじえ あいてっれば じばんゅん は めくちちゃゃ でも ちんゃと よめる という けゅきんう に もづいとて わざと もじの じんばゅん を いかれえて あまりす。 </p>
<p>どでうす？ ちんゃと よゃちめう でしょ？</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this would be the equivalent way of doing it, rather than using homonyms which have both different shapes and different meanings. </p>
<p>Here the shape of clusters of characters is intact despite each individual character taking on a different meaning (as opposed to gibberish when done in English), and overall the sentence remains understandable due to much of the shape being preserved.</p></div>		</li>
