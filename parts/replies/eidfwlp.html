			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I see! I noticed you don't usually see any birds over a huge area and thought there might be some infrastructure in place to prevent birds from being a nuisance (like emitting frequencies which would be annoying to the birds).
Thanks for the answer though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Airport sounds don’t really affect birds. Yes they will scatter when a huge airplane is nearby but they will go back eventually. </p>
<p>Airports have a lot of things birds find attractive like retention ponds for water and areas of grass where they can chill out and have a bite to eat at. There may also be some stuff outside the airport environment that attracts birds. Such as a landfill or a lake that the airport has no control over. In this case, the birds are not staying on the airport but are just flying through on their way to and from a place. </p>
<p>Airports deploy a list of measures against birds like noise guns, trained hawks, trained canines, and stationary statues like owls to try and scare the birds. But eventually the birds will be back. </p>
<p>The best way to get rid of birds is to take away the stuff they find attractive. You can’t really take away water from the retention ponds but you can sort of take away their grass. Letting the grass grow out is effective because the birds can’t look out for predatory birds so they feel vulnerable because they don’t have a clear view of their surroundings like a freshly mowed wide open field would be. The downside to this is that unkept fields do not look very nice at airports. </p>
<p>Another solution is to only worry about birds when aircraft are actually using the airport. In this situation the airport would deploy nose devices and such a few minutes before an aircraft arrives or departs. </p>
<p>Birds are also really dumb. When they see a predator (airplane) approach, they usually dive down to get away. So sometimes they dive down onto an aircraft. They also don’t have the ability to perceive threats very well. Say a bird sees a predator. They won’t react until the predator may be 30 feet away. So as long as a predator is 31 feet away they don’t really care about it but once that predator is 30 feet away they freak out. Well, airplanes move a lot faster than their natural predators. So by the time a bird perceives the plane as a threat, it is too late for them to react. </p>
<p>I’m not an expert on this stuff but I did take some airport management classes. I am however, an expert in bird law. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work as a pilot, and I can assure you that what u/WRSaunders says is correct about the airports not being bird free. There are a lot of birds in the aerodromes. They usually feast on worms in the ground next to the runway wiuthout fear of predators, and actually do not bother too much with the sound of roaring engines from departing traffic; they temporarily fly away  and land straight back to contineue feasting (to my unfortunate experience, twice, hitting the nosecone of the aircraft). During bird mitigation seasons, ATC actively report this bird activity as a caution before start-up.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Often the aerodrome operators have their airport patrol officers drive a car along the runway or grass to scare them away for any departing or landing traffic. If you ever walk near a runway during early summer, you might hear some gunshots as well, and often fireworks. Works wonders!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: When we get a good rainfall, we'll often just let the seagulls  show up and do worm cleanup for us. If the ceiling is low and we're light on traffic, we'll just &quot;escort&quot; the gulls slowly around the manoeuvering areas so they can gorge on the worms. After that, we send out the runway sweepers to finish the job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The grass is cut to a length that birds don’t like. The CAA guidance is:</p>
<p>Aerodrome grassland has the potential to provide food, security and nesting habitats for a variety of birds. Studies and fact based research over many years has determined that grass that is maintained at a height of 200-300 mm with minimal levels of weed infestation has been proven to reduce the presence of upright stems and the majority of hazardous bird species. This method of grass management is often referred to as a 'long grass policy' (or LGP) In the majority of cases throughout the UK, a LGP may prove to be the most effective programme to adopt,</p>
<p>Take away their ability to roost, feed and see predators and you will reduce the number of birds. Landscaping and dense vegetation also attracts birds and small mammals, so lots of longish grass is the way forward. You still have problems with transiting birds, but these can be seasonal or even daily and you will soon learn their patterns. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was at this airport for a number of hours last fathers day (father in law wanted to see an old plane they were flying) I kept hearing gunshots and when I asked about it someone told me they fire off blank shells to scare birds away. I have no idea if this is true but it sounds like a fun job.</p></div>		</li>
