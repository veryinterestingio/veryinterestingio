			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also how some bacteria get through the stomach acid. Some, like C. diff, can turn into a spore which is inactive like an egg but highly resistant to chemical disinfectant and digestion. Once in a more hospitable environment, they become an active bacteria again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also why puncture wounds tend to lead to tetanus. Rust has very little to do with it, except that itâ€™s a common infection vector. Tetanus starts as a dormant spore that can survive pretty much anywhere humans can. Often found in soil, which is where lots of people come into contact with jagged stabby rusty things, thus the common myth that rust=tetanus.</p>
<p>When the spore comes into contact with blood, it blooms and oxygen will quickly kill the (now bloomed) bacteria. So surface-level cuts and scrapes arenâ€™t a big concern, because itâ€™s just sitting on the surface and dies as soon as it blooms in the open air. But a puncture is bad because the spores get pushed into the wound, then bloom inside the body without any free oxygen to kill it off.</p>
<p>The result of the puncture is a tetanus infection; Not because of rust, but because the tetanus spores were able to survive in an oxygen-free environment after blooming.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A kind of unrelated question, but how do our gut bacteria survive? Are our intestines not so acidic?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, intestines are neutral on the ph scale. Actually can confirm that it is painful if they do become acidic (when my stomach gets too acidic, it releases some of the acid into my intestines. It literally feels like I could have appendicitis).</p></div>		</li>
