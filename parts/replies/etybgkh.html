			<div class="markdown"><p>Metal's higher density would largely offset its lower specific heat capacity for cubes of equivalent volume. Water still has the edge over metals even on a per volume basis, but it's not the factor of 8 that one gets on a per mass basis. For cubes of the same volume, the  factor is more like 1.2 or 1.3 depending on the metal.   </p>
<p>The latent heat contribution from melting ice, on the other hand, would be roughly triple that from the heat exchanged in warming the ice to its melting point and then to room temperature, with no counterpart from the metal cubes. Therefore, I think that latent heat is the real issue to dwell on.</p>
<p>But the catch with latent heat is that it, by definition, is absorbed when the ice melts. And when very much ice melts, it makes the drink taste flat. Hence the whiskey stones mentioned by others, made possible (though perhaps not convenient) by the higher density of metals as noted above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The density of the metal cubes has another aspect: steel weighs about 8 grams per cubic cm, and water 1 gram (8kg and 1kg per liter). Meaning that a mojito and some other ice applications could be unwieldy. </p>
<p>Also, hot water rises. Due to its low density, ice also rises, meaning that the hottest water is always in contact with ice. Metal would settle at the bottom, potentially not cooling the top of a tall glass as well. Not sure how big that effect could be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, with metal cube drink’s temperature would rise gradually. Where with ice melting, the drink’s temperature would gradually fall to 32 degrees Fahrenheit and stay there while the cube melts. Ice water is what we use to check temperature probe accuracy in commercial refrigeration (grocery stores).</p></div>		</li>

<p>If this is a constant issue for you then you should buy some reusable ice cubes. Little plastic cubes filled with water that you refreeze after every use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about that... but there is an idea of using materials with a high latent heat of fusion for regulating the temperature of a house.  </p>
<p>Imagine something that melts at room temperature, but has a very high heat of fusion. It freezes over night... but then requires a huge amount of energy to melt. So your house stays cool during the day. Then as night approaches, your house is shielded by layers of liquid material that slowly freezes. This prevents your house from getting too cold at night.</p>
<p>Instead of all that energy transferring into and out of your house... it is being buffered by something that repeatedly melts and freezes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read once that you get a similar effect from “just” having overly thick concrete walls. They provide the same sink/source for heat energy, just without the phase change/heat of fusion bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would also take a huge amount of energy to freeze, right (heat of solidification is always equal and opposite)? So this would be useful in climates that have large disparities between day and night temperature e.g. deserts.</p>
<p>Although it sounds like it could be harnessed there as a buffer like you said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's neat, but that won't work in all climates/all seasons.</p>
<p>In the Northeastern US for instance, that would work well for early summer, where it becomes 60 at night and 80 during the day. However, during the winter it's below 60 degrees constantly for probably 4 months in a row. At minimum you'll need heating (and cooling for warmer climates) in addition to that material.</p>
<p>And then I speculate it might be more cost effective to have geothermal heating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question. There's a selection of materials on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_fusion" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> page but water has the highest latent heat.</p>
<p>Of note is sodium acetate, which is almost as high as water but at 58C, and can be supercooled to room temperature without crystals forming. When crystalisation is triggered it then rises to 58C. They're used in pocket warmers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that Hydrogen does, but that comes with its own issues, namely being gaseous and explosive.</p>
<p>Also &quot;heat capacity&quot; and &quot;latent heat&quot; are different things. The first is how much energy it takes to warm per degree C, the second is how much energy it takes to change state - remembering that when a substance is changing state, the temperature is constant.</p>
<p>This is why ice is so good: it doesn't just cool the drink, but holds it at ~melting point. It also has the added visual advantage of showing you when the drink is warmer than ideal by disappearing. You can then just plop some more ice in to drop the temp again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Plus metal 'ice cubes' do exists, and they have one main advantage - if you don't want your beverage to become diluted with water. E.g. you want your whiskey a little cooler, but want to retain it's purity.</p></div>		</li>
