			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought I was the only one. I can’t touch styrofoam and I absolutely hate the sound it makes when it rubs on things. Pulling it out of a box, my teeth clench and I wince hard just thinking about it. It feels and sounds very “dry” if that makes sense. Sometimes cotton balls give me this same sensation, but not always.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are at least three of us!  Squeaking styrofoam (it was tough to even type that, lol) gives me the chillies.  EEK.</p></div>		</li>
