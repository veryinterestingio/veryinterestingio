<p>You put newspaper in the bottom, light it up and you have a cauldron of flame in ten minutes or so. No branches or lighter fluid required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got one of these about a month ago. Made starting a BBQ so trivial that I have started grilling a few times a week now. The best investment that I have made.light something flammable underneath, wait 10-25 minutes depending on the charcoal then pour it out into the grill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charcoal is roasted wood. The methane, water vapor and other fractionals vaporize and disappear, and what is left is mostly carbon, which oxidizes MUCH hotter than the 451 degrees wood burns at. </p>
<p>Natural gas is made much the same way, roasting coal in huge ovens. The methane is driven off, captured, dried, etc. What's left over, much like wood, is called &quot;coke&quot;,which is typically used to smelt iron into steel, except, being originally part of the biosphere, coal has EVERYTHING in it (lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury, etc.), and coke has to be treated a little differently.</p>
<p>Henry Ford worked out a deal with Kingsford to make charcoal with the scrap wood left over from Ford's spoke making plant. Folks could buy a Model T and get a free charcoal grill, so they could go see the country in their new Ford and have a cook-out.</p></div>		</li>
