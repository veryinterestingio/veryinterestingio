			<div class="markdown"><p>What if it's not feasibly possible to take prisoners in a given situation considering the resources of the non-surrendering army at the time? I'm sure there are many situations where you wouldn't have enough guards or places to lock up all the other army's soldiers who claim to be surrendering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an infamous video of a helicopter or drone aiming at a guy, and the guy dropping his weapons and surrendering. AFAIK the pilot radioed it in, some lawyer decided that since an aircraft can't take prisoners you can't surrender to an aircraft, and shortly after the guy was pink mist.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the &quot;rules of war&quot; were agreed upon before aircraft were used in war, so the US (and various other nations) argue that enemies cannot surrender to aircraft because there's no practical way of doing so.</p>
<p>Imagine an Apache helicopter engaging a few dozen troops. If those troops could all just drop their guns and throw their hands in the air to avoid being disseminated, they would. The helicopter then has no way of actually capturing these surrendered troops, so it'd just leave and the &quot;surrendered&quot; troops would just go back to doing whatever they were doing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>After receiving the lawyer's advice, the pilots reported that the men had by now got back into their truck and were attempting to drive on.</p>
<p>At first the fresh attack failed. &quot;Individuals have run into another shack,&quot; the crew signalled. As the Apache hovered high in the sky, a few miles north of Baghdad, the pilots viewed a zoomed-in image of the fleeing pair on their video screen.</p>
<p>The crew then received a further specific top-level kill instruction from brigade HQ and made another strafing run, firing bursts from long distance at 300 rounds a minute from the Apache's 30mm cannon. This time, the gunner succeeded in killing both men.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting read, I remember hearing this story once upon a time.</p>
<p>I’m still a little iffy on that lawyer’s judgement, but I never did hear the part where they got back in their truck and continued driving away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You get into legal and moral grey area. First of all, it's usually less resources intensive to take prisoners than to fight them. A couple of guys can hold them at gunpoint, but if you had to fight them, you probably gonna need a similar number of armed men to fight them to the death. Remember that an army have logistical lines, with a chain of command and supporting unit. It's just to their advantage to put a small amount of resources to take them prisoners, than to risk losing a lot more resources fighting them.</p>
<p>Now if a unit would be put into danger by taking prisoner, I don't have the knowledge to answer you, but my guess would be that if they can prove that, they wouldn't be guilty of a war crime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are mostly correct, except for the need to prove that you couldn't take them prisoner. Under international law, you have obligations to prisoners, but no obligation to take prisoners. Now, your military may have different rules that you can be punished for breaking, and public opinion can turn against you, but it's not a war crime to refuse to take prisoners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>psychologically, there is EVERY ' reason' to take prisonors. defeat is a highly contagious and rapidly spreading occurence once it becomes apparent that 1 side will definately lose. who wants to die in a hopeless war ? the 1st Gulf War is a perfect example. the majority of Sadass Insane's suddenly mushroomed occupation ' army' in Kuwait wasn't regular troops but instead were civilians rounded up off street corners and taken from high school classes, given very little training, armed and put in the desert ill equipt for their task with officers and NCOs who were mediocre at best. add in being subjected to 42 days of accurate almost daily Allied airstrikes particularly targeting critical fresh water tankers most were very rapidly reduced to all but dying of thirst without ever firing a single shot. up on the beginining of the actual ground war the Allied forces swiftly found that simply pulling up in sight of but just beyond the range of the thirsty defender's weapons and stopping, pulling out water bottles and drinking about half of it and then pouring the rest onto the blazing hot sand was more than enough to induce mass surrenders of almost entire units of thirst crazed Iraqis who just desperately wanted to survive. this didnt ' work' with the infamous Iraqi Republican Guards units or every Iraqi Army unit but for most it DID.</p></div>		</li>
