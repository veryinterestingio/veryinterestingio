<p>Water typically doesn't make it to the stratosphere, and the little water in the stratosphere is mostly in ice at cold temperatures.  Ozone is a more common molecule than water vapor in the statosphere.  </p>

<p>As for oxygen molecules, they aren't very reactive, since they are a pretty stable bond without some significant excess energy (heat, fire).  Free chlorine or bromine will usually just bump off those.  But when chlorine or bromine radicals bump into ozone, they pull off less stable third oxygen to form ClO or BrO + O2.  </p></div>		</li>
