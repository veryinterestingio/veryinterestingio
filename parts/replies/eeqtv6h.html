			<div class="markdown"><p>In my thermodynamics class we learned that feeling cold when wet has more to do with the state change of water from liquid to gas being endothermic, meaning that evaporation of water particles consumes heat energy from the body. Maybe this is a larger factor when you have an influx of dry air (wind) driving evaporation due to changes in the vapor pressure? This stuff is not very fresh in my mind at this time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water has a high specific heat/heat of vaporization, in other words it take a a lot of energy to warm up water molecules in comparison to other materials. If itâ€™s easier for water to evaporate, it takes more heat energy with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats how sweat works too, it absorbs body heat to evaporate which cools the body down. The other factor is that liquids are better conductors than air generally. Cold feeling isnt really an indicator of what temperature an object is but how fast its sapping heat from your body. Thats why a good conductor at room temperature (a metal block) feels colder than an insulator at room temperature (a piece of wool) even though they are at the same temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like a guy above said, wetness is our bodies detecting the change in temperature due to water, and the water in your blood will evaporate eventually. Normally blood would be heated due to your body temperature, but soon it would cool and you would feel the wetness.</p></div>		</li>
