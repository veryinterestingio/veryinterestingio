			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on which cold virus. Several viruses cause cold symptoms. Each type of virus will have its own duration of immunity. Some colds are caused by harmless coronaviruses (in contrast to the current novel coronavirus). Immunity to those lasts a few years. However, the viruses don’t mutate much, your body forgets what they look like. </p>
<p>Flu, on the other hand, is constantly changing. Our body remembers what 2005 looks like if we got it, but 2005 flu looks very different now, so our defense is weak or worthless. (There are several strains of flu circulating at a time)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So could having a cold or flu help prevent you from becoming infected with even more, different, versions of colds and flus until you recover? Hypothetically: say I had the flu just as the Coronavirus was spreading in the US in mid March... Assuming I had a normal H1N1 type flu and not covid 19, then maybe the flu helped prevent me from catching it if i was exposed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article that said that said when your immune system ramps up due to an infection, it becomes more vigilant. So if you were recently sick it might slightly decrease the chances or duration of a new infection, even if it's a different type (cold vs flu).</p>
<p>If you get infected by a virus that's <em>similar</em> but not identical to one you've had before, there's something called cross-reactivity where your antibodies might get a partial match for the new virus (not as effective as a more specific match). It's most commonly mentioned in relation to the flu, where the flu shot might give you partial protection against a new mutation.</p>
<p>The situation gets more complicated for SARS-CoV-2. There's some speculation over whether antibodies from other human coronaviruses (e.g. cold coronaviruses) can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. A <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.993097v1.full.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> testing cross-reactivity between the new coronavirus and the original SARS-CoV found that while the antibodies could each target the other virus, they failed to neutralize the related virus, which could theoretically lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement" target="_blank">Antibody-Dependent Enhancement</a> (ADE) where a weak antibody response could prevent the body from mounting a proper response. There's only a handful of viruses that are believed to exhibit this ADE effect, but the SARS family is suspected to be one of them.</p>
<p>Edit: Technically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin" target="_blank">original antigenic sin</a> is the broader concept for a weak response caused by antibodies from a previous infection. ADE is the &quot;trojan horse&quot; effect, akin to bringing a criminal into a police station without taking away their weapons. Also a disclaimer that the extent of my knowledge on any of these topics is basically limited to wikipedia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that elderly people show a delayed immune response to SARS-Covid-2 which could explain the rapid worsening in their symptoms, but I don’t know if they would have a ramped up immune system if they were recently sick with cold/flu, or rather a fatigued body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a research team currently working on this with the idea of creating a mega flu vaccine. I believe the idea is similar to allergy therapy, where you give sequential controlled exposures to minimal threat viruses. Not sure what status they are at though</p>
<p>Edit: although I don't think catching flu won't do anything to help you against covid. With a good likelihood, flu could damage your lunch tissues (Even minorly) and make your covid symptoms worse. I will bet that studies looking at diagnosed flu cases earlier in the year followed by covid cases will be looked at once there's time to collate the data. I won't be surprised if people who had a tough time with flu also have a tough time with covid, but it could be more correlative than causative</p></div>		</li>
