			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. But this is similar to the active cables in that they have active electronics that convert the electrical signals of the HDMI connector to optical signals through the cable and then back again at the other end. This means they do not need as much power amplification as similar length active cables because fiber optics have less loss. The fiber optic cables are also thinner then copper cables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more for people who want a physical cable still, but <em>need</em> higher bandwidth for things like 8K or whatever. They're pretty expensive, so I usually just recommend an HDMI balun instead. Those use traditional Ethernet cables to send HDMI signals and are upgradable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't HDMI also parallel and not serial, leading to timing issues?  I was of the impression that Displayport was serial and HDMI was parallel, hence the former's more simple cable construction, and presumably longer theoretical length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are partially right. HDMI is a strange hybrid between parallel and serial. The channels are using digitally encoded serial differential signals which enables error correction and clock syncronization for each channel. But then they are using seperate channels for RGB and sync. This does make it simpler to convert between analog video signals and HDMI as each channel is a seperate analog to digital serial converter while still giving the same benefits of modern differential serial signals used everywhere. However because this is used everywhere you now typically use the same serdes chips for everything including USB, DisplayPort, Ethernet, HDMI, SATA and PCIe.</p></div>		</li>
