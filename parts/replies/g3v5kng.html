I don’t have time to give a detailed reply right now, but I only know because I just listened to a podcast episode all about them thanks to the podcast “Stuff you should know” (thanks Josh and chuck!)
If you or anyone else is interested I’d highly recommend giving it a listen, an hour long, from feb 20th of 2020, available anywhere you get podcasts!</p>
<p>Edit: here’s a link through Apple podcasts for those interested!

<p>And for the record, if you’re interested in learning random stuff, which is part of my motivation for coming to this sub, then their podcast has literally <em>hundreds if not thousands</em> of episodes spanning years, some short some long! Plus they’re just a joy to listen to!</p></div>		</li>
