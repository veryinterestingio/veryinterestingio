<p>Here’s a source talking about it: <a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/moving-spots-in-blue-sky" target="_blank">https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/moving-spots-in-blue-sky</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Floaters are also a thing but different from what I’m talking about. Floaters tend to stay in the same position relative to the direction you’re looking. The things I’m talking about move around on their own even if your eyes remain still.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I saw someone that originally commented below me say that it stays with you from around age 8 and through the rest of your life, but I never see them anymore. </p>
<p>I just remember being a kid and seeing them all the time and actually never thought about it again until my son mentioned it the other night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes from a guy years ago first reading about the 1970's German terrorist group the Red Army Faction, also known as the Baader-Meinhoff gang, and shortly after finding another, completely different, reference to them.</p>
<p>&quot;Frequency illusion, also known as the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, is a cognitive bias in which, after noticing something for the first time, there is a tendency to notice it more often, leading someone to believe that it has a high frequency (a form of selection bias). It occurs when increased awareness of something creates the illusion that it is appearing more often. Put plainly, the frequency illusion is when &quot;a concept or thing you just found out about suddenly seems to crop up everywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The name &quot;Baader–Meinhof phenomenon&quot; was derived from a particular instance of frequency illusion in which the Baader–Meinhof Group was mentioned. In this instance, it was noticed by a man named Terry Mullen, who in 1994 wrote a letter to a newspaper column in which he mentioned that he had first heard of the Baader–Meinhof Group, and shortly thereafter coincidentally came across the term from another source. After the story was published, various readers submitted letters detailing their own experiences of similar events, and the name 'Baader–Meinhof phenomenon' was coined as a result.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
