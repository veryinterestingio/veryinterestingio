			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried that a few times. A lot of my dreams are very chaotic, irrational, and illogical, and always contain symbols/objects there exists no words for. It takes a while to describe those symbols in simple terms, and the more you write the less sense it starts to make. It does help me remembering dreams though, or fragments of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you don’t necessarily need to put a memory outside of a dream to your long term memory to at least be able to remember it slightly. I know I ate quark a few hours ago and went to the gym but sometimes I forget a dream when I was asleep just a few minutes ago. I’ll take what you said with two grains of salt and wait for a better answer. Thanks for making me think though... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually everything you recall is long term memory. Human short term memory is less than a minute, iirc, so anything beyond that is long term memory. It just varied hoe strong your memories are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay thanks for correcting me. So your answer would be something like:
You don’t put dreams in long term memory but you do put other memories in long term memory?</p>
<p>If that’s your answer, then why do I put other memories like what I ate last night and what I saw in the mall today in my long term memory when I’m not even trying but that doesn’t happen when I dream about a dragon eating my ass?</p></div>		</li>
