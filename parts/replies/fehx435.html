I didn't have the &quot;cool 1&quot; from Home Alone II or whatever (Talkboy?), but rather a more functional non-toy unit. I had some good times with that, recording prank phone calls and hijinks like that (placing the recorder on the earpiece of a 2nd phone not being used for the call) lol I did some creative shit..</p></div>		</li>
