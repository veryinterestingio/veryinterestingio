			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here.  I had the 20 hair mustache in my early 20's and the beard had bare spots so i didnt do either.  By 25/26 could grow a 'stache and by late 50's full on beard.   No one else in my family was like this.  Who knows?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetics and hair follicle density.</p>
<p>I’m 35, I didn’t shave for 6 months and I have a thin, peach fuzz-y kind of beard. My facial hair is straight, light colored (a mix of blonde, white, red and brown), and my hair follicles aren’t closely placed. </p>
<p>I do, however, still have a full head of hair</p></div>		</li>
