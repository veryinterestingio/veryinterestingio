<p>Also, some relevant stats in another real estate article: <a href="https://www.allpropertymanagement.com/blog/post/what-climate-change-means-for-coastal-real-estate-values/" target="_blank">https://www.allpropertymanagement.com/blog/post/what-climate-change-means-for-coastal-real-estate-values/</a></p>
<p>And a research paper: <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabb32" target="_blank">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabb32</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate gentrification: from theory to empiricism in Miami-Dade County, Florida</p>
<p>This article provides a conceptual model for the pathways by which climate change could operate to impact geographies and property markets whose inferior or superior qualities for supporting the built environment are subject to a descriptive theory known as 'Climate Gentrification.' The article utilizes Miami-Dade County, Florida (MDC) as a case study to explore the market mechanisms that speak to the operations and processes inherent in the theory. This article tests the hypothesis that the rate of price appreciation of single-family properties in MDC is positively related to and correlated with incremental measures of higher elevation (the 'Elevation Hypothesis'). As a reflection of an increase in observed nuisance flooding and relative SLR, the second hypothesis is that the rates of price appreciation in lowest the elevation cohorts have not kept up with the rates of appreciation of higher elevation cohorts since approximately 2000 (the 'Nuisance Hypothesis'). The findings support a validation of both hypotheses and suggest the potential existence of consumer preferences that are based, in part, on perceptions of flood risk and/or observations of flooding.</p>

<p>I know this isn't what the paper studied, but it seems to me that when you're thinking about buying a multi-million dollar beach home (which seems to be most beach homes these days)... you can afford the insurance. You don't care if it floods. It's an acceptable risk to you because you're wealthy enough that no single disaster could possibly take everything from you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insurance companies will often not cover damage from floods if the structure is in an area known to be prone to flooding. Doesn't matter to a billionaire but there are plenty of beach houses owned by people who are rich but not <em>that</em> rich. </p>
<p>Also consider that we aren't just talking literal beachfront property. In places like south Florida there are huge areas that are vulnerable to flooding which can be miles inland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having survived a flood, I'm afraid you're underestimating the impact of natural disasters, regardless of wealth. Some things are irreplaceable: mementos, photo albums, grandma's ashes. If you're not there in time—and I wasn't—these things are lost forever. Time is also a factor. It's no mean feat to purchase a new home, to relocate whatever remains of your material possessions, buy all the new kitchen equipment you spent a lifetime acquiring, and on and on. Wealth doesn't save you from having to supervise all these, even if you can contract everything else out.</p>
<p>It's a real dickshow. I do not recommend. It was such an enormous interruption that I sort of mentally separate my life between the antediluvian and the postdiluvian. Eight years on, I <em>still</em> find myself searching for certain items, only to realize I must have lost them in the flood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Miami Dade is really skewed because prior to the recent boom most homes along the coast line were already really high valued already, almost out of reach for most people. While the neighborhoods being developed maybe 7 years ago you could get a house for less than 100k.  Alot of real estate investors bought those up and sometimes they sell for 600-700k, or if they get bought by a developer they sell for over a million. One thing also skewing the data it is that little Haiti was massively developed into the design district and there are a stretch of high rise condos being built right down the interior through midtown, so all those run down houses were bought by developers. </p>
<p>I don't think looking at the aggregate is really accurate for that, as this is happening all along the Miami River too which is a major flood zone area.  You really have to see it to believe it, as recent as 2016 many of these neighborhoods you wouldn't want to walk down that street.  Now the houses sell for almost a million and condos and apartments are springing up everywhere. You notice alot of changes in a single year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how the US system works. But in EU while real estate price doesn't drop. Home insurance premiums are based on the &quot;risk&quot; of your area. And quite a few areas have been re classed due to climate change. Thus while these peoples home hasn't dropped in value there insurance premium has doubled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The United States has a federally funded flood insurance program. This program is deeply flawed because it isn't priced adequately which distorts the market by encouraging people to build in areas that are going to flood. Then there's also political pressure to prevent legislation that will prevent people from building in these areas. </p>
<p>Fresh air had a show about this recently:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just listened to this the other day (Terry Gross rules btw.. and Dave Davies is pretty solid too).</p>
<p>One of the important notes that the interviewee makes is that a few years ago the federal program that writes flood insurance policies started to move to a pricing model that actually priced the insurance based on risk... which is EXACTLY what insurance is supposed to do.</p>
<p>People lost their shit when they realized their new premium would be considerably higher than before.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those people had some powerful connections that were able to reshape the program to return to a system where taxpayers are subsidizing people in these high-flood-risk areas.</p>
<p>From the interview:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2012, there was a serious attempt to reform the program that would  have introduced higher premiums and shifted the risk back onto property  owners in a more rational way.  </p>
<p>And...the legislation passed by large numbers in both the  House and Senate and was adopted. And as soon as it came into play,  people began to see what it would do, and all of a sudden, all hell  broke loose. The property owners, the politicians, the mayors all began  to object that these rates were going to drive people away from the  coast. So then the politicians in Washington, including the backers of  the original legislation, withdraw, and we end up passing new  legislation that slowed down rate increases and even reversed some of  the rate increases. And that's where we stand today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the piece, there is $3 trillion worth of property built in coastal areas potentially at risk and a federal insurance program that is effectively running at a perpetual loss with $0 of reserves insuring a good deal of that $3 trillion worth of property.</p>
<p>Crazy stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is just floods being subsidized against in this way, though. Other types of disasters made more prominent or frequent by climate change will still cause insurance prices to rise.</p>
<p>A recent, prominent example is the wildfires in California. Insurance rates in California are skyrocketing due to the effects of the fires over the past few years, as insurers now have data saying that policies in fire-prone areas are severely underpriced. Some insurance companies went out of business paying the losses from those fires, and now basically no carrier wants to touch fire-prone areas. Residents are going to be increasingly forced into the surplus insurance market, which isn't cheap.</p>
<p>Insurance costs are going to start putting a significant economic disincentive to building and living in fire-prone areas of California.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In  NZ, the massively increased insurance cost for flood or earthquake-prone dwellings can significantly devalue them. For some properties, insurance is simply not available.  If you can't insure, you can't get a loan. The inability to insure is a relatively new thing (the insurance industry is changing its approach to risk in NZ), but we are likely to see significant drops in value relative to non-risky property in the years to come.</p></div>		</li>
