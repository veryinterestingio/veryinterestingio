			<div class="markdown"><p>AM stands for amplitude modulation and FM stands for frequency modulation. Color is determined by frequency in wave length. It’s a pretty good analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d say it’s essentially perfect, you could use frequency and amplitude modulation with visible light just fine. </p>
<p>Likely different circuitry though, the frequencies are much higher. That might cause issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't just an analogy it is the real thing. Light is only a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radio waves form another portion of the same spectrum, so indeed, they are &quot;light&quot; to a radio receiver. If your radio had eyes that see light in the radio wave spectrum, it would see exactly this on AM and FM :)</p>
<p>PS: I am ready to be corrected by Smarties here. No need to be vulgar :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also an important distinction is that with FM radio, the light can <em>always</em> be as bright as your equipment can make it. This is what makes the signal clearer and less likely to suffer from noise.</p>
<p>With AM radio the brightness of the light is part of the signal so during quiet parts the light <em>must</em> be dim, which makes it difficult to distinguish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concerning the noise on AM, when you tune an AM radio to place between active station you hear what we call &quot;static.&quot; What you actually hear is the sum of all of the AM noise emitted by every lighting strike on the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other way around, AM can skip off the atmosphere an astonishing distance. Though that is more a product of the frequency bands assigned than anything inherent to the transmission method.</p></div>		</li>
