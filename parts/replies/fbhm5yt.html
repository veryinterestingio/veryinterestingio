			<div class="markdown"><p>i have not really followed the product....currently I am on the automation side (designing/building assembly lines that automatically assemble engines, transmissions, differentials etc...)...Electric cars do have some advantages, however, gas powered is still more efficient at producing power especially for long distances and in colder climates....technology IS booming on both sides. When I was on the R&amp;D side, the technology was in its infancy with the biggest obstacle being the battery (range vs storage vs weight)....now engines are becoming more fuel efficient, smaller, stronger as well as the associated power-trains (trans, diffs...). If you are a commuter then electric especially electric hybrid is the way to go in my opinion. Tesla will never beat the automakers in full out production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lack of mechanical complexity in Teslas is the lynchpin for me - vastly fewer parts to produce/stock/ship; very few failure points; almost zero maintenance cost. ICE cars are bloody expensive to own/operate AFTER purchase, and that's under-appreciated by so many when comparing purchase costs.</p>
<p><em>EDIT: Which translates both to maintenance savings and improved reliability.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>honest question - why would Tesla never beat the automakers in full out production?  Supply chain limitations?  Battery components?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Sure, but wont those automakers switch to electric cars eventually? Tesla of course wont out produce all of the other companies. But I would wager that electric cars will surpass gasoline cars in production sometime in the not so distant future.</p></div>		</li>
