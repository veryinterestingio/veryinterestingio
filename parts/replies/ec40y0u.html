<p>Another example would be that the surface area of the air exchanging surfaces (lungs) would scale by a power of 2, but the amount of cells that requires oxygen would scale by a power of 3. If you make them to big they will asphyxiate.</p>
<p>Yet another example would be heat management. Cells producing heat scale again by a power of 3, surface area to dissipate the heat by a power of 2. Kurzgesagt has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7KSfjv4Oq0" target="_blank">great video</a> on that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes. He has fictional &quot;Pim Particles&quot; which are supposed to keep your physical structure intact, while altering your atoms themselves in some way. But the comics and the movies are wildly inconsistent with real world physics, and they kind of pick and choose what effects physics actually has. Which is why Ant-Man works best when they don't make you think too hard about it, and have as few physics discussions as possible.</p>
<p>This Stack Exchange question actually does a decent job of outlining the different ways this is possible: <a href="https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/96337/how-does-ant-man-shrink" target="_blank">https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/96337/how-does-ant-man-shrink</a></p>
<p>Edit: sorry, it's Pym Particles, after Hank Pym. I never really got into Ant-Man so I committed a major nerd sin. </p>
<p>Edit 2: don't get me wrong, I love the Ant-Man movies, and the hijinks are pretty hilarious. That's why I said the movies are better when not making you think too much, since the science isn't really that solid. But to make the character work you kind of have to do that. Sometimes entertainment is more entertaining when you don't think too hard about it. But we should be careful when dealing with science fiction that's really more like science magic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer!</p>
<p>There is also the issue that ants have open circulatory systems, meaning they don't have blood vessels to carry blood to and from important parts of the body. </p>
<p>This means that blood needs to be oxygenated near to the organs. Ants breathe through tubes called spiracles, which passively transport oxygen from the atmosphere to bodily cells. </p>
<p>Once an ant reaches a certain size it will require more oxygen than can be transported through its spiracles and the distance to the cells needing the oxygen will be too great for it's circulatory system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why pre-historically there used to be much larger insect species, because the concentration of oxygen in the air was higher and could support them. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070806112323.htm" target="_blank">source</a></p></div>		</li>

So like wouldn’t more oxygen be counterintuitive because more oxygen means more fires which means less forest which means less oxygen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why insects in the Carboniferous era (about 300 million years ago) could be so much larger (like dragonflies with 2 foot wingspans) because the oxygen levels in the atmosphere were so much higher (about 40% compared to 20% today), therefore more could diffuse deeper into the insects body.  In addition, there is evidence that the high levels of O2 were toxic enough that the animals had to grow fast to avoid O2 poisoning. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What's meant by &quot;passively&quot; here? Medium-to-large insects like wasps or grasshoppers <a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/oescsserivqtcyvzygvk.gif" target="_blank">actively pump air through their trachea</a> (that's the name of the tubes, by the way, the spiracles are the openings). That doesn't really look any more passive than our breathing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some insects, it just passes thru the membrane, due to the pressure difference of the air and their bodies or osmosis, so they dont pump anything.</p>
<p>Which is why you dont find insects thicker than 1/2 of an inch,  because any organs deeper than 1/4 of an inch cant get enough air.   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Any bigger and they have to actively pass oxygen somehow.   Animals got by this by having a huge area of skin, then compacting it and blowing air over it (lungs), and then having the oxygen go into blood vessels that circulate it over the whole body.</p></div>		</li>

<p>which is why tiny animals eat their body weight or more each day, most of it just goes to make heat</p></div>		</li>
