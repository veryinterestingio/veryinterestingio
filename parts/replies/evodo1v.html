As /u/disid noted, this case was protected as an exercise of &quot;Fair Use&quot; under U.S. copyright law, and the court gives a great, succinct analysis of why this qualifies as fair use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Moreover, the episode places Butters' WWITB video alongside other YouTube hits including, among others, the Numa Numa Guy, the Sneezing Panda and the Afro Ninja. This kind of parodic use has obvious transformative value </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last paragraph cites various other South Park episodes as evidence that Butters is very naiive, including somewhat offensive titles, and gives the impression that these items were not taken from either participant's testimony, but that the judge sat down and watched a bunch of episodes to determine just how naiive Butters is, to round out all of the arguments in the legal opinion.</p></div>		</li>
