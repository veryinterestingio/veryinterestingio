			<div class="markdown"><p>If you thought GEB was a &quot;pleasant&quot; read, you are either <em>way</em> more into logic and the foundation of mathematics as I am, or your definition of the word is wildly different from mine.</p>
<p>There is only a handful of books that I didn't finish after reading the first couple pages in the 30 years I've been reading books. GEB is one of them. It's a slog worse than the Silmarillion, and I have read that <em>twice</em>.</p>
<p>Not saying it's a terrible book by any means, the topics it discusses are interesting as anything, but it's tedious to read and I am just not the type to skip ahead to look for something more immediately interesting when things are boring. And GEB has a lot of long, boring passages where he takes his sweet time introducing a certain concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't done GEB - have you done When Einstein Walked with Gödel by Jim Holt? I'd probs give it to a layman before I'd give the GEB(tho again I havent actually read GEB). Its a much lighter book dealing with interesting stuff topics as you say; but in a pretty easygoing way imo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, no, I agree, it's a huge investment in time and concentration. The first time I read it, I was stuck in a desert office in the military, so I basically had nothing else to do for six months (the web was not even a sparkle in Berners-Lee's eye then). That helps. On the other hand, I couldn't get through the whole of LOTR, so to each its own, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can absolutely get through with nothing but a vague knowledge of, literally, turtles. The book is designed for the layman. </p>
<p>BUT, and this is a big but (and I cannot lie), it still requires a whole lot of thinking and, moreover, concentration. You can not read it half-awake. (Well, you can, but the point(s) will be lost on you.) Totally worth it, though, it's one of the very most mind-blowing and eye-opening books I've ever read, and I've read myself some... </p>
<p>(For reference, some of the other mind-blowing books I'm talking about : Herbert Senior's Dune books, and Eco's From the Tree to the Labyrinth.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by opening in this context? Black can sacrifice a pawn in its first move, that could definitely lead to a forced win. But it's very likely true that chess is a draw in the starting position, and any opening that isn't a blunder can probably draw, imo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity: where do we conclude the &quot;it's likely that both players can force a draw&quot; from? Is it due to the fact that professional chess matches are very likely to draw? Is it just because nobody has discovered a forced way to win yet? </p>
<p>The first part of the statement also doesn't <em>necessarily</em> follow from the second (although if 2, then <em>probably</em> also 1): there could theoretically be an opening move that is so bad it not only negates White's moving first advantage, but also his chance to force a draw, i.e. puts him in a worse position than moving second out of starting positions. Most likely candidates are border pawn moves, my bet would be on either 1.g4 since it weakens King side structure so much and puts a target on the g-pawn, or 1.h4 since it just doesn't look to do anything to help with development and permanently weakens pawn structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Draws have become more likely as chess skill level has improved, would be my primary evidence for suggesting that to be the case yeah. </p>
<p>The forced way to win certainly exists for some positions, but its likely that earlier on in the decision tree, the &quot;forced-to-lose&quot; player could have selected their way towards a draw instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an absolute everyday layman trying to self-teach - I would suggest its probably eventually a zero sum game given its in a limited field of 64 spaces with identical pieces on each side.</p>
<p>Isn't it akin to getting Josuha to play Tic Tac Toe against himself to stop global thermonuclear war??</p>
<p>When we find all 'optimum' moves - a computer playing itself(assumption we used a computer to do this) would eventually draw itself into a stalemate by being perfectly equally matched to itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most chess players <em>think</em> the game is a draw, but it obviously hasn't been proven (for the reasons described in this thread, not enough calculation power in the universe etc). It is certainly possible the game is a win for white.</p>
<p>And you're correct, the first move can significantly affect the eval. My guess is Nh3 and Na3 are the worst, as they certainly give black an objective advantage according to our best engines. H4 probably ranks right behind them, it's a useless move but not actively making your position <em>worse</em> like moving your knight to the edge is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not even close to accurate. Both players can't always force a draw just because the game is solved.</p>
<p>Let's look at the most extreme example - white hi threatening a checkmate in one move. Even if black has solved the game of chess, they would still lose this game. Now, a less extreme example- let's say white is up a minor piece. To beginners that might not be a big deal, but to grandmasters (and especially computers) that's a decisive advantage. If the side that is up a piece, assuming their position doesn't have any major underlying weaknesses and they don't blunder, will win the game.</p>
<p>Now, we look at the start of the game. We can apply the same principles here. White starts the game with an advantage, since they move first. That may seem inconsequential, but among grandmasters that already gives white about twice the odds of winning as black. And between computers, the ratio is more like 10 to 1. </p>
<p>Most high level games do still end in a draw, but the question is whether whites starting move advantage is enough to force a win once chess is solved. Most chess players (myself included) believe it's <em>probably</em> a draw, but we don't know for certain, and it's still very possible the game is winning for white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in tic-tac-toe, one player starts with the &quot;first move&quot; advantage also. Yet in tic tac toe, solved optimal play for both players always results in a draw. </p>
<p>If defensive play is sufficient to prevent a forced win, draws are inevitable. Simply moving first is likely not a significant enough attacking/aggressive advantage to overcome all defensive attempts by the opponent. </p>
<p>We see this in some anti-engine chess strategies that basically set up a stonewall of pawns and limit mobility of pieces.</p></div>		</li>
