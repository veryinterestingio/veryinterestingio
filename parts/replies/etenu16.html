<p>Digital music has only so many levels. You choose where to set those levels in the studio. You could put the whisper at max volume and you may do it by mistake if the whisper has a low range and you only normalize the range so that the 'loudest' part of the whisper has the same volume as the 'loudest' part of a song. </p>

<p>But you are not wrong to assume that 'loud' songs have less range and therefore can be 'louder' by comparison when played back with the same maximum volume.</p></div>		</li>
