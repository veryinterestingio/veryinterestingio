			<div class="markdown"><p>Larger aircraft have less restrictive crosswind limits but ‘a lot of wind before it gets actually impacted by it’ is untrue. Large aircraft, while having more inertia and lateral static stability, have enormous control surface  areas which catch the wind. A huge 380 is as prone to a gust and wing drop as a little 172. Its not a titan steamrolling through the air undisturbed, it’s still an aircraft with control surfaces and has to obey the aerodynamic rules of an aerofoil moving through a fluid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A possible difference might be this: Mass goes up as a cube of the size of the aircraft, but the force of the wind only goes up as a square of the size, and since acceleration dealt by the force is a=F/m, it would be a=(b*r^(2))/(c*r^(3))=(b/c)*(1/r), where b and c are some constants and r is the size of the airplane. So the acceleration dealt by the wind should be actually inversely proportional to the size of the airplane.</p>
<p>(At least as a very, very rough approximation.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about wing loading. An A380 has 10x the wing loading of a 172. So it absolutely does take a lot more wind to affect an A380.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I met a 747 pilot who flew RC planes. I asked him why a pilot would find it fun. He said the when you tell a 747 to turn right, it turns right. The RC plane does what the wind tells it to do first, then it takes pilot input. </p></div>		</li>
