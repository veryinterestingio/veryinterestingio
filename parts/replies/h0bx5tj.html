			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure.  I know if you're declaring bankruptcy and try this the court's going to see right through your scheme and be very unhappy with you, but I don't know about probate.  The IRS will look at your gifting in the last three years before death and assess the estate tax accordingly, but I don't know what recourse creditors have.  Keep in mind that high-value property like houses or cars which aren't owned free and clear will almost certainly have liens on them, so the person in question wouldn't be able to just gift their property to an heir to avoid debt like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually false information, my boyfriends father died of a stroke last year. His medical bill is 1,267,300.68. It does get passed down, his aunt now has to pay that and because it is physically impossible for anyone to pay that absurd amount of money. It will continue to get passed down his family. Take it from someone who is legitimately experiencing this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure of the specifics, but unless they co-signed a loan to pay those expenses or got tricked by some credit agency to take responsibility of the debt, the father’s estate should have paid whatever it could and anything above that is treated as a loss by the creditors.</p>
<p>If anyone tries to get your boyfriend to accept responsibility for paying off this debt, he should get a lawyer.</p></div>		</li>
