<p>You can measure variations in the water table and the amount of snow on the ground with a laboratory gravity meter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Turned out that the lab was sitting above the universities coal bunker...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gravity methods can be used to measure a lot of subsurface features, like ore bodies, water, and things of the like! It's super interesting!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or is the problem that gravity isn't a point force like the calculation implies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also don’t know the earth’s mass well though.
And earths mass times the constant is constant for all satellites, so measuring many satellites will get you a lot of similar values for that product, but you can’t measure them independently</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that G and the mass of the Earth only appear in the relevant formulas in the combination GM, never separate from each other. There is no &quot;hook&quot;, as it were, to separate them with algebra in a useful way.
The experiment described above of dropping masses in a vacuum with and without a mass above it also gives you a Gm term to work with, which helps separate them.
The original measurement of G used a torsional spring to measure the force between two known masses directly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bit late compared to everyone else, but I'll give a bit more detail. I was posting from my phone earlier.</p>
<p>A common term in orbital mechanics equations is <em>mu</em>. <em>mu</em> = planet's mass <em> gravitational constant. The equation for orbital period is quite straightforward: Time = 2*pi*sqrt(orbital height^3 / </em>mu<em>). Because we can measure to a very precise degree how long it takes to orbit, and how high up a satellite is, we can determine </em>mu* of Earth to great precision as well. </p>
<p>However you can't use any equations to cancel them out; you never see G or a planet's mass on their own in equations. Why is this? Because they're intrinsically linked. Everything with orbital mechanics is centered around gravitational forces, velocities, and distances. Big G over here is basically a conversion factor from mass to force. It's not particularly useful on its own, just like how a planet's mass isn't useful. </p>
<p>It's got some wacky units (now m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 ) in order to make the math work out. Units, in math, cancel and combine just the same as the 5's in (5*6)/(5*3) cancel. You multiply that bad boy by kilograms (m^3 s^-2 ), then divide that distance^3 by that (now we're at just s^-2 ) and take the square root of it and we're at plain ol' seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's basically what's been done. We're extremely confident in the first few digits (6.67408) and we're pretty sure that the &quot;true&quot; value of it is within 0.0046% of that. </p>
<p>There's diminishing returns to getting more precise numbers. NASA only uses 15 digits of pi for plotting, and if you had 40 digits of pi and tried to circumnavigate the observable universe, your drift over that entire distance would be about as wide as an atom.</p></div>		</li>
