			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention there's evidence suggesting that dinosaurs and other Mesozoic animals were already on a decline prior to the KT event; while the numbers of individual species was flourishing, the diversity of species was declining. Conditions on Earth at the time were getting pretty rough; there was a period of intense volcanism prior to the event that was pumping a ton of CO2 into the air. Not to mention the climate was starting to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn’t this depend on which research groups you listen to? There’s an awful lot of conflicting information in the literature about the biodiversity of the Cretaceous and the extent to which the Deccan Traps contributed to the extinction event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the currently accepted theory was 99.9% of land organisms were dead within 1 day, not 100 years.  The entire atmosphere was superheated by the impact ejecta.  So, for the KT extinction at least, it wasn’t a gradual decline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but dating methods can't tell the difference between a century and a day when we're talking about events that many millions of years ago. So fossil wise there's not much of a difference between them dying over the course of several decades vs in a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're missing the mathematical point. Imagine an animal, with a stable population, that has one offspring every year, not a particularly high reproductive rate, but to be stable it means one must also die per parent pair each year). If you kill 99.9% of them this year, will the total number of dead over the next 5 years (including that massacre) be higher or lower?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the lifespan. </p>
<p>If your animal lives an average of 100 years then only \~1% of the population dies per year when they are stable. So that massacre would be 20 times the background rate over 5 years.</p>
<p>If they live only 2 years they die at a rate of 50% per year and would have 80% fewer deaths.</p>
<p>The time it takes for an extinction to happen does matter, but when talking millions of years ago the difference between one day and a thousand years is largely irrelevant due to the high attrition rate for fossils.</p></div>		</li>
