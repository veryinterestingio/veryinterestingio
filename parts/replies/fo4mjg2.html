			<div class="markdown"><p>Putting this response in practical terms:
Say you have a cell that can store charges with potentials of 0V-3.3V. If you split those into even increments (0V, 1.1V, 2.2V, 3.3V), then each of those values can be read as 00, 01, 10, and 11 in binary respectively. Now, each cell can represent 2 binary values and you have twice the storage capacity. In practice, this is implemented to higher degrees of accuracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to tie back to consumer tips:</p>
<p>These are what the *LC stuff means. SLC (Single level Cell) uses each cell just to store 1 bit. MLC (multi level cell), somewhat a misnomer, stores 2 bits. TLC (three level cell), sometimes called &quot;MLC 3 bit&quot;, 3 bits. and Recently QLC (Quad) are rolling out for budget consumers. More bits per cell lower the lifespan of the drive, it's like a shared dorm room. But for most people who replaces after 3-5 years even QLC is probably fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to learn a bit more, the popped unpopped description also applies to the circuits which determine the flash memory cell you're trying to read or write. These circuits don't wear out the way flash memory does, however they require a small amount of power to retain their state. Fortunately remembering the last cell you read isn't important so they only need to maintain their state so long as it's plugged in and powered.</p>
<p>If you're curious you can look up YouTube videos on flip flops, latches and registers. They usually have some animations that show the flow of current so you don't need to be an electrical engineer to know what's going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually a lot more reliable. There aren't any spinning bearings to seize, or platters to scratch. However, in the case of crappy wear-leveling algorithms an SSD can burn itself out a lot faster than an HDD. The folks over at Backblaze, a cloud backup startup, wrote a good summary on the failure rates of SSD's compared to HDD's: <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-reliable-are-ssds/" target="_blank">https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-reliable-are-ssds/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First their is a lot of variation by drive manufacturer, model, and type.  So the below is just very broad outline of the failure characteristics.</p>
<p>Spinning HDDs last 7 to 10 years, normally.,  During their normal lifespan, 1 to 2% of drives fail each year.  Turning them on and off shortens their lifespan a bit.  Not enough to matter.</p>
<p>SDDs probably won't last longer than 10 years, but their life may be shortened if you write to them a lot.  For home computers and laptops, you cannot write to it enough to matter.  In some server applications their life can be as little as 1 year.</p>
<p>During their normal lifespan 0.5 to 1 % fail every year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite ironically, <em>not</em> turning them on for a long time can also shorten their lifespan, so it's better to just assume that they will fail and keep backups of whatever you care about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>desktop writes can be surprising. browsers constantly write, cache data, streamed media etc. so e.gl if you watch a 2 hour 1080p movie on netflix, the entire thing is cached on disk. also log files, tracing files, temporary duplicatesof files for downloads so e.g. even if you down that 50 gig game to a hdd on steam, it will duplicate the download to c: also which might be your ssd.</p>
<p>On average my ssd's on my desktop are doing about 10-20TB per year of writes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think some crappy ones still do. I had an SSD fail completely after just a few weeks (this was a couple years ago). I realized I had some software that was writing the same sector a couple times per second. My theory is that the controller was too stupid to spread those writes over more than a limited set of physical sectors, and quickly wore them down. In terms of drive writes, the drive was still basically brand new (I don't think it had accumulated even a single drive write worth of writes).</p></div>		</li>
