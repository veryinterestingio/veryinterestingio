			<div class="markdown"><p>also....in terms of things like birds... if a bird hits something traveling at 550 mph is going to end up as a cloud of feathers and a mist of what used to be the bird...the engine will spit it out a sparrow  without a hiccup... jet engines are designed to take small bird strikes..and they are designed to just stop working and hopefully not explode in the event of a large (and heavy) bird strike...like a flock of geese or something. </p>
<p>...so like you said, a light grille or mesh would just be adding the possibility of metal entering the engine along with pillow stuffing... there's really only added risk and no benefit.</p>
<p>but to add on to what you said...  if you attached a heavy metal grill, there would be fuel inefficiency as the heavy grille would occlude airflow into the engine. it's not possible just from an engineering standpoint. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a guy that used to work for GE at their testing facility.  There are probably videos of it nowadays, but they would get the engines running and simulate impacts.  Aluminum ladders are good, but my favorite is simulating geese.  They just bought turkeys at the grocery store and launched them into the turbine while it's running full bore.  The idea being that if a plane is taking off and hits a flick of geese they can be sure none of the engine parts make it out and into the cabin.  Pretty fun stuff.</p>
<p>Edit - Got a quick response, gonna be easiest to copy pasta the texts</p>
<p>&quot;They weren't real birds. Just dense gelatin to simulate 2,5,and 15 lb birds. The 15 lb were supposed to be Canada geese.
Fired them into a running turbine engine on a test stand at 150 mph and videoed with a high speed camera (10,000 frames per second). It was cool to watch.  The fan shrouds were multi layered Kevlar and were supposed to contain any debris/shrapnel when the engine destroyed itself. The bird strike would cause a titanium blade to fracture and be ingested. The imbalance forces and the mechanical damage from debris would then destroy the engine.  Makes a god awful mess. Their main design objective was to prevent engine parts from piercing the cabin so passengers wouldn't be sucked out a window like that lady on that 737.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GE Peebles frequent visitor here...  He's confusing two different tests: Bird strike tests, and destruction tests.</p>
<p>Bird strikes don't break fan blades. If they did, engines would be blowing up all the time. Bird strikes are pretty common.</p>
<p>Destruction testing involves strapping an explosive charge to a fan blade and detonating it while the engine is running. This is the test for fan case containment, hopefully to prevent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/how-a-cracked-fan-blade-probably-ended-a-decade-of-no-us-air-travel-fatalities/" target="_blank">things like this</a> from happening. It very rarely occurs during service.</p></div>		</li>
