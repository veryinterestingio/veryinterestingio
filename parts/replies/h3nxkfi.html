			<div class="markdown"><p>This would be a really lower bound. A person moving at constant speed on a horizontal surface performs no work using high school physics assumptions. If you factor in some hills, you will at least get a non-zero value but it will still be really low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how is a calorie consumption range of 500 to 4000 any helpful ?</p>
<p>Yes, its above 100 and below a million, so it passes the sniff test. But its worthless.</p></div>		</li>
