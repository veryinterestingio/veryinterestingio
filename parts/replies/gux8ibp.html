			<div class="markdown"><p>Water evaporates completely yes, but all the crap and trace minerals in it get left behind, that is what damages electronics (particularly if it gets wet while turned off and you don't turn it on until the water has evaporated). Isopropyl alcohol does not have any of said trace minerals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you could build a submerged PC in, say, deionized water. It's been done.</p>
<p>However, due to it's polarity, water <em>loves</em> to dissolve things, and it will slowly leech metals and such from surfaces until it starts to conduct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Used to work for a company that sold deionized water systems. I asked one day if you could drink the water. He said yes, but because the water is so pure, it will literally strip the enamel off your teeth.</p>
<p>Edit: Should clarify that he said if you drank deionized water with the same frequency that you drink regular tap water.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I’m not an expert. I am simply relaying what was told to me by my ex-boss who had/has a degree in chemical engineering, so I assumed he knew what he was talking about.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not true, though, is it? </p>
<p>There are plenty of submerged builds in mineral oil, or 3M's special liquid - but as soon as deionized water touches metals, the metals will start to ionize the water, and any currents will make it go even faster, and then the water's as conductive as normal water again.</p>
<p>Live circuits in water just ain't feasible, when you're using metals that'll ionize the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife used to have a vaporizer (creates steam to help with sinus issues from dry conditions) that had two electrodes and created an electric potential between them. The water would conduct the electricity, heat up, and voila, steam. Except our tap water is very soft and wouldn't conduct well enough unless salt was added and dissolved first. It seemed pretty inefficient and potentially dangerous so it &quot;disappeared&quot; after we got married. I think it was made 60 years ago, probably wouldn't be allowed now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it does. English isn't my first language but I'll try to explain. Ions (charged particles) help water conduct electricity. Usually, these Ions are from minerals and salts (like the salt that you use in your kitchen, NaCl. That turns to Na+ and Cl- Ions (charged particles) when dissolved in water)</p>
<p>In pure water, you still have a teeny, tiny amount of Ions. This amount can be traced back to the Autoprotlyse of water. Two H2O molecules become one H3O+ and one OH- ion. Therefore, distilled water is still conductive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  I spilled an energy drink on a wireless keyboard.  It got all sticky on the inside and out.  I fully submerged it in distilled water to get the inside clean and then finished it off with ethanol.  As long as you let it dry 100% before use it’s ok.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The non alcohol part will be pure water, it will not have a lot of contamination in there so it should not conduct initially. However, all downsides that pure water has still apply so in short time it can make itself conductive by dissolving little bits of material it touches.</p></div>		</li>
