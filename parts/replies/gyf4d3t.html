			<div class="markdown"><p>There are culinary truffles (Tuber uncinatum) grown on Gotland (Swedens largest island).
There's also one called stjärnhovstryffel (Choiromyces meandriformis) that grow on the mainland of Sweden in and around a region called Stjärnhov (the culinary merits of this one are.... debatable).</p>
<p>Then there are many other types of fungi in the truffle family that grow in northern Scandinavia that are either toxic or just inedible.</p></div>		</li>
