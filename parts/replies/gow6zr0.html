			<div class="markdown"><p>Chirality is my favorite part of this. Carbon atoms with the same atoms bound to them can be mirror images of eachother that cannot line up exactly. Like your hands, with palms facing eachother they line up but cannot be directly overlayed with both palms facing up. Our DNA and proteins are chiral and all made up of molicules with the same &quot;handedness&quot;. Our bodies often cannot process amino acids that are the opposite handedness to what our body uses. This theoretically means there could be life that evolved from amino acids with the opposite handedness that even if it looked identical to life on Earth we would get almost no nutritional value from because our bodies could not process the amino acids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Following that same logic as above you would not need protection in any way because space AIDs would not be able to infect our cells due to the chirality of their amino acids making proteins mirror images of ours. Also our DNA would be wrapped in the opposite direction from theirs so we could not get each other pregnant. So sex it up all you like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sugars are chiral, right-handed on Earth.  We can't process left-handed sugar.  Incidentally, it still <em>tastes</em> like sugar, but it doesn't get broken down because we aren't equipped to deal with left-handed sugar molecules.  Which would make it an amazing sugar substitute, if we had a cost effective way to mass-produce left-handed sugar.  </p>
<p>Similar issues probably exist for other stuff.</p></div>		</li>

This is an issue if you romance the Quarian or Turian team members, iirc; your fluids aren't good for each other, and you can't share the same food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember learning about chirality in ochem and remember that the chemical that gives mint and caraway their identities is the same molecule.  Just one is L and one is R.  Or as a pharmacy tech that a lot of drug companies introduce new brand names by eliminating the isomers that don’t work.  Zyrtec is 10 mg of both isomers but xyzal has the isomer that doesn’t work removed so it’s basically the exact same thing but more pure. and hello brand name status again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some time ago I read about L-glucose. Like you’ve described, it looks and tastes exactly like sugar — because it <em>is</em> sugar — but it just passes on through without being digested because the chirality is wrong. Apparently it would really kill in the artificial sweetener market except for the fact that it’s so hard to produce, it’s worth more than its weight in gold. </p>
<p>But anyway that was more than five years ago so I dunno how accurate it is anymore or if I’m even remembering what I read correctly. Still pretty cool tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 further point: scientists no longer believe that silicon life is possible, due to the fact that it's orbitals are too bulky to form double bonds (two bonds with the same other atom) and that it's structures are therefore much more limited than carbon's</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there are other possibilities beyond carbon that could work, but like silicon, they are all somewhat limited in the types of bonds you can make compared to carbon. Carbon's main benefit, though, is that it's so plentiful in addition to being able to support the complexity of life.</p>
<p>Silicon, Boron, Sulfur and some metals could potentially be the basis for a non-carbon based biochemistry (even if that biochemistry winds up being necessarily simpler in some ways than what we see on earth), but they are all stupidly rare in the universe compared to carbon.</p>
<p>Carbon biochemistry + oxygen as the oxidant + water as the solvent, if nothing else, should be significantly more common than any other combination in the universe just because of how plentiful everything is, how well they work together, and the range of temperatures/pressures they work in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t correct. Sulfur is as plentiful as carbon on Earth (and many other planetary systems—it doesn’t matter how prevalent they are in stars), and silicon is 1000 times more plentiful. </p>
<p>Also, the issue with silicon and especially metals is more that they can’t form complex structures like a carbohydrate or a protein. Biochemistry wouldn’t just be “simpler”—there is no way to make compounds that contain a lot of “information” in any meaningful sense (scientists have made every thinkable combo of those elements with any other, and none work). Compounds of those elements decompose into salts and small molecules way more easily than large carbon based molecules. (I imagine there are similar issues with sulfur, but I haven’t researched the topic as thoroughly. My best guess is that you’d run into difficulties because sulfur compounds ionize too easily.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we're reasonably close (whether that's 50 years or 500 years) to building silicon based &quot;life&quot;. That is computers that will act the same way as us with AGI. Whether anything but carbon life can come up &quot;naturally&quot; is a good question, but I think there's likely other forms of life that can exist, but they just might require other life forms like carbon based life to intelligently design them to start with.</p>
<p>And who knows, maybe carbon life doesn't exist naturally and life on earth was seeded in panspermia-style way by other life forms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a stability issue. Non reactive noble gases have 8 outer electrons. But the strongest bonds form by sharing outer electrons with another molecule. Hence carbon and silicone are the smallest atoms with four possible strong pairs.</p>
<p>The bigger the atom the more it's likely to give electrons and be stable isotopes than to form molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the # of covalent bonds is 8-# of outer shell electrons. So you would actually want fewer outer shell electrons to get more bonds.</p>
<p>But!</p>
<p>It turns out that if you have fewer than 4 outer shell electrons, the atoms aren't very good at holding on to their electrons. So elements with fewer than 4 outer shell electrons end up forming ionic bonds instead of covalent bonds. Ionic bonds are great and all, but they don't allow the same kind of complex structures as covalent ones. They also tend to break apart if you immerse them in water (maybe the Wicked Witch of the West was ionically bonded).</p>
<p>Thus, four is the best you can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is ok for an eli5, but it's not entirely correct. Bond nature is dependent on a number of factors, the most important is electronegativity.

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that there can be more. The issue is that those higher number of options occur in heavier elements, and those heavier elements are usually rarer and less reactive.
Carbon (and maybe Silicon) are in the sweet spot for number of possible bonds, reactivity, and rarity.</p></div>		</li>
