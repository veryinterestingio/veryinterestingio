			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience has taught me repetition works best. If you're going back to bulking up doing lower weight to get good form helps. If you were athletic before you have less ramp up on the joints.</p>
<p>This is caused by reduced blood flow to ligaments and joints.</p>
<p>I spent time figuring out the difference between burn and strain. Then the connective tissue catches up and you bump up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll usually use bands to some degree in every workout I can. If it's tricep pushdowns, curling, or some other extend. You can more or less do every isolation exercise with bands, and then rep it out. 100 reps is a good number to start with</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spend more time on the eccentric portion of the movement. So basically lower the weight slowly, and isomentric holds. This is how we strengthen tendons and ligaments in physical therapy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The muscles aren't a problem. The <em>tendons</em> are.</p></div>		</li>
