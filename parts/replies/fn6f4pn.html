			<div class="markdown"><p>I am still struggling to grasp this, so please forgive me -- consider this a question.</p>
<p>My understanding is that Bell's Theorem just disproves local realism, or the idea that the outcome of a particular measurement is known, locally, in advance, and the idea that this outcome is merely revealed when we perform measurement, and it just so happens that the revealed states follow statistics governed by quantum mechanics. A hidden variable of this nature was a proposed explanation by Einstein for entanglement.</p>
<p>While hidden variables as Einstein proposed them are indisputably ruled out, my understanding is that this does not rule out the notion that there may be unknown, possibly even deterministic (if extremely chaotic) mechanics governing wave collapse. All that is proven is that these rules violate local realism, which means that there are not hidden states which they reveal and/or they are nonlocal.</p>
<p><strong><em>As an example, one (purposefully contrived and very wrong) mechanism for determining the outcome of the collapse of entangled particles which bell's experiment does NOT rule out is this:</em></strong></p>
<p>Assign all photons in the universe a random number at birth. Entangle two electrons and separate them. When a photon interacts with electron A, it will cause electron A to collapse to spin up or spin down depending on whether the number it was assigned is even or odd, and electron B will collapse to the opposite accordingly. Theoretically, if you knew the numbers of every photon in the universe, the outcome is predictable. But otherwise, appears quite random.</p>
<p>This behavior, while absurd, is vehemently <strong><em>not</em></strong> ruled out by Bell's experiment (at least, as far as I understand), because it implies both<strong><em>non-locality and non-realism</em></strong> at the same time. The electrons really did not decide on a state until they were interacted with, and that interaction required spooky action at a distance. But the mechanism behind this wave collapse is still technically predictable, and still technically has &quot;hidden variables&quot; in a certain relaxed sense not addressed by Bell's argument.</p>
<p><strong><em>Am I off the mark here?</em></strong> I just don't find bell's experiment convincing evidence that wave collapse has to be truly random, though I accept that if it were not it would have to be chaotic beyond all hope of predicting its outcome given the current evidence.</p>
<p>The use of the term &quot;hidden variables&quot; kind of bothers me because, to any newcommer to physics, it sounds like we are saying &quot;that's all she wrote, there's nothing hidden about how this works, and nothing potentially predictable&quot;, but in reality, <strong><em>again, as I understand it</em></strong>, we really don't have a clue what's going on during wave collapse and we have yet to rule out the possibility that <strong><em>non-local</em></strong> deterministic-but-hopelessly-chaotic behaviors could be responsible. </p>
<p>One of my favorite theories right now for wave collapse is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence" target="_blank">quantum decoherence</a>, which states roughly that wave collapse does not, in fact, violate Schroedinger's (quite deterministic) equation at all, but that instead the interactions we see with &quot;classical&quot; / &quot;observing&quot; entities are so complex that the wave function evolves under Schroedinger's equation in a highly chaotic fashion, leading to an eventually highly unpredictable collapse.</p>
<p>Again, please forgive me any misconceptions, I am still learning this stuff and the whole hidden variable thing is something I really struggle with. This is the first time I've really been able to formulate my thoughts concisely like this, so having some expert feedback would sincerely be helpful to my growth as a physicist.</p>
<p>EDIT:
I guess one thing worth mentioning is that if wave collapse <strong><em>is</em></strong> deterministic but highly chaotic, such that it perfectly obeys what appear to be perfectly statistical rules, then... Who cares? By definition, then, there is no way to distinguish between the two. So good luck proving that's actually the case. The only hope for a deterministic version of quantum wave collapse is if there is some kind of subtle difference in how collapses play out, but I think the hope for that is pretty much shot as we would have already detected such differences in our experiments. Or maybe there <strong><em>are</em></strong> such differences, but they are astronomically small and beyond our ability to currently, or possibly ever detect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can imagine that non-local variables could be involved, that a future TOE might be deterministic, whereby a photon emitter does not exist in isolation but depends on a photon receiver anywhere in time/space. The direction of the photon would be towards a receiver that is ready to receive it (the non-local variable). Or something weird like that which would unify QM and relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This video from Minute Physics has some great visualizations showing how we can rule out “hidden variables“ in this context. It uses polarizing filters, which interact with photons in interesting ways that you can actually see. IMO, this experiment is right up there with the dual slit experiment in terms of visually representing the strangeness that is quantum mechanics. </p>

<p>Watched the video. How do we know if polarizing filters are absorbing or passing through the original photon? How do we know they're not absorbing the photons then reemitting a new photon of certain intensity and angle based on the incoming photon? Wouldn't this allow them to &quot;turn&quot; a photon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the second part of the video (at <a href="https://youtu.be/zcqZHYo7ONs?t=600" target="_blank">around the 10min mark</a>), I don't understand how we can create entangled photos that we send <strong>simultaneously</strong> from two places through two sets of filters to compare results.<br />
Isn't the assumption that there is a set of simultaneous actions linked to the assumption that we do actually transmit information (say, letting go of the entangled photo supposedly trapped somewhere at &quot;the same time&quot;, or the randomized polarization of parallel sets of filters) at more than the speed of light?  </p>
<p>And if so, isn't it then still possible for a hidden variable to be at play there since the entangled photons do not exactly pass through the test at the same time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That video made me wonder once again why quantum entanglement can't be used to communicate. I know everyone says it's impossible, but I've never understood why. He said if you measure in the same direction, and the measurement is in line with the particle, then you can be sure that the other measurement is the opposite. </p>
<p>Is the problem that we can't actually control the direction of the spin, only the plane? So essentially we aren't transmitting any data with the spin, only reading the data. If that's the case and we only had one detector reading on the same plane, then 50% of the time it would read up and 50% down, correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You may have heard about randomness being generated by pointing a camera at a bank of Lava Lamps, but in fact most of the randomness in that signal comes from thermal noise in the camera, not from the lamps. </p>
<p>Radioactive decay is another good quantum source of randomness.</p></div>		</li>
