			<div class="markdown"><p>SLP here (speech-language pathologist).  Much like the other answers in this thread it depends.  Typically individuals with strokes/brain injuries/surgeries who then develop aphasia may be able to read/write, but then again they might not be able to.  It is dependent largely on the part of the brain that is damaged.  Also aphasia has many subtypes and are all acquired conditions.  Aphonia/Dysphonia (impaired voice) can happen as a result of said stroke/brain injury/surgery; what sometimes differentiates them (aphasia and aphonia/dysphonia) is often the ability to reflexively produce a cough or other sounds.  An ENT can also look into the throat and see if the physical structure (vocal folds) are damaged/paralyzed.  </p>
<p>This is a bit of an aside but look up &quot;pure word deafness&quot;... that's an interesting one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the specific case of Broca's aphasia, writing and typing would at least be extremely difficult, if not impossible</p>
<p>If you really want to trip, google Wernicke's aphasia. It's the inverse of Broca's in which you can express language but cannot understand written or spoken language from another</p></div>		</li>
