			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they should generally have two goals: find food and reproduce. Why not just constantly look for food or mates? Which part of their code contains a time.sleep(100)?</p>
<p>I mean I guess for spiders specifically they make a web and wait for something to hit it, but I've seen beetles hang still for hours for no reason as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their senses are constantly looking for triggers, which then activate behavioural patterns. If they aren't hungry, if they can't sense a mate, if they sense no threat, no prey, then what would would they do? Moving around takes energy, it opens you up for risks. Of course there is a chance that &quot;curiosity&quot; is a benefit, but it can also be a risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One important thing to note is that the muscle efficiency of an arthropod is generally directly correlated to their body temperature.  In other words, for a beetle to travel 1 meter in a 10C room maybe require twice as much energy as traveling 1 meter in a 15C room, and 4 times as much as a 20C room.  This is the reason why you can tell the air temperature by counting how fast some species of cricket chirp.  So the beetle might just be waiting for warmth.</p>
<p>There are many stimuli which may inform a beetle's movement.  Without doing any actual research into it, I'd propose considering air temperature, internal body temperature, nearby scents or other chemicals (many insects have powerful sense of smell, and could for instance detect a human in the room; they can also detect CO2, which is a clear indication of a nearby mammal, for better or for worse), state of metabolism (no sense moving if you've got a full belly), vision (generally poor but seeing movement can trigger hiding behavior), light (brightness=scary, darkness=safe), etc etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fungi also absorb oxygen and emit CO2, and insects are the main source for mushrooms to spread their spores and the target predator for the mushroom's fruits.  In fact, mammals diverged from fungi, so we are all fungal bodies in a way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting: moving takes energy. Sitting still existing requires very little. Now why is this important? Actively searching for food may end up killing something that really has no ability to create fat reserves. Even things that can generally do not waste calories by running around (except for humans)</p></div>		</li>
