			<div class="markdown"><p>More to the point, there's a difference between your views changing with time and new evidence, vs saying</p>
<p>&quot;I support <thing>&quot; on Monday, then switching and saying</p>
<p>&quot;I am opposed to &lt;thing!&gt;&quot; on Tuesday, then switching back and saying</p>
<p>&quot;I have always been in favor of <thing>!&quot; on Wednesday, and then</p>
<p>&quot;I have <em>always</em> opposed and fought against <thing> with all my might, for my entire political career!&quot; on Thursday, and then going on the big debate on CNN on Friday and saying</p>
<p>&quot;Look I always, always said, since day 1, that we need to come together, and really support <thing.> Ive always felt that way, and thats what Ive said every time I get asked this question.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> its not about switching from stance A to stance B, its about 'flip flopping' from to A to B to A to B to A to B to A to B and back and forth and back and forth over and over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangentially relevant 'if-by-whiskey' argument:</p>
<p>Wiki: The label if-by-whiskey refers to a 1952 speech by Noah S. &quot;Soggy&quot; Sweat, Jr., a young lawmaker from the U.S. state of Mississippi, on the subject of whether Mississippi should continue to prohibit (which it did until 1966) or finally legalize alcoholic beverages:[3]</p>
<p>My friends, I had not intended to discuss this controversial subject at this particular time. However, I want you to know that I do not shun controversy. On the contrary, I will take a stand on any issue at any time, regardless of how fraught with controversy it might be. You have asked me how I feel about whiskey. All right, here is how I feel about whiskey:</p>
<p>If when you say whiskey you mean the devil's brew, the poison scourge, the bloody monster, that defiles innocence, dethrones reason, destroys the home, creates misery and poverty, yea, literally takes the bread from the mouths of little children; if you mean the evil drink that topples the Christian man and woman from the pinnacle of righteous, gracious living into the bottomless pit of degradation, and despair, and shame and helplessness, and hopelessness, then certainly I am against it.</p>
<p>But, if when you say whiskey you mean the oil of conversation, the philosophic wine, the ale that is consumed when good fellows get together, that puts a song in their hearts and laughter on their lips, and the warm glow of contentment in their eyes; if you mean Christmas cheer; if you mean the stimulating drink that puts the spring in the old gentleman's step on a frosty, crispy morning; if you mean the drink which enables a man to magnify his joy, and his happiness, and to forget, if only for a little while, life's great tragedies, and heartaches, and sorrows; if you mean that drink, the sale of which pours into our treasuries untold millions of dollars, which are used to provide tender care for our little crippled children, our blind, our deaf, our dumb, our pitiful aged and infirm; to build highways and hospitals and schools, then certainly I am for it.</p>
<p>This is my stand. I will not retreat from it. I will not compromise.</p>
<p>The American columnist William Safire popularized the term in his column in The New York Times, but wrongly attributed it to Florida Governor Fuller Warren.[4] He corrected this reference in his book Safire's Political Dictionary, on page 337.[1]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, what a fantastic extended quote!  I'm pushing 50, and a fan of both politics and history (and unique colloquialisms), but somehow in all these years don't think I've <em>ever</em> encountered any reference to &quot;if-by-whiskey&quot;.</p>
<p>Absolutely brilliant stuff,  Thanks for posting!!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or you mean how a certain person opposed a certain hot topic in politics for 20 years, raising money opposing that <em>thing</em>, then when polls showed support for that <em>thing</em> growing, all of a sudden that politician supports that <em>thing</em> and also claims to always have done so?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent example of this would be support for the current war/debacle in the Middle East -- Right after 9/11, political support for war over there was effectively universal, save for a tiny number of outliers. After all, it was an extremely popular position to hold at the time, and thus, politically expedient. After it had dragged on for a few years, and popular support began to wane, many of those politicians were suddenly anti-[this] war, and &quot;always had been.&quot; </p>
<p>To me, this raises the question of &quot;At what point were they lying to our faces?&quot; ...The predominant choices being, &quot;I honestly supported the war after 9/11, I voted in favor of it, but now I hate it because I want to keep my job&quot; (lying now) or &quot;I didn't really support the war then, anymore than I do now, but I voted for it anyway because I wanted to keep my job&quot; (lying then).</p></div>		</li>

<p>This part. If they said &quot;I was wrong in opposing <thing> so now I support it!&quot; this hypothetical politician would look considerably more trustworthy to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also many politicians when changing stances never really say why.</p>
<p>I remember being very impressed with a rep. From I think kentucky that was super for back doors into peoples information shouod the government need it. Then about a week later had pulled a full 180 saying (paraphrased) &quot;after consulting experts and gaining a better understanding of the issue I now realize my initial thoughts on the matter were wrong and it would be a huge mistake to put these sorts of holes in our security.&quot; He straight up admitted he was incorrect and wasnt afraid to 180 when faced with contradictory imperial evidence. I disagree with the majority of his political beliefs but I would be far more likely to vote for him over someone who i agreed with but refused to change their minds in light if new evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the problem with Hillary and gay marriage.  She could never really explain why she changed from DOMA supporter to gay marriage supporter in about a decade's time.</p>
<p>Her interview with Terry Gross was very uncomfortable because Terry was giving her an opportunity to explain her shift, but she couldn't and got very defensive.</p>
<p>When people can't hear your reasoning, they fill in the blanks and decide that you don't actually have a moral stance on the issue and are just chasing polls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was Hillary's &quot;trust&quot; problem in a nutshell. Not just on LGBT stuff, but on most major issues, if you looked back over her political career, she has lots of major issue flips that seem to only really be tied together by &quot;what is most politically beneficial right now&quot;, and she never really believably denies it because she never provides alternative explanations when she does deny it. Her positions don't really follow any logic more solid than &quot;The democratic platform adjusted for popularity in my next election race&quot;, which, for the record, is <em>a totally logical and valid logic to hold to</em>, but it does not do a lot to engender trust among your voters, because if they know that, they know you'll flip to something else when it becomes expedient, and most people want representatives that stick to the views they voted for them on, not ones that change those views to maximize their political careers.</p>
<p>What makes a good politician, a popular politician, and an effective politician are rarely the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add, as a trained journalist, that most politicians want to avoid saying anything that could possibly be misrepresented intentionally or not, and because of this tend not to espouse nuanced views and rhetoric even if they believe in those views. If you do, not only will your opponents on both sides of the aisle pounce on the sound bites to deceptively cut them, but you run the risk of people reading the news misunderstanding (even if the news is impartially reported!) What you said and thinking less of you.</p>
<p>Politics is set up to basically make the only safe positions vauge absolutes that make good soundbites/quotes. This is part of the reason why public political discourse is so horrible; the issue is nuanced but the people debating it can't be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More nuanced than most politicians? Yes. By independent measures? Not so much. He also, more recently, has had the benefit of a being a lame-duck president, which lets him be more unconcerned with how he gets spun, since he doesn't need to run for re-election. Look back at some of his earlier campaign stuff, for his first term and before. It's more than average, but it's definitely a lot closer.</p></div>		</li>
