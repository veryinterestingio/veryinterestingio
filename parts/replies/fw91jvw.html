			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I voluntarily cleaned as a kid, my mom would act as if she had told me to clean, then bark orders like a drill Sargent trying to get me to clean faster, or saying “you missed a spot there!” “Do that spot next!”</p>
<p>Instantly killed any motivation I had, so I only cleaned when she was asleep, or out of the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm similar, but I always kinda figured it's because I just don't want people to bother me while I do shit.</p>
<p>It's very apparent with cooking for me. I absolutely adore just flinging shit together, trying stuff out, learning from failures and improving etc.</p>
<p>All that shit goes down the drain once someone decides it's time to wander into the kitchen. All of a sudden you're being judged for having a bit of eggshell on the table or for some crumbs that fell to the floor like a second ago and now you also have to work around the person that obviously desperately needs to place their dishes in the sink and stand in the way of your utensils...</p>
<p>Actually shocking how I go from &quot;happy whistling and jamming out to music&quot; to &quot;angrily standing in the corner while my sauce is burning&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>don't ask me why but people knowing i'm doing something productive gives me anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same! I'll never understand it, but at least I'm not alone. I always assumed it was because my family is very hypercritical of failure, but who knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the other person wrote: “What are you working on? When will it be finished? Can you do this for me afterwards? Will you have time to address this issue?”
And might I add a bit of exaggeration:
&quot;Are you being useful enough to deserve to exist? Let me check and judge!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
