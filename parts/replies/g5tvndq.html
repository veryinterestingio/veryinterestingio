			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, most Commonwealth parliamentary systems such as Australia have a &quot;<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow" target="_blank">shadow government</a>&quot; made up by the opposition party. One effect of this is that they have their people already in place and ready to step in immediately after an election. In parliamentary systems all the ministers and shadow ministers come from the parliament itself and are chosen directly by the respective parties.</p>
<p>By contrast the US has separation of powers. The President nominates cabinet members and Congress (specifically the Senate) confirms them. This takes a bit more time and the gap between election and assuming office is partially there to give a head start on this process so there's extra time to get the President's appointees confirmed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to any one country's specific government on that deep a level because I don't actually live under a parliamentary system. I'm just an American who minored in political science. But I don't think that would be really necessary. Everyone has to learn on the job to some extent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i believe shadow ministers receive many of the same briefings their majority counterparts do? it would be weird if they didn't, since a shift in the governing coalition could in theory occur at any time</p></div>		</li>
