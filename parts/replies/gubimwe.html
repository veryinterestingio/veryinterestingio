			<div class="markdown"><p>Convection ovens are available here and have been for decades. I think it has more to do with demand and I suspect the lack of demand has to do with the fact that food cooks faster in a convection oven. That should be a good thing because they are about 25% faster and thus almost 25% more efficient. Unfortunately, it means almost every recipe and cookbook is will have incorrect instructions (for whatever reason none of my cookbooks nor online recipes have conventional time and convection time). One would think that people could figure it out but apparently they can't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow European here, I’ve never owned an oven <em>with</em> convection. </p>
<p>They exist, obviously, and are common enough for recipes to mention them as one of two alternatives. But personally, I’ve never had one (or have lived at a place that did as a kid; and my father is actually a cook).</p></div>		</li>
