			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah it is. And people cry about so many different kinds of things. People cry when they see something cute like a puppy. It's not sadness and it's not really happiness either. Emotions are so complex and crying is just a way for humans to deal with all of them. Odds are you are experiencing two things at the same time and have to cry to get out the excess hormones. </p>

<p>Like if you break your leg, you may cry from pain but you also may be angry about the injury if you are an athlete, which may make you cry more. You are probably really scared too since seeing a broken leg is shocking to you. You may also be crying because you have to pay for the ambulance to bring you to the hospital. All of this is happening at the same time and it's overwhelming. </p></div>		</li>
