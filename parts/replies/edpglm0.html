If you need to clean permanent marker off a smooth surface, you can clean it off with acetone (often sold as nail polish remover), or in a pinch, draw over it with another marker, and then wipe it off quickly before the ink from that one dries too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not for fabrics and other random surfaces. But a whiteboard, bathroom walls, mirrors. Anything smooth basically. </p></div>		</li>
