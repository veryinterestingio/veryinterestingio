<p>They even asked Six Flags to shut down their maglev roller coaster to tale pressure off the grid.</p>

<p>I don't know anything about this specific example, but some utilities actually have a specific tariff (utility word for pricing structure) that has lower rates in exchange for the utility being able to stop power (or reduce some agreed upon amount)to them during surges. </p>
<p>Theme parks are actually a decent example of a business that this could work well for.  If theres a risk of power outages cutting power to roller coasters has no real negative impact on society, but could allow the utility to keep AC running for houses and essential businesses.</p>
<p>Of course I'm not trying to argue with you, and I'm not saying the example you used was this case nor due to good planning, just thought it was an interesting case with some similarities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they definitely aren't designed (at least in my state) for residential customers.  Companies I've known who used them were things like a laser cutting shop (they laser's that could cut intricate patterns through over an inch of solid steel, absolutely crazy power consumption, but super cool), and some factories that also had power generation on site</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine too.  They always offer me these &quot;power saving&quot; options that can help me &quot;manage&quot; my utilities during &quot;peak&quot; periods.  I always call them on this by saying: &quot;So it lets you guys cut off my AC when I need it most?  no thanks&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep we have that in the north. It's called interuptable service. I regularly bypass it on no a/c calls when there's nothing wrong the power company just keeps cutting the condenser out. It's not supposed to affect your service and it shouldn't but the condenser being off for 15 mins every few hrs when it's 90 or 95 doesn't work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But I do agree the thought of someone stuck upside down is more funny</p></div>		</li>

<p>On hot days, they could curtail our power (or we could pay like 10x the standard rate and buy through the curtailment). It was always an interesting discussion about whether we were busy enough/making enough money to pay the extra or if we just ran at night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case is Texas specifically, a lot of their issues are self induced. Not connecting to the national grid to exempt themselves from national regulations. Regulations that discouraged diversified power generation and so they had no alternative supplies to buy from. And lax in state regulations meant some suppliers did things like use a grease on bearings that weren't rated for the temperature, like in the windmill farms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My kids school/daycare called all parents last week and said come get your children now, due to our agreement with the power company all electricity has been shut off due to the 100°+ temperatures.</p>
<p>We've been in a heatwave for 2 weeks but apparently the local grid must have been stressed.</p>
<p>I've got one of those energy savers on my home that can shut off my air conditioner and electric water heater, but I've never noticed when they activate it</p></div>		</li>
