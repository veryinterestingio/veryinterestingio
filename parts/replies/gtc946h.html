			<div class="markdown"><p>I was actually wondering if and how the low density of the marsian atmospheric makes it easier to spin the rotor. </p>
<p>Idk about how the lift is actually depending on rpm but helicopters might actually work quite well on Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drag isn't as big a problem as lift here. You're pushing 1% as much mass of air as you would on Earth, so you need to spin really fast and have a really light craft</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easier to spin the rotor with lower air density and therefore with less lift and less drag. Similarly, it would be easier for an aeroplane to barrel down a runway, not yet producing enough lift to become airborne. This is why calculating density altitude and required runway distances are important in pre-flight planning.</p>
<p>Lift grows linearly with density, and quadratically with speed over the aerofoil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok but that's exactly what I was wondering. </p>
<p>If lift only grows linear with density the lack of density isn't such a big issue. Especially under the low gravity of mars.</p>
<p>You should be able to overcome it by just spinning faster. I know that not easy but at least it's not N immediate road block</p></div>		</li>
