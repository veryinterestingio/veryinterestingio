<p>As an adult who has worked on Sea King helicopters, why not have large blades? There must be a trade off. I honestly don't know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of you helicopter can only fit 5 people, you don't need to fit an engine and blades that let it lift a tank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mechanism for blade pivoting in helicopters is really interesting and not widely known among laypeople. When I started wading through YouTube videos on how helicopters work there were a lot of surprising intricacy in how they fly. </p>
<p>Also there are quite a few less-known features like being able to convert potential energy (altitude) in to kinetic energy (spinning the blades) in the case of engine failure to allow unpowered emergency landing.</p>
<p>They really are pretty fascinating feats of engineering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The swashplate doesn't really care how many blades there are, you just need a pitch link per blade. The control mixing is all happening before the swashplate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Helicopter blades don't spin fast though. They spin relatively slowly. If they were spinning the same speed as an airplane the tips would be breaking the speed of sound, and noise would skyrocket and efficiency would drop.</p>
<p>General rule, the longer the blade, the slower its spinning.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or they have two or they have five or they have seven. It really isn't the best example.</p></div>		</li>
