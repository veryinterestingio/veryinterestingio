<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the results showed that adults with neck pain show increased FHP when compared to asymptomatic adults and that FHP is significantly correlated with neck pain measures in adults and older adults.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Results from meta-analyses were more consistently in favour of an association, whereas systematic reviews that included only prospective studies were less able to provide consistent conclusions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of that is to point out that correlation is NOT causation, and the reviewers identify several key confounding variables that make it difficult to draw sweeping conclusions from the findings.</p>
<p>Just because we see A with B it doesn't mean that A caused B. </p>
<p>Ergo, just because FHP is seen with neck pain is doesn't mean that FHP causes neck pain.</p>
<p>One can just as easily come to the conclusion that pain causes FHP, NOT the other way around.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except that FHP exists in the youth who don't have pain, so that would be a pretty bad conclusion to come to.</p></div>		</li>
