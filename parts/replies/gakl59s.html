			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this great explanation. If things like this were taught in school or made into PSAs, instead of always hearing &quot;Make sure you stay hydrated while studying&quot; or &quot;Sleep is important,&quot; <strong>knowing why</strong> makes it more real and tangible. Are you a neuroscientist or in some related field?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a research librarian! I have a psych degree but while I was studying for that I discovered I'm more interested in research than actually practicing so I switched it up. My primary research focus while studying for the psych degree was the structural brain differences in people with things like depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, Autism, and ADHD (which all happen to have a lot of genetic overlap and also a lot of structural brain stuff similarities) and learning about that also meant learning a lot about how typical brains work. I agree, this kind of stuff should be a standard part of basic biology education bc understanding how our brains work is useful for so many things. I've actually developed some different levels of basic neuro curricula to be taught as part of library programs (the great thing about being a librarian is that you can teach anything people want to learn, you aren't held back by the different government standards and requirements).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool. Research librarian is one of those fields that allows you to delve into so many different areas and learn and/or teach a wide spectrum of things. It would be much more refreshing and interesting, IMO, than teaching the same thing year after year.</p></div>		</li>
