			<div class="markdown"><p>Extraordinary response; this clears up so many questions I'd always had about these main neurotransmitters. Finding out that dopamine and adrenaline have a half life of ≈ a minute explains a lot of things. Thank you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why you would typically inhibit their reuptake rather than try to introduce more - if you're trying to fill a basin it's more efficient to partially stop up the drain over trying to keep getting more and more water out of the faucet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like it's more effective to fill a basin by stopping the drain than pouring water in by the cupful. There are drugs that work by forcing more neurotransmitters out of neurons (the equivalent of getting more water out of the faucet) - probably the best example is amphetamine (or, for an endogenous example, phenethylamine).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last part of the top comment is the most important for people to understand why.</p>
<p>The dopamine has to be released at a very specific place in a very specific way in order to illicit the affects you want. The receptor needs a particular molecule (or similar) in order to release the goods into the right place at the right time in the right concentration.</p>
<p>It's like saying if I have a headache why can't I just rub some Tylenol on my forehead. Sure, it's the right compound, but it's not reaching and reacting where it needs to. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately, the standard Midwest pronunciation makes these sound almost exactly the same.  (We also &quot;warsh&quot; our clothes in the &quot;crick&quot; but that may just be a Cincinnati thing.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is probably even shorter than that for neurotransmitters because you want the signal to be quick.  Reuptake chemicals retrieve things like dopamine to keep them from constantly activating neurons.  </p>
<p>This is how nerve gas agents like Sarin work.  They block acetylcholinesterase, which degrades the transmitter acetylcholine, causing your muscles to fire wildly and suffocation from inability to control your breathing muscles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It affects dopamine and norepinephrine as well, although it has the strongest effects on serotonin. Also, it's not just a re-uptake inhibitor; it mainly works by increasing the release of these neurotransmitters, although the release and re-uptake inhibition are synergistic when it comes to its recreational effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly serotonin, but that wasn't the point, I wanted to emphasize about the reuptake, it also slows down the reuptake of dopamine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah MDMA actually works primarily by causing the serotonin reuptake pumps to run backwards, thus flooding the synapse with serotonin. Cocaine, though, is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nono, it's not a pump, simply a chemical that binds with serotonin and removes it from the synapse, it doesnt run backwards. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cocaine and Ritalin are probably better examples of dopamine reuptake inhibitors. But even with these types of drugs, you actually have to do something pleasurable to release dopamine, while the cocaine makes that behavior more rewarding. Amphetamine, on the other hand, causes the release of dopamine, which is why tweakers will sometimes be just fine sitting in a kind of trance. </p></div>		</li>
