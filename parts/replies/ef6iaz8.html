			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any drugs that do the opposite of common recreational drugs? For example, Cocaine is supposed to bring euphoria because it's effects on Dopamine (I think that's what it does), is there something that brings about dysphoria?</p></div>		</li>

<p>tl;dr alcohol, weed, opiods to an extent, a few others</p>
<p>it's not as simplistic as 'makes you sad' though, it just reduces the 'power' of your nervous system in a way. think of how alcohol makes things feel numb sometimes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. I guess you could also look at the effects of Cocaine too, because that can result in a bad experience as well. People can get paranoid and nervous too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose you could take something that blocks your brain cells from recieving dopamine, which may not give you a stark opposite effect, but would definitely feel worse than taking nothing. Probably just feel intensley bored, like nothing could hold your attention or seemed appealing.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if they make Dopamine antagonists, but I know they have &quot;Anti-Heroin&quot; drugs that block  whatever opiods work on, usually used for recovering addicts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_antipsychotic" target="_blank">antipsychotics</a> typically have the side effects you described, and they are primarily dopamine antagonists.</p>
<p>As for &quot;anti-heroin&quot;, I'm guessing you're talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone#Opioid_overdose" target="_blank">Narcan</a>? That's used to reverse an opioid overdose, but Narcan itself isn't used in recovering addicts per se. Maybe you mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone" target="_blank">methadone</a>?</p></div>		</li>
