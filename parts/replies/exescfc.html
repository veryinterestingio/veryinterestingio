			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a nicely written short and easy-to-understand summary of a study on the evolution of ADH4 in apes:</p>

<p>In brief, they found that chimpanzees and humans have a much better ADH4 and speculate that this is because these apes left the trees, spend more time on the ground, and so might have come across partially fermented fallen fruits quite often than other apes who stayed up in the trees and so picked only fresh fruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might try Nature's 'Scitable'. It's sort of a layperson or undergraduate level approach to topics covered in the journal, but without dumbing the content down too far.  </p>
<p>For instance here's a discussion on Vitamin C biosynthesis, and why we lost that ability as a species:  <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-mystery-of-vitamin-c-14167861/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-mystery-of-vitamin-c-14167861/" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-mystery-of-vitamin-c-14167861/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fascinating topic to read about, but remember that these evolutionary explanations are often mostly speculative and difficult or impossible to verify empirically. Not that you shouldn’t believe any of it—just take it with that grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This makes sense. When reading the previous post, I was wondering why orangutans wouldn't be able to process alcohol as I imagined they would come across fermented fruit quite often... but it appears I was mistaken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only are there differences between species but within them too. Some humans, particularly in Southeast Asia, have a very inefficient gene for removing alcohol’s metabolites called Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). In practice this means they only need to drink a small amount of alcohol before having negative effects. It’s called alcohol flush reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The negative effects include having to drink a lot more and faster to feel tipsy, because the alcohol is metabolised more quickly, but at the same time this lets the metabolites build up too</p></div>		</li>

<p>And there are other animals that process ethanol better than humans.

<p>Bohemian waxwings eat a lot of berries, particularly rowan berries, which often ferment, so bohemian waxwings also tolerate alcohol better than humans. Their liver is 10% of their body size. When it takes about 8 hours for human to clear 1 permille (of blood volume) of alcohol, for bohemian waxwings it takes just one hour.</p></div>		</li>
