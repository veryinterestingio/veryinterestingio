			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is true, OP was clearly asking about the rhythmic term step. Which as above said, is usually used in musical editing programs and does denote the shortest note length used in the measure. See videos of drum programming in programs like ableton.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially rhythm is what you have if you remove tone from a phrase. Frequently(in my limited experience as a percussionist through high school) you would build upward a piece starting with rhythm then adding, notes, dynamics, shaping and then any visual effects. So a rhythm can be for example 2 eighth notes followed by an eight rest and a quarter note but not B flat, D flat, G even if they actually refer to the same phrase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  A beat is different than the rhythm.  In 4/4 time there are 4 beats in every measure (also called a bar above).  As others have said, the rhythm is basically like you were clapping every note of a song.  Not every measure (and likely no measures at all) would consist of just 4 claps.</p></div>		</li>
