			<div class="markdown"><p>While that is true, icing is still a major concern. This is why commercial airplanes have bleed air heating systems or (on newer planes like the 787) direct electric heating elements.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but you only turn on bleed air anti-icing between 10C and -40C static air temperature. Below -40C you don't turn engine anti-ice on in cruise or climb. </p>
<p>For wing anti-ice it's used more like a deicer, you wait for ice to build up, you can't turn that on above FL350 or that can cause a bleed trip off and a loss of cabin pressure.  </p>
<p>At least for the 737.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As u/RobusEtCeleritas explained better than I could, the difference between the static air temperature (actual air temperature) and the total air temperature (what the airplane “feels” due to friction and compressibility) is called ram rise, and it’s on the order of 25°C to 35°C at transonic jet cruise speeds of .78 to .90 mach. Temperature aloft in cruise varies with altitude, latitude, and season, but is typically anywhere between -50°C and -75°C. This leaves TAT still well below freezing, and sometimes right in the airframe icing sweet spot.</p>
<p>The reason icing isn’t a major concern at high altitude is that liquid water has not been found to exist below -40° SAT in nature or experimentally (source: US NOAA Severe Storms Laboratory). However, airframe icing can still occur at high altitude in convection, as the water droplets can be lifted rapidly enough to remain above -40° while the surrounding air temperature is well below that.</p></div>		</li>
