			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I used Cyprus as an example as they historically been a money laundering center and never asked many questions .</p>
<p>I could probably just deposit a briefcase full of cash or do something called layering.</p>
<p>Maybe I first go to a corrupt bank in mexico or Colombia and deposit cash, they turn a blind eye . Hell HSBC a well known global bank was laundering drug money in mexico .</p>
<p>So in the example I would find a way to deposit it through a corrupt bank in mexico , then transfer it to a company in panama, then transfer from panama to cyprus then from cyprus back to the USA.</p>
<p>Again if I went right from mexico to the USA it would be problematic mexico and usa have good relationship and if the FBI wanted to go through bank records in mexico they could.</p>
<p>However Panama has strong private banking laws , as well as cyprus</p>
<p>So again if the USA wanted to verify my income they just know its coming from cyprus</p>
<p>In cyprus it just says its coming from company XYZ and they may not give out the list of the owners of this company , and it may be me. I would be paying myself from my own company.</p>
<p>So if they did snoop around cyprus they would then find the money is coming from panama . And again then they would have to work with panama who has strong banking laws too.</p>
<p>The point is to create a bureaucratic mess for the FBI to go through and layers , and cyprus and panama will not just hand over bank account info to the FBI on request its going to take time </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so if you would regularity transfer it from country to country, always to new or old accounts, they could basically never get to it?</p>
<p>if i have a briefcase with 1 million USD, and i want to go to cyprus, i cant just take it into a plane or so, if its in the bulk luggage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cash.. for one.. hence why there are rules for how much cash you are allowed to travel without declaring it.</p>
<p>So Im going to break it out in a very simple way.. some of this is not technically correct but gives you an idea how it works.. </p>
<p>So imagine I set up a company (LLC) in the caymans or something.. as sole proprietor for the &quot;shell&quot; company (they are called shells because you cant see who actually controls the company hence hiding under the shell) I can have a credit card from the company that I use to buy stuff.  Now the company bought stuff but I am using it.. its a foreign company using foreign banks.  Any time I want someone to pay me for something I have them pay the company.  </p>
<p>US and EU banks typically have rules about doing due diligence and care about the money transiting them.. hence if money moving is fishy they need to report it.. if large sums come in or leave they need to report it.  Switzerland used to (maybe partly still do) had rules that privacy was paramount and would not report anything outside of Switzerland.. many small countries which don't care about large country laws because its beneficial to them to not care.. ergo they make money being a place where the rules dont apply.. whether legal or not is not for me to say.</p></div>		</li>
