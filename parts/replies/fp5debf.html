			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not admissible in federal courts.  Different states have different rules on admissibility, though last time I checked about half ban them entirely.  I don't know of any that only allow them for exculpatory evidence (though I'm certainly not an expert).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because if you think they work, they do. By making you scared of being caught in a lie. So instead you tell the truth. </p>
<p>But they don’t work. </p>
<p>They’re a tool for one part of successful interrogation - always make the other party think you know more they do. Preferably that you know everything. This applies in any interrogation, not just criminal or torture. </p>
<p>If someone thinks you already know answers, it helps it two ways. One, they’ll be scared to be caught in a lie. Two, it makes revealing/admitting information psychologically easier - if I already know something, you’re not doing something bad by confirming it.</p></div>		</li>
