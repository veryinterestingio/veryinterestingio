The benefit of this was that you could pee OR poop without having to remove the garment completely, which was probably a huge deal in the winter.  After all, there were no bathrooms in most people’s homes, so you did it outdoors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were there proper bathrooms in anyones homes? They seem like something that would only appear when house became more sectorised, which I guess happened in the renaissance? Since people basically did their things in metal recipients, you could just have it in your bedroom and throw it out of the window.</p></div>		</li>
