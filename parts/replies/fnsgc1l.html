			<div class="markdown"><p>Another cpa here, one thing I didn't understand until I was working for longer than I'd like to admit is the reason for the preferential capital gains treatment. If I buy property in 1980 for 100k and sell it in 2020 for 110k im paying tax on 10k of gain. But really I lost money in real terms due to inflation.  Part of the reasoning for the preferential capital gains tax rate is to offset the effect of inflation and the time value of money. Not saying its a rock solid argument or the best way of doing it but thats the logic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a timely ELI5 only because I just started building a basic spreadsheet to track my personal tax rates over the years. Anecdotally my AGI to date has never hit the $130k cap that u/Robert_A_Bouie mentioned, and my combined effective federal income and payroll tax rate over the last 10 years has been an average of 19%. However, that does not include state and local taxes paid in that span. Also, Fairfax County VA local taxes can suck a BBC.</p></div>		</li>
