			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to dislike olives. When I travel, I try and immerse myself in the local cuisine and I ended up having a lot of olives. I really enjoyed them.</p>
<p>It turns out that a lot of olives that I get in stores just are not great. Now I just dislike the majority of olives but relish getting good ones.</p>
<p>I like the Tassos olives, but can't find them here (Canada, bought them at Costco a couple of times and now I can't find them). They were less salty and more delicious.</p></div>		</li>
