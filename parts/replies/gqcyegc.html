			<div class="markdown"><p>I think my biggest concern about what the herd immunity threshold is, is that it is tied to rt, the reinfection rate. The higher that number is, and it is higher for several variants, the greater percentage of people are needed to achieve herd immunity. With continued spread, we will continue to see new mutations, so how quickly we stomp it out is very important</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can change the effective Rt through other measures such as limiting capacity, wearing masks, washing hands, and social distancing. It's all multiplicative, so one you get the Rt below 1, infected rays should start to decrease. Apparently, we've reached that stage already: <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1119412/covid-19-transmission-rate-us-by-state/" target="_blank">https://www.statista.com/statistics/1119412/covid-19-transmission-rate-us-by-state/</a></p>
<p>The problem is that opening too soon may very well increase it over 1. Still, if we get 70% vaccinated, and it has 95% efficacy, then you could get a place like Georgia from 0.84 down to 0.24. At that point, it's going to mostly burn out pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasnt under the impression they can confirm reinfection with the same strain, but having two mutations allows confirmation. With the number of strains circulating it seems possible there could be a wave of each strain...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also think that with more people vaccinated, even if that number does not reach 70-80%, spread may continue in some areas, but the opportunity for the virus to mutate declines substantially. And if it can’t mutate substantially, then it will have a harder time spreading over time as more and more of the non-vaccinated population has already had it....and have immunity against it since that strain won’t be too different from what they already had.  (If that makes any sense)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The virus has many different antigens, dozens or hundreds. Your immune system makes antibodies to some of them, randomly. As long as the antigens against which you have antibodies have not changed, you should have at least some degree of protection.</p>
<p>The theoretical advantage of some vaccines is that they put a selection of antigens in them, to force your body to make antibodies against the proteins most vital to the functioning of the virus, and are therefore relatively unlikely to change quickly.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>However, the emergence of a small number of reinfections in December, eight months after the first wave peak, is a cause for concern, suggesting that immunity may begin to wane in some patients around this time. Nonetheless, even with the limited number of reinfections, prior infection still confers a protective effect of 94% over the time of the study. This is equivalent to or better than the protection reported in recent vaccine studies.</p>

<p>A prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 83% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed five months following primary infection. This is the minimum likely effect as seroconversions were not included.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prior infection in patients with COVID-19 was highly protective against reinfection and symptomatic disease. Protective effectiveness increased over time, suggesting that viral shedding or ongoing immune response may persist beyond 90 days and may not represent true reinfection. As vaccine supply is a limited resource around the world, patients with known history of COVID-19 could delay early vaccination to allow for the most vulnerable to access the vaccine and slow transmission.</p>

<p>Duration appears to be at least six months, potentially longer (we won't really know until enough time passes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way things have been looking is those who have been infected are resistant but not entirely immune.</p>
<p>It's still far too early to tell for sure though, relatively speaking this virus is incredibly young in terms of how long it has been studied.</p></div>		</li>
