			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard it explained a number of ways. One is you shut down to tolerate the pain and trauma of say, being eaten alive by a lion, so that if you did get a chance to escape, you’d be able to do so and carry on with your life. The other is that it’s some weird left over from our lizard brains. Idk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well...if your enemy can't see you they can't kill you. </p>
<p>So if you freeze, you limit the ability of the enemy to find you. They don't have sound triggers and you aren't moving so you can blend in the background.</p></div>		</li>
