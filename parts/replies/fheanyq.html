			<div class="markdown"><p>To extend your explanation: coffee needs to be grinded. By grinding it becomes fine. More fine it is the larger specifit surface (the surface exposed to air). Hence larger area that can be oxidised.</p>
<p>Since coffee contains a lot of highly volatile compounds these to effects sync: oxidation and evaporation.</p>
<p>Stale coffee is highly bitter without any flavour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconding that. The aeropress saved me literally hundreds of pounds a year because instead of going to a coffee shop every day I'd make my own in the office kitchen. The coffee is not as good as an espresso machine, but it's cheaper, easier to clean and does not require electricity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grinding your own coffee and using it in a reusable pod is not the typical use of a Keurig. Freshly ground coffee will make a decent cup no matter what you do with it. The pods you buy in the store just suck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>French press man here...the single worst coffee related thing I've ever purchased was a Keurig. Gets dirty (internally) too quickly and most are almost impossible to get fully clean. The first time I had coffee from a French Press, I never went back to anything else....I usually only drink coffee black, occasionally with a little sugar. So the press is a godsend for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should get an aeropress. Easier to clean and makes better coffee. I have a &gt;1000$ espresso machine but I still occasionally pull out the aeropress and make a nice long black coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only drink black.</p>
<p>Pour-over is just a bit faster and more consistent in results for me than french press. </p>
<p>Both are good methods to achieving a proper extraction.</p></div>		</li>
