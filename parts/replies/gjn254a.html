			<div class="markdown"><p>Drivers/firmware are pieces of code designed to act as middlemen to the hardware. As such, they're given very privileged status when it comes to system security. Some exploits may leverage this &quot;high security clearance&quot; to mess with stuff ordinary software is not allowed to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Consider that many devices in your computer can read from and write to memory. (This is called DMA, or Direct Memory Access.) The way it's supposed to work is that the device and the OS agree on what part of memory will be used to communicate. But if the device or its driver were malicious, it could stomp on memory that was being used for a different purpose, like remembering your password for a website.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The SMT vulnerabilities for one. I would suggest looking up Meltdown and Specter, but they were patched in firmware updates. Cyber security isn’t my field, but basically it can be anything. When you write code, you can sometimes write unintentional consequences into it. Sometimes they are just weird inconsequential bugs, other times they can leave you vulnerable to attack. The point of the updates is that you can’t possibly find them all. I mean iPhone jailbreaking relies on their ability to get through firmware vulnerabilities. Apple tries their hardest for it not to be possible, but given enough time, people will find a way. At the end of the day nothing is air tight so it’s better to just constantly update and patch things as you find them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, just a CS student, so take this as speculation: I'm sure you could implement some sort of attack (eg buffer overflow) that runs on the GPU snd VRAM instead of CPU and DRAM.</p></div>		</li>
