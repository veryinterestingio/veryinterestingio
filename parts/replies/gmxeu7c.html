			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's why it seems like sometimes you can't stop using a product, like Carmex or chapstick, they do have some stuff that protects your lips but they also have stuff that dries them out, making you dependant on their product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get extremely dry hands in the winter (red, cracked, bleeding, and I’m not even outside or doing anything that would irritate them) and I finally realized that the alcohol in lotions and creams make it so much worse. I’m still on a mission to find a lotion that actually works. So many lotions, especially the heavily scented ones, end up making my hands burn and leave them worse off than when they started. The only thing that truly helps is summer when the humidity rolls around.</p></div>		</li>
