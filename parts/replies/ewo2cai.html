			<div class="markdown"><p>I found I was having difficulty sleeping and put it down to using tech before bed. I didn't want to give up the tech and I read that it's the screen color that keeps us awake, so I put a blue light filter on my phone and laptop. </p>
<p>It didn't help, so I tried stopping any activity involving screens an hour before bed time. </p>
<p>I used the hour for doing chores or other non-screen based things instead, and since then, I've found I am very rarely still wide awake at bed time. Now I go to bed tired much earlier than I used to, I fall asleep much faster and I sleep better.</p>
<p>Maybe the screen color is part of the problem, but I'm convinced a much bigger issue is the endorphin rush you get from social media/games. It keeps your mind active and looking for &quot;reward&quot; and suppresses your natural tiredness in service of that. Putting a hard stop on screen time means your brain can realise it's tired, and you go to bed when you actually should.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can literally fall asleep in under two minutes and my wife refuses to believe that and accuses me of faking sleep.  I close my eyes, turn off my brain, and drift off in no time at all and she keeps waking me up to discuss the intrusive thoughts that keep swimming around in her head, keeping her awake.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gotta feed the little bugger, take it for a short walk and bathroom business, which takes like 30-45min before bed each night. Staring at a screen is no longer a problem really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or have children. They somehow think we are awake until midnight partying. Nah, we’re in bed 30 mins after they are in bed. I’d be in bed before the kids if they would actually go to sleep themselves and wash the dishes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mum never understood how me and my brother could stay up half the night on our computers but she recently got a laptop and said it was so easy to be on it and glance at the time and realise it's midnight. I agree that the blue light isn't the main problem it's the stimulation of the gadget itself. Playing the sims is the worst for me!</p>
<p>I'm 28 now and have created a really structured bed routine - no pc / video games past 8pm, bit of tv and crochet from 9-10pm then read for 20 minutes as I settle down - it really helps :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a study that put tiny blue light devicd behind the test subjects knees while they slept and they also found a disturbance in sleep. So you basically have go make sure all devices have a filter or are turned off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg so when i was a kid there used to be this show on CITV (the old childrens afternoon slot on ITV/Channel 3 here in the UK) called How? </p>
<p>It was a brilliant show in which they explained all sorts of weird and wonderful scientific facts. Anyway so I always vaguely remembered one episode where they explained jetlag and I was convinced that they said one way to deal with it was to shine a torch behind the knee! </p>
<p>It would be my go to &quot;useless factoid&quot; whenever the chance presented itself and people would look at me like I'm a weirdo and be like &quot;Sure Jan, but that's not how things work&quot;. So I would often wonder if this was a false memory since I would have been like 9.</p>
<p>FUCKING VALIDATION.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Further analysis of these 15 reports indicated that a two-hour exposure to blue light (460 nm) in the evening suppresses melatonin, the maximum melatonin-suppressing effect being achieved at the shortest wavelengths (424 nm, violet). The melatonin concentration recovered rather rapidly, within 15 min from cessation of the exposure, suggesting a short-term or simultaneous impact of light exposure on the melatonin secretion. Melatonin secretion and suppression were reduced with age, but the light-induced circadian phase advance was not impaired with age. Light exposure in the evening, at night and in the morning affected the circadian phase of melatonin levels. In addition, even the longest wavelengths (631 nm, red) and intermittent light exposures induced circadian resetting responses, and exposure to low light levels (5-10 lux) at night when sleeping with eyes closed induced a circadian response. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't doubt this, but I wonder if there isn't more to it. My understanding was that a common recommendation currently centres around going camping for 2-3 days if you're struggling with sleep issues.  </p>
<p>My thoughts are that the blue light panic is overblown, and it's more that until recently you didn't hold a light source you're focusing on close to your face for an hour+ right before trying to sleep. Yes you might have read a book, but it was via indirect lighting or a low powered torch pointed at the book. </p>
<p>A lot of these devices are ridiculously bright at default or high settings. I have an e-reader and the light on it is ridiculous, I have it set to 4% when I read in the dark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was about to ask about that. I've got that set on mine too and I was wondering if the grayscale is actually shown to be helpful with going to sleep. For me it mostly just makes me want to put my phone down because it's weird to use in grayscale mode, so I guess it works one way or another haha.</p></div>		</li>
