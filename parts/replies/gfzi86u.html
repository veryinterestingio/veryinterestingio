			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>This increase in risk among alcohol abstainers suggests that the alcohol  content of certain mouthwashes (up to 30 percent) may be a causal agent  for head and neck cancers.  </p>
<p>Our mouthwash results should be interpreted with caution, as they are limited by our recording only the frequency of use. Questions on the brand of mouthwash, alcohol content, duration of use, and how long it was retained in the mouth were not asked. Mouthwash is an expensive product in Latin America and is therefore not widely used.  </p>
<p>Further, mouthwash use was strongly correlated with the presence of visible oral lesions (<em>r</em> = 0.29, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.0001). This suggests that increased mouthwash use could be in response to symptoms of disease and could explain why other studies have not observed increased risk for head and neck cancer with use of  mouthwash.</p>

<p>Assuming you're referring to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwm193" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>I wonder if there's any research on non-alcohol based mouthwash, which seems to be more prominent in my area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically because salt water also reduces swellings of wounds since it's isotonic. It contains about the same minerals as our bodies in equal concentration and therefore doesn't irritate the tissue. It's good for the healing process after a surgery in short term.</p>
<p>However, it's a double edged sword since it can longterm change the PH balance of the oral cavity and soften your tooth enamel which makes them more susceptible to develop cavities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as an addendum pouring some salt from your shaker into a glass of water is not going to create an isotonic solution. Physiologic or isotonic saline is 0.9% saline to be isotonic with the salinity of ourselves. By contrast seawater is 3-4% saline which is why if you drink it you will become dehydrated as your body needs to dilute to 0.9%</p></div>		</li>
