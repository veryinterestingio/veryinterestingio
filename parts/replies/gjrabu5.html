			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good top comment answer. I would like to add that it is very common for a successful new brand to come out, get sued by a bunch of random trademark holders, and pay them off as a cost of doing business. I have only been involved of the launch of 5 new IPs (all video games.) we were sued for infringement on all of them. Three of the products were duds so we just folded the little limited liability companies we had created for the products. For the successes, we offered a flat payment or said we would change our infringing stuff. The trademark holders are holding otherwise worthless trademarks, so this is their payday and they donâ€™t want to miss out. But they also know rebranding costs us, so they leverage that. We settled for only a few thousand dollars (way cheaper than what corporations have to pay their lawyers to not infringe in the first place.) New people tried to sue after that, as the game got more popular. But the past settlement acts as a shield against the future settlements (they are infringing on the earlier guy so  he could sue them.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the early 90s there was a reggae band called &quot;The Toucans&quot; from Seattle.  They <del>were sued by Kellogg's</del>  <em>initially denied a trademark</em> because Kellogg's claimed the band could be confused as connected to their Fruit Loops mascot, Toucan Sam.<br />
Eventually, it was settled that they could continue using the name as long as they never incorporated any imagery of tropical birds that could speak in &quot;a British, South African, Australian, or New Zealander&quot; accent.<br />
I remember reading about this in the newspaper many years ago.</p>
<p>Edit:  [I found a source!] (<a href="http://www.toucans.net/Trademark/PubResp1.html" target="_blank">http://www.toucans.net/Trademark/PubResp1.html</a>)  I was off a bit on the details, but not bad considering I was remembering an article I read from 1995.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;olympic rings&quot; example is awkward. The International Olympic Committee enjoys <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/us/1996/title36/chap17/subchapi/sec380/" target="_blank">special statutory protection</a> for this symbol. <a href="http://www.genericfairuse.com/2016/08/04/olympic-trademarks-are-sacred-and-easily-infringed/" target="_blank">You can't use the five rings</a> to promote a sports drink or anything else without permission from the IOC (which is <em>highly vigilant</em> about protecting its mark). Your comment about a mark being limited to specific goods and services is generally right--but there are exceptions, and this is one of them. IANAL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I specifically chose that example because it was one of the first famous lawsuits around this subject where IOC actually lost. You can still buy <a href="https://ringnes.no/media/24005/vorterol_330_can.png" target="_blank">olympic rings branded sports drinks</a> to this day. But otherwise you are correct in that major brands are able to enjoy trademark protection for all goods and services. The IOC example was before the olympic rings were a major brand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols#Intellectual_property" target="_blank">Norwegian Law in 1952</a>. If it's still in use today, it's an old exception that was grandfathered in (or subsequently licensed). Norway is now a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), <a href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/nairobi/" target="_blank">which granted special protection the Olympic marks in 1981</a>. Since you're writing in the present tense, and not 70 years ago, the &quot;olympic rings&quot; example is awkward. In just about any jurisdiction, using the rings as a mark without permission from the IOC will get you sued, and you will lose. IANAL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. US law allows stronger protection for &quot;<a href="https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/trademark-policy/well-known-marks" target="_blank">famous marks</a>.&quot; The Google name and logo would surely qualify. In effect, they own their marks regardless of goods and services. On top of that, Google can afford more and better lawyers than you can. IANAL.</p></div>		</li>
