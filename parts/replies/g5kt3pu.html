<p>Power is amplitude squared, but if you have incoherent signals, the powers add, not the amplitudes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I’m sure for the apparent loudness vs meausred loudness, the inverse square law comes into play. A group of people shouting wouldn’t stack linearly because the physical distance causes a huge drop off as the people in the crowd/line get farther away from the listener.</p></div>		</li>

<p>100 people is about 100x the energy, which will triple the decibels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't seem right. Let's say one person shouts at 100 decibels, then according to you 100 people shouting would produce 300 decibels, which is enough to set everyone's hair on fire</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the scale is actually 10 decibels is an increase of an order of magnitude, so in this case it would be 1 person = 100db, 100 people ≈ 120db-(attenuation from canceling waves+attenuation from the larger distance)</p>
<p>Edit: fun fact, this changes at about 194db because the trough of the sound wave is so deep it is complete vacuum and as such can't get any more intense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>+3 decibel is close to double the energy, not x100. Since we are talking about x100 here it would be about +20 decibel (very very roughly). So 100 dB would go to ~120 dB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big issue there is distance.</p>
<p>Imagine one person standing right next to your ear and screaming in it loud, and then trying to imagine increasing that to 10 people. The big problem is that 10 people will not fit that close around you, so some of them have to stand two or three or four times further away. And because intensity of also drops off geometrically, that means each of them will be adding a lot less than the full 100 decibels.</p></div>		</li>
