			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I think it was Moderna, but they had reworked this vaccine and had it completed in it's current form by March 2020. Everything since then had just been testing. It was complete before or first lockdown. </p>
<p>This was thanks in part to Sars-cov-2 being gene sequenced in only two days.</p>
