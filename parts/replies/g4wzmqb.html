			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit. Total game changer for me dealing with cystic acne.</p>
<p>Even not picking it the cyst always causes the skin to die and peel back into an open sore, often a cm across. </p>
<p>Used to take me months and months to heal up, with it constantly reopening and re healing and possibly getting infected. </p>
<p>Those little hydro colloid stickers reduce it to like a week. And I don't get repeat break outs!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a nasty spill on my bike a couple of years ago and lost a lot of skin in my shin. A friend of mine whoâ€™s a nurse insisted I dress it properly every day but not let it dry out at all - it took a few weeks but all the skin grew back and I barely even have a mark now.</p>
<p>Admittedly though, it did look pretty horrific during the process!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the answer then is: a fish's wounds don't clot? </p>
<p>Or am I understanding your answer wrong?</p>
<p>Edit: lmao apparently I'm getting downvoted bc I didn't understand something. Reddit truly is a magical place</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OC said that clotting does not require the wound to be dry. The wound still clots, it just happens from the inside and is therefore less visible.</p></div>		</li>
