			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I can finally see it in my mind. I feel a mixture of anger and shame. Anger because nobody I've asked in the past three years could dumb it down like reddit did in less than 15 minutes and shame that I couldn't get something so simple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be completely fair, despite the incredibly simple nature of this, it <em>is</em> a rather hard concept to grasp. Heck, a year into my engineering studies at the university people took some time to understand how this worked, and this is people spending their lives with those kind of problems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Easy means it takes little time to understand.</p>
<p>Simple means that when you learn it, it covers everything.</p>
<p>easy: Pythagorean theorem.  &quot;If you have a right triangle, and attach squares to each side so that the side of the triangle is a side of the square exactly, the long side's square has the same area as the other two squares together.&quot;  Requires a right triangle, a Euclidean plane (you don't even learn other surfaces are different until much later), and, possibly, a lot of paper or other flat stock to measure out the squares on.</p>
<p>simple: the law of cosines.  &quot;For any triangle of sides a, b, and c, on a Euclidean plane, c^2 = a^2 +b^2 -2ab * cos Θ , where Θ is the angle between sides a and b.&quot;  This covers any triangle in a euclidean space of dimension 2 or greater (the concept of triangle in a euclidean 1-space is undefined, since a 1-space is just a line; also, I'm not certain if fractional dimensional spaces can be euclidean, so I'm not including those just in case).</p>
<p>The Pythagorean theorem is literally just an easy special case of the law of cosines where Θ is π/2 radians, or 90^o because then the cosine term is 0 and it collapses away.  Good luck explaining that to a 3rd grader though, unless the kid's a lot brighter and more highly taught than I was.</p></div>		</li>
