			<div class="markdown"><p>This lines up with what I've learned about Alzheimer's patients.  Music memory is stored in a different area of the brain than language memory.  The music memory area suffers less damage.  That area is associated with emotion.  That's also the area of the brain where swear words are stored; with emotion, not language.  It's why music is recommended for Alzheimer's patients and why they can still recall swear words when other language is lost.</p>
<p>But maybe that book explained all that :)  Sounds like an interesting book to add to my reading list.</p></div>		</li>
