			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a fascinating rabbit hole to go down. You'll notice that art subject matter started to really change after the Printing Press. That's not just a coincidence. The printing press allowed for a greater spread of ideas and changed trading in a big way. This meant more people had money and ideas about subject matter traveled faster. This is the time where we start to see portraits instead of only religious art. We are also starting to see the every day still life's out of the Netherlands. Families like the Medici sponsored artists for works to decorate their homes, not just the churches.
As time marches on, and the industrial revolution hits it stride, there is even more communication, more money, more interest in art to be pretty, not just portraits and religious art. Most importantly, industrialization has dropped the cost of art supplies and created acrylic paints. This opened up art to the masses. Communication and travel is exploding, allowing swift exchanging of ideas. If you look at a chart of art through the ages, Western art really branches out in the 1800's, thanks to industrialization, cheaper products, more people having disposable income, and communication. </p>
<p>Art History is really an interesting subject to study, even if you don't really care for art. It follows the growth of humanity and how everything is connected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent, succinct art history lesson.  Working the industrial and financial side of art into the narrative tied it together very nicely.  While I have generally known this timeline (I am ancient..really), your last paragraph says it all. Who would think that such an etherial subject could provide such a history of civilization. Humanity is, indeed, a creative species. Saying that brings another thought to mind. Other than the higher primates, I can't think of any other species that creates just for the enjoyment of doing so.  Insects and birds build, but it seems to be for survival. Can you enlighten me ?</p></div>		</li>

<p>see Giotto “Confirmation of the rule”</p>
<p>The ancient greeks  produced physically realistic sculpture, but no perspective drawing.</p>
<p>Mesolithic sculptures can be highly realistic - yet full perspective drawing took until the renaissance to develop</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a theory that says art isn't a representation of artistic ideals, but a representation of technological advancement. If this is the case then the introduction of perspective was to support a society that was beginning to understand the geometry of the world around them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is certain the case with modern art and impressionism. Impressionism became possible because tubes of paint were invented, so you could actually paint outside, and then sell the paintings to the (relatively new and booming) nature tourism industry at the time.</p>
<p>With photography it was much easier to get good depictions of objects that you could then collage together into a unified painting (they used to do this with smaller paintings). But also it made more room for thinking about other artistic styles -- <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/edouard_manet-luncheon-on-the-grass-1.jpg" target="_blank">Luncheon on the Grass</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Edouard_Manet_-_Olympia_-_Google_Art_Project_3.jpg" target="_blank">Olympia</a> were just as controversial for the lack of realism in the artistic style, e.g., in the shading of the skin, as they were controversial because of the subject matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much what I got taught in art history 30 years ago. From memory he was also an architect so this was a great way to showcase his work. Another distant memory is he had created a grid apparatus to keep the point needing to be looked trough to get the exact perspective being reproduced as well as separating it in a grid to &quot;divide&quot; the work up to smaller pieces, divide and conquer!</p></div>		</li>
