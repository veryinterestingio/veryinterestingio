<p>Drugs usually force the body to directly create the neurotransmitters which will make you feel happy in as little as a minute. But this will further shorten the shortage of neurotransmitters in the future.</p>

<p>So basically drugs make depression worsen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, to start from zero you would have to stop taking it for weeks or months.  It’s generally thought that these types of drugs (SSRI’s) build up in your system over a period of time.  Missing a day here and there won’t drop you back to zero but it’s not good for your mental well being.  It can cause ups and downs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meds always (at least in Netherlands) come with an informative piece of paper, which contain info about the secondary effects and also say what to do when forgetting to take a pill.</p>
<p>Usually with these types of meds you should still take the pill, unless you're close to the next dose. But better check that leaflet!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no clue why that is. It's an SNRI. Usually it makes people feel a bit more down in the beginning.</p>
<p>Maybe they gave you something extra? Or the idea that finally something will help for the depression might be a huge mood boost as well?</p>
<p>Hope you are doing better :)</p></div>		</li>
