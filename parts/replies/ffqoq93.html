			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience with these games, if they have a PvP system, they also put the odds in the whales favor. Rewarding them for their good spending habits by matching them against trash. (eg non spending other players) The ultimate form of pay to win I see. You spend light and just get matched against much harder opponents. And the more you spend the easier your matches get.  I remember leaving Boom Beach for that reason. (Pay to reset your player matches)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And there are games where you literally pay to win, and in order to win, you have to be in a group with other people who also pay for the win. Used your 3 free attacks? Spend 50 gems for another three. The next three will be 100, the following will be 200, then 300 and so on. Those attacks not good enough? Buy this super attack for 3000! </p>
<p>Your opponent powering up faster than you? Buy this $1.49 pack. Bought your allocated max of 3 of those today? Buy the next one for $7.49. Those gone too? What about the $30.99 pack? </p>
<p>Need more energy for that mini game you just have to win every three days so you get better rewards and power up faster? Buy packs and we will give you energy. </p>
<p>Here is a leader board and special clothes so you can prove how much you are a winner. And here are special treats as you spend more money and get &quot;vip&quot; status as you spend thousands of dollars getting &quot;vip&quot; levels. </p>
<p>I play a game with some mates casually that you can consistently spend over $3500/day on packs varying from $1.49 up to $159.99. The smaller packs you can buy up to 6 times. The $159.99 you can buy 18 of per day! And trust me, people do. We watched the other servers (there are some 400 servers in our region as joining an established server is pointless as you will never progress) and we have seen people on servers 200 later than ours streak to the top of the leader boards purely by spending the most.</p>
<p>As petty as it is, we play now because it amuses us to see the others spend their money trying to beat us as these people simply cannot handle not being at  the top of everything all the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sounds like a 1%'er. Oh wait, their kids are probably the whales we're describing. Money is their toilet paper.</p></div>		</li>
