They dont do this while standing still so your heart has to  work harder and blood might still pool in your legs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why forcing retail/food service workers to stand still for hours on end when the same job could easily be accomplished sitting on a stool is tantamount to torture (seriously, it's some of the worst pain I've ever endured in my life, and I have foot problems too where I can't stand/walk for very long, but my managers didn't give a fuck and told me to stand anyway, in all of the jobs I've been forced to stand in)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear you. My overlords wouldn't even give me a cushioned mat like the security people have to aleviate the pain. Stand there for 8 hours, with a few breaks allowed while you get to restock shelves instead, so add some back pain to the leg pain and foot pain. I would be almost unable to stand up again for a few hours once I got home and sat down. I can't see why or how anyone could do those jobs long term for so little pay. Not even enough to put in retirement savings or cover your inevitable medical expenses when you're elderly and <em>mysteriously</em> have leg and back problems. </p>
<p>Apparently it's because customers will think that you're disrespectful and lazy if you're sitting while working, and also that upper management believes that allowing employees to sit while doing their monotonous task that requires no movement will lead them to become lazy and sit around all day when they're asked to do other things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And ALSO:  When standing many muscles relax and stop helping hold you up.  This puts more stress on your skeletal system as it takes over the &quot;holding you up job.&quot;  When working together the work load is split, whereas standing you may notice more hip/knee/ankle/foot/back pain as the muscles relax over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have sinus tachycardia and I can't stand in place for more than two or three minutes because my heart goes CRAZY. It's normally 100-110 bpm with medication, but soars up to 150-160 bpm when I stand in place. It's the worst. But I'm usually okay while walking!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also moving keeps your heart rate up, so in addition to the fact that the motion of walking moves blood around, it also keeps your heart rate and thus your circulation up, refreshing blood to those tired muscles.</p></div>		</li>
