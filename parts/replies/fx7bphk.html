			<div class="markdown"><p>What you say is rather true.  It's about like trying to use opinionated logic rather than reasoning with another just because both sides don't seem to see eye to eye right off the bat.  Thus why it's a 'logical fallacy'; an incorrect use of logic just to sway or perhaps bend the truth for ones own personal belief.  Pretty much just as bad as bending the truth for the sake of alteration and/or deception alone.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, it's not just opinion that is to be accounted for with the origin of this saying.  Has to do with persona traits which can cause confusion/misunderstanding.  It's best to just walk away some times.  Not knowing can be a good thing HEHE enjoy what you already have instead of demanding more all the time.</p></div>		</li>
