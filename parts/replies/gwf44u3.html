			<div class="markdown"><p>The Bible specifically mentions Herod the Great as still alive when Jesus is born.</p>
<p>Comparing non-biblical records from adjacent kingdoms suggests that Herod the Great had died by 4 BC, placing Jesus’ birth shortly before that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets even more complicated than that... Luke says the birth happened during a Roman census. The Romans took possession of the area and held their first census involving Bethlehem in 6 AD, as a result of deposing Herod’s son. So Matthew’s story involving Magi, Herod, and the slaughter of babies <em>cannot</em> be squared with Luke’s story of Romans, shepherds, and mangers.</p></div>		</li>
