			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I intentionally ignored security and privacy concerns because 5 year olds don't know what privacy is, but here's a slightly better explanation but maybe not 5 year old level</p>
<p>Privacy concerns about cookies is people stamping you after every ride, every stop, every bathroom visit, so someone else knows everywhere you have been. Some random person just ran up and stamped you. Why? You don't know. Thats why European countries enforce a law saying you have to agree to being stamped.</p>
<p>Security is where it falls apart. I knew that when typing it up. If a 5 year old points out that they could get a imitation stamp and get into the park for free, I'd praise their observation as being very clever. Cookies are NEVER TO BE USED FOR SECURITY. Only for convenience, as they can be faked. </p>
<p>Again, I was writing it like I was talking to my nephew. Little kids don't need long lectures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some random person bumped into you and you thought nothing of it, but they actually slapped an invisible ink stamp on you that you only learn about when you go to the ride that has black lights.</p>
<p>Edit: invisible ink stamp, not invisible cookie</p></div>		</li>

<p>What do you mean? Cookies are used for security on pretty much every web site that you can log into. It's entirely standard practice.</p></div>		</li>

&quot;LI5 means friendly, simplified and layperson-accessible explanations - not responses aimed at literal five-year-olds.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does <em>layman</em> even mean? To some, layman is understandable to 50% of people. To others, layman is understandable to 90% of people.</p>
<p>This subreddit achieves the first part, yet struggles with the second.</p>
<p>ELI5's whole spirit is for everybody to intuitively <strong>get</strong> it, which is why the age 5 is used.</p>

<p>This subreddit is like my brother trying to explain stuff to my mom. But since it takes a lot of effort and empathy, many people don't do enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This but also after you leave the park the stamp shoots a Bat-signal into the sky so that the amusement park can follow you once you leave the park and see all the other parks that you have visited as well.</p>
<p>All the amusement parks do this so that way they can tell what kind of amusement parks are your favorite. Isn't that great? It is like having an imaginary friend who always keeps you company, only they are real and their name is Mark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in some cases the park gives you maybe 20-30 different stamps, all with different signals.</p>
<p>Various people (some nice and normal, some a bit shady) pay the park money to put their own stamp on you, so they can follow where you go. And whenever you visit a park that would give you a particular stamp, instead of giving you a new version of that stamp, they add to it which park you are visiting now, and read off all the previous parks you have been to. And the restaurants. And shops. And train stations. And any other place that might stamp you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we are explaining to adults in a way a five year old can understand. Not explaining things based on a five year olds value judgements. </p>
<p>Kids might not care about privacy. But if the question is what am I agreeing to, you still need to mention the significant privacy implications. A five year old doesn't care, but an adult seeking a simple explanation might.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except they can write whatever they want on the stamp, like a number, so they can collect information on what rides you used the most, etc. And widespread platforms like Facebook can ask for your ticket if you go to many places outside the park, like a coffee shop, an hotel or a gas station. If you see the Facebook logo there (and maybe even if you don't) is possible that they're seeing you back.</p></div>		</li>
