			<div class="markdown"><p>Thirst is an evolutionary indicator that at some point in the future you will need to find water. It's is not an indicator that you must find water NOW. If that was the case we would never have become pursuit hunters. Our ability to sweat profusely to maintain core body temperature and at the same time tolerate up to severe dehydration allowed us to outlast our prey animals. Once the hunt was concluded we would then rehydrate. </p>
<p>Unfortunately modern marketing makes a lot of people believe that you need to drink constantly or you will perform badly. So drink your Coca Cola bottled water!</p>
<p>The truth is in real life activities often the most dehydrated athlete is the winner. They put aside the discomfort of thirst until after the event is completed. Several studies show the winners of marathon events are also the most dehydrated. So the people with the best performance are also the most dehydrated. Which blows up the suggestion that dehydration causes a decrease in performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for the last paragraph? I’ve never heard that and find it hard to believe considering athletes are always hydrating, often trying to hydrate as much as possible in the days before an event</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe he is referencing how far into dehydration that they can go, not starting off in a dehydrated state. </p>
<p>The book Endure by Alex Hutchinson has a chapter or two about this (as well as references), I lent it out so I can’t pull them directly, but the data is out there. I’ll try to find you one.</p>
<p>Edit: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This information can be dangerous if taken at face value.</p>
<p>Being hydrated is vital to your health and safety, specifically when doing strenuous activity or in heat.</p>
<p>Severe dehydration, including low electrolytes, kills people. Heat stroke is a medical emergency.</p>
<p>Ultra endurance athletes and hunters from thousands of years ago may have gradually learned their body's limits, but I imagine many also collapsed and died.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your last paragraph is completely missing the point of those studies: it’s not about who starts as the most dehydrated it’s likely about who can push themselves the hardest, push themselves to that point of dehydration. So make sure you still stay hydrated homie.</p></div>		</li>
