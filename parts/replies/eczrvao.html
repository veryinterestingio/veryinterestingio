			<div class="markdown"><p>Being satisfied makes you feel sleepy. It turns up the parasympathetic nervous system which is responsible for rest and relaxation. Eating until you’re bursting causes reflux and overstretches the stomach, causing pain. You’re probably not going far enough. That’s a good thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't find that light - even blue light - inhibits my ability to sleep. If I'm having trouble falling asleep I can read Reddit on my phone for 20 minutes to distract myself and then be falling asleep as I try to read. Does it not affect me, or do I make enough melatonin that it does decrease it but not enough to actually matter? Taking melatonin tablets makes me feel jittery rather than actually tired, as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep is influenced by these things, not necessarily 100% dependent on them. This stuff is all basic “sleep hygiene” advice that you’ll be given if you’re having trouble sleeping. The truth is everybody is different, not all advice is applicable to everyone, and who knows what your individual variables are. Sometimes people just don’t need as much sleep as others - there’s stories of various  people who got by on 3-4 hours a night with no apparent deficit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely need my eight hours, haha. If I get less than six I'm basically a zombie, and caffeine only sort of fixes it. Which is impressive, considering that I don't normally consume caffeine. I just find it very easy to fall asleep and to wake up. The only thing that really disrupts it is sudden noises that are louder than the background noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually watch YouTube videos on my phone until I fall asleep unintentionally at God knows what hour. Doesn't this negate the first three things? Is it just easier to fall asleep the tireder(?) you are independent of these things? </p></div>		</li>
