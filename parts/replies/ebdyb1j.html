			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the incentive would be ‘is it something people will pay extra for/leave the competition for?’. Likely research showed that the quality was already good enough that offering higher quality wouldn’t have resulted in an appreciable increase in income/users while at the same time requiring a substantial change in infrastructure. I think by the time people started to wonder why call quality wasn’t higher they already had ways to talk to people with higher quality, the internet, so again why change your entire infrastructure to replicate something that already exists? You don’t, you just run voice through your data line instead of your phone line.</p>
<p>I mean take any technology and you can take it to the extreme and it would be way better, but will it make you money? You can make a Toyota Camry go 200mph and make it $20000 more expensive but despite it being a ‘better’ car it will probably lose money because people bought camrys because they were cheap not because they could go fast, now they aren’t cheap anymore so less people will buy them, in the long run it will lose money. Better isn’t always best</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well they have done quite a bit of improvements for &quot;landlines&quot;
I work IT for a corporate office and we all use IP phones that connect via a network cable.
the sound quality is crystal clear with no static at all. if the other person on the line mutes their microphone, it'll be dead silent. as if there was no one else on the line.
we also have hold music and it sounds like you're basically listening through some $10-20 earbuds. </p></div>		</li>
