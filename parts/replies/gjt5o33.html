			<div class="markdown"><p>This also explains why eventually the effect of mint and eucalyptus will grow weaker the more often you use it in a given time. As with all sensory receptors, eventually the brain will start to ignore constant stimulation of those temperature receptors (after wearing a shirt for more than a minute, your touch receptors on your torso barely register something touching them), and in turn will stop telling the blood vessels in your nose to contract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of trippy when you think about it.  You can start to wonder, &quot;how much is my brain ignoring?&quot;.  </p>
<p>The really scary part is that it can ignore visual input as well.  You can experience this on your daily commute.  If you drive the same route every single day you can have a day where you barely register driving to work, all of a sudden you're in the parking lot and don't even remember the drive.  This is because the drive has become so routine, the brain ignores the input because it's seen it so many times before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the things that helped me realize I had ADHD as an adult. A big part of having ADHD is the brain’s filter not working as well as it should. I always just thought I had “sensitive skin” or some such since it was so difficult to find clothes that didn’t constantly irritate me. Unless I can find something to hyperfocus on an uncomfortable shirt, a stuffy room, or a seam in my socks can drive me bonkers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was taught this fact in school over 30 years ago, and I just couldn't relate. I feel my clothes all the time. Last year I was diagnosed with mild autism, and was told not being able to filter sensory input is a common part of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is very true.  That is why those who suffer from severe autism will sometimes make a constant humming noise.  The humming noise will drown out the external auditory input from the outside world making it easier for their brain to function.</p>
<p>I highly suggest looking up a young woman by the name of Carly Fleischmann. She's non verbal with autism but learned how to communicate via computer. An impressive and very eye opening story into the world of autism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I don't think that's really true in general either.</p>
<p>Only if it's an input you are already familiar with, will it be tuned out in people without sensory processing disorder.</p>
<p>Like when I started wearing leggings and skirts I was definetely aware of those sensory inputs for much longer than if I had just put on lose fitting pants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. TIL I may have a sensory processing disorder. I hate wearing shirts. </p>
<p>Oddly enough, the annoying feeling of constantly being touched is less bad if the shirt is made of coarse fabric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the brain also stop telling the blood vessels to contract if it was actually cold? If it doesn't then what's the difference? If it does then how come for example we don't stop sweating after being hot for a while?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, thanks so much for clarifying this, but did you mean &quot;contract&quot; instead of &quot;contact&quot;? I don't mean to sound like a grammar nazi, I was just genuinely curious. It could be a bit confusing if some people actually end up wondering &quot;contacting what.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation!</p>
<p>I had to have my turbinites removed years ago, now even when I have a cold I can still breath fine. Eucalyptus and such do almost nothing now since my nasal passage is basically in permanent &quot;open&quot; mode (is how it was explained to me). Its nice being able to breathe, and it helped clear up some serious sleep apnea, but man did the recovery suck, so I don't recommend anyone try it unless you have no choice hehe.</p></div>		</li>
