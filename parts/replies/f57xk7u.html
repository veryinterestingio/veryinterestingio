			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually our ears are already well suited for determining the direction of sound. The outer ear's structure gathers and reflects sound in such a way that our brains can determine the direction of sound in all 3 dimensions. Some other animals, notably dogs because it's so cute, need to turn their head and orient their ears vertically to determine the vertical location of the sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I thought too, closer hand should make a higher frequency peak of noise, but just putting your palm against your ear and moving it back and fourth, the pitch is actually higher when you hand is a short distance from your ear, then moves <em>lower</em> as you move it closer, as if you are shifting the cuttoff of a lowpass filter applied to static, exactly the opposite of what I would expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I just imagining things, or does the volume modulate with how relaxed/tight the muscles in your hand are?   I'd swear I'm not making gaps that would account for sound escaping, but a loosely cupped, relaxed hand vs a tight one seems pretty distinct.  Does muscle contraction make a sound?</p>
<p>Edit:  not sure if it's what OP was talking about, but just holding a tightly clenched fist near your ear versus a relaxed hand is audibly different, so we're not dealing with how sound bounces in an enclosed space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, same thing as holding a seashell to your ear.  Clearly one component of the &quot;white noise&quot; is the chamber your cupped hand makes.  My point was that there seems to be another unrelated component that I'm still (unsuccessfully) trying to track down.</p>
<p>Try simply touching an area near the concha symba with a finger, for example.  No resonance chamber is made, but personally something (that at least feels like the muscles around my ear) seem to react with a light hum that quickly fades over time.</p></div>		</li>
