			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Constant bombardment&quot; is almost an understatement. They used to use what was called drumfire, where artillery would be staggered so it was exploding like a fucking drum roll over your trench.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/mRPFQMO8yX4?t=38" target="_blank">Very loud video demonstrating what it would sound like</a></p>
<p>These bombardments would last for <em>days</em> without end in preparation for an attack. Sitting under that would fuck you up in a special kind of way not seen in modern combat. PTSD is of course very serious but Shell Shock from WWI was like PTSD+. That's where you get the severe physical symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can take a solid day to recover from a long flight due to the constant noise and uncomfertable seating. I think of that and imagine doing that for days with 10 times the noise. And then doing it again, and again, and again, for months or years. Knowing that at any moment one of those shells could land on, or worse, near you and if it didn't kill you outright would leave you die in the mud or at the hands of very primitive medicine. </p>
<p>All wars have their horrors but there is something unthinkably horrific about WW1. In many ways I imagine it had the same effect as being in a concentration or POW camp. Just endless suffering and fear of death while your labor and blood is pointlessly expended for meaningless goals.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>WW1 had drumfire barrages. Munitions much bigger were used and in such rapid, continuous fire that from a distance it sounded like a drum roll.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there has been a war before, or since WWI in which soldiers were exposed to such intense combat and shelling for such prolonged periods of time. That's why this is the first war where shell shock really started occurring- men just physically and psychologically breaking down.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that because no one really understood the condition at the time (or what effects these new weapons had on human bodies and psyches), many of these men were executed by their superiors for cowardice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best response I've seen yet. The issue is that in WWI it was likely (as we dont have brain scans from these soldiers) a combination of PTSD and having a traumatic brain injury (TBI). You see tremors at a greater frequency in those with a TBI from modern conflicts. In soldiers who served in WWI it was as u/cdb03b said the pressure from the shelling and the impact of the shelling caused your brain to shake inside your skull causing permanent damage. This damage is neurological in nature while PTSD is psychological in nature which causes neurological alterations to how the brain functions and can cause damage to specific regions of the brain. This can lead to tremors at times in those with PTSD. Happy to talk more about this as I'm a vet with PTSD and a Ph.D. in psychology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow so it was partly physical as well! I didn't know. That's really interesting. But then how did they manage to alleviate the tremors, sometimes even making them stop? If the neurological damage was irreversible? Was it because the psychological symptoms could be relieved, thus making the tremors less noticeable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the severity of the TBI. With very extreme TBI's they may never stop. Mild and moderate TBI's may lead to tremors when the person is stressed and the increase in cortisol in the brain would cause the tremors. A number of other aspects are believe to impact tremors though we really only understand how 20% to 25% of the brain works so theres still a lot we dont know for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fascinating.  There is a popular narrative that in WWI we just didn't understand PTSD, and &quot;shell shock&quot; was a primitive description thereof.  I've seen little discussion of the distinctively terrible bombardment and its direct impact on human brains.</p>
<p>Is there any equipment or precaution (available now or 100 years ago) that would reduce the TBI potential for soldiers facing such conditions? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From artillery? No. Most TBI's suffered in modern conflicts are from road side bombs (also called IED's). There is equipment to reduce the risk of TBI's and other injuries in this case mainly in the form of v-hulled vehicles like the RG-31. Essentially what happens is the blast is deflected away from the vehicle because the underside is shaped like a v while a normal flat bodied vehicle will end up absorbing the majority of the blast.</p></div>		</li>
