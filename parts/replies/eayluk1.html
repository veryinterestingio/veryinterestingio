			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually need at least three GPS satellites to pinpoint your location. And the satellite doesn't see anything. Your phone listens to a timecode, and because the signal travels with light speed to your phone but the distance to the different satellites is different, this timecode gets delayed and with some clever maths your phone fogures out what is the distance of it in relation to those satellutes and gets you coordinates.</p>
<p>And your phone checks for WiFis too for geolocation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Props for being the only commenter to (correctly) reject the idea of cell phones sending signals to satellites. </p>
<p>Geolocation is partially done by towers, but that is basically a hint to the GPS system to speed up satellite signal acquisition. Tower based hints are not precise enough for navigation. Other hints are used, too, such as WiFi access points. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It depends on the navigation. My first generation iPhone had no problem tracking me down a highway using nothing but cell towers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Targets in motion are easier to understand. You're moving fast south within a 100 meter radius that contains a southbound freeway, that's probably where you are.</p>
<p>Your ipad probably was less good at tracking you in neighborhoods, because there will be numerous streets within that radius and lower speeds are harder to estimate.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Mostly. Satellites carry about 1% of international telecommunications traffic. The rest is cables.</p>

<p>Normal cell phones never send data to satellites. </p></div>		</li>
