			<div class="markdown"><p>So when a dye is hit by photons, electrons undergo a transition from ground state to excited state by absorbing the energy of the photons.</p>
<p>When electrons return to ground state they release the energy in the form of a photon and that's where the colour of the dye comes from. </p>
<p>When sunlight breaks down the dye there is less of it and as a result the colours are less intense. </p>
<p>Or the sunlight could cause the molecule to change which makes the energy transitions different</p>
<p>Or as the electrons goes back down to ground state some of its energy goes into molecular translations</p>
<p>I'm a chemistry student and I've taken a module on photochemistry this year and it is quite complicated and I understand it enough to pass the exam but not ELI5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bonds between parts of dye molecules have a specific energy level that allows them to absorb parts of the visible light spectrum. So, a blue dye will absorb everything except the blue part, which is reflected back to you. </p>
<p>Breaking up these bonds will make the dye lose or alter its absorption qualities. It happens to different molecules at different times, which gives you the slow fading. How the color changes is very dependant on the dye and the bond that was broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The color of a thing is determined by the shape of the molecules that make it up. So if you change the shape of the colorful molecules, the color changes.</p>
<p>Simple molecules tend to be boring colors. Interesting colored dyes tend to be complicated molecules. Simple molecules are harder to break up. UV from the sun breaks apart the complicated molecules, making everything simple and thus boring colored. This is simplified, and of course there are many exceptions.</p></div>		</li>
