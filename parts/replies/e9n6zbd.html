			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that happens because as the molecules are aligned energy is released because there is energy being put into the system as mechanical work, but the energy of the aligned and unaligned molecules is the same. So the energy put in as mechanical energy to stretch the polymer comes back out as heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make a fridge out of elastic bands if you have enough of them because of this phenomenon. Elastomers are different from thermoplastics because elastomers are cross linked and most other thermoplastics are linear. When you pull on a lackey you are imparting enough force to make the polymer chains pull over each other but not putting enough energy into it to break the cross linked bonds. This mechanical energy is stored as heat and potential energy in the rubber band. When you release the lackey band the heat is released, the potential energy turns into kinetic energy and the crosslinks snap the linear chains back into their original position (or near enough that matters). </p>
<p>This means you can stretch an elastic band and it'll heat up, blow on it to cool it down while stretched, put it inside a sealed box, let it contract and it will absorb heat from the surrounding atmosphere. </p></div>		</li>
