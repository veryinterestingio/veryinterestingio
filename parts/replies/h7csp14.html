<p>a few weeks ago i read an article there that shows how an airplanes air filtration system works and how that affects your exposure.</p>
<p>my take was that only folks immediately near the the infected individual and not everyone on the plane.</p>
<p>so obviosuly the risk is non zero, but much lower than what you would expend from being enclosed in a metal tube for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>based on how we know masking works that would further lower the exposure and the risk for those nearby a infectious person</p>
<p>edit: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/travel/flying-plane-covid-19-safety.html" target="_blank">cited article</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, when I just flew though, my adjacent neighbors took off their masks when the flight attendants started handing out food and drink, and they never put them back on. As long as you have a drink on your tray that you’re sipping, you can get away with not wearing a mask. The whole thing was very anxiety inducing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People DO remove masks on planes. They say you are supposed to remove your mask to drink or take a bite to eat,  then put the mask back on immediately,  but on my flight, most people kept the mask off the whole time they ate. Some tried not to wear one at all,  flight attendants said nothing.  Instead,  there were constant reminders over the intercom.</p></div>		</li>
