			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the first paragraph of your post is the most direct answer to the actual question. At the lowest level there isn't any &quot;language&quot;, even the processor opcodes are just an abstraction for what the circuitry does as it chugs through the contents of registers and rewrites memory, looping over and over, synchronized by the system clock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in a mathematical sense, there absolutely is a language. Any finite set of strings of ones and zeros is ipso facto a language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a language in the sense that, at the lowest level, the circuits &quot;know&quot; the language. This is the whole point of the OP's question AFAICT. Below the level of synchronization and thresholds, there aren't even ones and zeros, the are just continuous values of voltage, and then there's an explanation for how the overall circuit is going to behave. This explanation has nothing to do with an instruction set, it doesn't express computation at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's weird that this comment is showing as controversial to me because technically it is a formal language. There are entire branches of computer science that are concerned with formal languages in the context of codifying what a computer can understand. Executable binaries are have syntax, grammar, etc. regardless of the fact that they're written in zeros and ones instead of letters. Physical logic gates interpret opcode (words) in a way that gives them meaning.</p>
<p>Your statement is factually correct and people who are insinuating that you're wrong by downvoting you are ignorant.</p>
<p>Source: A computer science degree at my university requires classes on discrete mathematics and CPU architecture that are heavily focused on defining what a formal language is and is not.</p></div>		</li>
