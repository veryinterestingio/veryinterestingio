			<div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere of a rocky planet like Earth or Venus is a tiny fraction of the planet composition.  The distance from the ground to space is way less than 1% of the distance from the center to the surface.</p>
<p>With gas giants the vast majority of the distance from space to the center is gas, and gas makes up the vast majority of the mass of the planet.  It doesn't make sense to call it an atmosphere when it's the main component of the planet itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Less, but not <em>way</em> less; though there's no clear delineation of the top of the atmosphere it's on the order of 0.5-0.8% of the radius.</p>
<p>My favorite analogy is that the atmosphere is the same proportional thickness as the skin of an apple. Pretty damn thin. Which is fascinating when you think about all those large scale weather phenomena that happen in this tiny layer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On Earth there's a clear boundary above which stuff is definitely gas and below which it's definitely solid (ground) or liquid (ocean)</p>
<p>Gas giants like Jupiter don't have that boundary. They start off definitely gas on the outside and are definitely solid in the middle, but on the way down the gas gets denser and denser until you pass through a layer that's definitely liquid, but when did it transition from gas to liquid? There isn't a clear boundary, it just gets denser and denser as you travel coreward</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not the only thing that defines a gas or ice giant. The atmosphere of Venus also goes through a gradual transition between gaseous and supercritical fluid phases. But Venus has a solid, well-defined border between its supercritical soup of an atmosphere and its rocky surface, and this is what makes Venus a terrestrial planet and not a &quot;gas dwarf&quot;. The boundary between supercritical fluid and solid core also has to be unclear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a matter of semantics.  You can call the super dense metallic hydrogen layer inside a gas giant “atmosphere” or “mantle” or whatever you like, but it is nothing like any part of the Earth and our words are only being used by analogy.</p>
<p>This layer has a density similar to aluminum, but flows like water.  It conducts electricity.  If you had eyes that could survive in it, you wouldn’t be able to see through it and it would glow white hot.</p></div>		</li>
