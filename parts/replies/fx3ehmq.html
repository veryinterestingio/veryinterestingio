<p>Kind of. We didn’t test anything empirically purely due to the aim of the book being to stimulate debate. We are hope to look into the area ourselves in the long turn but also hoping others jump on this as well. We aimed to stimulate enquiry. </p>
<p>From personal experience though, which is obviously very subjective,  I have noticed the same patterns that you reference here. The video game community is diverse and eclectic. Just like in wider society people with different views, morals and attitudes converge, so too this happens within video games.  </p>
<p>We have noticed some correlation. One of my students recently completed a dissertation study that showed compelling evidence around such toxic behaviours between the FIFA community online and what we occasionally see on the football terraces. This needs much more in depth study though but was a fascinating dissertation from a student at that level of study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very interesting. My subjective experience has been mostly toxic in online competitive games such as For Honor, Call of Duty, and Ark Survival Evolved. Other online games such as Guild Wars 2, and the Destiny franchise has been more positive experiences where the emphasis is on cooperation. I wonder if it just happens that highly competitive games emphasize negative personality traits.</p>
<p>I've even noticed when I myself (a fairly laid back and passive person) getting angry, argumentative, and hostile towards others when playing games like For Honor.</p></div>		</li>
