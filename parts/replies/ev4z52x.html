			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be the largest by volume but the largest known organism by size is a fungus in the Blue Mountains weighing over 600 metric tonnes and  spreading over 900 ha. (For comparison the one you mentioned covers an area of 40 ha).</p>
<p>Edit: it is called the &quot;homungous fungus&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't reproduce, though. Otherwise it wouldn't be the largest, but a cluster of related trees.</p>
<p>What it does is making new stems on a colonial root system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That distinction becomes somewhat blurry with clonal root plants. Portions of the root system may be severed through various processes, which would mean there are possibly several plants in that forest all named Pando.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other way, which is common for trees, is to start with a plant you don't want such as something that has terrible fruit or ugly flowers. You cut off the stem and leave just the roots. Then you take the branch you just cut -- and both branch and roots have to be freshly cut -- and somehow attach them together right at the cuts. The roots and the branch will essentially merge into one plant with the branch as a trunk when both parts attempt to heal the wound. This is beneficial if the plant you want to clone has roots that aren't suited for the type of soil or climate around you. You can have great roots from one species and a trunk, branches, and fruit from another. This is how nearly all apple trees are created.a</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since weed came up, I'll point out it's also a good example of where the plant as it appears for commercial purposes is only seed-free because it hasn't been pollinated. You separate your male and female plants (or just toss the males if you don't need them for breeding later) because if the males pollinate the females, the females (that produce the smokable flowers) will start generating seeds, which isn't a pleasant smoke (<em>crack! POP!</em>) and also leads to reduced THC content in the flowers.</p>
<p>This need to separate male and female plants because only the females produce smokable flower and males will ruin it, and the potential for your crop coming out smaller than planned due to new plants being male instead of female, are the main reasons cloning female plants is so popular in growing weed.</p></div>		</li>
