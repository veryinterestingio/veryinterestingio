<p>Mostly.  They don't want really good players steamrolling newbs and chasing them away.</p>
<p>Luckily, the professional players are also really good at human nature and will wink-wink-nod-nod with each other to let the newbs win enough that they keep playing, so this is rarely a problem for the casinos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Poker has taken a pretty substantial dip in popularity, maybe not on TV, but in actual card rooms. It used to be the wild wild west in a poker room, not it's just a convalescent hospital in my experience (dealer for roughly a decade). Most the old heads that would be rolling noobs enjoy teaching newer players the game, sometimes with tough love, but still love. Call it a lost art. There is also a big social aspect to poker, whether it be reading other players social cues/mannerisms or just being friendly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With poker, the house takes a 'rake' which is a % of each pot up to a max amount. That max amount varies by location but is around $5-10. So the house only cares that hands are being played.</p></div>		</li>
