			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always seen questions like these used to imply that if certain individuals <em>don't</em> have PTSD or trauma from certain events then the individual must be a &quot;psychopath&quot;. Not to claim that's what the OP is asking, but because I've had to talk to numerous service members from my time in the Army who had guilt and felt like they weren't normal that they weren't traumatized by traumatic things, because their civilian friends or family would basically <em>expect</em> them to have PTSD after witnessing or being a part of certain things while deployed. Not to get too preachy but this is something that does affect people so I thought I'd share:</p>
<p>Im a PA, and a young medic I worked with had some bad anxiety/OCD issues and was seriously losing sleep for months questioning whether or not he was a psychopath because he'd seen some dead children in the clinic, and it didn't bother him all that much. </p>
<p>What people are traumatized by is not really indicative of whether or not they have feelings or empathy. Normal and healthy people don't have to be a psychopath to not be traumatized by traumatic experiences, it's a matter of one's coping mechanisms and mental resilience that determine that stuff more than anything.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely correct. Me and another commenter discussed this elsewhere but traumatic events are not consistent between people. The criteria for PTSD makes specific allowance for this. Similar to your story, I hear incredibly distressing things on a daily basis (particularly around abuse). While deeply upsetting, it's not traumatizing for me. However, for others it may be. That doesn't make me a psychopath, it means I process them in a different way than some might.</p>
<p>Lack of distress doesn't make you a psychopath in any way. Consistently harming others, however, may mean you have ASPD.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is anyone aware of research that looks at why some people are traumatized more than others by similar events?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I listened to a RadioLab podcast that was discussing the results of a study checking for a correlation between empathy and heroic acts. What they found was there IS a correlation, but it's a negative one. That is, that those people with less empathy are more likely to perform heroic acts. The hypothesis the researchers had for why this is is that when a person sees someone in distress, if they're highly empathetic they feel that distress themselves, and are less likely to be able to act. Whereas people who don't feel that distress are more likely to act quickly and decisively, and be able to provide help to those who need it.</p>
<p>(This hinges on a definition of empathy that may not match most people's definition, but regardless of the semantics I think it's an interesting study)</p>
<p>I came across this study at a very important time in my life when I felt that my own lack of empathy meant I was a bad person. It helped me realize that empathy or lack thereof has no effect on how good a person ends up being.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I listened to a podcast once with a psychologist(don't remember his name) who was really adamant about a distinction between empathy and compassion. And he basically thought that empathy, while it has its uses, is kind of overrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was about to say the same. The fact that he was worried about being a psychopath suggests that he probably wasn't one. Perhaps the loss of sleep was simply related to the trauma of seeing the dead children and his mental process of worrying why it hadn't affected him was just secondary overthinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OCD anxiety is totally different. And can be crippling. He’s not losing sleep over the trauma, he’s losing sleep due to anxiety caused by his obsessing over his reaction to the supposedly traumatic experience. The fact he didn’t find it traumatic may be water off a ducks back to some people- he probably has an underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder and is ruminating and cannot stop the thought that his lack of response to the situation makes him a psychopath. The subject matter is almost irrelevant. The thought will not go away and cannot be logically resolved for long until it comes back and demands all the logic and resolution process again. And again. And again. And again. I would say this type of obsessive guilt certainly rules out any kind of anti-social personality disorder by definition- ironic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As both a psychology graduate and editor for a scientific journal in psychology, I found your response well-structured, well-balanced, and most importantly nuanced well! Thank you for acknowledging the difficulty in establishing an accurate timeline for really any person exhibiting symptoms of a mental/brain disorder. As well as, the often apparent disconnect between current classifications (a controversial debate in and of itself) and popular terms that form part of the ‘common knowledge’.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What u/SharkAttackOmNom posted pretty much covers it. Except you don’t necessarily need two equivalent degrees or have to a long established track record within the field - like they said “Any of those bits could be missing” and you would still realistically have decent chances on becoming hired. This goes without saying (but I guess I will anyway haha), success in an interview depends on both ‘on-paper excellence’ and the degree to which you’re able to demonstrate your enthusiasm and dedication/motivation to your potential employer with regards to the role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends, but often times for a field like psychology, tenure-track professors at many major research universities can be tapped or asked to serve as editors for journals. Often, these are journals they have some association with, having published in or been reviewers for prior.</p>
<p>Source: BA/MA in social psychology, worked primarily with principal investigators in labs during that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in the profession but I would imagine:
A dual major in language arts, and a science, Record of research from undergrad to graduate level, Contributions to published research and lastly a long roll of peer review on others research.</p>
<p>With that resume, apply to open positions for any science journals. </p>
<p>Any of those bits could be missing and you could still get into the profession.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a roommate who had no visible signs of empathy, guilt, love, friendship, interest in other people, and so on. I don't want to diagnose her as anything, I can just say she was absolutely void of any social emotions. The few she showed seemed insanely fake. She also stole our things, started gaslighting us when we confronted her, and so on.</p>
<p>Anyways, she loved taking party drugs. MDMA, Acid, mushrooms, speed, whatever. She loved MDMA the most, she kept talking about how much people love each other when on it, how nice it is, that she wants to hug and kiss everyone when on it. Well, that was the only time i saw anything resembling real feelings in her. However she still showed them in a very egotistical way, she never really started enjoying other's stories, or showed any interest in their personalities. She just.. started hugging them more.</p>
<p>Sometimes she would take mdma for days straight, and then afterwards spend a week in her room, showing barely any signs of life.</p>
<p>Maybe the MDMA made her that way, or maybe it gives her something she was previously lacking - I'll never know. Hopefully this was of some interest to you :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't it be ethical? The empathy stimulus doesn't need to be a vulnerable person. No issues with administering class or schedules drugs with regulatory approval and licensed suppliers. I think this would make a great study, helping improve self-management of community dwelling people with ASPD but more specifically management of ASPD within the forensic setting. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I know nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had a &quot;heart to heart&quot; with a drug dealer about the things we enjoy in life and our goals. He told me that he's well aware of being a psychopath and enjoying it. He told me one of his most pleasant experiences was torturing someone who owed him money while on MDMA. He didn't get any kicks from sex, music or company like people usually do with ecstasy. He found that MDMA enhanced the things he already enjoyed, hurting and manipulating people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jon Ronson’s, The Psychopath Test, has a section covering the use of LSD in a clinical trial in the 60s or 70s. But I believe that they have done more recent studies on the effects of LSD on mental health with positive outcomes. I believe MDMA has negative long term side effects and may not be suitable for that kind of treatment.</p></div>		</li>
