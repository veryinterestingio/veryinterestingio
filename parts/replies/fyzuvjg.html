			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this. I've played piano and several woodwinds for decades (yikes!), and both feel natural to me, likely because of the action of playing instruments. I would never have thought that one was more prevalent than the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely, I thought this was a weird ELI5 because I didn't really place any significance to which way I tap my fingers. But after reading what you wrote I realize  I tap my finger from index to pinky because I prefer to start a scales from the top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to play piano when I was younger. I certainly felt a difference at first tapping the &quot;wrong&quot; way, but I wonder if it felt less unnatural for me than someone who never played piano.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty natural for me from index to ring finger on my right hand, but my pinky acts a little awkward. </p>
<p>Then I read this and realized it's probably because I played saxophone for 6 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda but not exactly. Muscle ergonomics is more the issue at play. You have the ability to move your hand like that because you developed the ability to. That doesn’t make it a natural/instinctual use the system. When a “normal” person does it, the ease of direction comes from how the hand naturally opens and closes, not because of muscle memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain why I find it so awkward going pinky to index? Pinky and ring kinda thump down together and then the other two drop in place. Going the other way feels natural though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your pinky and ring finger share connected tendons, but the pinky is the dominant player - your ring finger is the freeloader. When you put the pinky finger down it's pulling on your ring finger and so you get that &quot;thump&quot; from both of them.</p>
<p>When you go the other way you're putting the ring finger down first and your pinky isn't pulling on it - your ring finger is pulling on your pinky slightly instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I find tapping index to pinky about a million times easier/smoother. I have to actively think about what I’m doing to do it the other way and it’s still not even close. If there is an answer to this question it’s going to have to account for these individual differences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what you're saying. In this context, the pinky to index tapping sequence felt more natural because of a variety of factors as you mentioned. </p>
<p>It's interesting then that you can overcome an unnatural feel, through practice and muscle memory. </p>
<p>As others who play instrumental they mentioned they didn't notice a difference in tapping either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like it would have something to do with the function of grabbing in the first place.  But I'm grabbing things and I don't seem to be grabbing first with my pinkie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, you are consciously grabbing something. Just like when someone switches to automatic breathing versus conscious breathing, your approach changes as your awareness does.
Secondly, your thumb and forefinger brace the object being grabbed and your pinky starts the roll of your fingers tuck into the palm. Your forefinger does not need to roll in that case as it acts as a brace for the grip with the thumb.
With an empty hand close your fist starting with your first finger. Feels kinda awkward. Try it starting with your pinky. Feels better but needs adjustment. Try starting with an okay sign and close the rest of your fingers. You’ll notice if you lead with the middle finger it is awkward af. Starting with with the pinky is way more natural.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Veey much this. I'd imagine anatomy has a lot to do with the way we instinctively tap our fingers, but as a piano and guitar player I can also tap in both directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, piano and guitar are definitely two instrument where finger dexterity is key. I'd imagine you worked out any unnaturalness in your finger movements long ago!</p></div>		</li>
