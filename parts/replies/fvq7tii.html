If you have one major left wing candidate, one major right wing candidate, and one third party but right-leaning candidate who is getting some attention, the votes that third guy gets will be disproportionately drawn from people who otherwise would have voted for the major right wing guy, and can hand the election to the left wing guy. </p>
<p>Imagine if 9 kids had to vote on what ice cream to have. 3 want vanilla, 2 want chocolate, 2 want Neapolitan, 1 wants strawberry and 1 wants chocolate fudge ripple. The vanilla team wins despite 5/9 wanting some form of chocolate. Even though Neapolitan would technically have what everyone could enjoy or at least live with (before someone hits me with r/enlightenedcentrism, I get that Neapolitan isn't always the best option).</p></div>		</li>
