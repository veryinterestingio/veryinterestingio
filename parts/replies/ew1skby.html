			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question. Since the US $ is considered the worldwide standard exchange, and now the exchange rate for US/Yuan is about $1/$7 does this mean that in modern times the Chinese stopped flooding the market with more money and has now stabilized it to not have the exchange rate change even more? As in at one point they kept printing money but eventually they stopped overproducing and that’s why it’s only $1/$7 and not like Japan’s $1/¥100</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not precisely.</p>
<p>A factory in china needs to pay its workers 10 charizards for each iphone they manufacture.</p>
<p>It used to be that you could buy 10 charizards for 10 USD.</p>
<p>China devalued their currency.</p>
<p>Now you can buy 20 charizards for 10 USD.</p>
<p>Since Chinese factories need to pay their workers in charizards, they can offer cheaper US Dollar prices to americans and still pay their workers the same rate as before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...the Chinese government devalued the Yuan to offer better prices to Americans and allow Chinese factories to pay their workers less? Somehow I don't think this was their motivation.</p></div>		</li>
