			<div class="markdown"><p>That isnt what is happening here. Gorillas, like most mammals, excluding humans, can turn break down plant matter and turn them into proteins. Yes, some plants have proteins, but not the amount needed to produce and maintain that kind of muscle. </p>
<p>There are some interesting research studies going on right now about what the effects of adding the ability to produce these enzymes to a person's DNA and how it would affect thier day to day life. Goats have a lot of them, that's why they eat most things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure about that.  They eat 'up to 18 to 20 kilograms' a day.  If you were eating 40 or 45 pounds of vegetables you'd get plenty of protein.  This is not to mention the fact that part of their diet is insects and bugs.</p>
<p>18 kg of <em>lettuce</em> has 245g of protein.  Spinach would be 535g of protein.  If any amount of that 18 kg is actually nuts, insects, etc. then they're well over 1000g of protein a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not only a question of intake but also of uptake. Vegetable proteins and fats are more difficult for us to take up, than animal protein. Thus you need to eat more than the meat equivalent of protein to eventually absorb the same amount of protein. And then, it's also a question of how well the human body can metabolise them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it's not some bunch of kooks banging on about veganism.</p>
<p>Interviews with bunch of doctors, scientists, Arnold Schawarzenegger, Lewis Hamilton, the guy who tapped out McGregor, some really ripped bodybuilder who munches carbs before competitions, the oldest Olympic cyclist to win gold, American football players and some really beefy strongman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually meat doesn't have that much more protein compared to high protein vegetables and plants in general have a lot of protein that we can use. You can ask Patrik Baboumian that set a world record transporting 555kg 10m.</p>

<p>Even with high-protein vegetables like legumes it’s surprisingly hard to get 1.5g protein per kg body mass per day. With tuna, chicken breast, curd cheese, chicken eggs etc. it’s relatively easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using what metric?  Because lean meats win if you compare protein to calorie ratio, protein to weight ratio, protein to volume, rate of protein absorption....</p></div>		</li>
