			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never even consider trying to inject something in my veins.. but I'm an extremely curious person... Could you explain the high?</p>
<p>How does it feel to be high on heroin?</p>
<p>I've been drunk, I've been high on marijuana, but that's it.</p>
<p>I'd be curious to know how it feels... Without having to do hard drugs...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done them all, so I can give you a pretty decent run down</p>
<p>Heroin: Uhmm...so.. Imagine the greatest happiest you've ever felt in your life, mix that with the most &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; you've ever felt. Then multiply by 100. There's no problems in the world, literally, somebody could tell you that you need to go scrub the public bathroom at your local seedy gas station with your tooth brush, and you'll be down on your hands and knees singing songs and shit, just happy as a motherfucker!</p>
<p>Crack: You take one hit and instantly, it's like somebody floored the gas pedal in your body. Your heart races, you're hyper aware, but for about 2 minutes. Then you feel like crap and you want another hit.</p>
<p>Meth: It's a much cleaner feeling high but much worse for you, you're focused, and wide awake. The first time I ever did it, I took a few hits waiting for the &quot;gas pedal&quot; feeling and it never came. But then I organized a large box of cables and had them sorted by length, type, and wrapped up cleanly and secured. If you've ever done Adderall, this is very similar.</p>
<p>Obviously these are the feelings I got when I did them, your mileage may vary, and there's a whole hell of a lot of negative effects that come with all of this. You can't &quot;use heroin responsibly. I'm involved with Narcotics Anonymous now and have been really trying to get my life back together after I wreaked havoc on myself but also those around me.</p>
<p>Doing those drugs was fun, at first... But before you know it, it becomes a full time fucking job with no choice but to work 24/7.</p>
<p>I remember one Christmas day, I'd lost temporary custody of my daughter to a family friend because the state stepped in. Well, my mom agreed to get my daughter for the eve and day so that we could spend the night together. The day of Christmas, I woke up and left my mom's house for 3 hours walking in the cold and snow to get a $40 bag of heroin that made me feel &quot;normal&quot; and not dopesick. I spent most of that entire day that was supposed to be with my daughter, getting drugs so I wouldn't feel dopesick. If I honestly give anyone advice, it would be to not fall into the throws of addiction. That life is pure hell, and I wouldn't ever wish it on my worst enemy.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;It's like you just won the lottery x 1000. But your body is never supposed to be able to feel that level of happiness, and once you've had it you never stop thinking about it. I've been clean for 10 years, and every night, every single damn night, I dream I'm shooting up again to feel that high. It's agonising to know you can feel that amazing, but you're never allowed to. It's shit man&quot;</p>
<p>Heard that on some former addicts YouTube video. That shit hit deep. It sounds horrible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who had habit forming issues (depression, and anxiety), yes, it is the best feeling in the entire world.</p>
<p>But you do get past it.  In truth, I might not have been able to get past it without LSD and some good old introspection.  But I've been able to go through hell after opiates without as much as reaching for a Tylenol 3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other comment is a better source obviously, but a while back I saw a comment which explained it as imagining you just took off the heaviest backpack you didn't even know you had on, and when you come down it's like putting that backpack back on and never being able to shake the feeling of that backpack again.</p></div>		</li>
