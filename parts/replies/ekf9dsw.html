			<div class="markdown"><p>All of you have explained this so well! It makes so much sense. I’m sitting here trying to nibble on my cheek/tongue. I can feel my cheek on my tongue but I can’t feel my cheek other than that. I don’t know if that makes sense</p>
<p>Edit: guys, calm down. I wasn’t actually BITING my cheek. I was just trying to see what they meant. I’m not a fucking savage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It really makes you think how crazy this whole life thing is - even your brain needs to constantly reaffirm itself when considering where it's own body is!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Every control loop needs an input for feedback. Without knowing where our body parts are, how would the brain know how much muscle power to apply?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I think people explore their mouths so much instinctual if they have a change in teeth and why pregnant women sometimes rub their bellies. Also, when I was working out, I had this almost primal urge to feel the muscle growth. This is just a hypothesis of course</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe because skinny would be a more accurate pinpoint of location, while fat is a less accurate location.   &quot;My lip is..... somewhere in this 1 foot by 1 foot space!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a guess but overestimating is safer than underestimating. If you underestimate the size, there is a higher chance of accidentally doing damage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as when you can't see you rely on other cues however inaccurate they are.</p>
<p>The brain can't reach neurons... So it can't feel and it can't move the lip easily. That is the most amount of info it has. And the reference point it remembers is a swollen lip... Where sensory points are engulfed in protective inflammation and the lip is heavier and harder to move. Symptoms match.</p>
<p>Needn't be swollen though. Growing up, I apparently perceived it as a missing lip instead of a swollen one.</p></div>		</li>
