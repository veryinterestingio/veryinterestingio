			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify further:</p>
<p>You get dopamine from the pleasure piece, seeing something interesting, funny, etc. but you also get dopamine from the anticipation of reinforcement. You also tend to seek reinforcement when dopamine falls. This leads to a cyclical effect where you get a dopamine release from the occasional good post, that subsides a bit, you scroll down and gain more from the anticipation of more, subsides a bit, repeat. The more predictable reinforcement and the lower response cost/ease of use mean habitual checking is far more likely</p>
<p>It goes beyond this because social media, especially Facebook/insta, do things to deepen the effect:</p>
<p>Variable reinforcement scheduling - they curate your feed to make reinforcement slightly less predictable to make it more powerful over time</p>
<p>Loss of time - they no longer give feeds chronologically; you used to log on to Facebook and it was literally a timeline of posts in chronological order. The issue here is that it gives you a frame of reference to disengage in the platform (feeling “caught up”) so they no longer do this and now are more akin to sorting by hot in reddit.</p>
<p>Reinforcement power: Instagram specifically withholds reinforcement to deliver more powerful reinforcement later (see <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brain-hacking-tech-insiders-60-minutes/" target="_blank">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brain-hacking-tech-insiders-60-minutes/</a> ). Basically if you post something notification of “likes” or whatever is withheld until some are built up. Instead of getting a notification that one person liked it immediately you get one 6 hours later that says 15 people liked it. Additionally Facebook tends to stack notifications as you engage more - initially you may only be notified about messages and potential friends but as you engage more they start notifying you about random posts by your network. The number popping up drives that anticipation dopamine</p>
<p>Remember this the next time you’re scrolling through your twitter timeline, Facebook feed, /r/all, etc. these platforms may have started as different beasts but they have evolved into systems that are designed to exploit you. This is behavioral psychology and neuroscience used for profiteering. These people don’t want to create a product that enriches your life, they want to be the technical cartels producing digital heroin</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adderall is the only way I can stop getting &quot;withdrawals&quot; from spending a few hours on social media (I will literally get shakes and feel very deeply uncomfortable). Figured that out from watching a YouTube video about what you said, since Adderall acts on dopamine receptors. The problem is when I don't stop and I hyperfocus on it.. Lol
Edit: this isn't the reason I take Adderall, and I'm on a low dose as needed and mostly just use for work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.. I wish there were support groups like there are for alcoholism. Any time I try to bring up my addiction seriously, even to my therapist, I always get the &quot;aren't we all?&quot; and a laugh. People don't understand I literally spend 6 to 12 hours a day on my phone and I can't stop.</p></div>		</li>
