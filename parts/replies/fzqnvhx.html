			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>A:</strong> There are classical problems that comes with using miles of fibers running beneath highways and densely populated areas which are very “noisy” environments. One engineering challenge is therefore to ensure that the communication across fibers remains lossless. Because quantum networks use single photons to carry the information, it is very easy for those photons to be lost.   There are also synchronization challenges, but this is more similar to classical networks. </p>
<p>There are also hard quantum challenges especially to create quantum repeaters and nodes. They are essentially very small quantum computers or memories that can interface with the photons. This interface is challenging to make, and generally very slow. (Gary)</p></div>		</li>
