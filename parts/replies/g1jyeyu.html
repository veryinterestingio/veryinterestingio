			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that, however do you think you could clarify how that translates into the effect of &quot;seeing stars&quot;? What exactly is happening that creates this effect in our vision?</p>
<p>Sorry, im not op but i keep wondering</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a layer of cells on the back inside wall of our eyeballs called a retina. The retina only detects light (rods and cones detect color) and sends those signals to the brain via electrical impulses. We also have goo inside of our eyes called vitreous fluid. Changes in the vitreous fluid can change the amount of light our retinas detect and how the brain interprets the signals being sent to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Seeing stars&quot; mostly happens at the brain level. If we stand up too fast, it can change our blood pressure, which also causes a sudden change in the pressure of the fluid inside our eyeballs. If we get hit in the head, it can affect the fluid surrounding our brain or even cause physical damage to the brain itself. These scenarios cause the brain to be unable to interpret the light (or sudden change in amount of light) being detected by our retinas, thus causing the electrical impulses to be perceived as flashes of light, sparks, or &quot;stars.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This what I was after. Thanks. I'm aware that the actions described above contribute to a drop in blood pressure however I was looking for an explanation as to how this directly affects vision....</p>
<p>Also someone mentioned below light reflecting off white blood cells in the eye... I'm not sure how true this is however the bright dots do zip around like how cells look when observed under a microscope....</p>
<p>Is there any truth in this do you think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the blood pressure drops, lower amount of blood flows to the brain. The brain cannot function as well since it does not have enough oxygen (since hemoglobin in blood transport oxygen). This may result in affecting the parts of the brain controlling vision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Iron is the &quot;heme&quot; portion of hemoglobin. So you are carrying oxygen better than you were without your medication, so you don't get momentarily hypoxic quite so easily</p></div>		</li>
