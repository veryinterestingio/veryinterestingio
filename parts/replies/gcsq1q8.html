<p>During pregnancy, some of those antibodies go through the placenta to the baby, so when it is born it has some protection against the pathogen. This is known as passive immunity.</p>

<p>In fact, it's even more interesting: the process is active and, at least for some vaccines and antibodies, you see higher concentrations in the infants.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's another article that highlights the newborn to maternal ratios (NMR) and the concentrating effect I alluded to above: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38874" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38874" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38874</a></a></p>
<p>Measles is one example where there appears to be concentration of antibodies in the newborn (higher concentration in the newborn compared to the mother, NMR &gt; 1). We also see this with Hepatitis B antibodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this:</p>
<p>The antibodies are passed via the placenta in the third trimester, so premature babies are much more at risk from disease upon birth.</p>
<p>Antibodies are also passed through breast milk, and the thicker, yellowish milk that the mother creates during the first few weeks after birth is particularly high in antibodies. So breast-fed babies have passive immunity for longer, and are able to receive new antibodies that the mother creates after birth. The really cool thing is that through breast feeding, the mother can detect viruses present in the baby’s saliva (such as coronaviruses), and supplement the baby’s own immune response by creating antibodies which are then passed to the baby through milk, even though the mother never had the disease herself.</p>
<p>Anti-vaxxers may be saving up another nasty issue: Most of them were actually vaccinated against some pretty terrible diseases, which means that their children had some (short-lasting) protection at birth; But if herd immunity is enough that their kids don’t catch them, then eventually their grandchildren will be born with no passive immunity, and vaccinations may not be able to be given immediately, so coupled with the declining herd immunity the same anti-vaxxers will have caused by then, the fatality rate amongst newborn babies could see a steep uptick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wholeheartedly agree with this. I feel like the real tragedy of antivaxxers is their position of rejecting vaccines, whilst currently being protected. The ones who will suffer are their poor kids.</p>
<p>To add to the breastmilk fun facts, it's IgA which is secreted in huge amounts. Immunoglobulins are too large to pass from the gut to the bloodstream in human babies (interestingly, this is not the case with all mammals, as IgG can pass from the mother cow to the calf's bloodstream via milk). Nonetheless, it still provides enormous protection, particularly for pathogens which target the GI tract. So much so, that in certain areas of India, with historically high levels of rotavirus, there is so much IgA in maternal breastmilk that breastfed babies don't form an immune response against the rotavirus vaccine. The breastmilk is so powerful against it! Biology is soooooo cool.</p></div>		</li>
