			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like it should be pointed out that we still aren’t sure of a lot of Ebola’s secrets... including where the reservoirs of virus are and who the normal host is (basically where it goes between human outbreaks and what animal is the typical host that it can survive in populations of for extended periods without just burning out by killing them all).  Bats are a candidate but so are a bunch of monkey and ape species...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are also not sure (yet) what conditions change when an outbreak starts. Unless there is some special tribal ceremony that requires a specific bush meat, it is correct to assume the people who become infected are going about their normal lives when the jump is triggered. That no common factor (other than, possibly, bush meat being eaten in general) is found only confounds things, at least for now.</p></div>		</li>
