			<div class="markdown"><p>That's only because Passenger Pigeons or wild pigeons are extinct. The main reasons for the extinction of the passenger pigeon were the massive scale of hunting, the rapid loss of habitat, and the extremely social lifestyle of the bird, which made it highly vulnerable to the former factors. The last confirmed wild bird is thought to have been shot in 1901, when a male bird was killed, stuffed, and placed in Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois, where it remains today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Passenger Pigeons are a different Genus than rock doves. Pigeons are not just domesticated/feral rock doves. There are different genus &amp; species. The largest range of any species is that of the rock dove. </p>
<p>In North America we would've seen the Passenger Pigeon in abundance had it not been driven to extinction. Is that provided in answer to OP's question, no. That is to add to what KnightsofForestsWild said.  This being a sub-reddit devoted to learning it seemed it might be welcomed information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Passenger pigeons and the city pigeons we know today are separate species even, I believe, genuses. The passenger pigeon was native to North America and was migratory and often roosted in forest canopies by the millions.   Wild pigeons of other species are still around all over the world.</p></div>		</li>
