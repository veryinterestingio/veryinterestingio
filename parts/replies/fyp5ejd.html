			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun thing is that when you have your ears covered up with earplugs and you yawn, you can hear the outside noise better because you are actually listening through your mouth and Eustachian tube! That rarely happens but when it does you have this weird wtf feeling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is almost entirely wrong. The eustachian tube doesn't underpin the phenomenon OP is talking about (it's actually contraction of the tensor tympani muscle, as others further down the thread have explained). But even if the eustachian tube <em>was</em> opening up, that would lead to pressure equalisation and and therefore <em>better</em> sound transmission, if anything. You've got it completely backwards.</p>
<p>It's like popping your ears on an aeroplane. If there's a pressure differential between the two sides of your eardrum, as is caused when the pressure drops as an aeroplane ascends, your hearing sounds muffled. The pressure needs to be the same on both sides of the eardrum. Opening the eustachian tubes, by &quot;popping your ears&quot;, equalises the pressure and improves hearing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only the basics, I'm afraid. I work in a research lab that focuses on inner ear stuff, but I don't have a medical background. I work with audiologists, but I'm not an audiologist myself.</p>
<p>Feel free to post some questions though. If I can't answer them, I bet someone else will be able to eventually.</p></div>		</li>
