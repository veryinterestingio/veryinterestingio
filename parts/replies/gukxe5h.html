			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - I'm pretty sure this is also how dogs know when to wait by the window. </p>
<p>It isn't that they are reading the clocks in your house, they are just very attuned to their environment and use regular occurrences (your neighbour always gets home before you do therefore the sound of their engine coming down the driveway means we're close to home time for you as well) to work out where they are in the day. Imagine how much information they get from which smells occur when.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a study on this with dogs. They can tell by the strength of your residual scent when to expect you home. </p>
<p>They had someone carry an item of clothing through the house midway through the day, which had the scent of the dogs owner on it. Completely threw the dog off and had no idea to be expecting their owner home when they arrived.</p></div>		</li>
