			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I had a more recent suggestion, but when I was a kid, I thought very highly of Leon Lederman's <em>The God Particle</em> (1993). Despite the silly title, Lederman does a great job explaining serious particle physics for a general audience. Of course, it was written before the discovery of the actual Higgs, but since the Standard Model seems to have been vindicated, there shouldn't be too much amiss.</p></div>		</li>
