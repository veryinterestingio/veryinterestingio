			<div class="markdown"><p>When you cut something you are breaking the intermolecular forces between the molecules of that substance. You are probably not breaking up individual molecules (depending on the substance, there are some grey areas). And the process consumes energy rather than releasing it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would think that with very high molecular weight polymers, there would be some molecules broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's unlikely for small molecules, but for large polymer chains you can cut the bonds between molecules. The energy is released (if breaking these bonds was exothermic), but since it's only a few molecules at best, it's nothing compared to the energy you use to cut the material in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
