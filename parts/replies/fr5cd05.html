			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: most known forms of life also have self-driven, near-24h periodic rhythms in gene expression and metabolism. For example, a self-sustained rhythm was found just last week in malaria: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/368/6492/746" target="_blank">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/368/6492/746</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I always thought the Circadian rhythm stuff was a bunch of pseudoscience, like a more sciency sounding version of astrology.</p>
<p>How reputable / accurate is an average search on circadian cycles? </p>
<p>Is it like weightloss / healthy foods where it's almost impossible for the layperson to access accurate but thorough info unless they just read studies and get a M.Sc in Biology to try to dissect it all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Circadian rhythms is a very legitimate field of research, the NIGMS even has a nice summary page of explanations:  <a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx</a></a></p>
<p>We even have some evidence on a molecular level of mechanisms that might explain how circadian rhythms are generated and maintained.</p>
<p>The issue is just that it is incredibly complex to study for a number of reasons. Hormones are the primary means by which we believe to regulate circadian rhythms and hormones themselves are difficult to study.</p>
<p>Some hormones can exert significant physiological effects at extraordinarily low concentrations (some have to be measured on a nanograms per milliliter scale). As well, measuring accurately is not the easiest thing to do because typically we measure its presence in plasma, but this does not necessarily reflect its local concentration in other tissues where it will be exerting its effects. We also have no way of measuring them in real time.</p>
<p>I would also like to add that most hormones mechanism of action is by affecting gene transcription. Typically, hormones will bind to a cellular receptor or enter cells directly and influence a very large set of different genes that will lead to a multitude of changes on a cellular, and then tissue, and possibly systemic level.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: And to answer your questions directly, the average search as long as it brings up a properly peer-reviewed paper, should be fairly reputable. It's important to remember that a study can be accurate in what it concludes but only relevant under a specific set of circumstances. Most studies regarding the circadian clock are of course limited by our ability to measure things accurately, in real-time and in appropriate models.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In case you are still concerned, the discovery of the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms won a Nobel Prize in 2017. Even things like stroke incidence have a 24 hour rhythm (strokes peak in the morning, if I recall correctly).</p></div>		</li>
