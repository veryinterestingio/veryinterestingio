<p>Your limbs just don’t need to stay warm for you to live. Your toes being cold is just inconvenient, while your pancreas being cold couldn’t function. Thus it would be a waste of energy for your body to try and keep all your limbs at 37 degrees (celcius).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised this is so low/ Especially given how many people have commented on how their fingers or toes get cold first. The areas that feel cold first are the areas your body is restricting flow too because it wants your core temperature warm. It's the reason for the idiom &quot;if your feet are cold, put on a hat.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
