			<div class="markdown"><p>Most definitely! And likely some due to scattering in the air.  A great example of this is if you have a mirrored medicine cabinet next to your bathroom mirror, if you put the two mirrors facing each other, you can see each reflection getting darker and darker!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a bathroom cabinet with three mirrored doors so you can angle them to show enough reflections that they eventually fade to darkness.</p>
<p>I suspect the main culprit of the declining brightness is the glass itself due to the mirror being rear surface. In order to reflect back to the viewer the photons pass through the glass twice - once on the way in and once on the way out. The loss isn't obvious until you have a &quot;hall of mirrors&quot; effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But when the image is black, that means there is no photon left, or are our eyes not sensitive enough for that low level or brightness. Another question that comes to mind: Will it ever reach a point where the photon loses enough energy to disappear, and if so, does it does that, disappear , or does it turns into something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s important to differentiate between the energy and the intensity of the light. What you’re describing is the intensity- how bright it is or how many photons exist per unit area. Each bounce will reduce some of the intensity, meaning some of the photons will be lost. But the energy of each photon will not change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How do <a href="https://www.planetary.org/explore/projects/lightsail-solar-sailing/what-is-solar-sailing.html" target="_blank">solar sails</a> work if at least a minuscule amount of momentum is not being given up by individual photons? </p>
<p>And how would this experiment from Cody's Lab demonstrating photon pressure happen without at least some momentum of the photons being given up? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effect you're talking about is a lower intensity per unit area but also yes, energy is lost in reflection. When a photon reflects, it has a change in momentum and the mirror has a corresponding increase in momentum. Since the mirror presumably was at rest, this means it gains energy and therefore the photon must lose energy</p></div>		</li>
