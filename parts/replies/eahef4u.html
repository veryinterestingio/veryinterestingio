			<div class="markdown"><p>So say on Io and Mars we could reasonably expect Lava formed caves then. And it wouldn't be a stretch to think there would be Ice caves on Europa, like deep down where we think hot water might be. </p>
<p>Thank you for the expansive answer! Its more than I expected and very helpful. Take an updoot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, possibly, but at depth it might get weird. The pressure at depth will favor the stability of a different ice polymorph than the one we are familiar with. I'm not quite sure how that one would work out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbonate rocks <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2010/2540.html" target="_blank">have been found on Mars</a> and are expected to be widespread and common.  In fact, one of the big puzzles with Mars has been his difficult it has been to find the expected carbonate rocks.</p>
<p>It’s certainly true that on earth the vast majority of carbonate rocks, especially limestones and marbles, are biochemically precipitated, a portion of them are abiotically precipitated.  On Earth this is a minor portion, but on a lifeless planet with liquid water and CO2 in the atmosphere it’s expected that this would eventually result in thick carbonate rock beds there too.</p>
<p>Another place we <em>may</em> have found carbonates is in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08016.pdf" target="_blank">a rocky planet orbiting white dwarf SDSS J104341.53+085558.2</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding cave formation specifically, in carbonate rocks, there are two primary methods, the main one one being erosion from water, primarily from naturally occurring carbonic acid.  The second main way is from erosion caused by sulfuric acid expelled by snottities and other biofilms in caves.  There has been a good bit of study on these in recent years and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201674.pdf?origin=ppub" target="_blank">they’re turning out to be biologically pretty diverse</a>.</p>
<p>There is a bit of a chicken-and-egg issue with the snottites as they appear to need the cave environment, so it may be that they colonize extant caves, and their presence accelerated the cave formation process.</p></div>		</li>
