			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t that only true for the ocean? Like the beach and 100 yards out is a satellite image right? You can clearly see boats and people swimming. But once you get further out it’s obviously something entirely different</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google Maps actually can combines multiple satellite images into a composite image that we see. They choose the pixels that have the most appealing-to-the-eye colors so the composite image is not necessarily moment-in-time color accurate.</p>
<p>To simplify it, Google Maps tries to have the greenest imagery possible while still looking realistic.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just look at any of the deep ocean water in satellite mode maps, theres no water its just a topographical map. Closer to land they have like a mile or so of satellite imaging of the water, then transition to topo since theres no point in wasting resources on imaging the ocean surface.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Umm. Every Maps layer is by definition an image.</p>
<p>And the satellite layer is photographic imagery. Those photographs come from a variety of sources and lighting conditions, and are processed in a number of ways. So you're right that you shouldn't always expect accuracy or consistency from them. But they're certainly images, and they're also photographs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can argue about what I meant by &quot;image&quot;, but the pixels you see offshore are most definitely not photographs.  They are seafloor bathymetry measured using sonar, and their colors have nothing to do with the actual color of the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Texas gets that stupid eddy current that comes off of the gulf stream. It goes clockwise and stirs up everything. Our sand is very muddy in general. Go a couple miles offshore and the water is crystal clear and deep blue.</p></div>		</li>
