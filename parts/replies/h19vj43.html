<p>It sucks that your Mum is losing her voice, at least you have access to the tech to mean she has an easier time with it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This example is particularly interesting to me since it's not only imitating speech, but imitating the voice of a specific person whom you know very well.  I'm curious, how accurate is the digital voice replication?  Are there obvious &quot;uncanny valley&quot; moments, or is it actually good enough that you can't tell the difference most of the time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I’ve seen this is usually done as a transformation to an existing voice model. So you take a generic female/male voice and manipulate the synthesis to match pitch and timbre of the desired voice. There was a group in Japan doing this a long time ago using hidden Markov models. It’s very cool stuff and can come pretty close to the target speaker’s sound, although I think there will still be some things that are a bit “off” about it. Nice username by the way.</p></div>		</li>
