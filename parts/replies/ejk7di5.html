			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any other reason besides &quot;it works so why change it&quot; that we just limit ourselves to red, green and blue? Like you said LED's don't display yellow very well and just fake it by having red and green light up together. But surely we can make dedicated yellow LED's. In fact modern traffic lights seem to be made of clusters of LED's arranged in a circle and the yellow/amber lights I've seen seem to be made of proper yellow LED's. Could have sworn I've seen them in some consumer products too (occasionally Christmas lights will have them, and so they should because I hate how so many Christmas lights made from LED's these days just have red, green and blue lights which feels so incomplete compared to how much more colours there were on traditional lights, which often included yellow and orange and sometimes pink, in addition to red green and blue)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also I'm surprised I've never seen anyone design LED blacklights. In fact I haven't seen blacklights for many years. Bowling alleys and other party-centric places seemed to have switched them out for ordinary blue lights but I swear &quot;true&quot; blacklights which were noticeably more purple than blue, did a way better job causing certain pigments and materials to fluoresce and I'm just wondering why I never see them anymore in both traditional &quot;tube&quot; format or modern LED format. Blue lights ain't blacklights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can make LEDs of virtually any single frequency -- pure red, pure yellow, pure orange, pure green, etc. Some may be harder than others due to the band gaps involved, but for the most part it can be done.</p>
<p>The human visual system, however, is based off of three pigments which react differently to light of different wavelengths. Each pigment is sensitive to a broad range of light, but the sensitivities vary based on the wavelength on the incoming light, and each pigment has a peak sensitivity in a different range. Conventionally, these three peaks are called &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, and &quot;blue&quot;. </p>
<p>When we look at something like a sodium-vapor lamp, which emits 90% of its light at 590 nm wavelength, the light is sensed well by both the &quot;red&quot; and &quot;green&quot; pigments, but not the &quot;blue&quot; pigment. The rest of our visual system interprets this as &quot;yellow&quot;. If we were to instead show a light that was a mix of red and green light so that it triggered the &quot;red&quot; and &quot;green&quot; pigments in our eye the same as the sodium-vapor lamp, that mix would also be interpreted as yellow.</p>
<p>The color of everything we look at is determined by how well it affects those three pigments in our eyes -- which we can individually trigger by using lights of three different colors. Every color reproduction system we use, from color photography, to color television, to computer monitors, all works on recording and displaying a careful mix of &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, and &quot;blue&quot; lights, not on a true mix of individual rainbow colors. They do this because mixing the three wavelengths suffice and because it is much easier to record/playback three different colors than an infinitude.</p>
<p>Astronomers and other scientists do have techniques for recording many more colors than we can see. It is not uncommon for astronomers to take photographs using filters which only allow the specific wavelengths given off by hydrogen, or water, or carbon dioxide, or other specific chemicals, and thus &quot;see&quot; where those chemicals are in the sky. Similarly, people who need it can get LEDs that light things up in specific ways.</p>
<p>You can get black lights which have a purple filter that eliminates most of the visible light emitted by the fluorescent tube. They look purple in operation. You can also get black lights which don't have the purple filter. They look blue in operation. The only different operationally is whether or not the purple filter is there. You can get black lights which use LEDs instead of a fluorescent tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose as far as practicality goes then yeah - building RGB screens and recording devices makes more sense than building them with oranges, yellows, cyans and magenta's too if it's no different in appearance on our end. I just thought maybe for decorative lights (Christmas lights, or even cool-coloured lighting for modern style homes) that there might have been a bigger use for LED's designed to be a specific non-primary light colour like yellow or orange rather than just using red and green together. Could be because I'm biased as I generally prefer the &quot;in between&quot; colours more.</p>
<p>Ah that's right - I remember now hearing that traditional black lights aren't actually purple, they just have a filter over them. So I guess they do the same thing as blue lights without the filter. Maybe it just looks more dynamic since blue is still a visible light so you see the other non-fluorescent stuff around the room more easily (it'll all just be dark blue) whereas with purple filtered lights the non-fluorescent elements are much darker almost appearing black compared to the few things that are highlighted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For purer UV, lasers work well, I hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually physics and cost.</p>
<p>RGB, Blue and Ultraviolet and Phosphor-based White.</p>
<p>These are the 3 types of commercial LED right now on the market. Th yellow ones you see in traffic lights are probably filters it's a type of White with a cap to filter out yellow light or it's Bi color Red Green right tuned to look yellow. </p>
<p>LED blacklights are available but they're not as good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought there's be much more than that. I'm sucker for RGB lights myself, I have a few decorative lamps in my house with RGB bulbs in them and I can set it to automatically cycle between colours, or have it stay on the one colour (and there's usually about a dozen options achieved by using the RGB is different amounts) I can make it white too but I think it's just white achieved by having all colours going at once and not an actual white light in there.</p>
<p>That could be it with the traffic lights. I've never gotten close enough to really tell. But I just assumed they made amber-coloured LEDs specifically for that purpose.</p></div>		</li>
