			<div class="markdown"><p>The reasons you give about slaughter methods and how they affect subsequent breakdown (or lack of) and taste are absolutely correct, and it was interesting to learn a bit more of the detail of what exactly is happening in the bodies of certain animals that give such differences in flavour. </p>
<p>But of course, the methods you describe that give the best meat and fish tastes are the finest that money can buy. Japan isn’t above having large catches of trawled and netted tuna landed and left to die onshore whilst prices are being negotiated, far from it. The ikejime method and similar are simply not the norm — tuna is “king” in Japan precisely because such vast amounts of it have been fished by more crude methods and then gone on sale to the nation’s people, not because the fish has been given royal treatment in general. </p>
<p>Not so dissimilar with the USA and beef. Sure it’s an incredibly popular meat, but this tells us that an immense amount of it is being produced for almost everyone to be enjoying it so often. Again, there is inevitably some disparity between the finest grass fed, unstressed, and most humanely slaughtered animals than the ones which make up the majority of the beef market. The rise of factory farming and the problems associated with it are well documented in the US. The overriding picture of the industry is one which will cut any corner or externalise any cost in order to squeeze out more profit. This inevitably leads to high rates of things like poor maintenance of equipment (a number one factor in the stress of animal slaughter when it is the slaughterhouse equipment), and poor maintenance of animal health whilst they are alive. </p>
<p>Anyway apologies for banging on a bit there, I just don’t think that the pictures you gave of certain animal food industries were representative of them as a whole. Many would say for example, that not only is the American seafood system fucked, but also the American livestock industries.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just so you know, literally any meat besides wild game is considered &quot;factory farmed&quot; by any group that tries to collect that data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure that grass fed beef that is left out to pasture for the vast majority of its life is classed as factory farmed? There is definitely data out there which distinguishes between that sort of thing and what we typically understand by factory farming (which is perhaps better described as intensive factory farming), I’ve seen it myself albeit a long time ago. Perhaps it called intensive factory farming something else. At any rate, it’s not impossible to draw a line somewhere more useful than ‘wild game vs everything else’ to get some more useful insights. Haven’t bothered to dive into all that in many years and have been content to get info from second hand sources (summary reports, investigative journalism etc) so like I say, perhaps a different set of terminology is used.</p></div>		</li>
