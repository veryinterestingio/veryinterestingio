			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately every electronic device needs DC. You can convert it externally which leaves you with a brick, or convert it internally which takes up more space. Most of the time it's an aesthetic choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As TVs become thinner thereâ€™s no room for the converter, so they put them on bricks now. Old box tvs up to the 90s and early 2000s had plenty of room inside the unit for one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever seen wallace and gromit? You know the machines they make to get out of bed etc?</p>
<p>It's a bit like that for electronics - things have to be in a certain order to be able to work properly.</p>
<p>With AC, the current flips back and forth 50 or 60 (usually, it can be other numbers) times a second, so things aren't really happening &quot;in order&quot;</p>
<p>With DC, the current moves in one direction, so we have more control to make sure things affect each other in the right way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DC remains consistent over time whereas AC is constantly changing its direction and value many (50-60) times per second.  AC would therefore cause problems in electronics that use digital logic where high voltage means &quot;on&quot; or &quot;1&quot; and low is &quot;off&quot; or &quot;0&quot; - with AC things would keep flipping between &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; and not work properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Computer stuff is more 1v these days, but they get that by stepping down from 12v DC which is converted from mains power (~120-250v AC) by the power brick / PSU.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the reason they are generally so large is that many of the components inside have sizes that are inversely proportional to the frequencies they interact with. Since the AC line oscillates at a very low frequency (e.g., 60Hz in the U.S.), the components will be relatively large. There are also requirements for things like brownout (i.e., losing line power briefly), so you need large passive components in that case to draw energy off of temporarily.</p></div>		</li>
