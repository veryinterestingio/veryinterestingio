			<div class="markdown"><p>Had an iguana as a kid and wowie can they whip hard once they get to be a couple feet long. Definitely can make you bleed. Smaller than about 18&quot; and they'll welt ya pretty good, but less damage for sure... Can't imagine the damage a 30' lizard could do, but I'm sure it'd turn bone to shards.</p></div>		</li>
