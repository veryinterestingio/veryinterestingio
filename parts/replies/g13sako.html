			<div class="markdown"><p>i did a quick google search on neuron size and found the diameter is .1 mm, or 100,000 nm. So if the synaptic gap is only 30 nm, that means they’re so close they’re practically touching, right?
(I mean not actually touching of course, but damn close)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's very very close. Individual neurotransmitter molecules themselves are also on the order of 1-2 nm across, so it's like dumping ping pong balls into one side of a shoebox. A lot of them are going to reach the far side very easily.</p></div>		</li>
