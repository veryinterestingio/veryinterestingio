			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this is really good summary of information from all comments, also thanks for info about topological quantum computing, I've never even heard about it before. And you are right in saying that  this is a good starting point, I'll be looking into it more. </p>
<p>Do you maybe know what are some good places to ask questions about QC (both theory and hardware implementation)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stack exchange is generally good for physics questions. I'm not really sure about places for QC questions specifically because I generally just ask the people I work with who know more than me or I read papers/textbooks etc. </p>
<p>Do you have much of a background in physics? I could definitely recommend you some reading if you'd like but it all assumes a reasonable knowledge of quantum mechanics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have much background in physics unfortunately, I was studying Computer Science 10 years ago and did some basic physics and electronics courses then and worked as video game programmer since. Went through Feynman's Lectures On Physics few years ago on my own to get better at basic stuff, but I'm nowhere close to being comfortable with QM. I'm mostly interested quantum computing algorithms and programming and I do some simple courses using QC simulators.
When it comes to learning about QC hardware, I mostly wanted to satisfy my curiosity and have better understanding how some of the concept that are feasible on simulator might not map well to actual hardware.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip on StackExchange.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is currently no experimental evidence for the existence of these particles, but in theory they exist in 2 dimensions and you can change their state by swapping their order</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm probably biting off more than I can chew with this question, but here it goes.  Whenever you preform an operation with any kind of computer, you provide inputs, and then observe the output. How could you possibly hope to observe any change in the state of a particle you're never actually observed with enough certainty to say it even exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not been entirely settled - as it is, it's still not certain that Majorana bound states have been observed, but the possible other explanations are being ruled out more and more every other year.</p>
<p>On the way we have learned a <em>lot</em> about the system, and progress in the past few years has been pretty good so I'm hopeful.</p></div>		</li>
