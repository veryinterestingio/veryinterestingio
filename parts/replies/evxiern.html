<p>Anyhow, that experiment was a bit circular in my opinion because we used molar mass in our initial standardization of stearic acid, which requires Avo's number to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the old definition of Avogadro's number, determining the molar mass doesn't not require knowing Avogadro's number. You burn a known mass of the acid, and weight the carbon dioxide produced. The molar mass of carbon dioxide can be determined by burning a known mass of carbon (well, pure carbon-12, which is a problematic sample to obtain) and weighting the carbon dioxide produced. </p>
<p>Knowing how many atoms of carbon is in a mole of stearic acid (this part took the better part of the 19th century, but we got there with nothing more advanced than balances) then yields the molar mass of stearic acid.</p></div>		</li>
