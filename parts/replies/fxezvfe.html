As for filters, I don't have much faith in them, other than for keeping the grounds out of my coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's not very plausible, we already have technology to look pretty far, imagine what we'll have in a 1000 years, or by the time we can do interstellar travel.</p>
<p>I think the observation technology outclasses travel technology by so much distance that it would be kinda pointless to try to hide in the universe.</p>
<p>What terrifies me is knowing that we already have the basic knowledge to do light speed weapons. US army have laser on some warships, we are far from the deathstar but, in the future we'll have better version of this at least. That means a interstellar civilization would have a insane version of this, could wipe us all and we have no means to know that it's coming before it hit us.</p></div>		</li>
