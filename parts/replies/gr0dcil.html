			<div class="markdown"><p>We are already seeing huge amounts of 'AI' deployed in a number of industries. Chatbots  (including Alexa) are a good example of some early stage basic AI, although without full sentience. But its adoption has been widespread.</p>
<p>There's lots of other AI examples which are mainstream but are less visible such as adaptive smart power grids.</p>
<p>AI represents a potential step change in how the world works and operates. It could simply fizzle out like the HD-DVD or it could change every aspect of our lives in a short period of time like the internet has done in the last 30 years. </p>
<p>Regarding teaching AI, do you mean teaching the concept to people or teaching the AI itself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all are, but there are quite a few that are. AI could also just be involved in a subset of the dialogue that takes place within your interaction with a given chatbot.</p></div>		</li>
