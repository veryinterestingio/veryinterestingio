			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we probably miss out on some. However, we also test drugs on human cells. If we can clearly see a positive effect on human cells (lets say liver cells) that are important for a disease, we could see which other animal cells react similarly to the disease, and pick a model organism that is thought to react in the same way as humans.</p>
<p>But definitely, I believe we miss out on possible medication because of our model organism choices. </p>
<p>It also happens for side-effects. Softenon/Thalomid (causing limb deformities in fetusses) only showed the same effect in lambs as in humans. I believe that it didn’t cause anything in rats, dogs and at least another species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also cannot find which tests were done beforehand. That crisis caused drug testing to change a lot afterwards.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This completely depends on the pharmacological mechanism of action. Drug discovery usually starts with a target, such as a receptor. Modern techniques also allow us to suss out the potential genetic variance between species, i.e. sequence homology.</p>
<p>Increasingly, newer drugs leverage the immune system. Immunology is one such field where we see a lot of divergence, as animals have essentially evolved different immune systems.</p>
<p>It’s hard to answer your question with certainty, because it depends on the scientific context. In the case where animal testing fails, we often probe the why. We need to understand whether it failed for safety or efficacy reasons. There are also ways to modify a model organism, such as generating a chimeric organism with human traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is to rethink how we analyze a drug candidate's efficacy. To understand what I mean by that you need to know why laboratory animal models frequently suggest a drug will work that doesn't. Mouse models will be made to express real human proteins in various stages of mutation, or a more systemic disease like cancer, to evaluate function/loss of function, and a drug candidate's effect on this system. </p>
<p>The problem arises because, although the mouse is in a diseased state, this dysfunction is completely contrived. It is unnatural and as such there are factors at play that researchers can't predict will be a problem in a real diseased human. Some researchers choose to combat this by collaborating with vet med programs to administer drug candidates to actually cancerous dogs for example. This doesn't completely solve the problem, as the rarer the disorder the lower the odds you will have a non-human patient, not to mention the fact that some diseases are uniquely human. Additionally sometimes the drugs that actually work on dogs just don't in humans and we don't know why. </p>
<p>I believe that the computational space will continue to prove more and more effective at screening drug candidates as well as the shift into a biochemical answer to disease rather than the small molecule chemistry that has dominated pharmaceuticals up until now. Biologics can have incredibly high specificity and we can design analogues of existing peptides now. The major gap in knowledge preventing us from treating any given major disease this way is the complexity of many of these systems and our sheer lack of understanding of how much of biology works.</p></div>		</li>
