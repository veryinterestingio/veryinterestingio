<p>edit found this answer down below: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Entire&quot; is the wrong word here - the impact heated the atmosphere, not 'the entire planet'. Oceans didn't get vaporized (aside from the area immediately surrounding the impact.)</p>

<p>This is not correct. Here's a <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/science/kring/Chicxulub/regional-effects/" target="_blank">laymen discussion</a> of some of the effects of the impact.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's a link to the actual show on Youtube.  I listened to the podcast myself.  I love Radiolab, it's really excellent and entertaining science journalism.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How often are animals fossilized?  </p>
<p>Obviously burying the sea floor in a couple hundred meters of debris ejecta is going to produce a high number of fossils.  What other kind of events create fossils and is the fossil record continually being created?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fossils are created anywhere organisms are buried faster than they are eaten, decompose, or physical break apart. There are also trace fossils, where you see tracks or burrows left behind by creatures.</p>
<p>Whether we can find fossils of a particular organism depends on how common they were (easier to find abundant, widespread plankton than rare, large sharks), if rocks from that environment are in a place we can see them (most sedimentary rocks on land are from shallow seas, so less likely to find animals that live in the open ocean), and if an organism will be buried rapidly enough to avoid being eaten or decomposing (a good lake example is the green River  formation in Wyoming-Utah. Rapid deposition of fine grain sediments in a lake with no oxygen in bottom waters provided an excellent environment to preserve fossils).</p>
<p>For animals on land it often takes something special, and usually pretty bad for their remains to make it in the fossil record. They have to be in a place where sediment is accumulating and will not erode away. It’s much harder, but we do find them. There are several known bone beds, where a large number of different species are found. We don’t really know why a large number of animals would be found in the same spot and there could be a variety of reasons, but bad storms and floods are good candidates. There are also odd spots, like the La Brea tar pits, where animals became trapped in the tar, rapidly covered and preserved.</p>
<p>There are definitely organisms that have evolved on Earth that we have no record of having lived. But it’s always hard to know what you don’t know.</p></div>		</li>
