			<div class="markdown"><p>God damn, I'm gonna screenshot this. You even answered something else I wondered about: what stroke is! For example, I often watch videos on YouTube where people do experiments with lawnmower engines and I believe they're usually two stroke engines. So that number is telling me how far the piston travels? </p>
<p>Thank you! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stroke is the distance the piston travels, but in the context here the stroke refers to how the engine functions: Either 2-stroke, or 4-stroke.</p>
<p>A combustion cycle has 5 phases: Intake, compression, ignition, combustion, and exhaust. A 2 stroke engine does all of these phases in the time it takes a piston to go up and down twice. A 4 stroke engine does these things in the time it takes a piston to go up and down four times.</p>
<p>Both of these hypothetical engines could have different (or similar!) stroke lengths, could have any number of pistons etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stroke in that sense is the amount of “events” happening in each cycle.
A two stroke sucks and bangs, a four stroke sucks squeezes bangs and blows.</p>
<p>The stroke of a piston, is how far the piston travels within the combustion cylinder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes the stroke is how far the piston travels from top to bottom. </p>
<p>two-stroke vs. four-stroke is different. a two-stroke burns fuel every rotation and is typically used in small engine like chainsaws, four-stroke engine have valves and only burn fuel every other rotation, it is the kinds of engine used in a car </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay. But then is it that number x number of pistons? Or do you include the fact that not all pistons are BDC at the same time?</p></div>		</li>
