			<div class="markdown"><p>Iron. We have said that each heme group in a hemoglobin molecule contains an ion of the trace mineral iron. On average, less than 20 percent of the iron we consume is absorbed. Heme iron, from animal foods such as meat, poultry, and fish, is absorbed more efficiently than non-heme iron from plant foods. Upon absorption, iron becomes part of the bodyâ€™s total iron pool. The bone marrow, liver, and spleen can store iron in the protein compounds <strong>ferritin</strong> and <strong>hemosiderin</strong>. Ferroportin transports the iron across the intestinal cell plasma membranes and from its storage sites into tissue fluid where it enters the blood. When EPO stimulates the production of erythrocytes, iron is released from storage, bound to transferrin, and carried to the red marrow where it attaches to erythrocyte precursors.</p>

<p>Not sure on this one, but since Iron is efficiently recycled, i doubt it would be a good measure to figure out iron deficiency. And it highly influenced by your diet as well, so hypothetically you could eat just enough iron to absorb but not &quot;waste&quot; through stool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not heard of stool color indicating iron deficiency, the big concern with stool is &quot;clay colored&quot;  which looks tan or even white. This can he an indication of liver failure (I work in a hospital lab)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, the urobilinogens are reabsorbed in the large intestine once broken down and has to make it back through your bloodstream to get to the kidneys where it is finally filtered out. Upon meeting the oxygen of the air, the urobilinogens oxidize to yellow urobilins.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Urobilinogen (colorless) is oxidized to urobilin (yellow) prior to hitting the external environment, as evidenced by placement of indwelling catheters, which can return yellow urine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>*should be no air in the urinary system ;)</p>
<p>You're right though, I hadn't thought about that. It's been a while since biochemistry, but I thought I remembered something about oxidation and the yellow color. I guess there must be some other oxidative process converting urobilinogen to urobilin in vivo?</p></div>		</li>
