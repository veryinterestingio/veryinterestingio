			<div class="markdown"><p>Electric charge is always conserved. A black hole must have the same charge as the sum of all the charges of the matter from which it formed.</p>
<p>I believe there are some specific phenomena predicted for charged black holes but to put it simply: a charged black hole will have an electric field.</p>
<p>Since most macroscopic objects in the universe are roughly charge neutral, black holes are expected to be mostly charge neutral too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So say you made a black hole that was really negatively charged. Would the electric field extend past the event horizon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be an electric field outside. I'm not sure if &quot;extend past the event horizon&quot; is a useful description in words. The electric field has been there before, too, because the charge didn't change at any time. This is quite similar to the gravitational field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For instance, mass has a role in the prediction of the tidal forces experienced by an object falling into a BH. While spin affects the innermost stable circular orbit.</p>
<p>These two has been somewhat easily understood by individuals with little to no knowledge on astrophysics, partly because they are linked to a concept that we can visualize, I believe.</p>
<p>But for electric charge its a whole different ball game.</p>
<p>Are there any writings/predictions made on the properties of a positively/negatively charged BH?
Or the discovery/research of BHs till now has always been based on the assumption that it has a net charge of 0?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, a charged black hole would be like any other charged object, with an electric field and a magnetic field. The interesting question is how it might affect the shape of the singularity inside the event horizon.</p>
<p>The force of electric repulsion is far stronger than gravity and so the singularity might manifest itself as an infinitesimal ring or disc</p>
<p>A perhaps notable result is that sufficiently charged objects (for example, an electron) cannot become black holes.</p>
<p>None of this is considered particularly significant in the field of cosmology as black holes are expected to have very small or no net charge. This makes sense because a positively charged black hole would repel positively charged matter and attract negatively charged matter.</p></div>		</li>
