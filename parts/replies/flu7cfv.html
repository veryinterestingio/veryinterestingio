			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Get some oil on your skin or some slimy greasy shit and you will be wanting some hand soap, body wash isnt as strong. Out of all the answers here that were so well thought out why did you listen to this guy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shampoo is the most mild of all soaps because your hair has protective oils on it that regular soap can strip away, so yeah using shampoo everywhere isn't bad but you also aren't cleaning your body as well as if you used body soap because your body is different then your hair and tends to build up more dirt/grease. If it works for you that's what matters, but there is actually a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that it's not as strong so if your hands are heavily soiled it will take more scrubbing to clean them.  </p>
<p>And that's really the only downside here.  Also note that handsoaps tend to be &quot;antibacterial&quot; while body soaps probably aren't, but that means nothing anyway, because the soap washes the bacteria off of your hands and it doesn't matter at all whether they die or not in the process.</p></div>		</li>
