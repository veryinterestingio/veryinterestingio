<p>For example, average of $100,000 and median of $50,000 tells you that most of the population makes less than $100,000 but there are few extremely high earners. A median of $50,000 wouldn't tell you that.</p>

<p>Using a per household number is what I most commonly see used, and in some sense it is a metric of income / working population. It also has the advantage of not disregarding the costs of the nonworking population entirely</p></div>		</li>
