			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really curious about the last part.  Would you mind explaining what you mean by projecting the episode onto future events?  For instance is it similar to saying that individuals who are deep rooted in clinical depression are so certain of their negative perceptions, or their certainty of how a future event is bound to make them feel?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just did a quick look as I am also interested in this. Interesting stuff indeed. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. You cant make a claim a person in depression is certain of anything or not even if they say they are.  It is specifically known as “Memory State Dependance” and is transference only after the fact, so I wouldn’t even call it transference at all. Gabor Mate talks about “salience attribution” in his book “Hungry Ghosts” and theres another book called “Brainlocked” by a doctor on the OCD element in depression.</p>
<p>“Memory State Dependance” is best explained like how you remember Algebra better when you are in math class. Or how you remember the vibe of your pals in 94 when a song comes on.  Your memory works to retrieve certain feelings under certain circumstances better than others.</p>
<p>The issue the depressive has is the negative compulsion built by an unchecked constant rumination within a BRAIN LOCKED memory state, trudging over the same negative loss helpless vibe again and again everyday making that the only way the brain can work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the goal of certain types of therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy. Basically, trying to re-route your brain so it functions more appropriately and responds to negative stimuli in an appropriate manner.</p></div>		</li>
