			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is the correct answer.  The sound card is a dedicated processor/controller that can work independently from the main processor. The main processor does not run a real-time OS this it relies on external controllers like the ones on the sound card to do time sensitive tasks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... Kind of. The audio card only has &lt;1s of audio buffered at a time. The CPU is still processing and sending that data to it. That's why when a computer crashes catastrophically you'll hear the last sound just on repeat over and over (like a BSOD meme)</p>
<p>90% of the time when a computer freezes it's not even the CPU at 100%. It's the hard drive or RAM. Most tasks people do don't take up very much processing power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, they’re just miniaturized on your main board. There’s a reason most mobos have the Realtek drivers, there’s a micro controller apart from your CPU dedicated to just sound. Mobos have also improved dramatically for isolation and other advancements which makes the bulky size of cards mostly obsolete outside of port availability.</p>
<p>Ninja edit: I’m old enough to remember when arithmetic logic units ALUs were add on cards. Most early CPUs couldn’t even math at the level required for early CAD software. A precursor to graphics cards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem knowledgable so i take the audacity to ask; In average, is integrated sound better than a dedicated sound card?</p>
<p>I have decent headphones, i currently have a 2006 laptop (with realtek chip) and used to have a desktop PC with a Creative SB0460 (dedicated PCI sound card from around that era), but apart from sound not being as loud (it is loud enough though), sound quality wise i have not noticed much difference (if any) between them. I havent (and cant) compare them side to side, but if there was a noticeable change i would've noticed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What does that have to do with anything? The phone can do everything it can do outside of my pocket also inside of my pocket. There's no limitation and it doesn't matter if there's dedicated hardware to perform that task or if it's done purely by the CPU. My phone for example reads my mail inbox and sends alerts to my smartwatch, no matter where it is. And there's no dedicated hardware for my mails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is not really dedicated Hardware for your mails, but you don't need dedicated hardware for it either. Your phone periodically checks if it can connect to the internet via WiFi or 3g/LTE and check if there's mails available and then reports it depending on your settings. So, there's the networking hardware involved. Even when you put it into standby. Sound is running constantly and without an integrated circuit your phone would not be able to do a playback in standby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point is that the whole phone is running anyways no matter what. That you can listen to music while it's in your pocket has absolutely nothing to do with dedicated hardware for sound output. It could be done completely in software on the CPU and it would still work.</p></div>		</li>
