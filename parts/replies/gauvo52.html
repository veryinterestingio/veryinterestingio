			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm obviously not a pop star, but I did theatre for a bit and lemme tell you. There is nothing more satisfying and freeing than closing a musical and <em>never having to hear any of that music again ever again</em>. I used to love Chicago, then I was in a production of Chicago, and I still, five years later, can't watch or listen to Chicago.</p>
<p>Maybe it's different if it's your own music that you wrote, idk. But performing other people's music gets old quick.</p>
<p>(Side note: learning how to push past that boredom and lowkey hatred of a specific piece of music and still deliver an engaging, thoughtful performance is a skill that actors have to learn. Cuz no one wants to watch someone be bored on stage.)</p></div>		</li>
