			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not true. You forgot to consider heat conduction within your body. If one side of you is getting burned from heat radiated from the sun, rate of heat transfer through your body (through conduction) will be way higher than rate of heat transfer from your body to ‘empty’ space (through radiation) on the other side, thereby, making it almost as hot as the side facing the sun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then it's possible to get further back (to what to degree, I can't speculate) out towards Mars, Jupiter, etc. so that the rate of burn doesn't feel like horrible burning but is reasonably warm without your back freezing? Or because it's like a sunburn and not like a campfire the sensation of the heat wouldn't be the same?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, that's not true.  At normal temperatures radiation is a small factor but in space a human-shaped body will lose upwards of 5 kW to radiation.  That's way more flux than the human body can conduct for a sustained period, and way more than can be survived for a reasonable length of time.  A human exerting themselves will generate a few hundred watts of heat (although athletes can do about a kilowatt for a couple minutes), but they can't sustain that for long without overheating.  In space, without an insulating cover, they'd be losing heat several times faster than they could move it from their front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but it will never get exactly the same. The side facing the sun will always be noticeably hotter than the side facing away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a hard answer as it really depends on unknown factors such as what color your painted.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In direct sunlight say orbiting earth you actually overheat.  Space suits are painted white and have active cooling systems.  Imagine standing in the middle of a bright sunny day and how hot the sun feels on your skin.  In space only radiation can cool you and it's very inefficient at human temperatures.  </p>
<p>Also humans have active cooling via sweat which is even more efficient in space, and also how hard you are doing would factor in since a human generates up to a few hundred watts of thermal energy during strenuous exercise.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The answer would be further than 1AU in the sun and if you were working.   They actually tested unpressurized space suits and it was noted they had a cooling system but no heating system FWIW.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top answer says 1 AU, where the earth is.</p>
<p>So if you get closer than the earth, it will get warmer, and further will get cooler.</p>
<p>You can imagine the earth as a giant spacesuit, the average temperature is 60 degrees F. A person in a spacesuit would have a similar average temperature, though warmer because of their body temperature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good thing we have a <em>perfectly working</em> climate control system in our 'spacesuit' then.</p></div>		</li>
