			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I drive my weight in screws every year, sometimes twice my weight. Torx are absolutely superior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are good and bad Robertson bits. When you buy a big bit set they're always those cheap tapered bits, and they slip and wear out like nobody's business. There are better bits that have a much smaller taper.</p>
<p>I learned about the good and bad bits building a deck with my dad that took at least 2000 screws. I currently don't own any good bits, so I'd buy one before building a deck of my own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're using cheap bits if you have any issues with them slipping. I used to build cabinets using Robertson head screws and a bit would last thousands of screws before wearing out and beginning to slip. In 6 months, I probably only actually wore out 2 bits and I drove 800 to 1000 screws a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is Robertson. All self-centering means is that rotation force can't throw the bit out. Torx and Hex get that award too.</p>
<p>Robertsons (with good bits) don't slip as easily though and don't require much axial force to keep the bit in.</p>
<p>Screws can be put on a bit and held sideways easily too, which isn't common for Phillips unless the bit is magnetized.</p></div>		</li>
