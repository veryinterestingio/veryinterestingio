<p>There is no clear answer to this but because of improved medicine, living conditions etc people are living much longer and so the ultimate selection pressure “dying before you can reproduce” is less powerful.  There are a variety of genes (and of course there physical manifestation) that have been found to have changed over the past few decades.  Possible explanations are – the genes are linked to other unrelated genes that are affected by selection pressure, or that a process called biased gene conversion during reproduction may be responsible and of course just  random changes can occur in gene frequencies sometime caused by increased global interaction and of course even infertile couples can often now have children.   </p>
<p>Hope that helps – there are lots of other things that seem to be changing we may be adapting to junk food, more people have extra bones in the feet and an artery in the arm that normally disappears by birth is becoming more frequent. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Evolution is more about being able to procreate than to survive.
Having that in mind, maybe part of humanity has trouble mating because they are &quot;distracted&quot; by getting their wisdom teeth removed. While this is not an extreme operation in today's world, it may be enough to slowly <em>guide</em> the gene pool of humanity away from wisdom teeth.
Another idea is that the body is basically wasting energy to grow a teeth you don't need + the healing of the removal will take some energy too.. maybe this person's sperm is not as fertile? I think especially in modern society this change will be close to zero tho.
However I don't know about which society you are talking as for example in africa many people don't have enough food, or it's not nutritious enough. Maybe for them this wasted energy is a bigger problem.
Also maybe dying because of something like an infected wisdom tooth is not as rare for them as it is for someone who grew up in a more developed country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe some of the changes in our teeth and jaws are due to changes in the food we eat and how food is cooked.   Our diet has changed quite a bit over time.  Certain teeth are used more for different types of food - meat versus vegetables and fruit.</p></div>		</li>
