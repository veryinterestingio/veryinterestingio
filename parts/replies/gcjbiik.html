			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Many comments up above are saying that Pfizer didn't run stability studies at higher temperatures, preferring not to take the time and try to get the vaccine to market faster.</p>
<p>But no, that's not how the industry works. I am very sure Pfizer had vials at higher temps that -80 on stability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really doesn't cost you any extra time to do higher temps, since higher temps would almost certainly result in <em>faster</em> degradation than your -80 and -20 conditions; plus it's good to have stability data for worst-case scenarios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great reply.  Cell therapy here.  I haven’t looked at the two candidates closely — it could definitely be stability protocol results and just how they set up the study that’s driving it.</p>
<p>But I wonder if they might also be different dosage forms?   Maybe one in frozen suspension (and has to stay below the first glass transition temp) and the other lyophilized, more stable, and resuspended with companion diluent at time of use?</p>
<p>Will be interesting to find out. </p>
<p>Anyway, cheers for the great answer.</p></div>		</li>
