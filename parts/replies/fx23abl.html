			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, how then are people able to expose themselves under doctor supervision to allergens in controlled amounts in order to &quot;get over&quot; their allergy? Wouldnt the effort just continually make it worse?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically tricking your immune system by sneaking the allergen in. It’s given in teeny tiny doses, low enough that it (hopefully) won’t trigger a reaction, then gradually bumped up. Your body hasn’t been reacting, so you can sort of circumvent the system. </p>
<p>It’s like the old “frog in boiling water” story. Give it all at once and you’ll react, give tiny amounts and slowly scale it up and (maybe) you won’t. It desensitizes your system. </p>
<p>It doesn’t always work and isn’t always permanent, but sometimes it’s really effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about when several generations of my family experience the same harmless pollen and my body still hates it? I've been very allergic to dandelions and apparently most people ate them during the Great Depression. Is this just a weird genetic quirk?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, allergies have nothing or very little to do with genetic inheritance. Some of your immune cells are constantly producing immunoglobulins with slightly different structures which are circulating in your bloodstream. It's not like you inherit immunoglobulins (or even the specific 'genetic blueprints') from your parents, even though breastfed babies get some immunoglobulins from breast milk.</p>
<p>We know some people are more inclined to develop allergies for a multitude of reasons, such as early weaning, early introduction of some foods, different makeups of gut microbiome, etc. We also know some foods, chemicals and biological structures (eg pollen, fungal spores) are more allergenic than others. Past family exposure to allergens doesn't affect your probability of developing an allergy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You don't inherit the blueprints, or let us say, lego model building plan, but you do inherit the lego bricks themselves --- different families may have different bricks and allergies (or rather, the proclivity towards having allergies) are heritable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your ancestors' immune systems were busy fighting tuberculosis, plague, lots of bacterial infections and other nasty stuff  that was around for the entire lifetime of our species minus past  \~100 years.</p>
<p>MtDNA studies roughly estimate that H.Sapiens has been around for 200 000 years. So 99.95% of that period our immune system was under attack since we lived literally in the dirt. It doesn't think that 100 years of vaccines, clean hands, food standards and sanitation is enough of a &quot;ceasefire&quot; to readjust. <em>Immune system is &quot;trigger happy&quot; by design</em>, so in the absence of real enemies it starts ringing alarms on benign stuff.</p>
<p>So if you have kids - get them a cat and/or a dog, allow them to play outdoors, don't Chlorox absolutely everything, don't feed them fast food that impacts the gut biome, make sure that in early months they get breastfed (because again, gut biome). That would keep their immune system entertained just enough.</p></div>		</li>
