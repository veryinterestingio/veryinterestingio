			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, important to understand.  Aerodynamical drag force increases quadratically with velocity, but the power required to overcome this force increases <strong>cubed</strong> with velocity.  That is the reason why 200 kW cars are not 2x faster than 100 kW cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. There's a reason some electric cars in the 1910's could go for 100+ km: their cruising speeds were so low, drag barely entered the equation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slowing down isn't always more fuel efficient.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/sloan-auto-lab/research/beforeh2/files/IreneBerry_Thesis_February2010.pdf" target="_blank">Optimal fuel efficiency for many vehicles is achieved in a pretty broad band from about 50 to 75 km/h (30 to 45 mph) (fig. 41), with 100 km/h (60 mph) pretty close to the optimal band.</a></p>
<p>Crawling along at 25 km/h (15 mph) and driving down the highway at 120 km/h (75 mph) gives you the same fuel economy in a late-90s Ford Explorer. Maximum efficiency in that vehicle is achieved at 65 - 75 km/h (40 - 45 mph). Drive faster OR slower than that and your fuel consumption goes up.  </p>
<p>This happens because the engine is considerably less efficient under low loads, and that efficiency gain is faster than the increased drag gain up to the maximum fuel efficiency point. After that, increased drag outweighs any continuing gains in engine efficiency.</p></div>		</li>
