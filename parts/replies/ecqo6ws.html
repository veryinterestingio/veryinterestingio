			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation. I seem to remember Feynman writing about giving the string theorists a hard time, asking &quot;how many dimensions are you in today?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how he'd feel today. Back then there was more hope for more &quot;normal&quot; approaches to solving quantum gravity and unification. But it doesn't seem like anything to his 1970s flavored liking will ever show up. </p>
<p>Some guys from around this era have gravitated more towards acceptance of string theory. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't it be the case that some dimensions simply don't affect certain things? Maybe 26 dimensions are in effect in the cases where the math properly describes it as such, and fewer 'active' dimensions in cases such as 11 or 10 dimensions? I'm not great at physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s basically what they’re saying.  That all of the extra dimensions other than our familiar four are curled up so tightly under the planck limit that you can never detect them and they have no practical direct impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems to me to be akin to the epicycles theorized by Ptolemy to describe the retrograde motion of the planets while maintaining the idea of Geo-centrism. </p>
<p>With a lot of math - the model is consistent, but far more complex.  I fear that this is un-scientific in nature.  If observations are made that contradict the string theorist's model, I fear that they will simply add further mathematical complexity to accommodate.  </p></div>		</li>
