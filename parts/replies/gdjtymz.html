			<div class="markdown"><p>Good morning!</p>
<p>Great questions. I'll go in order.</p>
<ol>
<li>We know that there is a variety that have already thawed, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The way we are thinking about this is in terms of knows and unknowns. For example, we know about the methanogenic bacteria that process carbon-- and that there are increasingly more of them-- and we know about Smallpox victims buried in permafrost-- but what don't we know about? That's what really piqued my interest.</li>
<li>There could be some really cool, helpful stuff in there. There are some microbes that are very resistant to temperature extremes, for example, and could have agricultural uses (e.g. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161592" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161592" target="_blank">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161592</a></a>). It's also possible that some of the microbes with antibiotic resistance (we talk about in the article) could teach us new things about medicine. It's really very cool.</li>
<li>I am worried about a few things. There seems to be a hardiness to come from the emerging microbes that may make them more competitive in the environment. If they are from thousands of years ago, that could be a shock to the local system. Also, I am COVID-influenced, so I am wary of anything that could be a problem for the human population.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How old are these microbes that are defrosting? I was under the impression that most of these ancient microbes wouldn't have high potential to infect humans because they are so old and poorly adapted to our immune systems. For example, wouldn't dinosaur microbes be unable to infect mammals due to our different cellular structures (ie. Protiens)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The methanogenic (methane-creating) bacteria they mentioned would make things worse, in that regard. Even <em>if</em> they somehow consume carbon dioxide from the atmosphere instead of carbon from organic detritus (almost certainly not), the fact is that methane is a much, <em>much</em> more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide - and while it decomposes in the atmosphere, it decomposes into <em>carbon dioxide</em> (and water - and water vapor is also a decent greenhouse gas, but at least the atmosphere has a limit on how much water can exist in it without it condensing out. No such limit exists for other greenhouse gasses like methane or carbon dioxide).</p></div>		</li>
