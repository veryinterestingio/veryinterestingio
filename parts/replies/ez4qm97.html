			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact! A pidgin is a simplified language used in a pinch between two people who can't understand each others' languages, with simplified grammar and limited vocabulary. A creole is a full language with its own complete grammar and vocabulary, and it can even be someone's native language. Adults mixing two languages together for trade will probably create a pidgin, while their children who grow up in a bilingual environment can create a creole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meeeeh... Possible, but they would both have to slow down considerably and use plenty of pantomime. They are not <em>that</em> similar.</p>
<p>I speak both, plus portuguese and French and despite what people think, it's not the same with a few variations, they are absolutely not mutually intelligible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly, I only ever spoke English when I was in Rome, because itâ€™s such a tourist city everyone speaks it and sometimes better than native speakers.  However, growing up as I was learning Spanish I was able to speak with my mom who speaks Italian fluently and knows 0 Spanish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Portuguese and Spanish are strangely similar. A few years ago a runner from Brazil came to my running club and we spoke for a good 10 minutes, him Portuguese and me Spanish and only a few times we had to stop to explain/gesture to get the point across.</p>
<p>French and Italian are a little rougher without a previous related language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that this is completely related to your point (the languages aren't similar at all), but I always find it amusing when some of my African or Asian friends are talking to their parents in their native language and right in the middle of a sentence they switch to (usually overly American) English. Like they just drop a &quot;Ate a Big Mac&quot; in there out of nowhere.</p></div>		</li>
