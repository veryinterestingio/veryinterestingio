			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you want more, the reason most of the water gets directed towards the outer edges of the fan is more than just centrifugal forces. The outer edges of the fan blade are traveling faster than the inside, and therefore can create a higher velocity air flow. This higher velocity stream has an inherently lower pressure than the slower air in the center of the fan, and any water droplet entering this system will experience a difference in pressure that forces it (sucks it) towards the outside walls of the fan duct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this point, water will still get into the combustion chamber however the igniters (spark plugs for jet engines) will be turned on to continuously create a spark, incase it does lose its flame its reignited right away. When usually in good weather those igniters are off because its a continuous flame in the combustion section.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And with turbine engines there's no BANG. More of a burn.</p></div>		</li>
