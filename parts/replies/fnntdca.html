<p>It's more akin to epilepsy than &quot;a headache&quot;.  It's there, waiting to be triggered.  Semantically speaking, you don't get migraines as much as you have migraine, and get migraine attacks.</p>

<p>That's a great way to put it! Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is so stark. </p>
<p>Headaches are headaches but I know it’s a migraine because it’ll quickly switch to me very nauseous, being sensitive to light, and feeling super hot.</p>
<p>You can work through a headache but not I migraine. </p>
<p>I remember last time I had one I went to the grocery store for medicine and I was wincing at the light and was like hunkered down as if it was raining from the pain</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I’ve only had one in high school. The aura was confusing, but I don’t recall the pain being remarkable. I felt a lot of unease and an inability to think. And persistent nausea. From stories I’ve heard, I’m happy it was a mild one.</p></div>		</li>

Otherwise yes you are right</p></div>		</li>
