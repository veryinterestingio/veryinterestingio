			<div class="markdown"><p>Misread the question my apologies, but if I was to hazard a guess I would probably say it's something to do with people's tolerance levels to motion sickness, an average person couldn't handle the G-forces of F1 cars or fighter jets yet there are people in the world who can stomach such forces its probably the same for car/flight/sea sickness just not as harsh as my former examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many people struggle with motion sickness when going through pilot training. Some people it is short lived. For the others at least in the Air Force they are sent to the barony chair (suped up office chair for spinning people in) and get spun around until they quit getting sick. Most people overcome it others never do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I get motion sick but it happens more with low FPS monitors. High FPS has more realistic movement so my brain and eyes seem to agree with it better.</p></div>		</li>
