			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had some success with getting mostly clear ice using a process of freezing distilled water from an almost boiling temp in a spherical mold and semi submerging it in a larger bath of water. Some fractures occured in a few batches but they turned out close to flawless. Apparently this method freezes the ice in layers as opposed to from the outside in. Doing the same thing without setting atop a bath of water produces cloudy ice as the freezing process is now &quot;traditional&quot;--from the outside in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I make 2x2 inch clear ice cubes at home using boiled water, a silicon tray and a consumer level freezer.<br />
Hot water in trays, in water, inside a closed insulated cooler box, inside a larger freezer will make perfectly clear ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually using filtered water (as clean as possible) makes a difference. If you boil it, let it cool down and boil it once more before freezing you get quite clear ice as there's very little microscopic air bubbles trapped in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can say that using those ball ice makers with boiling water does make them less cloudy but not perfectly clear. There are devices you can buy which do make clear ice but they can be kinda spendy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm honestly more curious about this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have clear, restaurant quality ice that melts 5 times slower than cloudy ice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would clear ice melt slower than cloudy ice? Is is because there's more surface area in the micro-fractures of cloudy ice that offers more exposure to warmer air and beverages?</p></div>		</li>
