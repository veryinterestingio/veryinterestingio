			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I've had lucid dreams waking up has been kind of weird. I awake but don't quite feel there. Feels like I am still in a dream. It takes a while for the feeling to go away completely. And once or twice I have experienced nested dreams when I awoke in a dream. Really scary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My last Lucid dream I got worried I did not set my alarm before laying down, so I tried to wake myself up to check.</p>
<p>I kept &quot;waking up&quot; on a couch still in a dream. It was in the fictional dream house so I knew right away I was still dreaming. Took close to ten attempts before I really woke up.</p>
<p>Was pissed at myself because turns out I had properly set my alarm all along. But I managed to get back in my Lucid dream anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had I super close call when in a dream I realized I was lucid and dreaming for the first time and was excited to notice it was real but needed to pee so I figured I'd wake up and be able to get right back into it after I got back.  So I woke up and the handle to my room door felt strange and wouldn't turn and I could feel how bad I needed to pee when I realized I was indeed still dreaming and barely woke up in time to not piss the bed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also tried to do lucid dreaming.</p>
<p>I  ended up having the same recurring nightmare. I was laying in my bed unable to move, while someone sat on my bed next to me. Sometimes I would &quot;wake up&quot; staring into this face, that for a lack of better words was completely featureless and looked very sinister. Feeling every muscle in my body tense, as I tried to pull away from it, but still being completely motionless.</p>
<p>I stopped trying after those. Those were really creepy. 2/10 wouldn't do it again..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try 5HTP and if you smoke blend in some mugwart.  Be very gentle on consuming both of these and increase dose very slowly.  Also do not use them extended periods without breaks.  5 nights in a row should have 10 nights off, 2 should have 4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never managed to succeed. What I've heard can help though is keeping a &quot;dream diary&quot; kind of thing. Keep a notepad next to your bed and write down your dreams, in as much detail as possible, as soon as you wake up. This is meant to help train your brain to realise the difference between a dream and reality.</p></div>		</li>
