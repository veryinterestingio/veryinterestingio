			<div class="markdown"><p>No, antimatter isn't some exotic FTL stuff. It's just regular matter, but with the opposite electrical charge on the protons, electrons etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't mean to suggest it was FTL; I was more suggesting that the universe is CPT-symmetric about the big bang; what matter exists in our universe is complemented by anti-matter &quot;existing before&quot; the BB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you misunderstood what he meant. He doesn't mean travel back in time in the sense that it surpasses the speed of light.</p>
<p>Rather he talked about anti-time or a similar concept to that. While it sounds like a pretty funky sci-fi concept at first but it is an theory that is compatible with known science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Within the same realm of speculation, it could be possible the universe has two sides, just like a sheet of paper on which you can &quot;draw&quot; particles and universes on both sides. Maybe, for some reason antimatter is almost here but on the opposite side. This line of thought would partially explain dark matter too - the space-time fabric is gravitationally stretched by masses on its either side. So there is apparently more mass than we can see. We cannot collide with it but can interact gravitationally</p></div>		</li>
