			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be cooler, but unfortunately physics doesn't quite work like that - think of the blades like an olympic hammer thrower's hammer: although the blades are spinning around a single point when attached to the rotor, as soon as they detach there is no force pulling them in a circle, so they pretty much just fly in the direction they were already moving</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>accelerometers, direction sensors, and the seat computer. Some new seats (like the one on russian SU-30 MKI) can actually reorient / maneuver to an extent before and during firing their main motor, to give you higher survival rates, even if you are in a low altitude inverted flight scenario (like the one here: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yh-kuztsE1s?t=39" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/Yh-kuztsE1s?t=39" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Yh-kuztsE1s?t=39</a></a> with near-inverted, or <a href="https://youtu.be/YxMLkEYgT78?t=30" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/YxMLkEYgT78?t=30" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/YxMLkEYgT78?t=30</a></a> with sideways ejection scenario out of canadian F18 Hornet  - both in nearly zero altitude situations. If you look closely, both seats take their time and fire main rockets when they are properly positioned, not straight away)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: as a fun fact, there was at least one aircraft - the  XF-104  - that had its seats configured to actually fire downwards at one point in development (to limit pilot exposure to wind blast when leaving the aircraft, and to have it clear the aircraft with no chance of hitting the vertical stabilizer) <a href="http://www.ejectionsite.com/f104seat.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.ejectionsite.com/f104seat.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ejectionsite.com/f104seat.htm</a></a>  - I'd really hate to take all that negative g loads tho (negative as in bottom to top, reverse from normal direction)...for obvious reasons it was not a zero altitude capable system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe another helicopter has used that method.  Though that requires a more complex seat, as you'd need to go sideways, then orient itself to go up, otherwise things could go badly when ejecting at low altitude.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just laughed so hard at the image of a pilot being forcefully ejected straight ahead and flying through the air strapped to a seat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Detach spinning things with small explosive charges and they go flying sideways outta the way. </p>
<p>That said, I'm not sure I want to fly on a helicopter where someone put explosives on the rotor for 'safety reasons' </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Explosive bolts and frangible nuts are a somewhat common thing.  Among other things, they're used on rockets to separate stages.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_standard_detonator" target="_blank">They were also how the space shuttle dropped the boosters and fuel tank</a>.  They're quite reliable about detonating when you want them to and not detonating when you don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also: Bridges. At least in Europe. During the Cold War, a lot of bridges were prepared with <a href="https://www.geschichtsspuren.de/images/stories/Artikel/sperren/09ssesk1.jpg" target="_blank">holes</a> and in several cases the holes were filled with explosives (without fuse). There is still an unknown number of bridges with explosives inside.

<p>They had a military parade in my city where you could sit in a blackhawk. One Family-Father pulled the wrong leaver when opening the door to get out of the helicopter and activated the explosive bolts on the door, which then, well, the door just fell of as intended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As such - considering how much explosives there are in your average ejection seat (both as explosive bolts, and several solid fuel rocket motors with several tons/seconds of thrust in them) - you should reconsider getting into a cockpit of one then :)</p></div>		</li>
