<p>When you are looking at yourself in the mirror, the image has depth and a 3d feel to it, meanwhile the photo is a 2d, slightly distorted image. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My neice is very pretty in real life, but in photos she is breathtaking. I always wondered why. The lens does something very pleasant to her proportions while I end up looking like something behind glass at Ripley's Believe It or Not. A novelty potato, perhaps, or maybe a large piece of haunted cheese. </p></div>		</li>
