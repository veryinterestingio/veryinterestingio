			<div class="markdown"><p>My Dad was WW2 generation and had a manual typewriter.  I don't know how he wrote letters that were supposed to impress, but it seems like the typewriter and his signature would do the job.  I don't know how a type-written letter was received vs. good penmanship.  It might have actually carried more weight because they figured it was from an office, or somebody who wrote professionally and had a typewriter.  It would certainly be appreciated as easy on the eyes, since everybody was familiar with typewriter fonts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, for sure typed letters were seen as highly professional as well. While typing wasn't exactly a rare skill, a lot of people treated that as something to delegate to a secretary/assistant.</p>
<p>That said, typing properly invites similar issues/judgement. When you make a mistake it's apparent. There's a reason that whole moment of ripping a page out of a typewriter in frustration is kind of a trope of hollywood films set in that era. Stuff like white out didn't exist until the 60's or something.</p>
<p>And don't even get me started on how effective these fucking things are as a device to torture children with: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Original-Big-Chief-Writing-Primary/dp/B0094ILCJC" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Original-Big-Chief-Writing-Primary/dp/B0094ILCJC</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really, really disliked penmanship.  My pen was always half a paragraph behind my brain and every sentence became an irregular squiggle.  I never received better than a D in penmanship.  It dragged my average down all through grammar school.<br />
I managed to save up for a typewriter by the time I was halfway through  secondary.   Even the Columbus Method was a relief.  Finally learning to type was a godsend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a moderately aged fart, I've learned that most styles of writing have be a purpose. Someone gave a good answer about getting ink to flow from fountain pens (and previously quills) so the word would be legible. This makes sense because stopping and starting ink flow would leave a lot of ink blotches and make things harder to read. With the advent of pencils, and ultimately erasers, I suppose this would make cursive less relevant because you could fix a mistake easily. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I mean it goes back even further. Ever try writing with a quill, or even a more modern fountain pen? You can only do strokes easily in particular directions. Cursive definitely works better with those pens once you get over the learning hurdle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned cursive in France in the early 60s using a dipping pen and inkwell.  Pulling the tines of the pen apart as you were writing was the only way to get the ink to flow out.  Also you could only get one word per dip, and cursive made the ink last longer for each word.  We never printed anything.</p></div>		</li>
