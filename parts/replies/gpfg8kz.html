			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the seasoned and novice runner burn the same number of calories per mile (assuming they weigh the same). The novice *feels* that it is much harder to do the run, but not because calories/mile is higher. Fatigue and endurance are only loosely connected to rates of expenditure. In the Hadza example, we’ve measured their walking cost (calories/km) and it’s the same as people in industrialized countries</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>doesn't biomechanical efficiency come into play? the trained runner is more biomechanically efficient, either genetically, or from training? so the runner gets farther, faster, on the same calories as the novice?  </p>
<p>if the two runners were machines, we would allow that the machine with more friction would experience more energy loss in accomplishing the same task.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the response they gave sounds fishy or incomplete. Healthy adults are all capable of walking with what I would assume would be relative energy expenditure. Running is more difficult. A trained runner should be handling running better than an untrained runner. Their heart, lungs, and muscles should be more efficient. If someone is a proficient runner, their heart rate should be lower, breathing less, and temperature regulation more stable. All of those contribute to calorie expensiture. None of those come into play for walking. I don't know if you can draw the conclusion that walking and running are the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming the same speed right? Like a 4:30 capable runner doing an 8 minute mile uses the same amount of energy as a novice just barely getting through an 8 minute mile (assuming the same weight)?</p></div>		</li>
