			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, the mass of the water in the tower has noting to do with the pressure. It is only dependent on height. If you put a litre of water 10m up it will have the same pressure as 1000l of water at the same level.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes, I know that the more water you add to a tower will raise the level and thus the pressure, that is besides the point here.</p>
<p>Moving water to a height uses energy(converts it actually, to potential energy) , thus the more water you pump up to said height, the longer you can maintain the pressure while supplying water. In some countries they even use dams at high elevation like batteries, pumping water up into the dam during off peak power demand and then letting the water run back down through a turbine during peak power demand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what kind of water system you have. </p>
<p>In my house, we have an old system where the cold water as it comes in is split in two, one half goes straight to the taps and the other goes to a header tank in the attic, which is responsible for keeping a big <a href="https://www.thegreenage.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/630x630_1369408950_hot-water-tank.jpg?swg_a2bc=1" target="_blank">insulated tank</a> topped up with water. That tank is heated by the heating system in the house that also runs the radiators, and that tank supplies your hot water taps in the house</p>
<p>In that situation, you only have as much hot water as is in that tank, and as soon as you start using it, it's getting topped up by the cold water off the mains, bringing the temp down. </p>
<p>The modern solution of having water heated on demand as it comes in is way better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to be a continuous column of water. If you have 1L in a container 10m in the air, the pressure is only relative to the bottom of the container. Now, let’s assume you have an infinitely small tube at the bottom of the container that runs all the way to the ground, the water pressure will be the depth of the container plus the depth (height) of the tube.</p></div>		</li>
