			<div class="markdown"><p>Additive Vs subtractive colour.</p>
<p>So with blue paint for example in white light, which contains all wavelengths of light. It hits the paint and it absorbs every wavelength of light apart from blue which it reflects back at you. If you add in a colour that isn't blue it'll absorb those blue wavelengths as well and you'll get a darker colour because more and more wavelengths are being absorbed by the paint</p>
<p>Screens work through additive colour. So each pixel has a red, green and blue light in it. So instead of different wavelengths being absorbed they stack up on top of eachother. If you add &quot;all&quot; the wavelengths back together its white again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Displays that produce light typically use Red, Green, and Blue as primary colors. But printed images are typically made with Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow (and also Black because it's easier and better looking to just have it available directly than combining the three others, but that does make black also)</p>
<p>In the RGB system, CMY are the secondary colors: B+G=C, R+B=M, and R+G=Y. And White is R+G+B</p>
<p>However in the CMY system, RGB are the secondaries: M+Y=R, C+Y=G, and C+M=B.<br />
It might make more sense if you think of it as subtraction from white -- which it is, these are called the subtractive colors and work by absorbing the color they aren't any of, and reflecting/transmitting what's left -- such as White minus Cyan (absorbs red) and minus Magenta (absorbs green) = Blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For additive color mixing (screens) the three colors are red, green, and blue (RGB) and them all together (turn pixels on) and you get white. With subtractive color mixing (light reflecting off of paper - colors used for printing) the colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow add them all together (subtract more color from the reflected light) and you get black. Since the dyes arenâ€™t perfect a black ink is added to make better blacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still the same concept. The screen still ends up emitting the same light. Whether you turn a light on or off, or whether you open or close a hatch to let the perpetually on light through, the end result is that light coming towards your eyes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh, so that's why the primary colors in screens are RGB instead of CMY!</p></div>		</li>
