			<div class="markdown"><p>It's similar to sleep apnea. </p>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea is basically choking from your tongue in your sleep, until rising CO2 &amp; falling O2 cause you to wake up enough to move your tongue and breathe again. You'll then fall back asleep.</p>
<p>Central sleep apnea amounts to &quot;forgetting&quot; to breathe, again, until rising CO2 &amp; falling O2 cause you to wake up enough to remember to breathe again, and then fall back asleep.</p>
<p>For both kinds of sleep apnea, people may wake up 30-60 times per hour, causing a big change in &quot;sleep architecture.&quot; They may often be really tired &amp; sleepy all the time because they don't &quot;sleep well.&quot;</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Normal &quot;sleep architecture&quot; has alternating periods of moderate and deep sleep in the beginning of the night, then alternating periods of moderate and REM (dreaming) sleep, until they wake up. People generally only remember dreaming if they wake up during REM sleep. If you wear a Fitbit on your wrist, you can get diagrams showing when you have deep, moderate and REM sleep overnight.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Back to coughing, if you can't breathe well enough in your sleep without coughing, your body will wake up, you'll cough, and fall back asleep. If the coughing is really severe, you may wake up enough that you realize you're awake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without a sleep monitor, it would be hard to tell the difference, but coughing will come with an arousal, similar to sleep apnea. Apnea sufferers can wake up many times per hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My lungs weren't good as a child. Suffered from asthma, bronchitis, all that shit.</p>
<p>I remember once I was having a nightmare. A dinosaur came in my room and was about to eat me. Then to my relief, my mom woke me up and asked if I was okay because I was coughing really badly.</p>
<p>I don't remember coughing, and I don't think I &quot;woke up&quot; with each cough I took since my dream played out pretty smoothly. So I think people do and can cough in their sleep.</p></div>		</li>
