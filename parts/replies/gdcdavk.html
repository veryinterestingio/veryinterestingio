			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually another big part of the variable speeds of old film that's been digitized.</p>
<p>Before frame speeds were standardized (although saying that, I deal with footage that get shot at everything from 15 fps [frames per second] to 120 or so), the camera operator would hand crank the footage through the camera. The idea is the projector would try and project at that same relative speed and any difference in speed would be unnoticeable.</p>
<p>By the mid-twenties, film cameras could definitely film at 24 or more fps, but what would happen was movie theaters realized that if they sped the footage up, they could do maybe 6 screenings a day instead of 5 and make more $$.</p>
<p>Seeing this happen, filmmakers intentionally slowed their filming speeds down to prevent this from happening, and it became a sort of vicious cycle to the point where footage might be coming in a 15 fps. Later when those film prints were digitized at 24 fps, they look speed up. And that doesn't even account for comedy/action movies, who might undercrank to make an action scene or comedic chase seem that much more frantic.</p>
<p>With the advent of sound, theaters and producers finally had to standardize the fps, otherwise stuff would be out of sync with the audio, that and just the general movement towards standardization and away from the 'Wild West' era of filmmaking got us to our current accepted frame rates (which I could go into, but it would take 20 more paragraphs).</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not capitalism, this is having some manure for a brain. If the money is not good enough for the product - you can always set the price higher instead of scamming people. If you have no basic human decency - just rob and steal - why produce anything?</p>
<p>It's so good we have some standards now.</p></div>		</li>
