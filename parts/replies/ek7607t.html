<p>The seminal work on Rotating Figures of Equilibrium was written by Chandrasekhar, and can be accessed <a href="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1964ApNr....9..323C/0000323.000.html" target="_blank">here</a>, if anyone's up for a very technical read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, Astromike!</p>
<p>I have a related question that maybe someone with more experience can answer. Recently, we discovered that the two lobes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(486958\)_2014_MU69" target="_blank">Ultima Thule</a> are flat. Like, crazy flat. Much more oblate than a planet could get. Obviously, small asteroids are not fluid, so it's expected that some of them have weird shapes. But still, the lobes look very round, making me think that their shape has something to do with equilibrium states, either now or when they were forming. Do you have any idea how they could get so flat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So only one of the two lobes (the larger) is really unusually flat. This information is less than two months old, and I don't think a convincing explanation has been put forth just yet. That said, I think you're right on both counts: Ultima Thule is nowhere near large enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, and even if it were, we shouldn't expect such a shape to arise from fast rotation.</p>
<p>A compelling hypothesis I haven't seen explored is that the shape could be an end-result of collisions. The evidence strongly suggests that collision events are numerous in the Kuiper Belt based on the distribution of object sizes, which is close to an R^-4 power law (if one object is 1800 km, there are roughly 2^4 = 16 objects that are 900 km, 3^4 = 81 objects that are 600 km, 4^4 = 256 objects that are 450 km, etc.), and we generally believe that kind of population can only arise from numerous collisions grinding down each other's sizes. Maybe the unusual flatness of Ultima Thule's larger lobe is the result of being a collisional shard rather than a primordial shape?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this does seem to  be the best answer.</p>
<p>It also shows that we've come a long way since this book was written (1953). Hal Clement (and at some point MIT) did do the calculations to make sure this world would be (theoretically) possible.</p>
<p>Clement did say he made a mistake; The G forces at the poles are not 665 G but &quot;only&quot; 275 G.</p>
<p>Anyway: Thanks again.</p>
<p>PS: For those that like to read hard science fiction that focuses more on the world itself and a bit less on the story, although a bit outdated this is definitely a must read in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>giving it a higher angular momentum than any other large object we know in the solar system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh? Angular momentum scales with Iw = c m R^2 w where c is some shape-dependent prefactor. Jupiter has 470,000 times the mass of Haumea and 60 times the radius, using the largest of the three axes of Haumea. Its angular velocity is more than 1/3 of the angular velocity of Haumea. Its density is less uniform than Haumea's, but that is a detail that doesn't cancel the factor 500 million in the other components.</p>
<p>Did you mean angular velocity? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fast_rotators_(minor_planets\)" target="_blank">2014 JK_80 is a 200 km diameter object with a rotation period of just one hour</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh yeah, probably. Thanks.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That's big but maybe not big enough. The point is to look at <em>fluid</em> objects. 200 km is a little on the small side to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, right? If it was spinning that fast when it cooled, then it might still have that prolate shape though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is still very remarkable because one hour is faster than the orbital period above its surface. The 200 km object is under internal strain in two dimensions. Yes, it can't be in hydrostatic equilibrium - it would fall apart.</p></div>		</li>
