			<div class="markdown"><p>A while back I seemed to recall reading about bio labs stopping any reconstruction of sequences that <em>might</em> indicate an attempt to replicate one of the Avian flu strains. That strain in birds was fatal, but for us (due to temperature) it was further up in the chest.  </p>
<p>There was some sequence difference though that if <em>that</em> portion got exchanged, it would work in the body deeper in the chest and be highly fatal.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Unfortunately searching for that information now runs into a smack of conspiracy theories and useless hits- so if this is ringing any bells (and I'm not spouting off nonsense) I'd love to know if this memory is trie or not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Silly memory process.</p></div>		</li>

It discusses some of the sequence difference research that occurred after the virus was recovered from a deceased person's tissues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When multiple influenza strains infect the same cell, big segments of the viral genome from different strains can recombine into a new virus. This process, called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenic_shift" target="_blank">antigenic shift</a>, is why new flu strains can emerge so suddenly. The random accumulation of mutations is called antigenic drift and occurs more slowly and steadily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partly right but it’s important to add that influenza viruses can reassort without leading to antigenic shift. Of their 8 gene segments, only 2 influence antigenic shift, but any or all of the eight can reassort and potentially change the personality of the virus, including its ability to infect new species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to see if I’m understanding this correctly - does the mutation happen, basically, one time, in one host’s cells, and then just become the dominant strain out from there?  I can’t imagine it happening simultaneously in two different hosts likely, but I still want to be sure I’m understanding</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume this would occur in cases where people (or more specifically, one or more of their cells) were infected by both viruses at the same time, leading to all sorts of recombination possibilities between the two strains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 viruses need to infect the same cell. While the hijacked cell machinery replicates the viruses, genes have a possibility of being 'reassorted' i.e swapped from one virus to another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fort Dix in New Jersey had a H1N1 outbreak in 1976 that infected less than 20 people. During the winter of 1977-78, there was the Russian H1N1 pandemic. That pandemic was nearly identical to flu samples from the 50's and this pandemic led to the endemic circulation of H1N1 until 2009 when the triple reassortant H1N1 emerged from swine in Mexico and pushed out the already circulating H1N1.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also wanted to say there are several theories of why H1N1 remerged in the 1970's. My preferred theory is that in response to the 1976 H1N1 outbreak, vaccination programs decided to include H1N1 in an upcoming flu vaccine. To do that, scientists started creating vaccines from H1N1 samples from the 50's. Due to poor lab practice, scientists accidentally let the flu escape and since anyone in their 20's or younger had never been exposed to H1N1, these escaped viruses swept through the younger population causing the 1977-78 pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis and live attenuated vaccine programs in China and Russia suggest labs in these countries were responsible for the H1N1 re-emergence.</p>
