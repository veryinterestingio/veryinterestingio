			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It is a collection of data compiled on March 17th for a subset of deceased patients (~17% of the total) from Italy.</p>
<p>It basically says that as of now, almost all of the deceased had previous health conditions (76% had high blood pressure, 35% had diabetes, 20% had had a cancer in the last 5 years and so on). Median age is over 80 and apparently men are far more likely to die than women.</p>
<p>Of the few young patients who died (aged around 30) all had serious pre-existing conditions -obesity, diabetes, heart disease, liver disease and so on.</p>
<p>What this means is that, as of now, the healthcare system is holding and only the most fragile are diyng in droves (to the point this night in Bergamo it was necessary to load dozens of coffins on army trucks to drive them to crematoriums around the country, as the city's graveyards are all full).</p>
<p>If we lose the battle and our hospitals are overloaded because we can't expand them quick enough while we try to slow the contagion rates with the lockdown, those stats are gonna change drastically.</p>
<p>Please, stay home.</p></div>		</li>
