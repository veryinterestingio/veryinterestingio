			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get something called phlebitis, meaning inflammation of the blood vessel. It can be mechanical, infections or chemical. Mechanical would be the plastic cannula rubbing on the vein, chemical would be a medication irritating the vein, and infection is exactly that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, I’ve never heard the term “tired”, but it’s more like your vein gets irritated. It’s still a functional IV site but it hurts so we’re happy to move it so you’re more comfortable. A lot of medications can irritate your veins and give a burning sensation. Sometimes those medications and fluids can also infiltrate and actually be pumping into the area around your vein rather than into it and that is another reason it would hurt and you’d need another IV site. Hope this helps you understand! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a planned 5 day hospital stay after surgery extended to 4 weeks after internal bleeding, and pretty much a few days after admission, they were taking blood through the back of my hands (nurse couldn't find veins in either elbow - after 3-4 sticks on both sides). Finally they inserted a PICC line because they needed me to stop drinking completely. It seems that veins do get &quot;used&quot; up after (not a long) while.</p></div>		</li>
