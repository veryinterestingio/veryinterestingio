<p>I've always wondered if that was actually true.  Has anyone ever definitively proven (or disproven) it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Identical twins, who are exactly the same in every other way, would be most likely to have identical fingerprints, but they don't. And are usually not as identical as you may first think, just very very very much the same. Each will be a little different than the other, kind of like knowing that your toy isn't someone else's toy, because there are tiny differences. Your toy may have a scratch here that their's doesn't, yours isn't missing a sticker, but their's is, all kinds of little things that make two things that look the same, but just a little bit different. Identical twins, while very very similar and exactly the same in some ways, will be just a little bit different in other ways. One may have a scar from doing something the other one didn't, one may have a freckle the other one doesn't, one may be nicer than the other one, one may be interested in something the other one doesn't care about at all. </p>
<p>Fingerprints are like those toys. Some may be very very very much the same, but they would still be different. There would always be just a little bit of a difference if you looked really really closely. It's possible that you wouldn't immediately see the difference, but there will be one, even if you can't see it. Would it be possible for two fingerprints to be &quot;close enough&quot; to make you think they are the same? Absolutely.  And a fingerprint sensor for a phone may do just that, it's not as good as a person at seeing, and it's not seeing as much of a fingerprint as a person could see, so it's possible for two people to be close enough that the phone thinks their fingerprints are the same. But it would be really really hard to find two people who are close enough and you wouldn't be likely to find two people who are exactly the same, just like those toys.</p></div>		</li>
