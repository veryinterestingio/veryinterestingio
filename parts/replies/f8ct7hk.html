			<div class="markdown"><p>No, what they mean is say you have your thermostat in the center of the room set for 70 F.</p>
<p>If you have heating on then it will wait for temp at the thermostat to drop below 70 F before turning on. But when the thermostat reads 69 F turning on the heat, where you're sitting on the couch may already be at 67 F.</p>
<p>If you have heating on then it waits for the temp to exceed 70 F to turn on the air conditioning. So when the thermostat reads 71 F your spot on the couch may read 73 F.</p>
<p>The temp comparison is not 70 F to 70 F, its 67 F to 73 F, which is a noticeable difference.</p>
<p>So when you set your thermostat dont think of it as one point to be at. Think of it as a range. When heating the actual average temp will be cooler than the set point. And when cooling the actual average temp will be warmer.</p>
<p>So if you want it to be 70 F at all times then you should set it for something like 68 F in the summer and 72 F in the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I'm about to say applies most obviously to central HVAC, but there is some of this going on with any system.</p>
<p>Let's say your thermostat is in a hallway in the middle of the house set to 25C. You're sitting in your room with exterior walls and a window.</p>
<p>Let's say it's summer. Your AC runs until the thermostat in the middle of the house reads 25C, then shuts off. So far so good. Over the next hour, your room, with the exterior walls and window, starts taking in heat from outside. That heat travels through the house slowly, so maybe your room gets up to 28C before the thermostat in the middle gets to 26C, at which point it turns on and brings the temperature back down.</p>
<p>In winter, same thing with cold: your heater runs until the thermostat in the middle of the house reads 25C, then shuts off. Over the next hour, your room, with the exterior walls and window, starts taking in cold from the outside. The cold travels through the house slowly , so maybe your room gets down to 22C before the thermostat in the middle gets down to 24C, at which point it turns on and brings the temperature back up.</p>
<p>If your setup has the thermostat, HVAC output, and you in the same room, these effects will be less pronounced, but they will still be in play. On top of that there's the impact (mentioned above) of the temperature of the air coming from the HVAC system blowing on you, which also influences the perceived temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air conditioning isnt just changing the temperture, it is also changing the moisture levels in air known as humidity.</p>
<p>24°c with low humidity will feel very different than 24°c with high humidity.</p></div>		</li>
