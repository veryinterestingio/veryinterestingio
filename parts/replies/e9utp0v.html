			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really only a half truth. The use of the term “climate change” has been very interchangeable with “global warming” since the inception of the idea. The shift was also already happening by the time Lutz used it, but Lutz might have accelerated its use over the term “global warming”. Both sides have shown the term preference over the other for their own reasons.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Climate Policy Analyst here. This is the only correct answer. Frustrating that it's not at the top. </p>
<p>Warming seemed one directional with a negative connotation and would frighten people into action that was counter to GOP goals. Climate Change sounded more benign and natural, so they reframed how we talk about it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied climate change for a while, my understanding is that “climate change” encompasses things like changing precipitation patterns, changing wind patterns, ocean acidification, etc. </p>
<p>Of course the root cause of the climate change is global warming due to increased carbon in the atmosphere, but the terms specifically refer to different phenomena </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, climate change helps describe the bigger picture related to climate forcing, like changes in the hydrologic cycle. But that's not why the phrase was invented. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an interesting twist to this too.  When it's a warming trend, it's &quot;climate change&quot; but when there's any kind of record <em>cold</em>, it is referred to global warming.</p>
<p>&quot;Heat wave and hurricanes!&quot; the topic becomes climate change.</p>
<p>&quot;Record cold at these research stations!&quot; the topic becomes 'so much for &quot;global warming&quot;, amirite?'</p></div>		</li>

<p>Conservative strategist Frank Lutz pushed the idea of calling it climate change instead of global warming because climate change sounds less scary and can be conflated with historic changes.</p>

<p>&quot;The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&quot; came out in 1992. Frank Luntz wrote his memo in 2002, ten years later.</p>
<p>A google books phrase search doesn't suggest any clear increase in the spread of the phrase following the Lutz memo:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No-one said that Lutz invented the phrase. It was indeed used very interchangeably with global warming to discuss climate forcing and disruption. But it was for political aims that conservatives reframed the conversation to favor the more benign sounding language. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like in 50 years, Frank Lutz is going to be that guy that history podcasts do a show about because nobody has ever heard of him, but his impact on the world was to cause unimaginable damage.  I imagine he’ll be like Fritz Haber is now.</p></div>		</li>
