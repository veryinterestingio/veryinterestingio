			<div class="markdown"><p>For galaxies, you would generally see uncertainties on the order of a few km/s. This sounds like a lot, but is actually pretty accurate.</p>
<p>The most precise measurements I know of are those used to detect exoplanets. If you have a solar system, the star is not perfectly stationary at the center. Instead, it revolves around the center of mass, which is dominated by the star, but also accounts for the orbiting planets. As the planet orbits the star, the star wobbles a bit, and this can be observed. In this case, you can get velocities from this relativistic effect with an uncertainty below a meter per second. Yup, you read that right. From the wobble of the star, you can derive the mass and orbit of the orbiting planet.</p>
<p>Some measurements of the velocity of distant stars are literally more accurate than the average laser gun measurements a police officer performs to catch speeding cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This always baffles me. A star has letâ€™s say 8 fairly massive planets orbiting around it. Maybe two planets have a somewhat synchronized orbit, maybe one planet has an orbit thatâ€™s completely opposite. How the hell can they tell how many planets there are, much less their individual sizes, distances, and orbital speeds? Wouldnâ€™t one massive planet with a distant orbit have a similar gravitational effect as a smaller planet that orbits much closer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also observe changes in the amount of light received by the star over time to determine how often it orbits, like when a rock is thrown in front of a flashlight and you can see it cut the light in its path. The frequency over which the light keeps dipping tells us how long it takes the planet to orbit the star</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Answered a different way, exoplanet hunters are looking for pretty small cyclic changes in the velocity of a star as the gravity of an orbiting planet pulls on them.</p>
<p>This change is often a few meters per second. You can measure star movements that are about walking speed.</p>
<p>Without spectroscopy astronomers would know a lot less about the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The estimates are constrained by the resolution of your observations. For example, Lyman alpha radiation has a line center at 1216 Angstrom. Your estimate for the receding speed is far more accurate if your spectroscopic bandwidth is 10 Angstrom than if it is 100 Angstrom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am always amazed at the ability to take the precise measurements of objects that are light years away when in the time required to take your measurement, the platform your equipment is built on has moved due to earth's rotation and orbit and the suns movement and while we are at it, lets throw in problems with speed measurement due to relativity based on gravity and velocity. This is not a trivial problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think part of OPâ€™s question (or at least how I interpret it because I have this question) is how do we know itâ€™s actually caused by expansion, and not say, a redshift caused by orbits of star systems, galaxies, and clusters. Put another way, how do we know that our observable universe isnâ€™t part of a larger structure which has an elliptical orbit (on an unimaginable scale) where we just canâ€™t see the blue shifts from distant objects?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd need a pretty convincing theory as to why all the blue-shifted objects are somehow invisible. Otherwise expansion is more plausible, and the simplest explanation is usually correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can see everything within the &quot;observable&quot; universe. That is, up to the distance that corresponds to the age of the universe at the speed of light (plus the expansion of space). The further away something is, the further ago we see it, because of how long it's taken light to arrive.</p>
<p>The real kicker is that there can't be any effect on what we can see that originates outside of the observable universe - as was recently detected and proved, gravity also moves at the speed of light. So anything that is say 1 million lightyears from the edge of the observable universe, we would be seeing it 1 million years after the big bang, which means it only shows gravitational effects from that million years - which because of gravity moving at the speed of light, means only things within 1 million light years of it. It's 1 million light years from the edge of the observable universe - so even &quot;second hand&quot; the effect has to be within our observable universe.</p>
<p>So there can be no larger effect outside our observable universe that affects anything we see, as it wouldn't have had time to propogate to us yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>good catch, about what OP's question could have additionally meant. most folks here are missing it, as did I, until I read your comment. </p>
<p>we know that the redshifts are due to expansion because the farther away an object is, the more redshifted we find it to be. further, the relationship between the distance to an object, and the speed it is receding at (as determined from the amount of redshift), is linear.</p>
<p>expansion is the simplest explanation here because if each unit volume in the universe is expanding at roughly the same rate, then something that is 2000 length units away from you would recede twice as fast from you than something that is 1000 length units from you, because there's twice as much space contributing to the total expansion between you and the object. </p>
<p>this is where the old example of an inflating balloon helps. take a balloon, and use a sharpie to mark many dots on its surface. now as you start filling up the balloon, then you'd find that each unit area of the balloon's surface is expanding at a roughly similar rate. however, you'll also find that the speed of separation between any pair of dots turns out to be proportional to (i.e. a linear multiple of) the distance between them. </p>
<p>does that make sense? </p>
<p>ðŸŽˆ</p>
<p>PS: upon closely reading OP's question again, it seems that they weren't asking about the reason for redshifting after all. oh well, in either case, yours was a good question too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve heard the balloon example before but really digging into the proportional expansion made it click; thank you!</p>
<p>Edit: to clarify, what Iâ€™ve taken from the balloon example before was the point of there being no one origin point for the universe because itâ€™s all expanding at the same rate, but I never really thought about how even the dots that are on the complete opposite side of the balloon would retain the same proportional distance due to expansion</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add some clarity, the fingerprint is the spectrum of wavelengths associated with the <del>element</del> photons emitted when electrons transition between orbitals in the element.     </p>
<p>IMO, what u/ExtonGuy added is important because:  </p>
<p>These transitions are almost always, at least statistically, discrete (don't ask, it's a can of worms that allows us to do every sciency measurement with electrons and photons and improves our lives drastically). The transitions which result in visible light emitted in line of sight can only come in certain sizes based on the number of electrons in any given atom.   </p>
<p>All stars are primarily Hydrogen being fused into Helium. All stars are primarily composed of only 1 electron and 2 electron elements. There are a limited number of electron transitions which are statistically probable with only 1 or 2 electrons. We should expect that all stars should have identical characteristic peaks associated with the 1 electron and 2 electron elements, but they don't and red shift explains why they don't.</p></div>		</li>
