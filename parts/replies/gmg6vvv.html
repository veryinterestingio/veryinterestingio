			<div class="markdown"><p>All of these are great explanations. One addition; time after application. When a tape is first applied, adhesion is &quot;X&quot;. That tape can be removed and moved immediately, but the adhesion increases over time as the chemical penetration occurs. Wetting, if you prefer. I think the word <em>tape</em> is too generic, as has been pointed out. It's chemistry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much force is needed to pull tape off also depends on <em>how</em> you pull the tape up, because that changes how much area is actually under load.</p>
<p>Peeling off a bandaid or a sticky note, there is only a thin strip of it that is actually taking the load of pulling it up at any given time, and so the force needed is quite small. If instead you tried pulling along the entire surface at once, say trying to pull apart two objects stuck together with double-sided tape, that is going to be a lot harder than peeling off a piece of the same tape.</p></div>		</li>
