			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually find that the 3 or 4 star reviews are the most constructive and realistic. Nobody is going to pay for a 3 star review but I'll buy a 3 star product if I'm ok with the negatives that made it lose 2 stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say this. It is also helpful because the reviewer will bring up good negative points that may be a deal breaker for you even if the product as a whole is good. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the median ground! </p>
<p>I do the same thing in trying to find the one person that had something reasonable go wrong and see how the case was handled. I’m understanding in the fact that no product is absolutely perfect, however I’d like to buy from a company with good customer support. </p>
<p>In addition to fake or paid for reviews, there are honeymoon reviews. The product is amazing for 1-2 weeks- leaves amazing review. The product fails week 3 doesn’t care enough to go back and change their review. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always said “medium ground.” Like with “happy medium.” I know what a median is, so I can see why that would work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that is true, I think more people take the time to fake the positive reviews more than the negative ones. It is also easy to spot the fake negative reviews when they just say the product is bad without any other info. If on the other hand, it's a fake negative review that is also constructive then you should be able to find the same review from other sources. The thing to look for here is the constructive part and from as many sources as you can manage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, wanted to say that, but the comment was deleted.</p>
<p>Couple months ago I was buying a power supply unit for my PC, and I read reviews and comments under them on one online store, and there was a dude who kept saying &quot;that's a bad, low-quality PSU, buy that one instead&quot;. Then, after checking like 15 PSUs and seeing that dude all over them, I see a comment from someone else: &quot;stop saying all PSUs are bad, we know you work for another PSU company&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
