			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to this that your body isn't really capable of creating tons of situation-specific responses. You really just have the one main &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; response. While in situations like drowning or choking, freaking out might not be the best response, it most situations (explosions, attacked, etc.), &quot;freaking out&quot; and running away is a pretty good response most of the time. So your body has a response that works well &quot;most of the time&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I work with dog behavior and fawn is a lot more common than people think. I had a whole litter of dogs that inherited a strong fawn reaction to &quot;threats&quot;. They start licking everything around, roll on their side with legs splayed and sometimes pee.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fawn is not on the same level of the other three because it's a learned response based on experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why people like firefighters and military members are supposed to train continuously, so that when the adrenaline dump happens in a stressful situation you can fall back to your training. You don't need to think as much when you are trapped in a burning building or in a shootout if you have trained for those scenarios and can just fall back on what you know instinctually through training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Freezing can help a lot in a defensive attack from another animal (ie, mama bear protecting her cubs who only wants to neutralize the threat) but if it is attacking because it wants to kill and eat you then it's not the right response.</p></div>		</li>
