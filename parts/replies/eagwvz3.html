			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people don’t realize but Niagara Falls water flow is reduced at night during the winter months by joint Canadian/ US hydro authorities. </p>
<p>Another neat fact is that the generators in place there were designed and built by Nicolas Tesla. They have never been replaced in over 100 years. The generators were proof that AC was superior to Edison’s push for DC power systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Niagara Falls is reduced all the time.  It's only flowing at like 50% capacity even at peak times.  The flow is further reduced as you mentioned below that.</p>
<p>This is done in part to slow down the natural erosion.  The falls can also be turned off completely if absolutely necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flow is really only reduced to divert the flow to the hydro power stations. Tourism is the only reason they don't divert it all. This is why the falls have higher flow rates during the day and during peak seasons:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, since Tesla’s introduction of long distance transmission of electricity via alternating current, businesses didn’t need to relocate close to electrical sources.  The initial construction of what became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Canal" target="_blank">Love Canal</a> was cancelled after only a mile was dug.  The unused canal was turned into a landfill, filled with poisons, plowed over and sold to the state, and they built a school on it, poisoning many many people.  It became the first Superfund contamination site. </p>
<p>Interesting place to visit if you’re in the area.  I prefer to visit the Canadian side anyway. There’s a statue of Tesla. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Canadian side is great. I really like the U.S. side though. It is more sprawling and park-like rather than being squeezed between the road the river. The each his or her own though. The Falls are an amazing site. Imagine seeing it when it was wilderness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in Chicago until I was seven, when we moved to South Dakota. I was surprised that the small lakes out west didn't have waves: Lake Michigan did, after all. It wasn't till I was a little older that I realized that it took a really big lake (or an ocean, of course) to have consistent waves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was utterly amazing the first time I saw one of the Great Lakes. I live on the Atlantic coast, so I didn't think a big pool of water would be anything special. It had waves and I couldn't see the other side. It really is a sight to take in when you realize it's a lake that's big enough to lose ships. It wasn't even the biggest one. It was Eerie, which is the second smallest at 9,910 square miles. Superior is 31,700 square miles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's never something I thought about growing up 20mins from Ontario, and with a boat. But yeah its basically like looking out at the ocean I guess. The great lakes are pretty damn big. Under the right conditions, from rochester, you can see the reflection of Toronto and the tops of the tallest buildings, but you'll need binoculars and it doesnt happen too often.</p></div>		</li>
