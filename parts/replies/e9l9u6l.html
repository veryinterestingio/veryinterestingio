			<div class="markdown"><p>This might not be the rabbit hole you're looking for, but there's actually a great deal of emerging science on cooking techniques with starches and how different techniques yield different caloric quantities and proteins. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/25/scientists-have-figured-out-a-simple-way-to-cook-rice-that-dramatically-cuts-the-calories/" target="_blank">Here's an interesting write-up on rice.</a> There's a lot of food scientists trying to find ways to make staples more vitamin and nutrient-dense and it's crazy that it seems like cooking methods are really early in their food science exploration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IDK if you see the replies but you could eat raw potato, but it's really not palatable. The toxins are in the vine and leaves, and to a degree in and around the skin if the potato was either not grown properly or allowed to sit in sunlight a while. Even then if you have green potatoes it's not the eating them raw that's so bad, it's eating them at all, but the worst that usually happens is a stomach ache anyway.</p></div>		</li>
