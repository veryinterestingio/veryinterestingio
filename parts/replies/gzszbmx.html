			<div class="markdown"><p>Chip-grade silicon wafer is very expensive.   The number of dies you can get per wafer (the yield) is a major production efficiency metric.  Depending on the defect rate and the numbers they are trying to manufacture, they sometimes have disabled cores and binned parts. But it is never the case that there is a big chip and empty space on it. Every square mm is precious. A chip intended to be smaller is smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silicons are semiconductors, so they can short current, or not, according to an external interaction. You can shape silicon in a way that it becomes able to do that as a small transistor (a switch, with a button actuated by an electric current instead of your finger), and found them all clunked together in a defined, complex matrix architecture so that they create logical functions (like and, or, xor, this kinda thing). Thus creating very small components like an Harvard architecture, a DAC, and other functions that you would use commonly in a cpu, link them all together, <em>print</em> the whole thing, and you have your cpu die.</p>
<p>This cpu is then basically a Turing machine with extra stuff, now the only thing left is to to create programs (softwares) to make it do whatever you like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silicon is simply used to display 1 and 0. You don't have to use silicon for that, it's just the most efficient way to do it at this time.</p>
<p>Basically, all a computer does is performing an addition between two binary numbers. Even when a computer divides or substract numbers - it does this by performing an addition (which takes more steps but is mathematically possible).</p>
<p>If you want to see how a computer performs such an addition at the most basic level, check <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Halfadder.gif" target="_blank">this</a> out.</p>
<p>The computer takes two single digit numbers (which there are two, 0 and 1) and adds them together. The result is either 00 (0 in decimal), 01 (1 in decimal) or 10 (2 in decimal).</p>
<p>It does this by using two different logic gates - XOR and AND. You can think of them as small devices which input two single binary digits (1 or 0) and output one single binary digit (again 1 or 0) - based on simple rules.</p>
<p>For example, when an AND logic gate receives two 1's it will display a 1, in every other case it will display a 0. That's its 'rule set'.</p>
<p>When a XOR gate receives a 1 and a 0 it will display a 1, in every other case it will display a 0.</p>
<p>With those simple rules an addition is possible, as you can see at the gif. And that's how computers fundamentally work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something that helps with understanding how we managed to get rocks to think using lightning is to understand abstraction. This is largely the software side of things though (the side I actually kinda know).</p>
<p>Abstraction is the idea that you build progressively less complex systems (less complex in the sense that they're easier to interface with) on top of complex systems in order to interface with a complex system more simply.</p>
<p>The layers might look a bit like this: the bit layer (1s and 0s), machine code (which let's the computer understand instructions), C (a low level programming language that allows you to convert to machine code), and Python (a high level programming language who's main interpreter is written in C (IIRC)). There's probably more layers.</p>
<p>So we took a fairly simple concept (flipping bits to effectively represent yes/no) and abstracted it to the point that it's relatively understandable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are silicon wafers really that expensive? I'm sure it's a significant percentage of the production cost (&gt;= 10%) but I would've thought that the largest cost would be the processing (etch/CVD/metallization/etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The majority of the cost is in the silicon itself. The package it's placed on (where the empty space is), is on the order of a dollar. Particularly for the motherboards, it's financially advantageous to have as much compatibility with one socket as possible, as the socket itself costs significantly more, with great sensitivity to scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the things not mentioned also is the failure rate. Each chip after being made is QC (quality controlled) and checked to make sure all the cores work. I remember when AMD moved from Silicon Valley to Arizona they had operational issues since the building was new and when you are making things many times smaller than your hair, everything like humidity/ temperature/ barometric temperature must be accounted for.</p>
<p>I believe this was when the quad core chip was the new &quot;it&quot; in processing power but AMD had issues and I believe 1 in 10 actually successfully was a quad core and 8/10 only 3 cores worked so they rebranded them as &quot;tri core&quot; technology.</p>
<p>With newer and newer processors you are on the cutting edge of things failing and not working. Hence the premium cost and higher failure rates. With lower chips you work around &quot;known&quot; parameters that can be reliably made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tighter and smaller you pack in the chips the higher the error rate. A giant wafer is cut with a super laser so the chips directly under the laser will be the best and most precisely cut. Those end up being the &quot;K&quot; or overclockable versions. The chips at the edge of the wafer have more errors and end up needing sectors disabled and will be sold as lower binned chips or thrown out all together. </p>
<p>So when you have more space and open areas in low end chips you will end up with a higher yield of usable chips. Low end chips may have a yield rate of 90% while the highest end chips may have a yield rate of 15% per wafer. It takes a lot more attempts and wafers to make the same amount of high end chips vs the low end ones thus raising the costs for high end chips.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cutting the wafer is not a source of defects in any meaningful way.  The natural defects in the wafer itself cause the issues.  Actually dicing the chips rarely costs a usable die these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the laser that does that, it's the purity of the crystal that the water is cut from that can vary across it's radius. Very slightly less pure = more defects that can interfere with the creation and operation of the transistors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was wondering if from a business standpoint is the profit margin proportional or do they market up the high end chips to achieve an even greater margin or conversely sell the Low end Chips at lower prices to drive sale volume? 😌</p></div>		</li>
