			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't exactly to the question but related interesting information from a book called Operating Manual For Starship Earth: When a chick is growing inside an egg it's slowly consuming the nutrients inside of that egg, eventually become larger and larger, and just as the nutrients run out its then strong enough and big enough to &quot;accidentally&quot; break the shell. It's a larger piece on determinism vs free-will and the author used this as an example, and a really cool book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know we're admiring nature here rather than eating it, I just wanted everyone to know that air pocket is what you carefully pierce before cooking your egg, so the hot water goes between the layers, loosening the egg from its shell and making it 1000x easier to peel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's always at the butt of the egg, and you can use a pushpin or needle, just only stab deep enough to make a tiny hole in the outer shell. if you stab deeper, you risk piercing the next layer, which is a thin membrane.</p>
<p>and if you're cooking eggs to save for later, don't use a grimy piercing thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds specifically store waste as urea which isn’t readily dissolvable in liquid (including egg whites) and also a much smaller amount than mammal pee. Bird pee is less toxic than mammal pee. Some land laying reptiles also use this. </p>
<p>Eggs laid in water are a much more open system</p>
