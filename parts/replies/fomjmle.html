<p>Cats are riddles wrapped in enigmas, forever unknowable.</p>
<p>However, cats do not miaow to each other after being kittens. They only do it for humans. Put a load of cats together and they just don't communicate that way. So it would be surprising if they did recognise themselves (or each other). But see my previous point, as cats are mysterious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I saw one video where it really looked like a cat passed the mirror test, but it might have been a coincidence. If there are some cats that definitely 100% do pass it, then that is super interesting! </p>

<p>Anyway, yea. Cats are pretty interesting, aren't they?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know why that keeps getting perpetuated.  I hear my neighbors cats meowing at each other all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think most, if not all cats do recognize themselves in the mirror. Although it takes a few tries. Any small cat I've had who was initially introduced to a mirror would hiss at it at first, including a few times one of them spooked himself when he saw himself reflected in the window. But after that, I'm pretty sure they knew it was them. They never greet it the same way they greet a foreign cat. (Read: Poorly, for my current cats) They just don't pass the mirror test because they just plain don't care enough.</p>
<p>One cat I have is rather exceptional with mirrors, and loves to stare at himself for hours in the mirror. He'd also sometimes stare at Mirror Me. When I stared back at him, I'd lock eyes with Mirror Him for a few moments. And then he'd turn his head to stare straight at Real Me, because he knew I was looking at him. So I'm completely convinced he understood mirrors perfectly.</p></div>		</li>
