<p>They suggested I probably hadn’t had any good, deep sleep in years based on some of my other health indicators. </p>

<p>Could you elaborate on the health indicators? My husband is a loud snorer, doesn't have the best sleep habits, and I'm quite sure has apnea or something related. He doesn't show any other symptoms like sleep paralysis that is jerking him into action though, and he's always been very reluctant to go to the doctors for anything. But i do notice some small gradual decline of his health in the past 10 years or so.  I know individuals differ, but would love to be educated even if it's anecdotal to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>all of the major &quot;bad health&quot; symptoms get worse.  high blood pressure, gaining weight, higher blood sugar levels, risk for stroke goes up, head aches.  a general decline in body health like sore muscles wounds taking longer to heal.   mental health problems become more apparent, depression, anxiety, anger.   </p>
<p>many of these can also be signs of other issues and just older age. sleep apnea happens in older and over weight people, so does diabetes, diabetes can case depression and anger issues.  old age also involved with body not healing as effectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep that’s pretty much it. I was just about to turn 40 and all of the things mentioned above started happening to me. Even got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I thought I was just “getting old” but it turns out now, 5 years later, it was (mostly) not sleeping and ever since I got the CPAP I feel 10 years younger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a pretty standard dad bod, on the thinner side of normal. I live on a farm and get a couple hours of hard work every day and play softball. I got heavier when I was struggling with sleep and before I got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Doctor says he wants me to be at 190 and I’m currently sitting around 210.</p></div>		</li>
