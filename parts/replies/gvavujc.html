			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd add to that that the tongue basically stays in the mouth all the time. It knows the mouth intimately, whereas your finger is a bumbling outsider. It's like brushing your teeth with the wrong hand - one hand is just used to it and the other one isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my God I just had a memory of a childhood TV show called &quot;Hey Vern, it's Ernest!&quot; where Jim Varney plays his <em>own tongue</em> (in a recurring role) and in one skit he's watching his own finger try to dislodge some stuck food. The 90s were weird, lol.</p></div>		</li>
