			<div class="markdown"><p>A good chiropractor is literally just like a massage.  It helps temporarily, but makes no long term improvements.  There is a reason adjusting the spine is not done by doctors!  It’s not because they can’t, or because it’s a different type of medicine.... it’s because it’s not medicine.  You might go to a doctor , and they have no idea what your problem is.  They might recommend a chiropractor as a last ditch effort, like maybe they can do something weird to fix you... but if spinal adjustments were the normal treatment, doctors would be doing them..  just my take on it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your evidence for chiropractic manipulation causing stroke is exceptionally poor. This is an example of either cherry picking or reading a study and not understanding the value of study design. One of your pages is literally a list of anecdotes. all of the studies you linked are individual case studies.  Most of your research is also very old. Multiple larger and better designed studies (such as case-controls) have been done. As it stands, no research has ever demonstrated that chiropractic neck manipulation causes stroke. Ever. Here is the most up to date research on the topic:</p>
<p>A review from the Annals of Medicine, published in March of 2019:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... several extensive cohort studies and meta-analyses have found no excess risk of CAD resulting in secondary ischaemic stroke for chiropractic SMT compared to primary care follow-up. Similarly, retrospective cohort studies have reported no association with traumatic injury to the head or neck after SMT for neuromusculoskeletal pain. Invasive studies have further disproven any misconception as to whether VA strains during head movements, including SMT, exceed failure strains. No changes in blood flow or velocity in the VA of healthy young male adults were found in various head positions and during a cervical SMT. Thus, these studies support the evidence of spontaneous causality or minimally suggest a very low risk for serious AEs following SMT.</p>
<p><strong>In light of the evidence provided in this comprehensive review, the reality is (a) that there is no firm scientific basis for direct causality between cervical SMT and CAD; (b) that the ICA moves freely within the cervical pathway, while 74% of cervical SMTs are conducted in the lower cervical spine where the VA also moves freely; (c) that active daily life consists of multiple cervical movements including rotations that do not trigger CAD, as is true for a range of physical activities; and (d) that a cervical manipulation and/or grade C cervical mobilization goes beyond the physiological limit but remains within the anatomical range, which theoretically means that the artery should not exceed failure strain.</strong> These factors underscore the fact that no serious AE was reported in a large prospective national survey conducted in the UK that assessed all AEs in 28,807 chiropractic treatment consultations, which included 50,276 cervical spine manipulations [emphasis mine]</p>

<p>If we look back at other large-scale research, we see the same thing.</p>
<p>The Department of Neurosurgery at Penn state did a meta-analysis in February of 2016 which looked at 253 studies on cervical manipulation and VBA stroke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In spite of the very weak data supporting an association between chiropractic neck manipulation and CAD, and even more modest data supporting a causal association, such a relationship is assumed by many clinicians. In fact, this idea seems to enjoy the status of medical dogma. Excellent peer reviewed publications frequently contain statements asserting a causal relationship between cervical manipulation and CAD [4,25,26]. We suggest that physicians should exercise caution in ascribing causation to associations in the absence of adequate and reliable data. <strong>Medical history offers many examples of relationships that were initially falsely assumed to be causal [27], and the relationship between CAD and chiropractic neck manipulation may need to be added to this list.</strong>[emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What did they mean by &quot;even more modest data supporting a causal association&quot;?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found no evidence for a causal link between chiropractic care and CAD. This is a significant finding because belief in a causal link is not uncommon, and such a belief may have significant adverse effects such as numerous episodes of litigation.</p>

<p>2017 study examining 15,523 stroke cases. it said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found no excess risk of carotid artery stroke after chiropractic care. Associations between chiropractic and PCP visits and stroke were similar and likely due to patients with early dissection-related symptoms seeking care prior to developing their strokes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.strokejournal.org/article/S1052-3057(16)30434-7/fulltext?cc=y" target="_blank">http://www.strokejournal.org/article/S1052-3057(16)30434-7/fulltext?cc=y</a>=</p>
<p>2015 study, 1829 stroke patients studied over 3 years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found no significant association between exposure to chiropractic care and the risk of VBA stroke. We conclude that manipulation is an unlikely cause of VBA stroke. The positive association between PCP visits and VBA stroke is most likely due to patient decisions to seek care for the symptoms (headache and neck pain) of arterial dissection.</p>

<p>2015 study, 1,157,475 Medicare patients looked at in a massive retrospective cohort. The researchers actually found that the incidence of strokes were higher in people who saw a PCP rather than a chiropractor, but deemed it clinically insignificant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among Medicare B beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years with neck pain, incidence of vertebrobasilar stroke was extremely low. Small differences in risk between patients who saw a chiropractor and those who saw a primary care physician are probably not clinically significant.</p>

<p>All large-scale research demonstrates no causation, but we can look at studies on mechanism also:</p>
<p>A 2002 study, comparing strains necessary to cause a dissection vs strains sustained during a cervical manipulation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SMT resulted in strains to the VA that were almost an order of magnitude lower than the strains required to mechanically disrupt it. We conclude that under normal circumstances, a single typical (high-velocity/low-amplitude) SMT thrust is very unlikely to mechanically disrupt the VA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381972" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381972</a></p>
<p>Another study on mechanism, this one from the Journal of clinical biomechanics (2014). This study sought to assess the amount of force put on the vertebral artery during a cervical manipulation. The study found that the amount of force put on the vertebral artery during manipulation are not sufficient to cause a dissection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The results of this study suggest that vertebral artery strains during head movements including spinal manipulation, do not exceed published failure strains. This study provides new evidence that peak strain in the vertebral artery may not occur at the end range of motion, but rather at some intermediate point during the head and neck motion.</p>

<p>The evidence just isn't there. Maybe future research will find that cervical manipulation causes stroke, but to date, no research has even come close.</p></div>		</li>
