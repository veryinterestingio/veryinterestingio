			<div class="markdown"><p>Also epileptic. I've never had a seizure triggered specifically by flashing lights, but they can give me some pre-seizure sensations. I've always wondered whether it would cause one or not but I won't be testing it myself...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any photosensitivities that I know of, and I've never had a seizure, though I have passed out several times in my life (for various reasons)..</p>
<p>So.. What does it feel like?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It feels like an extremely unpleasant and dangerous stimulus that I need to remove immediately.    I would compare it to recoiling from being burned, or someone holding rubbing alcohol under your nose.   It can instantly turn me from a good mood to feeling weird and upset with confused thinking.   If it proceeds to a seizure then I wake up disoriented some time later.</p>
<p>It makes me sad that there is little awareness or attempts to accommodate this issue.   I do really appreciate it when a video gives me a warning about strobing.   I'm worried about that thing that some cell phones have which strobes the camera flash when there is an incoming text.   If that becomes popular I would have to leave civilization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I too have epilepsy, not photosensitive though, but that feeling before a seizure is awful. Like for a fraction of a second my legs feel like they lag behind my brain and I instantly get cold and terrified. Instincts say lie down immediately but I have ALWAYS kept it my biggest secret from people so admitting I feel weird is both awkward for me and frightening to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. An ex of mine has seizures and I would always do my best to accomdate. I actually got in trouble in school once because she started having a seizure as we were going to class and I refused to leave her side. I never got in trouble for that, even with all the yelling and posturing the staff were doing.</p>
<p>What's the best way to help someone who's having a seizure? I'd always give her water (to drink herself, not dumping it onto her face or anything) and just hold her hand tight. She told me that my talking to her helped, but it didn't seem to do much. Is it different person-to-person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any known triggers, it just happens sometimes. It's like I just pass out without warning or any sort of feeling to ready myself, and I just wake up all groggy and loopy. First few times it happened were all at work and my coworkers just said I stood there like I was dead to the world, would answer to questions like I undersood what they were saying, and then fall flat on the ground. Of course, I'd have no memory of that. Just wake up a little later confused af and sore all over.</p>
<p>Oh, and I wet myself. Great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dang. I have a history of sleepwalking, which feels similar because you say and do things that you don't remember, and wake up confused, slowly realizing you don't know where you are.</p>
<p>It would definitely be scary to have that happen somewhere besides home, during the daytime.</p>
<p>I've had one unexplained pass-out incident, as well, but that could have been anything. Though it was scary because I hit my head on a chair during my fall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it's like going numb.  Cognitively I feel kinda like I'm drunk (slower speech.  A pressure in the back of my head.  Confusion sets in.  Then I wake up with people standing over me very panicked (doesn't happen often).</p>
<p>If I can get away from the trigger early enough I'll be fine, maybe feel a little drained.  If I stay to long, but before I seize... It's worse.  I was watching a movie in the theater (Quarantine) and tried to tough out the flashes.  Eventually felt I needed a break, went to the public restroom and the next thing I know I'm waking up from the floor of the bathroom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, our eyelids aren't opaque against the general flashing of light, so that stinks.</p>
<p>It would be nice if you could have some completely blacked out sunglasses that you carry just in case.</p>
<p>For like.. if you were riding on a train, and the sun was streaming through the windows and flashing directly into your vision, being strobed by a fence or some posts or a bridge or something.</p>
<p>Situations where you just need to block something out temporarily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did as a child, but don’t now; since coming to the states and getting treatment (or growing out of it, the catalyst is not obvious to me.)</p>
<p>PM me if you don’t mind comparing notes.... I would, just out of curiosity. I don’t know anyone else (confessing to) epilepsy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew out of it. At some point I just took less and less medication and when I was about 12 I stopped completely. Never had any seizures after that. I also recently had an MRI and EEG done, and they couldn't find any evidence of epilepsy.</p></div>		</li>
