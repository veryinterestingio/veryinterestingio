			<div class="markdown"><p>Never watched Stargate but a guy told me all about it on our first date, and from that knowledge I can say that a lot of characters/races/plots in Stargate are retelling of mythical and historical characters and stories. Also there are a lot of philosophical nuances in the show. So I'd guess the answer to your question is yes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pretty much that is the premise of the show; the whole point is that all mythology is based on aliens and the show explains how the aliens made the mythology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>See every character/species/race in sci-fi and fantasy (even some horror) ever for examples of this.</p></div>		</li>
