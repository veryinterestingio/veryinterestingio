			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's true of any brain fundamentally unless you're accounting for hormonal regulation etc., and neutral networks are simulated and have only an abstract geometry made of links but not locations. The point is that the warped donut in a squid and the crusty and over-raised muffin in our heads don't share any structural or functional organization and don't break into the same parts - there's no cerebellum or cortex or whatnot in an octopus brain. And most invertebrates don't centralize as many functions to that one location as vertebrates do, either. It's all independent solutions to the same problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious what definition of brain you are applying here?  Even the most rigorous set of criteria I have encountered so far (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12523550/" target="_blank">Sarnat et al., Semin Pediatr Neurol. 2002.</a>) seem to be met by many flatworm and insect brains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then there's cephalopods.</p>
<p>Not the nautilus, which is probably about as aware as a sponge with googely eyes glued to it. It's well in the range of &quot;clusters of ganglia&quot;.</p>
<p>Maybe some squid, the esophageal ganglia ring can get pretty complex in larger species, notably humbolt.</p>
<p>Octopuses, especially the larger species, have definitely evolved proper &quot;brains&quot; from those esophageal ganglia, and is probably our best axample of what OP was originally getting at: convergent evolution of a self-aware and proper &quot;brain&quot; in a non-tetrapod.</p>
<p>Beyond what's been mentioned with nervous systems showing up pretty early in Animalia, cephalopod brains are about as close as we've encountered to &quot;intelligence&quot; evolving along a completely different lineage.</p></div>		</li>
