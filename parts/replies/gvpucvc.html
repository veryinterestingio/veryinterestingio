			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, just one point about that data though. It can be misconstrued to both mean it’s not dangerous to those groups when that ignores the hospitalization rate and the fact it’s still more deadly to those groups than other respiratory viruses.</p>
<p>Just my perspective as a nurse on a COVID unit. Too many people take that as “it’s not dangerous to young/healthy people” when the truth is “it’s not as dangerous if you’re young/healthy but still far more likely to kill you than the flu”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point, and it's not even taking into account nonfatal, but still very undesirable outcomes. A ventilator is not a minor hospital visit, even if you survive. There are people who experience long term effects and because it's a new disease there are many unknowns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where is your 1% death rate for those who are vaccinated come from? The initial trials had a 0% death rate - which was likely too low due to the size of the trial. In the US, the CDC stated that there were ~5800 breakthrough cases (where vaccinated people contracted COVID-19), of which 74 died - which would imply a ~0.1% death rate (and this figure may be high as well).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So far, there have been 74 deaths of people who have been fully vaccinated and tested positive for COVID afterwards (some of these aren’t a <em>result</em> of COVID, but they were 1. Fully Vaccinated 2. Contracted COVID after vaccinated 3. Died)</p>
<p>If we assume ALL of these deaths were 65+, that would be 74/23M fully vaccinated seniors = .0003% COVID death rate among fully vaccinated seniors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That number is a little misleading as it includes all deaths of people who both tested positive for covid, and died. At least nine of those deaths were completely unrelated to covid, for example: got into a car crash</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shouldn't you divide by all people diagnosed by covid-19 after vaccination instead to find death rate? Just using number of vaccinated people doesn't seem useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. You must consider death rates among total vaccinated because the vaccine protects from both infection and symptomatic infection. If you don't include all vaccinated people, you will miss people who never get sick because of the vaccine but would have died (statistically speaking) without the vaccine.</p>
<p>But you should also compare this to death rates among <em>all people</em> in the same age range pre-vaccinatiom because simply not getting sick also protects against death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number I gave provides a more accurate assessment of “real risk” to seniors who have been vaccinated. Since vaccines reduce transmission so much, you would be ignoring the bulk of the vaccine benefit by using breakthrough infections (~6000) as the denominator. </p>
<p>It would give you a number that tells you “IF a senior gets a breakthrough infection, what are their chances of dying”.... which is useful, but less practical IMO than “If a senior gets <em>vaccinated</em>, what are their chances of dying” - which is what OP asked</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number OP gave is a risk within the population itself, which is the answer to the question “of older folks who got the vaccine what percentage died of covid”. Which is a meaningful probability to compare against “of younger unvaccinated folks how many died of covid”. Basically you compare two populations on their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather than pester /u/angelamerkelsboner about sources, I checked into this myself. They seem to be fairly knowledgeable on this topic with accurate info.  Anyone curious about people who die after being fully vaccinated, you can read more info on the CDC site. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html</a></a></p>
<p>In the US, there were 7,157 of these &quot;breatkthrough infections&quot; reported as of 20th April, 2021. Of those, there were a total of 88 deaths. 88 deaths out of 87 million fully vaccinated people. So, essentially, that's a real life &quot;one-in-a-million&quot; type scenario.</p></div>		</li>
