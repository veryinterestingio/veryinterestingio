			<div class="markdown"><p>Your own sense of paranoia or heightened self consciousness can drive that bias and make you behave to look for eyes on you from people around you so if you’re very concerned about being looked at, you may be more likely to constantly scan around you which may in turn cause others to look at you because you’re acting like an owl spinning it’s head around and looking around more than others in the room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is also a good time to bring up Jungian synchronicity. When you only pay attention to hits, not the missses, you get a feeling someone is your guardian angel. this is the crux of most of science. You can't just dismiss the misses, you have to factor them into the total of hits/misses. As for synchronicity, jungs description is that things that seems really crazy coincidence are simply bound to happen once in a while, but you never notice when they don't</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of how I noticed a while ago that I 'always' look at the clock at a very specific same time (the numbers represent my birthday), but it soon dawned on me that I look at the clock multiple times a day and obviously my brain doesn't register the other number combinations as anything special so on the surface, it appears like I only look at the clock when it's meaningful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the person that calls/texts you just when you are thinking about that person.</p>
<p>You probably think a lot about people you know throughout the day and also get calls/texts from people throughout the day. </p>
<p>It only registers as an event when the two things match up but you don't register it as an non-event when it doesn't match. That way you only register the confirmation of something.</p></div>		</li>
