			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, air ride seats are like a second set of suspension for the driver. Helps your back quite a bit when you're in the seat all day long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. As someone whose driven a 26ft International box truck with those air ride seats halfway across Ohio on multiple occasions, I think it's super annoying especially when you hit that hellish series of potholes around mile marker 80 on northbound i71. So glad they repaved that last year...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the most common noise these end up making. Often, it's right after the compressor shuts off. I'm pretty sure it's an &quot;unloader&quot; valve so the pump doesn't have residual air pressure in it the next time it turns on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to drive a truck, can confirm. Air braked vehicles are equipped with an onboard compressor, mine was gear driven off the engine for reliability and durability. The &quot;PSSsshh&quot; is the governor turning off the compressor after the tanks are full and wasting a bit of air.  Not sure about bus equipment, but the one on the truck I used to drive looked like this:

<p>Edit: clarification, the PSSsshh when driving is the governor, there is another one when the driver stops and lets the air out to put on the spring brakes.</p></div>		</li>
