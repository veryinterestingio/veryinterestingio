			<div class="markdown"><p>I once saw a documentary where they taught people that have lost their speech ability (due to a stroke for example) speaking and remembering things by singing. The part which controls speach in the brain was damaged, but because other parts are responsible for songs/music, it's essentially a workaround and it worked great!</p></div>		</li>
