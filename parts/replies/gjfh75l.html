			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation! To add to this, you might wonder why he chose 1, 2, 4 ,8...</p>
<p>We're used to using a system that goes from 0-9, and the jumps to 10. This repeats, at 99=&gt;100 etc. Note that each time you add a digit, you go up by a power of that number. So </p>
<p>10\^1 =&gt; 10, </p>
<p>10\^2 =&gt; 100</p>
<p>10\^3 =&gt; 1000</p>
<p>Also note that the 10 in these examples is the count of possible digits. 0123456789 is 10 possible digits.</p>
<p>In binary you have 2 possible digits, so you use powers of two. But you can also kind of count on them, where if you have binary 1, and add 1, just like with normal addition you are out of digits so you have to roll back over to zero and &quot;carry the one&quot;, so 1+1 in binary gets you 10. But the next number after 1 is 2, so binary 10 is equal to decimal 2, and again that lines up with our power of 2 principle. Count one more binary is 11, and that's 3. Count one more, carry twice, and that's binary 100, or decimal 4. </p>
<p>This pattern of interpreting on or off as numbers tends to make powers of two crop up a lot. If you want to count higher than 63, by adding one more bit you can now use that to represent 64, but you can also represent 64 plus all the previous numbers, so your total possibilities double, aka go up by a power of 2. In other words, you wouldn't choose to have a number range that was 0-99 or 1-100, because by the time you have those 100 possibilities, in binary you can already count 128 possibilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really the same. Adding one bit doesn't suddenly double the capacity of the drive. 8 gigabytes mean there are 8 billion (I think) bytes each of which are a set of 8 light switches in this analogy. So to get 16 gb you need to add an additional 64 billion light switches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an analogy for binary, and powers of two. By adding one more bit you double the range of values you can represent.</p>
<p>You're right in that it doesn't really answer why storage might use powers of two but it's a solid analogy for why those numbers are significant otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
