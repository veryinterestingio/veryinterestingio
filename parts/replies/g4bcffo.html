			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's not a goal. The guy who wins the race isn't the one who tastes the most blood.</p>
<p>Quite likely it's more common the less fit you are although like many of these things (cramps etc) the science behind the cause isn't particularly strong and it's more lore.</p>
<p>The suggestion of the lore is that it's less likely the fitter you are and/or if you're warmed up prior to doing big efforts. This is based on the notion that it's the higher blood pressure in capillaries in your lungs that's causing it - others disagree with this as the cause though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely feels like you’re dying.  It only happens when I do absolutely nothing for weeks then do something like sprint up a giant hill without warm up. You feel like you might die for a few hours.  I can’t imagine you can push much harder without dying, if that gives context. </p>
<p>Cooler weather makes it worse like some else mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have pushed myself hard enough to not be able to stand up after finishing. I usually throw up from this but I’ve never tasted iron before. However, there have been a handful of times where I’ve panicked or been scared enough that I get a sudden and sharp taste of metal in my mouth. Not sure if that’s related but figured I’d share</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its gotta be related to fitness level somehow. I live in a really cold area and used to run track in the spring, and used to have to run for a couple hours straight each day but I don't remember anything about tasting blood. I've vomited a couple times from the running though lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it’s more related to fitness level and weather like others are saying.  I regular train martial arts till I collapse and recover within minutes, but if I decide to binge Netflix for 3 weeks and go back to my routine without ramping up, it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you in warm humid areas? I experience this more with exercise at higher altitudes - especially with cold, dry air. (Often accompanied with bronchoconstriction, if I've overdone it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my first experience with it was after a run when it was February and snowing, but the air was still pretty dry. </p>
<p>My age and being relatively out of shape probably contributed, because I had exercised very strenuously all through high school but that run in the snow I was in my late 20s and was just trying to get some endurance/stamina back. The blood taste freaked me out so much I didn’t exercise again for a few years -_-</p></div>		</li>
