			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, could you explain more how the anthocyanins help prevent damage? </p>
<p>Trees that live for hundreds of years would get bombarded with lots of radiation over their lifetime. If even 1% of the radiation made it through the bark that's still a lot for their DNA to shrug off, they must have some kind of genetic repair ability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While anthocyanins can also 'prevent' oxidation from radiation they are also a part of while larger class of plant compounds call polyphenols. Much like Vitamrn E and D for us they act as antioxidants but also due to their resonant ring strucutre they are able to absorb UV light a big part of why the sun's rays can be so damaging.  These polyphenols are often attributed to the health benefits of fruits and vegetables esp for green tea, chocolate, etc </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that &quot;antioxidant&quot; should not be confused with &quot;cancer-preventing&quot;. If anything, an excess of antioxidants can disrupt certain means of cell death, not just interfering with some means of cancer treatment, but potentially stopping precancerous cells from dying when they hit the self-destruct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is fascinating to me. How does this work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just some background information about electromagnetic radiation penetration.  Electromagnetic radiation suffers an exponential drop-off with thickness.  For instance if 1 mm of bark blocked 90%, 3 mm blocks 99.9%, and 5 mm blocks 99.999%.  So the difference in thickness between a radiation shield which will protect you for 10 years on average and one which protects you for 1000 years on average could easily be relatively modest.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of organisms do have DNA repair mechanisms! I don't work on trees necessarily, but I do work on light responses in fungi. Photolyases are a pretty ubiquitous class of proteins that use light energy to repair lesions in DNA. There's also nucleotide excision, which straight up cuts out and replaces damaged DNA. Plants do have photolyases at least, and I would guess they have NER as well.</p></div>		</li>
