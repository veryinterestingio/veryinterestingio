<p>Maybe follistatin</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. IIRC one of the drugs didn't pass trials because it did something to cause blood vessels to grow as well as increase muscle mass, but the proof of concept for myostatin inhibition is there.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow this comment blew up. To clarify something a lot of comments have been asking about: while vascularization is a good thing for muscle growth generally, the blood vessel growth in this case was leading to bleeding in trial subjects, and looked like it was due to the drug binding to receptors it wasn't supposed to bind to. This is bad because a well-designed drug should have as few unexpected effects as possible.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh shit, if we actually figure that out, not only do we massively help people with diseases where muscle just goes &quot;lol, I'mma head out&quot; but also it would increase life expectancy, like overnight. A huge issue with aging is loss of muscle which leads to more deadly falls and less overall health.  </p>
<p>We'd increase longevity and life expectancy in so many ways with just being able to retain muscle strength and amount.  </p>
<p>Next thing to work on is plaque build up, find a way for the body to find and break it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a number of people (often high level athletes) that have a mutation on one copy of the gene that leads to being more muscular, as well as at least one case of a child with mutations on both copies.  it seems like only a matter of time before athletes find a way to inhibit myostatin (assuming they aren't already)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a swimmer my whole life, two of the kids I swam with for years and years come to mind. By sophomore year they were just jacked. We did the exact same practice every day, ate similar food, didn't lift any weights, played the same off-season sports. We had the same lifestyle, but I looked like a wet noodle and they looked like they'd been lifting weights for years.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly they became very strong swimmers around that time, both had a good career in college and one went to the olympic trials in a few events.</p></div>		</li>
