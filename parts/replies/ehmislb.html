			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it really depends on the actual reviews. You'll often see the 5 star reviews are something to the effect of &quot;It wasn't broken when I got it and the shipping was fast, 5 stars&quot;. The 1 and 2 star reviews often go into quite a bit of detail about what went wrong. And if the relatively few, but still existent 1-2 star reviews all point to a similar problem, that does point to something actually being there.</p>
<p>On the other hand if the 1 star review is something like &quot;It broke after I used it in a way that would clearly break it&quot;, or &quot;I clearly don't know how to use this thing and therefore it must be broken, 1 star&quot; of course I ignore that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I like to check for a few specific things.</p>
<p>5 star reviews- Do they seem genuine and is it given 5 stars for a good reason? Watch out for over enthusiastic reviews, 500 people do not talk about how this grape peeler is the best thing they've ever purchased.</p>
<p>1 star reviews- Any recurring problems with the quality of the product? Are the issues something that bother me?
I won't care if the stickers for the brand peel off too easy on my new hat.</p>
<p>2-3 star reviews- I check these against the 1 star reviews for consistency. Often these people gave serious thought out reviews. You tend to get more of the honest people in here. No fake reviews to boost, or overly pissed off people.</p>
<p>Finally I look at multiple versions and eventually get the one with the most compelling reviews that is able to be shipped by prime. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Bias...
“It’s risky to change, especially when things are going smoothly.”</p>
<p>[Reads negative review]. </p>
<p>Confirmation...
“I’m never switching products cause this would totally happen to me.”</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: confirmation is only when you have a preconceived notion that you're confirming. This isn't confirmation bias. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a preconceived notion that all products are capable of sucking, even if they look/sound good.<br />
Before I buy something, I want to know what, if any, problems to expect. Negative reviews are where I would find that, although I almost never sort by 1-star, because they’re usually not the average.<br />
Generally I look for 3-star, or around there.<br />
Unless a large percentage of the reviews are 1/2-star; then I suspect the product just sucks.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Because people tend to be distrustful, especially online, <em>especially</em> with money. You <em>want</em> it to be good but you <em>expect</em> it to be &quot;too good to be true&quot;. </p>
<p>Confirmation bias over-weights evidence that conforms to your expectations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just total BS, I filter by 1 star myself and it's because I want to know if there are any common problems with the product or if it doesn't measure up to expectations. </p>
<p>Positive reviews saying &quot;I'm very happy about this product use it all the time.&quot; doesn't actually add any new information about the product in question. Reading them doesn't reward me with any new knowledge. </p>
<p>Negative ones on the other hand, saying &quot;The handle broke after two weeks&quot; or &quot;The Bluetooth keeps disconnecting every 30 seconds&quot; are much more relevant. They assist me in making an informed decision about the product.</p></div>		</li>
