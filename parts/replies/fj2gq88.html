			<div class="markdown"><p>WHO estimates 2-3%, but it infected 500 million people. Those who died were also skewed more towards young, healthy adults than typical flu. Many of the deaths were from immune system <em>overreactions</em>, so it hit those with healthy, strong immune systems harder than expected. 50% of US deaths from the Spanish flu were ages 20-40, compared to last year's flu season where just shy of 75% were 65+.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not why it was skewed towards young people. Tons of diseases kill you because of immune overreaction, that’s not remarkable at all.</p>
<p>Influenza virus does something weird with your immune system where your adaptive immune response is skewed to versions of the flu that you’ve seen before. This is called imprinting, original antigenic sin, or the hodgkin’s effect. The reason is killed more young people than old people was because young people’s immune systems did not respond appropriately to that particular strain of H1N1 because their immune systems were accidentally responding to the wrong flu virus.</p>
<p>(this is a simplification)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>500m when the world population was less than 2B means a quarter of the world got it. Total deaths are also estimated to be as high as 100 million. </p>
<p>So the 2-3% estimate is very misleading. It is actually the CFR for the developed world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a world that wasn't connected by airplanes like our modern world is, the virus spread across the globe so fast that almost everywhere was hit and overwhelmed within a few months.</p>
<p>I read the book Flu by Gina Kolata a few years ago, it discusses the flu and follows the story of trying to recover viable tissue so they could sequence the genome and figure out what made it so deadly.</p>
<p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/275/5307/1793.long" target="_blank">Here</a> is the paper that characterized it, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2391305/" target="_blank">here</a> is one by the same author that discusses historical context.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, it's still a mystery how the virus spread so far so fast. It basically hit most of the planet within the space of a couple months (~Aug - Nov of 1918) and everyone got sick all at the same time, so there was no 'preventing' the spread, as everyone was already sick. The book discusses a theory about how a mild form of the virus that spread earlier that year may have had something to do with it, but from what I know about viruses (degree in Immunology &amp; Infection) I don't think they work like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was 2% in the developed world. But specifically, a third of the entire world population got it, and up to 5% of the world died (100m people with a world population of less than 2B), making the mortality rate at least 10% and as high as 20%. Notably, it killed the young and healthy more than it killed the elderly. </p>
<p>That said, I corresponded with John Barry who wrote The Great Influenza about the 1918 flu, and he himself clarified--</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over-all case mortality #s were almost meaningless. different groups had vastly different rates. according to metropolitan life #s, for example, even in the US case mortality for factory workers aged 18-45 was at least 10%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 1918 flu was extremely serious and the oft-cited CFR of 2% really understates the deadliness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a good perspective. Looking at overall mortality rate can be deceptive both for people in developing areas thinking mortality rate is less than it is [in their area] and for people in developed areas thinking mortality rate is higher than it really is in their area.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Second, COVID-19 is transmitted quite efficiently</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the greatest danger to undeveloped countries and even developed ones. It will overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure to the point where hospitals can no longer take in any more patients.</p>
<p>A virus with 1% death rate and 15% hospitalization rate will turn into 10%+\~ death rate if people do not have access to medical equipment and care. It would tremendously increase the fatality rate of simple illnesses as well. For example, the current U.S. flu season hospitalized 280,000 people. A bad flu season combined with COVID-19 would be quite scary in U.S.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will also cause a lot more deaths from other diseases due to overcrowding hospitals. If you have a heart attack, stroke, pulmonary embolism, etc. your chance of surviving is pretty dependent on the hospitals ability to treat you quickly and efficiently - not easy if every bed is taken up by coivd-19 patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most important fact.  in the US we have a limited number of hospital beds, a few thousand that are not currently used of the potential 1 million (890,000).  the mortality rate of 2 percent is based on good quality care if that is not available then the mortality rate increases, but more importantly it also increases for every other critical care case.  The US healthcare system is optimized for maximum profit, that means minimal spare capacity, 100,000 additional patients nationally will overwhelm the system, if the patients are in a specific geographical location (California) then the local system is tanked in about a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And an even more limited number of negative pressure rooms.  The tipping point of a highly contagious airborne disease going from contained to on the loose in a hospital is probably a surprisingly small number of patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tiger749" target="_blank">tiger749</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. In peak flu season, the two hospitals I work at operate at capacity (one due to staffing, the other due to space). The ED boards the excess patients until rooms upstairs open up, backing up the ED and causing all sorts of issues. We walk a fine line of being barely able to handle our current patient loads. This could be absolutely overwhelming to us. Add in the mass hysteria aspect of everyone showing up for every slight cough or &quot;fever&quot; (read: &quot;well, I just felt hot&quot;) on top of the actual sick people, it's a recipe for disaster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah 15% hospitalisation rate is huge for a developed nation.  No way an undeveloped nation can cope.  </p>
<p>That level of acute cases with a proper outbreak would cause a lot of hospitals to basically get bed blocked.  Even if death rate stays low you have the other issues.  A lot of very sick people in a hospital generally means they more likely to die from other pathogens.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The average person spreading the disease to two to three others means the virus' basic productive number R0 is between 2 and 3.</p>
<p>The Los Alamos National Laboratory estimates the R0 of COVID-19 to be between 4.7 and 6.6. <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1.full.pdf" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>Kyoto University and Georgia State University estimates are, regarding Wuhan City, China: R0 = 7.05 before quarantine and R0 = 3.24 afterwards. <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v1.full.pdf" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>It is likely that COVID-19 is <em>much</em> more contagious, and as a result, more dangerous than the public thinks it is.</p></div>		</li>
