			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. In short, newspaper comics began to use Z's as visual shorthand for sleeping. Comics did the same thing with a lot of other symbols, creating a visual shorthand that we all know now. For example, thought balloons, a light bulb above a person's head, characters like #$*! to symbolize curse words, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm not sure why the comment I replied to was deleted... but it linked to a <em>Stack Exchange: English Language &amp; Usage</em> discussion about the entomology of &quot;zzzz&quot; and its first use in newspaper comics, starting around 1918.</p></div>		</li>
