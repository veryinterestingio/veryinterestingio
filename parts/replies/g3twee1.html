			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this reconcile with distances between the objects? After a year of such travel would the first two objects be considered .5 light years away from the third, but only .8 from each other? Is this still the case if something were to travel between them at a much slower or faster velocity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All distances are measured relative to a reference frame, and since the three observers are in different reference frames, they would not agree on the distances. Except that this is even more confusing: <em>Time</em> too is dependent on the reference frame, so they would not agree on how much time has passed. And if you try to make them all measure &quot;simultaneously&quot;, you will discover that measurements that are made simultaneously in one reference frame are not simultaneous in the other reference frames.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we make a new observer that travels at a speed much smaller than c and he travels from the reference frame that had not moved up until the point in space where one of the two previous observers were after one year of travel. According to this new observerâ€™s frame of reference, how far away would he be from the point in space that the observer that traveled in the opposite direction was after one year?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, but you have to consider which distance you're asking for, and also what you mean by &quot;after a year&quot;.</p>
<p>You'll have to excuse the terrible graph, but here is an illustration: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZDMts3J" target="_blank"><a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZDMts3J" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/ZDMts3J</a></a></p>
<p>The top graph shows the situation as measured by the middle observer (G) after 1 year in their own frame of reference. According to G, all of the spacetime points along the gray line occur simultaneously, and so, G measures distances along this line (after all, if you want to measure the distance between two objects, you want to know their locations at a single point in time, not months apart).<br />
G measures this line to be 1 light year long.</p>
<p>However, the observers R and B disagree with G on a number of key facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>They do not consider the points on the gray line to be simultaneous.</li>
<li>They do not agree that the length of this line is L = 1 light-year long. Due to length contraction, they think it is about 0.86 light-years long.</li>
<li>They do not agree that the gray line is placed at t = 1 year. Due to time dilation, they think that it is at a t = 0.86 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, they can take these two values L and t and find that L/t = 1 light-year / year, and thus conclude that <em>in G's frame of reference, L grows at the speed of light</em>. However, that's not what it looks like in their own frames of reference.</p>
<p>The second diagram shows the situation as it is experienced by B. Their timer hits t' = 1 year some time later.To determine which points they consider to be simultaneous with this time, we reflect B's world line (the line showing their journey through spacetime) through a light-like geodesic (that is, a line that travels 1 light-year / year, marked in yellow in the graph).</p>
<p>We see that B considers events in R and G's pasts to be in its own present; it intersects G's worldline when G's timer shows 0.87 years, and R's worldline when R's timer shows 0.6 years.<br />
According to B, this line is L' = 0.8 light-years long.</p>
<p>The third diagram shows the situation as observed by R; it's basically just a mirror reflection of the situation as measured by B.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I should note that I haven't got a pen and paper handy, so take the numbers with a grain of salt. The &quot;larger/less than&quot; inequalities look right, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the detailed explanation. That graphic is extremely helpful i. visualizing this. It's so far outside of our intuitive understanding of the world to be looking at things at a scale where perception of time makes such a huge difference.</p>
<p>This is also why at relativistic speeds time dilation is a factor, right? If R and B were to switch direction and travel at similar speeds back to G they would have experienced less passage of time that G would have?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So let's say we have 5 super robots that are playing around with this concept, they have some pretty awesome spaceships.  Each one of them has several mirrors and lazers, and an amazing internal clock.  They break off in an empty area of space.  One stays in a spot A, unmoving relative to the closest galaxies, another goes to location B, two light years away from spot A and also sits unmoving. The other three go directly inbetween them.</p>
<p>These spaceships are the bees knees, they can miraculously survive accerlating to 99.99999% the speed of light and decelerating at a similar rate.</p>
<p>So at point C, in the middle between A and B, he shines his lazers at all four of the other bots, and they reflect it back at him.  Then two of the robots Traveler 1 and Traveler 2, fire up their spaceships.  Traveler 1 and 2 are shining their lazers at each other and reciving lazers from the other locations.</p>
<p>Travler 1 heads to point A at 99.99999 percent the speed of light and travler 2 heads to point B at 99.99999 percent the speed of light.</p>
<p>From Travler 1 and 2's perspectives, they reach their destinations very quickly.  Whereas for the observers at points A, B, and C, the trip takes about a year.  The light that travler 1 sees coming from point as lazers is heavily blue shifted, and the light from points b and c is heavily redshifted, but what does the light look like coming from travler 2 during the trip, say if travler 2 reflected the light back to travlerer 1?  What does traveler's two speed appear to be during transit for the travler 1 in comparison to points a, b, and c?</p>
<p>Also, from the perspective of travler 1, while at the start point a appeared 1 light year away, does it appear shorter once they start traveling at that speed?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Please help me understand one last thing. I see that V is negative, fine. I also see that you changed the addition in the equation to subtraction, and I don't understand why. </p>
<p>I feel like it must be done so we can still get a nonzero sum using a negative number, but is that why <em>you</em> did it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 1-uv part remember u is positive and v is negative so 1 - 0.5c * (-0.5c) the negatives cancel out and the thingy becomes positive.</p></div>		</li>
