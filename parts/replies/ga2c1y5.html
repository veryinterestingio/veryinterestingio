			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, a regular person probably can't really understand the legalese of a release like that, and don't have time to consult a lawyer because they sign before, not after (which they probably wouldn't have done anyways, tbh).</p>
<p>Also, it's often the case that they don't get embarrassed until the thing comes out and they look like assholes on a global level. When they were in their bubble surrounded by people just like them they thought their behavior was normal and appropriate. Then the thing comes out, they see how they actually look, get embarrassed, and sue out of embarrassment of their own behavior, but because SBC did anything wrong</p>
<p>edit: guy above me deleted his comment, but it was something about how he finds it weird that no one reads the release before signing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having worked in a bank for twenty years, many people don’t read because they assume they won’t be able to understand it. It’s mind boggling. You’re typically reading the document with the banker/lawyer sitting right there - READ the damn thing and ask questions about what you don’t understand!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to defend them at all, but I'm also assuming these people (politician's, leaders, etc...) live very different lives then you or me.</p>
<p>When's the last time you signed a lengthy document? I can't remember mine but it was a while ago, and because it was so foreign to me I read it.</p>
<p>These people are being interviewed on the regular, going to rallys, giving talks, etc.. they probably sign tons of release forms or forms like this. They get complacent. I can admit I can get complacent about things at my job that I've done hundreds of times over.</p></div>		</li>
