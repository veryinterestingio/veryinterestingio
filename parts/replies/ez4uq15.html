			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fantastic question that I hope gets answered. Although it is fair to say that so much is unknown about the actual underlying causes of mental disorders that a lot of what we are doing now in the field is attempting to uncover the mysteries of the disorders in order to actually make headway on treating/preventing them. I am sure a lot more conclusive research needs to take place before we start making significant strides in the treatment of these disorders. </p>
<p>Still, I'd love to hear this question answered!</p></div>		</li>
