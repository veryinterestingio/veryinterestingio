			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I've actually recently gone vegan, which is why I'm more conscious about what I might be missing out on. With a limited range of protein sources, I was wondering whether I ought to be supplementing certain types to make sure my time in the gym isn't wasted!</p>
<p>Edit: just realised I'm already a typical vegan, as the first thing I've done is post on reddit so I can tell people about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin C considerably increases iron absorption, makes it similar to iron heme (but without the downsides). For instance a head of romaine lettuce contains 75% of daily iron needs, if you take it with some Vitamin C rich pepper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I eat a plant based diet, although I do occasionally splurge on some fish or ice cream, but protein is so not an issue. Chia seeds in smoothies/oatmeal/yogurt parfaits, peanut butter, tofu, and oh yeah broccoli. 1 cup of broccoli has 31 calories and 2.5 grams of protein. Most of that one cup ends up being water. Dip broccoli in hummus. Cut it up onto a salad. Roast it and put it on a simple spaghetti.   One thing to keep in mind is that you can/need to eat a larger portion size of raw veggies than cooked meats and starches to get the same amount of “full”.   The idea that vegans need more protein is pretty well BS, as long as you’re eating more than just ramen noodles and Oreos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For bodybuilders/gym goers it is obviously going to be harder to get adequate protein, which is why the person is asking. It's all possible of course and there are plenty of successful vegans but it requires a bit more thought than an unrestricted diet. I don't really like when vegans argue it's a myth or &quot;just as easy&quot; when it's objectively not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m also primarily plant based (I eat meat or fish roughly once every couple of months). If I want to feel full, then adding a small scoop of vegan protein powder to a smoothie bowl makes a huge difference. Without it I’ll be hungry before lunch, with it I normally just skip lunch and eat a larger dinner.-</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Larger portions, yeah. I was a veg from 17 to my late 30s, then again starting 10 years later.  When I started again I was reminded how I habitually ate until my stomach felt stretched, almost painfully, to avoid getting hungry between meals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP specifically mentioned muscle growth in the title. The typical recommended amount (50g/day) of protein is very sub-optimal for that purpose. It takes effort to get enough, which takes more planning than just diversity of the menu.</p></div>		</li>
