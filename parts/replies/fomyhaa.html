			<div class="markdown"><p>Some kids are picky for no reason. I made it all the way to 19 years old truly believing that I didn't like peaches, pineapples, baked beans, etc.</p>
<p>But then I went to prison and had to eat what I was given if I didn't want to starve to death or be too hungry and weak to defend myself. Figured out real quick that I wasn't really that picky of an eater, I just always thought I was for some reason.</p>
<p>So, y'know, silver linings. Sell 4 grams of pot in college, have your life irreparably ruined forever, figure out you're not really a picky eater, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, I nipped that right in the butt immediately. Every sandwich was an easy it all, including the crust, or you're going to bed for a nap. I didn't waste my time lying about it being the healthiest part, I just gave them the choice of bed or crust. Turns out going to bed is significantly worse than eating crust, so the behavior changed pretty quickly..
