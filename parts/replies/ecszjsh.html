			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question: how do you see your face in the shower or do you just... not? Or a shower mirror?</p>
<p>Edit: holy shit ok guys you use your fingers, your face isn't uncharted territory, shower mirrors do indeed exist, and i should grow up and shave in the shower</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do this, I just didn't see my face. Some times I would finish up the little bits I missed outside the shower, but at some point I got good enough to completely do it without looking at my face. </p>
<p>Since then I stopped doing it and the couple times I've tried again were bad...</p></div>		</li>

Just thinking about this logistically makes soooo much sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, try it. I was complaining to him about the really crappy razors you get in the toiletry kits from the airlines when they misplace your luggage. Instead of agreeing and saying I should only ever use Big Shave’s super duper thousand blade cartridge, he kinda looked around to make sure no one would hear and then told me it’s all about waiting the two minutes for the hair to soften. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amen. I use safety blades (so single blades), and have used those crappy double blades when something gets misplaced. They don't bother me at all anymore.</p>
<p>I used to have to use the sensitive skin gel with big razor's 5 blade cartridges before learning these kinds of tips.</p>
<p>I don't shave in the shower though. I do shave immediately afterwards though, and don't even dry my face from the shower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>puffy also means enough moisture to be able to stretch and pull the skin to expose even more of the hair than when it's stiff. So you could potentially get even closer.</p>
<p>I don't shave in the shower, but I do shave immediately after without giving it a chance to lose that moisture.</p></div>		</li>
