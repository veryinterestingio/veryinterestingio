			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who was worked on the influenza vaccine, I can potentially offer some insight.  The vaccine is typically produced (at least where I worked) in two waves: for the northern hemisphere (NH) and southern hemisphere (SH), offset ~6 months by the seasonal nature of flu.  The NH campaign is typically manufactured Jan-Aug, while SH is manufactured Sep-Nov (lesser quantity manufactured in US for this).  Both waves have what is called a &quot;strain selection&quot;, where the WHO recommends which strains are chosen for the vaccine (one H/H1N1, one A/H3N2, one B(Victoria) lineage, one B(Yamagata) lineage; in recent years different compositions are recommended for egg-based vs. recombinant / cell-based vaccines due to shifts during production incubation in eggs).  This selection happens by a committee of experts, and is based on surveillance data about which strains / clades look to be prevalent during the upcoming flu season.  For the NH campaign, the CDC makes their own recommendation a couple of days later (no CDC recommendation for SH, since US is in NH).</p>
<p>Interested parties (vaccine manufacturers, research institutes, others) then look to take the initial seeds and test them to see which are most likely to be manufactured well (high yield, good quality testing results).  They start doing seed passages and reassortments to increase yield and quality.  Sera and antisera are developed to create release tests to identify on a finished vaccine product that the strain is correct.  I would think that removing ourselves from the WHO may hurt our ability to get seed isolates and reassortments, along with sera / antisera made internationally.  There may be delays in the CDC being able to release these items due to severing the direct pipeline of information between themselves and the WHO.</p>
<p>The timing is very crucial as it is difficult to produce enough antigen for the flu season due to the changing strains.  To have enough vaccine by September, manufacturers typically start producing product in Jan or Feb, even though the strains are being selected later and later in the year to be more accurate (~Mar).  If the manufacturer incorrectly identifies which strains are selected, any incorrect strain material produced must be discarded.  Testing / releasing product is on hold for a couple months due to waiting for sera / antisera, and runs continuously for several months to be able to release enough product on time.  Any delays may mean reduced vaccine availability, especially at the beginning of the flu season.</p>
<p>In terms of the surveillance data, it is most beneficial to look globally, as other areas can give an indicator of what may happen in another country (ex: looking at Australia to get a sense of what may happen in US).  Flu patterns are also heavily affected by the migration of both people and birds, which often go between countries.  Not sure if leaving the WHO will sever the exchange of data, but even if it does not, may delay getting access to critical data.</p>
<p>Leaving the WHO may also affect US manufacturers that produce and release SH materials for WHO countries, or ex-US manufacturers that produce flu vaccines for the US.  Regulatory agencies routinely inspect manufacturer sites, and so every country does not need to tour every possible supply site, there are often agreements of reciprocity (ex: if Australia tours a manufacturer in Japan that makes vaccines for the US market, the FDA may accept the inspection and not have to tour it itself).  Most of the coordination is through PIC/S, but not sure how tied into WHO it is.</p>
<p>The WHO published many testing methods, manufacturing recommendations and standards.  I would imagine that if we were no longer a member of the WHO, we would not be able to contribute comments to updates on these documents.</p>
<p>In addition, probably lots of other effects that I do not have the knowledge to predict.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest concern with the flu vaccines is that the WHO provides information on likely candidates for the next flu season. Missing out on that information might make the production of flu vaccines more difficult. </p>

<p>By made, do you mean researched, developed or manufactured in Pennsylvania? That could be very much relevant.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>More than 100 national influenza centers in over 100 countries conduct year-round surveillance for influenza. This involves receiving and testing thousands of influenza virus samples from patients. The laboratories send representative viruses to five World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Influenza, which are located in the following places:</p>
<pre><code>Atlanta, Georgia, USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC);</code></pre>
<p>London, United Kingdom (The Francis Crick Institute);
Melbourne, Australia (Victoria Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory);
Tokyo, Japan (National Institute for Infectious Diseases); and
Beijing, China (National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically this reduces the world's capacity for flu vaccine development by roughly 20%, and cuts the US out of the process, meaning that any flu strains specific to the US may not be accounted for during WHO vaccine development.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-selection.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-selection.htm</a></p>
<p>Given CDC's miserable failure at working on a COVID test, I'm not super excited about putting all our eggs in their basket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flu strands that are ultimately selected for the vaccines are chosen based on the recommendations of WHO.  Governments throughout the world have “influenza monitoring centers” that continuously sample local flu strains both in people and animals and attempt do determine which ones have pandemic potential.  The five bodies chiefly responsible for picking the flu vaccine are the Centers for Disease Control (US), Francis Crick Institute (UK), Victoria Infectious Disease Reference Library (AUS), National Institute for Infectious Disease (JPN), and National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (PRC).  Representatives from each meet twice each year and their recommendations for the flu strains for the vaccines are submitted to national authorities.  Ultimately, the FDA has final say about which strains go in the vaccines but they lean heavily (if not entirely) on the recommendations from WHO.</p>
<p>By leaving WHO, the US essentially isolates itself from the other national bodies monitoring flu strains.  We lose access to that information.  And we also lose a seat at the table in discussing which flu strains should be included in our vaccines.  While the CDC could upgrade it’s own worldwide monitoring system, that would take money.  Or we could just accept the WHO’s recommendation anyway, but again, that would be a recommendation made without US input.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I don't have anything to back this up, I don't expect withdrawal will affect the flu vaccine at all. Withdrawing from the WHO is about finances and political influence. I haven't seen anything to suggest that the CDC is going to start <em>refusing</em> to give the WHO seasonal flu information, nor that the WHO would be legally prevented from finding other ways to get the same information themselves.</p></div>		</li>
