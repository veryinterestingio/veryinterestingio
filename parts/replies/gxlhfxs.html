			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always wondered this. I use liquid soap when I come home to wash my hands but my wife likes hand soap and I’ve always had this sneaking suspicion that perhaps the bacteria she brings from the outside could remain on the bar of soap.</p>
<p>Like you said I’m sure it’s pretty much moot since it wouldn’t live for long and also, we are rinsing our hands and the bar of soap after washing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Soap isn't for killing bacteria. It's for loosening oils. Your hands skin produces oils, and bacteria hang out in it. Soap just dislodges all of that and sends it down the drain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think &quot;normal use&quot; will infect the soaps; IMO the typical household bacteria you're adding to the soap can't really survive on/in it.  As I said, it would probably take sitting unused in damp conditions in a moldy location for that mold to &quot;take&quot; and grow on / in the soap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems a bit excessive to worry about that. Any bacteria that might be left will die off quickly.</p>
<p>I mean, if you're concerned about that, then why not worry about depositing bacteria on the handpump of your liquid soap? Bacteria can survive for much longer on plastic. Or what about every surface you might touch between opening the front door and touching the tap/soap?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No I agree with you. I’m being overly paranoid about it.</p>
<p>Sometimes we hold irrational thoughts/feelings. This is one of them for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently found an old piece of soap that had some sort of concentric ring growth on it. </p>
<p>It had been in a box in a relatively dry garage for N years. </p>
<p>(May have a photo of it somewhere.)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know, you'll have to look at actual studies that test the soap's ability to bind to oils and grime, and whether that depends on the overall pH of the soap.</p></div>		</li>
