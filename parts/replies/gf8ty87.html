			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not specifically answering your question, but you should only use mouthwash with alcohol once in a blue moon anyway. The &quot;use once or twice a day&quot; thing is bullshit for that. Just use it when you think your mouth needs a rinse out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mouthwash with alcohol shouldn’t be used very often for this reason. Once in a while for a person with healthy gums, it’s not a big deal, but it’s better to use one without alcohol like biotene.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they say it makes very little difference either way but there's sometimes a trace of the alcohol contaminating the sample. That's why they stopped in the UK apparently.</p></div>		</li>
