			<div class="markdown"><p>They way you said that made me think &quot;hmm this sounds like the perfect old wives tale (urban legend), it sounds so right&quot; So I goodle it. It's techincal and wordy but pretty much this chewing thing seems to be true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The epidemic’s roots lie in cultural shifts in important daily actions we seldom think about; things like chewing, breathing, or the position of our jaws at rest, and these changes have in turn been brought about by much bigger sociohistorical developments—namely, industrialization.</p>
<p>Our upper jaw, which is technically known as our maxilla, seems as if it is just the base of our skull, but it is actually formed by two bones, one on each side, fused together. Our lower jaw, technically the mandible, is likewise made by the fusion of two bones. If the jaws develop correctly they have ample room for all of the teeth, and the teeth fit together well. Both upper and lower jaws can move and change in the process of development. But that process has been gradually altered ever since our ancestors began to use tools, cook, cease their mobile hunting-gathering lives and settled down to practice agriculture some 10,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Anthropologists have reported that the size of the human mouth has long been shrinking. Because human beings have been using stone tools for at least 3.3 million ears, that may represent the time during which the shrinkage has occurred. Stone tools permitted a greater shift to a carnivorous diet because the ability to cut meat into small pieces reduced the amount of chewing required to extract nourishment. Less chewing reduced the need for large, powerful jaws. The advent of agriculture accelerated this trend. As anthropologist Clark Larsen noted, “There has been a dramatic reduction in the size of the face and jaws wherever humans have made the transition from foraging to farming.” The superficial result, as we have seen, is malocclusion.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had 2 palette expanders placed in my mouth in my early 30s. I had to get them adjusted about every 6 weeks, but instead of having 8 teeth pulled like one ortho suggested, I only needed my wisdom teeth out.</p>
<p>Point is, is can be fixed later in life. I believe that it hurt more, but my front teeth still aren't crowded together at age 55, thanks to a permanent retainer.</p></div>		</li>
