			<div class="markdown"><p>5% is <em>extremely</em> low for an EF, even for end-stage heart failure. Indications for transplant consider a lot more than EF, but generally people will start being considered for transplant (or LVAD) around 20-25% (although depending on your disease you could get a transplant even at an EF of 60%, since it’s more than just EF.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. ICU nurse here. We take heart transplant patients (and VADs) on my floor. I’ve seen lots of patients who had pre-op EFs in the 15 to 25% range.</p></div>		</li>

EF is a good measure of when the heart isn't working well, but isn't so good at showing a strong heart. Stroke volume, as in the amount of blood put out per beat I suspect would be a better measure of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't really change much, because the heart doesn't go to cintracting more than it should in training. What mostly happens is the heart gets bigger. So while both the regular office worker and the pro distance runner might have af EF of 70, the total volume of blood per heartbeat will be much higher in the athlete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little over 50-70% putting 60% right in the middle. I think it decreases with age and cardiac health. </p>
<p>Also the heart is a lot more complicated than just rate and ejection fraction. </p>
<p>I find congestive heart failure CHF interesting because if you have right sided CHF then fluid is being pumped out by the left ventricle faster than the right ventricle can handle it, so it backs up into your arms and especially legs. You'll see pitting edema where you press on the skin and it stays indented. </p>
<p>And if you have Left sided CHF then fluid is being pumped by the right ventricle into the lungs, faster than it can be roved by the Left ventricle and you get fluid in your lungs, sounds like crackling noises like rice crispy cereal in milk. If you lay down flat you feel like you're drowning and when it's really bad you actually start drowning and foam builds up in your lungs and out your mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The relationship between EF and blood pressure is complex. Some people have low EF because of high blood pressure - the heart physically just can't get the blood out due to the pressure it is pushing against. Others have low blood pressure because of low EF - the pump isn't working well so can't generate pressure.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The physical sensation from a low EF is very unique, also. It doesn't feel like an asthma attack necessarily because you can physically get the air into ypur lungs without issue....it's just that breathing deeply <em>no longer helps anything</em>. I'm certainly glad we have pills for it that work well enough.</p></div>		</li>
