			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s worth underscoring something you’ve said between the lines.  </p>
<p>Some people think muscle is just there.  Once you build it, it’s bought and paid for.  Unused, it shouldn’t cost anything right?  Muscles only need energy when in use. </p>
<p>Well, most of our body requires constant care and feeding with energy. Some parts are more expensive, from an energy standpoint, to feed.  Muscles, even idle ones, are expensive to feed and so if they are unused, the body starts breaking them down to reclaim those nutrients and to reduce its energy demands going forward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, what you said is a bit untrue. </p>
<p>Muscle fibres aren't broken down in disuse atropy. they are simply shrunken down to smaller size. They are rarely actually broken down. </p>
<p>So once you develop muscles, they are there for your life time, but their size varies according to use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true. Spent two years in the gym and built a respectable physique. Then missed a year and lost all my size. Took about 2 months of training to get it all back and I was stronger than ever before by the 3rd month.</p>
<p>Edit: Super happy I could help motivate alot of you guys! May the gains be with you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By 'develop muscles' do you mean that we grow more muscle fibers in our existing muscles?  I would assume we don't grow any actual new any muscles, with the new attachment points, facia and tendons they require.  And once those new fibers are established, are you saying we only lose them completely due to famine- or disease-related wasting?  My wife (who got her B.S. in nutrition science 30 years ago) told me that the same is true for fat cells.  They are like balloons, and while they can be emptied, the membranes remain.  I've never heard this about muscle fiber, but it makes sense.  Just wanted a bit more clarification.  Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s true!  Especially considering the bulk/cut cycle where you have to eat at a caloric deficit but still work out as hard as you can to encourage your body to make up for the caloric deficit via your fat stores instead of muscle.  All the while, you’re tired and weaker from being at that deficit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep but I would like to point out the human ability to gain and atrophy muscle is actually an amazing trait that few other animals have. </p>
<p>I once read a great example of how this helped humans spread all over the globe. </p>
<p>Say you live in your village but it is becoming too crowded. You chose to strike out for fresh lands. </p>
<p>You pack up your stuff and head out and the journey will take a month. Day one your leg muscles are burning like crazy but every day they grow stronger and stronger allowing you to march longer distances every day with ease. </p>
<p>When you arrive at your destination you now need shelter. Those giant endurance muscles you have built in your legs are no longer needed for lengthy daily hikes. So those muscles are no longer needed and start to fade. </p>
<p>However you need to chop down trees to build shelter.  Your lanky arms and shoulders now begin to grow in strength making your new task easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert, but I'd say that could be due to the vast majority of animals doing the same thing every day instead of being a postman for a few years and then a carpenter for a few other years. If they train the same every day why would their muscles change size once they reach optimal efficiency?</p></div>		</li>
