			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that makes sense. But why would P450s, which are designed to oxidize larger molecules, work on benzene? Many larger molecules have structures like benzene rings, but benzene is obviously a lot smaller than them? (Or is this a case of it only oxidizes like 1% of the time, but that's enough to cause damage?)</p>
<p>As a broader question, are most or all carcinogenic compounds at some point in the body converted to reactive oxygen species?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>TLDR: yes, basically, it might work only &quot;1% of the time&quot;. More realistically, in terms of orders of magnitude, your enzyme would work 50% of the time on the larger molecules, and 5% of the time on benzene, but collisions happen very often</strong></p>
<p>Longer explanation :</p>
<p>You can think of it this way: the interaction between a chemical and enzymes (like P450) are often compared to the &quot;lock and key&quot; mechanism : it does not really matter the form of the shaft of your key (the molecule backbone), as long as the pattern is correct (reactive site). The lock is the enzyme, and the keyhole is its catalytic site.</p>
<p>The benzene molecules and the P450, due to brownian motion, are moving around and occasionally colliding. Now, when collision occurs, you have a probability of reaction, that depends on the match between your enzyme catalytic site and your molecule reactive site (how well the pattern matches the keyhole). And since benzene looks so much like the cycles on which P450 can operate, the probability of a reaction happening is still quite high.</p>
<p>People sometimes assume that enzymes &quot;choose&quot; their reactants, but in the end they are only governed by statistical thermodynamics, and that actually is the reason of many of medical drugs' side effects. The capacity of enzyme to react on non-specific substrates is called enzyme promiscuity, and it is a very active area of research.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like when cocaine (hydroxy-benzoyl-ecgonine; ecgonine benzoate, the ecgonine part being the root structure) metabolizes to become the metabolite (benzoylecgonine), which then about 5% of it by weight connects to ethanol during the cleaving part of the ester formation.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you are actually working on this field I have a side question.  The more I read about cellular biology the more crowded intercellular space seems.  What is the mean free path of a molecule in the typical human cell and what is the likelihood of an interaction?  It seems organelles are needed to create spaces where reactions can take place without interference from all the stuff coming and going in the protoplasm.</p>
<p>Do cells ever reach a point where there is just too much in solution for reactions to reliably take place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight correction.  P450's aren't designed at all.  They evolved over time and in the course of their evolution they have been used for a number of metabolic processes.  Many of those metabolic processes involve the secondary oxidation of endogenous macromolecules, but another is the oxidation of xenobiotic material to aid excretion.  This is a wantonly indiscriminate process and is driven almost exclusively by the enormous redox potention of the P450's.    Multicellular organisms that didn't have such a process would face a lifetime of accumulation of non-polar material in their bodies until it started interfering with normal processes (hence the evolutionary advantage.)  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah by designed I meant what they are functionally intended for.</p>
<p>How can P450 distinguish xenobiotic material from &quot;self&quot; material? It's not like every &quot;self&quot; protein, carb, etc. has some identifying feature that non-self macromolecules lack. Do they just have incredibly high reactivity and zip around, oxidizing a bunch of stuff?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>question for you;  I don’t understand how grapefruit juice inhibits cytochrome p450s, but I can postulate.  If it decreases the number of p450’s or “jams up the machinery” temporarily so to speak, then never mind.  But if there was a substance that thermodynamically decreased the oxidative capability of p450 temporarily, such as complete, near 100% binding-, would this substance be of high importance in the administration of drugs that would otherwise get destroyed?  Or is p450 so intergral to life that turning it off for a few hours to achieve the medicinal effects desired would kill the patient, or even just outweigh the benefits?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not very good on those oxidative pathways, so can't give you a good answer on the first part. As to the part I quoted, there are certainly other mechanism. For example you can have so-called intercalating agents that insert themselves between base pairs in the DNA and cause replication failures that way. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qua.10715" target="_blank">Benzopyrenes</a> are a good example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From toxicology I recall that p450 oxidation causes benzo a pyrene (five benzene rings) to bind to nucleotides or be recognized and substituted by the body as an actual nucleotide. I can’t remember which one. However when this happens it is then paired with the wrong nucleotide base pair during dna replication. Thus causing a point shift mutation that leads to cancer.</p></div>		</li>
