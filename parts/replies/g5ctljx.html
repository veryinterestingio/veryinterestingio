<p>It's not technically a mass extinction—it actually directly led to the Cambrian Explosion of Life—but it's my favourite for how dramatically it changed the very nature of our planet.  </p>
<p>I, uh, actually did a <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/events/tedx/" target="_blank">TEDx talk on it that'll be airing on Sunday</a>!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One to two billion years, depending on what you consider animals. It was maybe 1.7 billion years from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event" target="_blank">oxygenation event</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ediacaran" target="_blank">Ediacaran</a> period where we have fossils of early sponges and worms and such. The Cambrian explosion, which is super cool, happened right after the Ediacaran.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's both a mass extinction of everything that came before <em>and</em> an evolutionary explosion of everything that came afterwards. We tend to only talk about the explosion bit while ignoring that a mass extinction that happened at the exact same time.  </p>
<p>It feels awkward doing self promo during an AMA, but do check out the TEDx talk if you're curious to learn more. It's a seriously cool story of both dire warning and cause for optimism, particularly when all of us on the West Coast are choking on smoke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It killed off a large amount of earths life, like 90% of it. Which was Bacteria mostly iirc. </p>
<p>However it also gave rise to new life that could handle the new oxygen rich planet, a lot of it(Cambrian explosion). </p>
<p>Basically it was somewhat accidental reset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could the Great Unconformity, before the Cambrian, explain why it appears  such a large diversity of life appeared suddenly?  Perhaps the fossil record is lost?</p></div>		</li>
