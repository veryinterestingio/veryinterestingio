			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, God, that makes so much sense! I kept thinking of it as an evolutionarily disadvantage, you should want to excrete away from your home to discourage scent hunters, but thinking about it as a “safe space (lol)” is the connection I wasn’t making. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha exactly! this is why humans are so interesting in the light of evolutionary biology. We have the instincts of prey but the thinking of predators. You would think of this as a disadvantage because you’ve never had to worry about a saber-toothed tiger trying to snatch you while you take a shit.  😂😂😂</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bathroom is only centuries old. Before that we used to go far from the house to crap at least. So this doesn’t make any sense from the evolutionary perspective. In fact in developing countries, bathrooms are fairly recent and we still have countries where large parts of the population have no access to the bathroom.</p></div>		</li>
