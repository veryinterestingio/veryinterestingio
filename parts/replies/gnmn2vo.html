			<div class="markdown"><p>A big part of this is that cobalt minerals typically also yield arsenic. The DRC has the biggest reserves, yes, but it's also got a worse level of regulation so these things can be processed at a cost no other major producers can compete with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you can apply similar cons to most of the mineral mining in the world. Most people will say they care about workers' conditions but the minerals are also needed for technology stuff, so nobody really gives a damn, because cutting off that precious materials means less phones, computers, cars etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congo is a much more expensive place to mine than almost anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Around 80 per cent of the copper and cobalt mined in Congo comes from large, mechanized mines. I've been to mine sites in Congo that are more modern and more environmentally and safety conscious than operations I've visited in Canada and South Africa.  </p>
<p>To operate a mine like this, you need a concession from the government, this is not cheap. You also need to relocate and compensate anyone who is already living on the land, this is also not cheap. On paper, Congo has some of the strictest mining and environmental regulations in the world. These often go unenforced, but not in the case of large mining companies, which means you need to play by the rules or bribe. All this time, you have to go through the steps of dealing with Congo's paper-based, bribe expecting bureaucracy. Even if you don't bribe, you still will have millions of dollars in fees just to get the right to mine. </p>
<p>You then have to partner with the government-owned mining company, Gecamines, as well as pay taxes and royalties on what you mine. But because this money basically gets stolen, you'll have to build the roads yourself. There is a road building tax you'll have to pay on that. </p>
<p>You also need equipment, which will have to be imported (takes a truck about 15 days from the time the get in line to clear customs), there's also the question of fresh water, electricity, internet and you may have to pay the local cell phone company to put up some towers on your site. </p>
<p>Now you need workers, a lot of those will be foreigners who you have to pay extra because it's Congo. You also need a hospital, firefighters and security. The Congolese government also expects you to pay the salary of the mine police. Getting the visas for these workers will be incredibly expensive. Your Congolese workers will mostly be from Kinshasa and Lubumbashi, because you need an educated and trained workforce, they make significantly higher salaries than the local average. (Though, some of the Chinese mines use all Chinese labour now). You'll also have to import food for your workers and you may end up also running an airline to get them in and out. </p>
<p>I could go on. </p>
<p>No mining company in the world would operate in Congo if these deposits weren't the richest in the world and they are. You can see the black band of cobalt in exposed rock on the hillsides - hillsides that are literally green with copper. </p>
<p>I don't want to seem like I'm defending international mining operations in Congo. The relationship is incredibly exploitative and any money that stays in Congo mostly benefits wealthy, politically connected people in the capital. </p>
<p>Most Congolese people who work in mining are artensianal miners - working with their hands either independently or in small groups. While this is technically illegal, around 70 per cent of Congolese miners work in this area. It generates around 20 per cent of Congo's cobalt. This is the sector known for child labour, danger and environmental problems (charcoal fired smelters), but it's also a sector that employs people who are trying to live and have few other options.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One aspect on artisanal miners, is that the government can often allow them to work on the same permit as the mining company, as they pay money back to the gov't officials through bribes &amp; kick backs.</p>
<p>No developing country gov't official is going to completely remove a group of artisinal miners, as the unregulated money flow is so high, plus it employs people; a lot of people and there is little else there for them to make money.</p>
<p>Source: I also work in Africa in the mining industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an in depth report by the Washington Post if anyone wants to read more about artisanal mining. It's a long one but imo worth it. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/batteries/congo-cobalt-mining-for-lithium-ion-battery/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/batteries/congo-cobalt-mining-for-lithium-ion-battery/" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/batteries/congo-cobalt-mining-for-lithium-ion-battery/</a></a></p>
<p>And here's a 2019 article from the Guardian relating Congolese mining to big tech companies and supply chains, which is another interesting angle. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths</a></a></p></div>		</li>

Most of the child are really teenagers, Amnesty international love to make thing darker than they are to get you to donate money, make shit up all the time, get naives volunteer to guilt people to donate monthly and pay their top staff ridiculous salaries, fuck them.</p></div>		</li>
