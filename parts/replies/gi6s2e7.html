<p>not always. discontinuous behavior is certainly seen in first-order transitions, but second-order transitions occur gradually. think supercritical fluids, where gas and liquid phases are indiscernible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. I was under the impression that OP wanted a more general approach to phase definitions than the usual &quot;solid = fixed volume, fixed shape/ gas = volume expansion&quot; that is taught in schools. </p>
<p>As you point out, my answer is limited to first-order transitions and does not take into account quasi-states, non-molecular states (QGP) and others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a misinterpretation of what &quot;discontinuity&quot; means here though. A second order phase transition essentially by definition features a discontinuous second derivative of the free energy, where some susceptibility of the system diverges. This in my mind constitutes an imprecise but totally valid definition of a phase transition - a region in the space of physical properties where some derivative of the energy changes discontinuously. The liquid-gas transition belongs to the same universality class as certain models of magnets and behaves in exactly this way - the order parameter itself (in this case the density) is continuous, but the isothermal compressibility is divergent.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> infinite order phase transitions though - famously the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition is 'infinite order,' in the sense that it's smooth 'all the way down', but that gets into some more complex stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not really. you're using an outdated classification scheme. i'll link you in my other comment where i make this point clear -- it was in response to another user whose similar comment has since been deleted.</p>
<p>edit:after coming back to this and picking up on some more things you've said, i'd like to make some additional points</p>
<p>one should note that at the time ehrenfest established his system, what he had in mind were jump discontinuities in the free energy derivatives. divergent susceptibilities in second-order phenomena had not yet been encountered and were not accounted for in his &quot;nth-order discontinuity means nth order derivative&quot; classification scheme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A second order phase transition essentially by definition features a discontinuous second derivative of the free energy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i dont know why you would use ehrenfest's definition and then cite the KT transition where it quite clearly breaks down. the point of the original post and comment was to address how scientists distinguish between phases in a broad and general sense.</p>
<p>that being said, as i pointed out in my other comment, the modern dichotomy is that first/second-order phase transitions denote whether there is/isnt latent heat involved, i.e. whether or not the system displays a sharp change or discontinuity</p>
<p>now i can maybe see you taking issue with my modern usage of &quot;second-order&quot; to denote all continuous phase transitions -- especially if you'd prefer to avoid the obsolescence of the ehrenfest classification -- but the terms have become more-or-less interchangeable and this is the normalized/accepted terminology... for good reason too.</p>
<p>when one encounters, say, a volume discontinuity at the first order transition, it is quite in your face. every single aspect and everything you could measure about the system will quite literally jump.</p>
<p>on the other hand, if we go beyond the critical point and find ourselves in a second-order regime (in both the modern and ehrenfest sense), then saying -- &quot;well....the second derivative of the free energy diverges at this point so it's still discontinuous&quot; -- while technically true, is hardly useful outside of a perspective adherent to ehrenfest's dated system.</p>
<p>as you've pointed out the order parameter remains continuous in this case, and there's nothing that the system will do which is quite so flagrant as the volume discontinuity that we mentioned above.</p>
<p>for most practical intents and purposes, first/second-order or discontinuous/continuous are the only two boxes we need, and differentiating continuous transitions by whether a discontinuity technically occurs in the second, third, fourth, etc derivative is hardly useful.</p></div>		</li>
