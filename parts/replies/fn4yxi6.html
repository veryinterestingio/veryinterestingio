<p>I wish they just had multiple tracks you could adjust the volume on independently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Almost four years later I still have them on so I'm not bothered as much by interruptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think subtitles add to your experience...alongside catching all the dialogue, sometimes they explain background noises.</p>
<p>Example; people are at a military base, and you can hear background machine noise as the characters are walking...subtitles say</p>
<p>[engines powering down]</p>
<p>And it's kinda cool to me to then see the airplane in the scene on the runway and realize &quot;oh yeah, that makes sense</p>
<p>Is it just me? My listening skills are like super tuned into spoken nuances as opposed to background details</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's obviously not the same as an on-screen menu with sliders to control volume, but a lot of sound systems have &quot;clear voice&quot;-style EQ presets built into them now. I use mine on my Samsung soundbar any time I'm watching movies and it makes a world of difference. It's not perfect, but I can't stand watching movies any other way now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you've ever changed the balance on your stereo or tweaked your 5.1 surround sound, you've already used the concept of separate track volume.  There is no technical limitation to how many tracks exist and which are tied together (for example speech tracks could all be impacted by a &quot;speech volume&quot; and right ear tracks (in stereo) could all be impacted by &quot;right balance&quot;.</p>
<p>This is really simple stuff.  It is simply limited by the fact that it is not an industry standard.</p></div>		</li>
