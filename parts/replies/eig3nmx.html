			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, with suspended particle tech the default state would be opaque because the particles are randomly scattered through Brownian motion. You need power to align them and see through the window.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t that a terrible idea then? I remember the reason why we have to keep our window open while takeoff and landing is to get our eyes used to the outside environment, so if anything terrible happens we could get the fuck out ASAP.<br />
If the windows are default to pitch black, how the heck am I going to see outside and what’s going on when shit hits the fan?<br />
I must be overlooking something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interior lightning (or lack thereof) is the ones that keep your eyes adjusted to the light outside. </p>
<p>The window shades open are for your cabin crew to assess outside conditions to determine if an evacuation is needed or safe like looking for if the engine is on fire, or if that exit is usable during an emergency evacuation. Also, for emergency crew to see dangers like fire or smoke. </p></div>		</li>
