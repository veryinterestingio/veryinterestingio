			<div class="markdown"><p>Gary Nabhan wrote a book about spices. The first chapter described desert conditions where very fragrant fruits and seeds were found, much different from things like tomatoes that are mostly water. It's fascinating to read about ancient trade routes, etc. and how Europeans were over the moon about basically all spices because hardly anything interesting grew in Europe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s where it gets even more interesting. If you look at medieval recipes, things are heavily spiced. That’s mostly because the recorded ones are all rich people food, and spices were very expensive.</p>
<p>Then trade got easier, and less costly. Middle class folks could now afford spices, so the rich essentially threw a shit fit, and started emphasizing that the “real” good food for rich folks didn’t need any of that middle class spice, and things got bland again.</p>
