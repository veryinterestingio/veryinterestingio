			<div class="markdown"><p>Before computer-assistance, they would use an analog switch box that was connected to each fuse via alligator clips or other such termination.  Essentially a very large control panel version of what is used to launch model rockets today.  </p>
<p>Here is a modern version of an analog firing system: <a href="http://pyroinnovations.com/400-shot-fireworks-firing-system.html" target="_blank">http://pyroinnovations.com/400-shot-fireworks-firing-system.html</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you are not imagining things.  I recall in my youth being taught that the way to tell when the show was starting was to look for the red road flare being lit and heading for the tubes.  It was only on 4th of July as well.    Of course the fireworks were a little less complicated then.  No multi-burst shapes and designs.  Just as pretty in my thinking.  Especially since they are supposed represent the &quot;rockets red glare&quot; .  They would also reload small tubes during a show, which nowadays is not as common.</p></div>		</li>
