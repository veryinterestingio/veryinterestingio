			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add that praise is a valid form of positive reinforcement. </p>
<p>Verbal validation is actually a very powerful tool because it sets up the individual to do things because it makes them feel good about themselves, not because they expect something for it. They modify their behaviour because of intrinsic rewards, rather than because of their expectation of environmental benefits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The kind of verbal praise is important as well. Telling children that they're hard workers results in better work ethic in the future compared to telling children they're smart. Although those studies were also retrospective, if I remember correctly, so take that with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about a study where they gave teachers “profiles” of certain students. Some were labeled as smarter or slower, some as difficult or easy, etc. They found that the teachers modified their treatment and approach towards the kids as the label would suggest, and the study observed a correlation in behavior from the child that matched. The treatment could be as simple as calling on the “smart kid” to answer a question, encouraging further participation in class. Or talking over the “disruptive” kids, discouraging them to express themselves. The most obvious modification came in grading subjective assignments. </p>
<p>It suggested that labels are very powerful. So when an authority figure treats you a certain way, it’s easy for you to fit the mold. </p>
<p>When I look back at the way I treated certain teachers, I absolutely was not the same child in each classroom. My behavior was widely varied, and I wonder if this had anything to do with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, you're informing them that their actions are the things that has resulted in the reward, as opposed to some intrinsic quality that they have.  If the positive outcome is simply a facet of their innate and unalienable ability, then regardless of their actions they will still posses that quality that will result in a positive outcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for the rant but this really clicked with me. </p>
<p>My partner is amazing for this, always telling me when I do desired behaviours and now I almost hear a little voice in my head telling me how good I was when I make my bed or similar. This has resulted in a clean living space. My parents would just yell and punish for a messy room and all it caused was anxiety and avoidance of the whole situation, no change to room cleanliness. Sometimes even leading to defiance.</p>
<p>Anecdotally I can say you're really onto something </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Verbal abuse would be similar to physical abuse in that it adds a negative experience, as the reply on top defined it. There is lots of teaching out there that would say a lot of bad things about verbal abuse. I have read sad stories on r/raisedbynarcississts </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Punishment is not the opposite of positive reinforcement. </p>
<p>Verbal abuse might temporarily make you suppress the behaviour, but it does not suppress the inherent motivations that caused the behaviour. </p>
<p>Dealing with an abusive father can have many potential outcomes on your personality. You likely will respect his opinion less, you might feel a larger desire to be what others want rather than who you want, or it might even help insulate you and make you more adept at overcoming future criticism from others. </p>
<p>The bottom line is you are who you are, and everything bad is a learning experience that you've strengthened from, if you can maintain a positive attitude. If you disagree with your father's style just be sure to avoid repeating it when dealing with others. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like another important aspect people often overlook is whether or not the parents incorporate 'cause and effect' into their parenting styles.</p>
<p>For example, punishing a child for doing something wrong when they had no prior knowledge that what they were going to do would incur that punishment will not be as powerful or beneficial as adequately informing them that certain actions will incur certain repercussions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm this. As a child I was spanked for misbehavior. However, what I learned from the experience was not &quot;I better act right or else I'll get spanked&quot; what I learned was &quot;Mom better not find out what I do or else I'm gonna get hit&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, I still did whatever the fuck I felt like doing, I was just more careful and sneaky about it. </p>
<p>I have ALWAYS, from my earliest memory, been a very clever liar and been able to outwit my parents whenever I wanted to. </p>
<p>So...yeah. Make sure to connect with your kids about why their behavior is wrong and make sure they don't get the idea that you're just some mean person who yells at them for doing things they didn't know were wrong. It can cause a huge divide. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any research to suggest positive reinforcement has negative effects? </p>
<p>It just seems (and this may just be me thinking) that doing things only for good behavior can create negative consequences. If you only do good expecting a positive reward what happens when u stop getting rewarded? What happens when u get older in life and be a r/niceguy amd expect something positive for your &quot;good deeds&quot; cuz that is how u were brought up do good for good rewards? Instead of doing bad has consequences? </p>
<p>Just my thoughts </p>
<p>Edit: thank you kind stranger for my first gold! I'm glad that it wasn't for some weird sexual comment or a weird bodily function comment. Don't know why I was rewarded but I'll try and use my newfound riches wisely</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sporadic rewards are most effective for embedding the behaviour long term. </p>
<p>So, little Susie shouldn’t get a cookie <em>every</em> time she exhibits the desired behaviour, only sometimes. And it shouldn’t be presented as a bribe or payoff.</p>
<p>Good example:
“Please clear the table, Susie”
<em>table gets cleared</em>
“Thanks so much for helping, would you like a cookie?”</p>
<p>Bad example:
“If you clear the table, you can have a cookie”</p>
<p>Also, the reward shouldn’t always be material. Praise, gratitude, etc. are also examples of positive reinforcement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sentiment is correct if the behaviour is already in the person's repertoire and it's pretty stable. If it's a new behaviour or something the person struggles with, reinforcement after every instance of behaviour and having it explicit is recommended. And then you fade to intermittent, more natural schedules of reinforcement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know about research, but positive reinforcement is just one small facet of parenting. With my own kids, we work very hard to instill respect for themselves and others. If someone doesn’t want to share their toy or kiss grandma, they don’t have to, for example. While I don’t know how they’ll turn out, I do know that they will have that. </p>
<p>It’s also important to note that kids aren’t static and neither is parenting. As they get older, how we talk to them and treat them will change. Right now, when my kids hit each other, they (mostly) don’t have the impulse control to not do it. If they hit each other when they were teens, my response would be very different. Just my thoughts as an okay parent trying to do his best. </p>
<p>Edit: said punishment but I meant reinforcement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is exactly what you meant, but in a similar line of thinking they have done childhood development research on the particular type of positive reinforcement.  I'm paraphrasing from memory, but say you have a kid that got straight A's and you want to praise them.  Saying &quot;Great job.  You're so smart&quot; that kid thinks their success is a consequence of an innate personal quality.  Saying something like &quot;Great job.  I'm proud of how hard you worked,&quot; makes it clear you value their effort which is more likely to get them to reproduce that success.</p>
<p>So the specifics matter.  If you give a kid five bucks and an atta boy every time they do something good it's still positive reinforcement, but it's not necessarily going to produce an adult that makes good decisions unless you teach them the right values as well.</p></div>		</li>
