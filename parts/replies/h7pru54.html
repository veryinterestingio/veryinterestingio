<p>That equation isn't right in curved space-time (though the principle applies)</p>
</li>
<li>If your definition of &quot;really far away&quot; is much less than the radius of the observable universe then you'll say that even more of the universe is &quot;really far away&quot;.  If a billion light years is far then it's from like 0.07R to R.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you measure the physical volume of every shell with equal thickness, such as spherical shells with a 1 kiloparsec thickness, the volume of each shell moving outward from Earth is bigger than then previous shell's volume until you hit about 10 billion light-years away. At that point, the volume of the shells starts shrinking. This is because you're looking farther back in time to when the universe was much smaller.</p>
<p>It's not a pure r^3 rule in cosmology.</p></div>		</li>
