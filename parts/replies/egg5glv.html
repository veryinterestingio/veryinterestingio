			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no general rule since it depends on the required accuracy of the calculation. 0.1c is often used at the cut-off in high school physics classes, but that may be way too high in some cases. GPS satellites orbit at about 0.000013c, but relativity (both special and general!) has to be taken into consideration, or else they would give useless data after a very short time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sending the Apollo missions to the moon used classical physics, even though the speed were slightly higher. If they had tried to use Einstein's equations, they would probably have failed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really? This sounds kind of dubious to me. Shouldn't it be more precise, albeit to such a negligible extent that it's not worth doing the additional calculations?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's not really a hard limit, it's (afaik) a matter of precision. Everything is always relativistic, no matter how small v/c gets. It's just that the difference the relativistic component have on your result gets smaller the smaller v/c gets.<br />
Ignoring relativity will always, at any speed, introduce an error but that error gets smaller the slower you go.</p>
<p>When dealing with real measurements there's always a degree of precision at play. We're never truly accurate. So our answer will always have a margin of error. If that margin is large enough that the impact of relativity is completely lost within it, then it doesn't matter if we include relativity or not, our results will not change in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>So it's not a question of IF something is relativistic, but rather whether my measurements are precise enough that I need to care. (Or even if my measurements are that precise, whether I need my results to be that precise.)</p>
<p>And that's going to be different depending on what you do. The larger the speed and the tighter the precision, the more you need to care about relativistic effects.</p>
<p>GPS satellites for instance, again if I recall correctly, aren't traveling at what we normally consider &quot;relativistic speeds&quot;, but their position measurements are so precise that they nonetheless have to account for relativistic effects to manage to be as accurate as they are in determining your location.<br />
<strong>Edit:</strong> GPS satellites travel at ~14 000km/h (~3900m/s). So v/c (3900/~300 000 000) ~= 0.000013c in that case. Quite small indeed. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine that the relativistic effects that satellites need to correct for are because of the distance from the Earth's center, meaning less gravity. Effects due to speed are still insignificant even for the level of precision needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a quantity gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta\^2) where beta=v/c, which quantifies the importance of relativistic effects, roughly speaking. For v/c = 0.01, relativistic effects are less than one part in 10,000, while for your v/c=0.13 they are about one part in 100.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you analyze gamma in terms of significance? Looking at other replies, the impact depends on the level of precision required. I'm a finance guy and I'm trying to get my head around the relationship between v/c and when it's impact can be said to be important, like the GPS scenario</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait but isn't the reason there's a 1/2 there just because the integral of xdx is 1/2 x^2 ? I get that the classical solution is a special case of the more general relativistic model so what you are saying is also true but purely in terms of the simple classical derivation it isn't surprising by any means that there'd be a 1/2, it's just basic calculus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by the &quot;full&quot; answer? Series expansion is the way in math to approximate a complicated mathematical function as a sum of simpler functions, such that each new term matters less than the last that is only valid in the neighbourhood of a certain point (in this case (v/c)=0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you agree that using more terms in the expansion will give a better approximation. So my question was, if we were to use more terms in the expansion our answer would be more accurate? You answered that question, thank you!</p></div>		</li>
