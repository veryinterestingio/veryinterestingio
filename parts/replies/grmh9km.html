So, if someone gets amnesia, that would mean something happened to the links of the neurons specifically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, amnesia like you'd see in movies where a person just suddenly forgets big of their life and who they are is <em>incredibly</em> rare (although I've seen a case in the ER!), and almost always psychological.</p>
<p>Far more common is amnesia that involves a period of time where you can't form any <em>new</em> memories, usually due to drug intoxication (alcohol), head trauma, stroke, etc. Also, Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia cause a slow loss of past memories, ability to form new memories, and general functions of the mind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suspect one of the key connections between depression and memory loss involves head injury in some cases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unknown. It could also mean that something is wrong with the neurons that they can't activate the links between each other. But, as I said, it's still pretty poorly understood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's interesting is that memory is really a range of different things. Remembering how to ride a bike is different from remembering what you had yesterday. And these memories are physically localized to different parts of the brain.</p>
<p>Memory is very complex and what we perceive as memory is probably many different processes in our brains occuring simultaneously.</p></div>		</li>
