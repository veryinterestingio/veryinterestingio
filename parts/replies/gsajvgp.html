			<div class="markdown"><p>We're way ahead of you! PNNL helped solve the <a href="https://defensesystems.com/articles/2014/11/17/pnnl-navy-samms-submarine-air-purification.aspx" target="_blank">stinky solvent problem on submarines</a> nearly a decade ago. Our SAMMS technology uses solid sorbents to capture CO2 from submarine breathing air, rather than solvents that evaporate and generate that <em>eau de MEA</em> you love so much. Now, submariners have one less stinky smell to worry about.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of other cool research involving algae going on, including <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/okeechobee-blooms-biocrude" target="_blank">turning it into biocrude</a>.</p>
<p>If we are capturing CO2 from industrial flue gas, it is better to capture CO2 near the plants, since it is more expensive to transport industrial waste gas than pure CO2.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thought this was a typo until I googled it. For anyone wondering, sorbents work by way of adsorption (another not-typo), which means they induce substances to gather into films <em>on</em> their surfaces as opposed to absorbents which draw substances to permeate/dissolve <em>within</em> them.</p></div>		</li>
