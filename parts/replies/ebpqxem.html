			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer refers to color as pigment - like if you're mixing paint.The rainbow is color as light, and the mixing rules are different.</p>
<p>But basically a rainbow is the pure versions of the colors, the only colors they're mixed with is their neighbors. The  primary colors of light are red green and blue. Red and green make yellow.</p>
<p>So you can also mix colors with grey, which affects their saturation (think of foggy or dusky colors) or white or black (which affect brightness). Pink is just red mixed with white.  Its not in a rainbow or a normal color wheel because a normal color wheel doesn't show the regular colors mixed with white, black, or grey. But a color wheel that has white in it will have red slowly get pinker and pinker.</p>
<p>Brown is the same, the magic marker brown we think of is orange + black. A color wheel with black will have orange slowly looking browner.  Brown isn't on the rainbow because the rainbow doesn't have black mixed in it.  </p>
<p>(There is actually a whole range of muddy &quot;brown&quot; looking colors. Red yellow and orange will all look some degree of brown if you add black and/or grey to them. Context is important to how colors look to us too- if a color is surrounded by a different color it will affect how we see it. This is getting out of ELI5 terrain but a desaturated purple in a field of blue has the potential to look brown.)   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's getting a bit out of my area of expertise, but I imagine it's a similar reason: the rainbow is all the different colors that makes up white light, split up. Brown is made by mixing opposite colors together, rather than being its own frequency of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. Rainbows are basically splitting the light into all visible wavelengths.
The only reason we see green in a rainbow is because yellow and blue overlap a little, giving you the illusion of green.</p>
<p>If you have more questions about color I can answer them, I studied color theory in school. I'm not the best at explaining the science, but there are really cool tricks. If you are painting green leaves on the ground, painting red as a shadow under the leaf tricks your brain into thinking it's a shadow. Straight-out-of-the-tube black is really flat, the older masters almost never used black because it doesn't give the same rich depth as using other colors does. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the rainbow as a continuum of notes on a piano. Red would be the lowest key/note and violet (a vibrant blue, not purple) is the highest key/note. </p>
<p>The rainbow is all the individual notes we can see from lowest to highest. </p>
<p>Brown (and purple) would be analogous to hitting multiple keys at the same time to make that color, more like a chord rather than a single note. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So long as you mix things oppositely on the wheel (in terms of pigment), in roughly equal proportion you'll hit brown or grey.</p>
<p>Generally though, the colour wheel is used to aid in paint mixing, the ambiguities of putting brown in the centre can cause problems.</p>
<p>Some of the more detailed ones do include brown, they've got windows that show what happens when you mix in the complimentary opposite. </p></div>		</li>
