<p>why a really humid day feels hotter than a less humid one at the same temperature, because humid air is denser than air without a lot of water in it and so contains more energy for the same volume.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of this is correct, but the main reason humidity makes it feel warmer is because your body becomes less effective at cooling itself.  Your body's main climate control mechanism at high temperatures is to sweat.  Sweat evaporates, cooling the skin.  As humidity rises, evaporation slows and your body cannot cool itself as effectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good addition, upvoted. </p>
<p>However a humid day at temperatures that are well below those when you would normally sweat still feels warmer (or cooler, if the ambient temperature is low enough) than a dry day at the same temperatures.</p>
<p>It's not &quot;incorrect&quot; so much as &quot;incomplete&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the thing is, humid air is actually less dense than dry air (since H20 molecules weigh less than the N2 or O2 molecules they replace). So whatever causes the warmer feeling, it can't be higher density, and the original comment truly is &quot;incorrect&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Opposite feels true too. Damp cold days always feel more chilling to the bone than brisk cold days.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s a function of the air’s density per se, but perhaps humid air transfers heat faster than drier air?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And also, humidity is relative. If you notice in the winter, most days are at 80% humidity but they still feel dry. That's because the air holds less water at lower temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last part definitely is not true. Air on a mountain top doesn't feel colder, it is colder. The reason things feel hotter or colder, such as water Vs air isn't the amount of energy stored per space, it's the rate of energy transfer between your body and the surroundings. That's why you can take your bread out of the oven with bare hands, but you burn if you touch the metal. Not because it has more energy, but because it transfers energy more rapidly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Believe it or not, moist air (provided it’s below the dew point) is <em>less</em> dense than dry air! With gasses, you have to know the masses of the particles. Hydrogen’s atomic weight (the weight of one atom) is 1, Nitrogen’s is 14, and oxygen’s is 16. Air is mostly N2 and O2, molecules of 2 nitrogen atoms or two oxygen atoms. So an nitrogen molecule weighs 28 and an oxygen molecule weighs 32. But a molecule of water, H2O, only weighs 18! So the more humid the air is, the <em>less</em> dense it is.</p>
<p>That all depends on the air being humid, but not so humid that you get mist or fog, which are very small droplets of <em>liquid</em> water floating around in the air. That’s <em>much</em> heavier than air that’s completely dry or just really humid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this meterology concept of air parcels! It's really helpful.</p>
<p>A small comment: I think you might mean 50% relative humidity instead of 50% water vapour. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapour_pressure_of_water" target="_blank">The vapour pressure of water is 0.5 atm at about 81.5 °C</a>, so 50% water vapour would mean the air is 81.5 °C or hotter.</p></div>		</li>
