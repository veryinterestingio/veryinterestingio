			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, plasma is not gas. There is so much energy that electrons are not bound to their nuclei. So the matter will not behave like the same element in gas form; you don't get the same chemistry you typically find on Earth. I'm not a physicist but saying &quot;gas in plasma form&quot; sounds an awful lot like &quot;liquid in gas form&quot;. Usually when people say something (an element) is a solid/liquid/gas, they just mean that's how we usually find it naturally.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting way of putting it. How much helium/hydrogen is out there in interstellar space relative to what's concentrated in stars? I think technically you could make the argument that we usually find it naturally in the liquid/plasma form within stars. Kind of shows a bias to what we consider &quot;normal&quot; in science.</p>
<p>Does this make sense?</p></div>		</li>

<p>At really high pressures and temperatures (above the <a href="http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch14/property.php#critical" target="_blank">critical pressure and temperature</a>), that's not a bad description.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plasma is gas in the ionic form, with electrons stripped off. Still a gas. When a  liquid turns to gas it is no longer in the liquid state, but it is still a fluid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the thing that makes hydrogen hydrogen is how many protons and electrons there are right?  If it's electrons become detached, is it still considered hydrogen in plasma form?  Or is plasma absolutely any combination of protons and electrons... So plasma for of hydrogen and the plasma form of carbon are chemically the same thing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you plunge deeper into Jupiter, the atmospheric pressure becomes so intense it turns into a super-critical fluid. At that state the gas behaves like a hybrid of liquid and gas. Go deeper, and the pressure continues to mount until it takes on a complete fluid state.</p>
<p>So, deep in the interior of Jupiter is an ocean of liquid hydrogen at 10,000 degrees or hotter. It is at this point hydrogen is described as taking on a &quot;metallic&quot; state, as it behaves much like a metal - and is believed to be the incredibly powerful dynamo driving the planet's magnetic field.</p>
<p>It is theorized that if you could go even deeper into the interior of the planet, past the ocean of super-heated liquid hydrogen, you'd find a rocky core - possibly 10x the mass of the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're not 100% sure, but there's a lot of conjecture that Jupiter's core is comprised of heavier, rocky solids.  However, the vast majority of it is made of densely packed gas.  So, you could &quot;land&quot; on this core, if it exists, or, probably, &quot;sail&quot; through the gasses.</p></div>		</li>
