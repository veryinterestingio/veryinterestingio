			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your financial institution. Interac doesn't put time limits, those are enforced individually by the banks. In fact, Interac has been pushing all the banks to increase their speed with features like auto deposit.  The banks add limits to mitigate risk, as transfers can be used for fraud. Banks hate fraud.</p></div>		</li>

<p>100% instant. With auto accept on, I suppose it can only go one way, but thatâ€™s all I use it for.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't ever see people complaining about banking in Canada or most other countries, actually. Mainly just America. Shocker, guess people don't complain about things that work lol</p></div>		</li>
