			<div class="markdown"><p>Our experience with heat is very much dictated by humidity. Physiologists measure temperature as humans will experience it by wrapping a thermometer bulb in a wet cloth and reading the temperature. That accounts for evaporative cooling.</p>
<p>At 100% relative humidity, humans dies at surprisingly low temperatures: 95°F/35°C. It's estimated healthy people cannot last more than 6 hours at that wet bulb temperature in shade, completely inactive. Also estimated that due to global warming, by 2050, that wet bulb temperature will occur in various populated areas of the planet.</p></div>		</li>
