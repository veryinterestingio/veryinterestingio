			<div class="markdown"><p>A healthy predator-prey population would definitely allow for conditions that result in dense plant growth. But it's very important to also observe the composition of these thick undergrowth areas. Just because there's a lot of plants doesn't mean it's all the good stuff.
Invasives (non-native, easily outcompete natives) and interfering vegetation (native, easily outcompete other natives) can take over an entire area and make it seem like the forest is healthy, when in fact it's lost its complexity completely. Without a diverse understory, the forest lacks the ability to sustain a diverse array of wildlife. </p>
<p>Climate can also greatly impact the growth you are seeing! That's a great point, as many have stated in this post, when the resources are available the plants will flourish. Light is often the limiting factor for plants, but a long growing season can reduce this impact given that the plants have more time to find their spot and thrive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a great show on PBS (I think NOVA) that was talking about this.  The show was on Keystone Species and how removing a keystone species from an area has a massive chain reaction effect.  </p>
<p>I don't hunt but I respect those that do because they are doing the job of the predators that aren't here anymore.</p></div>		</li>
