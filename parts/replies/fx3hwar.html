			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a thing on the science channel or something like 10 years ago that was speculating on how life on Earth would evolve if humans left. In their world spiders had evolved a bit and mice were the last mammals. </p>
<p>The spiders set up huge webs across crevasses that would catch seeds. The spiders would then use the seeds to feed the mice, which were eventually eaten. They farmed them like cattle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could see that happening. We get some pretty big wolf spiders out here. They could easily take out a small field mouse. I have personally seen a wolf spider that had a leg span larger than my outstretched hand. They live for up to 5 years I think. </p>
<p>The house I lived in before was in the tarantula migration path from Mexico to Oklahoma. We were the only house there for a long time. I'd sit out on my porch at night and I'd see dinner plate sized spiders come out from their day time hiding spots and start hunting. We never had rodent issues, no crickets, no June bugs, and we lived in the middle of a big field. Really scary when they come up on the porch with you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chickens eat almost anything. My chickens are in a coop and 2200 sq ft run that is covered and protected from predators. The spiders build webs all around the coop and run. When I let the flock free roam, I didn't have spiders as much. But I lost over 45 birds to predators in a single year. So I built them a run with swings, a slide, tons of perches, automatic feeders and waterers. They are happy chickens now and I get 3 to 4 dozen eggs a day from them 9 months of the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Orb Weaver spiders build giant classic spider webs, usually building in the evening, eating overnight, then pulling their web back in the morning so they can recycle the material the next day.  Good chance those are the types of spiders you have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do have several orb weaver spiders, St Andrew's Cross I think. I definitely leave them alone and encourge them to build their webs on and around the house. They take care of so many flying, and non-flying, pests.</p>
<p>I did not think that the ones around the run were weavers, but after looking at some of the webs on the Google machine, I think you might be right. the webs are tough, big, and they are always gone in the morning but they pop up in almost the same spot night after night. They are beautiful bits of architechture, I am always amazed at the way they reach up into the trees and anchor to the bushes, or various parts of my run.</p></div>		</li>
