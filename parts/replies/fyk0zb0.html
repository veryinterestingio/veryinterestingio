			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add mapping the clouds of dust and gas, as well. You can measure the distance of these constituents of our galaxy and see their direction in our sky, so you can map out their location in three-dimensional space. For objects in our quadrant of the galaxy, these data are reasonably complete and accurate. For objects farther away, or on the other side of the galactic core, the data quality really falls off, as intervening dust, gas, and stars block the photons. When you see a painting of our galaxy, objects on the opposite side of the disk from us are largely best guesses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't get enough parallax from different points on the earth to map anything outside the solar system. The distances are just too vast. Using the earth's orbit around the sun, you can measure the parallax to close stars with ground based telescopes. The Gaia satellite has mapped positions of hundreds of millions of stars in the Milky Way using parallax at an orbit wider than the earth's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to that, by measuring radiation in the form of the light spectrum, we can accurately determine the chemical composition of the stars and gas clouds, allowing us to give an educated guess on the color of the star naturally (we are at a distance that can cause red/blue shifting) as well as an estimate of what the star smells like!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And by measuring the Doppler shift of the Hydrogen line in that light (well EM radiation) we can determine if the gas clouds are moving towards us or away from us. This lets us show that the galaxy has large sale structure of Arms/ Bars and voids. </p>
<p>(My last school project was collecting and analyzing radio astronomy data and creating a top down map of the galaxy - with only a few hours of data we could see multiple arms! Made pretty pictures too)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For objects that are on the other side of the core and aren't as able to accurately mapped, do you happen to know if, say something like rotational symmetry is assumed in the estimation? Or in general are galaxies (or specifically the Milky Way) not able to be considered rotationally symmetric at the level of detail that we can map close objects to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by “rotational symmetry.” If you are asking whether our knowledge of the location of, say, the Eagle Nebula suggests that if we look in a rotationally symmetric location then we would find another nebula, the answer is no. However, if you are asking whether the general structure of the “arms” of the galaxy on the opposite side of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/pia19341-nasa_denilso_camargo_rev_v05.jpg" target="_blank">core</a> are in part based on an assumption of rotational symmetry, then the answer is yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I've always wondered about this though, is that - the galaxy is 100,000 light years across. So we're seeing stars in different parts of their orbits around the galactic center, relative to where they actually are &quot;now&quot; - I.e. The location they would appear to be if light traveled instantly. Closer stars appear closer to where they are now, while further away stars, appear far from where they are now. How is this corrected for, if at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An orbit around the galaxy takes in the neighborhood of 200 million years. 100,000 ly of time lag is only an error of 0.05%. You could account for it if you really wanted to, since it's predictable, but it doesn't really have an effect on the overall shape of the galaxy. If it were an obvious effect, all the other galaxies we see in the sky would have time lag distortions too, and they don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No need to correct for it. Nothing moves faster than light, so observed positions are as good as you need. Also, the disk moves (mostly) at an (almost) uniform rotation rate, which was the first observational anomaly that led to the theory of dark matter.</p></div>		</li>
