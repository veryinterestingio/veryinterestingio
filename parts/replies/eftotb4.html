<p>I see fewer calls for this sort of ban in the US.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's because there are significantly fewer diesel vehicles, for a couple of reasons. The US historically had much stricter diesel regulations than the EU with regards to NOx and particulates. Further, because the US didn't tax petrol like the EU, there wasn't a huge economic push to switch to diesel either. Diesel has also regularly been more expensive than petrol.
To put that in raw numbers, in 2013, 72% of new cars sold in Portugal were diesel. At the same time in the US, ~1.5% of vehicles were diesels, and ~80% of them were sold by VW Group.</p></div>		</li>
