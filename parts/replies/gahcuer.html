<p>I would paraphrase or cut and paste, but it doesn't seem fair to steal their thunder. </p>

<p>I, however, have got no respect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roasting and baking are both common cooking methods. Perhaps you’ve baked chicken breasts, roasted a whole chicken or a mix of root vegetables, or at the very least enjoyed a slice of baked cake. But do you know the difference between them?</p>
<p>These terms are used interchangeably quite often, but what really sets them apart? Are roasting and baking actually the same thing?</p>
<p><strong>Dry Heat Cooking</strong></p>
<p>Roasting and baking are both dry heat cooking methods. These cooking techniques use hot air to conduct heat, typically at 300°F or higher.</p>
<p>Both methods brown the exterior of the food, adding delicious flavor (think: crispy chicken skin and crusty bread). While roasting used to signify food cooked over an open flame, roasting today is done in an oven.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the Difference Between Roasting and Baking?</strong></p>
<p>While these cooking methods are nearly identical in today’s kitchen, there are actually a few things that set them apart.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Structure of the food</strong>: This is the primary factor that sets these cooking methods apart. Roasting involves cooking foods that already have a solid structure before the cooking process begins (think: meat and vegetables). Baking involves that foods that lack structure early on, then become solid and lose their “empty space” during the cooking (think: cakes and muffins).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temperature</strong>: Various sources note that the temperature setting on the oven also distinguishes these two cooking method. Roasting requires a higher temperature (400°F and above) to create a browned, flavorful “crust” on the outside of the food being cooked, while baking occurs at lower oven temperatures (up to 375°F).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fat content</strong>: While many baked goods contain fat within, an outer coating of fat, such as vegetables or meat brushed with olive oil, is an indicator of roasting.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Covered pan</strong>: Roasting is typically done in an open, uncovered pan, while items that are baked may be covered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which Method Is Right for Your Recipe?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re cooking food that has a solid structure — like any type of meat or vegetables — no matter the temperature of the oven, you’ll roast it.</p>
<p>If you’re cooking food that doesn’t already have a solid structure, but will after it’s cooked — like muffins, cake, bread, and casseroles — the proper method is baking.</p>
<p>Simple enough, right?</p>

<p>Whereas I just googled it.</p>
<p>Also, I wasn't certain of the sub rules, and honestly, was too sleepy to make myself check before commenting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In case you still haven't checked, posting the link without also writing out the information in that link as a top-level comment violates part of Rule 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comments must be written. They can't be links to other posts, images or videos. Comments can include those, but they can't be the primary content. Links can and do die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't have to copy and paste the article, merely paraphrasing the core details is sufficient. The idea is that no one should ever have to follow a link from a top-level comment to get the explanation for their question. A link can be used as a source for credibility or further reading, but all the explanation required for the question must be in the comment.</p></div>		</li>
