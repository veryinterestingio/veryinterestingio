<p>5’ non structural proteins for self amplification and the 3’ ends of the mRNA are capped. </p>

<p>I'm sorry... as a carpenter this looks like it says &quot;5 foot long proteins&quot; but that can't be right can it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For both RNA and DNA, 5' (five prime) and 3' (three prime) refer to specific ends of the molecule, based on the bond orientation of the molecular backbone. These terms are just helpful for distinguishing the two sides of mRNA, since there are different things going on on each end. You can look up the structure of mRNA to get a better idea of the &quot;cap&quot; this guy mentions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5' and 3' refers to the position of the C atom in the (desoxy)ribose molecule/sugar ring [for DNA it's desoxyribose, hence the D and for RNA ribose, R]. To the 5' C a phosphate group is attached and to the 3' C an OH group. A DNA strand or a RNA has a phosphate (desoxy)ribose backbone, which is a chain of phosphate group to (desoxy)ribose connections. On one end the phosphate group is on the outside and because that's connected to the 5' C, it's called the 5' end. And on the other end the OH group, attached to tje (desoxy)ribose is on the outside, that's the 3' end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally think 5’ as feet too! It’s to specify the direction of the strand, since RNA polymerase can only read in one direction. It should read as 5 prime and 3 prime.</p>
<p>DNA has a sugar/phosphate backbone, the sugar has 5 carbons that help make it’s ring-like shape. 5’ means the strand ends at the phosphate group attached to the 5th carbon, and 3’ ends at a hydroxyl (OH) group attached to the 3’ carbon.</p></div>		</li>
