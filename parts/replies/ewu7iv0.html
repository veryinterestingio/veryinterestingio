			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd point out this applies to the US. In most of the first world countries the situation is a lot better. Intra-bank transfers are pretty much instantaneous, cheque deposits are extinct, never saw one in my life. Even in developing countries (East EU, Asia, etc) the banking system is state of the art, very similar to first world countries, often times it's the same international banks and they offer the same services.</p></div>		</li>

People still deposit checks here, but those usually also clear immediately (they always have a disclaimer that it's not final for a small amount of time, but the money shows in your balance immediately), and you can deposit with your phone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another thing, and I don't know if you can explain this, but to do instant transfers between different banks in my country we need to use a phone number rather than a bank account. All banks seem to have this capability but can't just instantly transfer using bank account number. WTF?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A situation which isn't improving with fewer and fewer 'original' COBOL developers out there. While it's not impossible to learn COBOL today to read and understand the code base, knowing the mindset, the 'style' and all the quirks from back in the day is still considered valuable when it comes to understanding code from that period.  </p>
<p>That also means that if you wake up one day and suddenly remember you worked with some COBOL 30 years ago, banks would throw money at you for just being around....</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a person working with payment systems in a bank, this made me laugh for several minutes. Thank you for that.</p>
<p>Banks have an enormous amount of legacy systems, banks were some of the first to introduce computers, and funnily enough these have to be extremely stable. So working from the perspective, if it work, don't fix it, the technical debt slowly accumulates to the point where someone says, let's change this.</p>
<p>But now all the old programmers who made the old code, without documentation or comments, in a dead programming language don't work there anymore. The price-tag for fixing goes through the roof, and it's hard making a business case for getting this changed.  Because what is the shareholder value, in the short term, for using 1 billion for fixing back-end systems.</p>
<p>So IT have to sneak a slow update in through other projects, &quot;Well we can't make that, unless we fix this part&quot;. Important to choose small sections to upgrade, or else the whole project gets too expensive.</p>
<p>But now the upgrade happens staggered, with no real oversight, and causes it's own technical debt, and creates more legacy systems.</p>
<p>On top of this pile of shit, most larger banks is actually a merger of at least 2 banks, but more likely 10-15 banks, with each of their of IT systems, that is taped together, and mashed into a single box.</p>
<p>Still haven't met a developer whos soul hasn't been eroded by the chaos that is bank IT.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In some major industries, like banks, being correct is more important than being fast. Computers are a mathematical machine - if it's correct now, it will be correct 50 years from now. Those systems are ridiculously difficult to change, and if things go wrong - it has disastrous consequences. </p>
<p>Unless strictly neccessary, those systems in place are not changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the computers that are slow. When the batches go through they process plenty fast. It's the ACH batching system that because of tradition and payments being routed through a Federal reserve bank or two if the paying &amp; receiving banks are in different regions and that they don't even process on weekends because of &quot;banking hours.&quot; </p>
<p>Rich people can wait for their money because they've already got plenty. But the experience &amp; results for normal people are problematic. I worked in banking for several years &amp; have spoken to customers &amp; friends who buy and sell classic cars. Because handing over the keys &amp; car when you have to wait 3 or more days for a transfer to clear they all use cash. </p>
<p>We're talking about people walking around with tens of thousands of dollars to make a purchase and risking the police confiscating it if they get pulled over. Not to mention the tax evasion possible when doing large transactions in cash. Because cashiers checks are faked too. Due to customer history I decided to check on a large one and called the issuing credit union. And they told me that they don't even issue cashier checks, not a service they offered. Dealt with plenty of fraud victims who had cashiers checks as well that were frauds. </p>
<p>If we had instant transfers then it would really make for a better society all the way around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I realize the computers aren't slow, but this is an ELI5, and it's a bit hard to explain the difference between batch oriented and event driven software architectures to a 5 year old - but you're welcome to try ;-)</p>
<p>And yes, instant clearing is absolutely the future - I think every bank will agree to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, somewhat tangential question: why not accompany the purchaser to their bank and have a cashier’s check issued in front of you before accepting it? I’ve assumed this is how I would do a major purchase with a stranger.</p></div>		</li>
