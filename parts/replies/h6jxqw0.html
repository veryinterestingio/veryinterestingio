			<div class="markdown"><p>An aside to this is that Japan effectively has almost no military spending compared to most comparable nations. Following the treaty after ww2 the US has been holding the reigns for Japan's protection and pretty much paying for it all out of pocket. They use that capital for industry since they have no military to fund.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This opens up all that money that would go into the military to be spent elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All that trillions of dollars going into education and technology would have made earth a totally different place. Hell, we might have been walking on Mars by now.</p>
<p>Of course that would be reliant on all of us getting fucking along with each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not necessarily true, military spending is capped at 1 percent of GDP in Japan, which is lower than most major powers but no by so much. England is only 2 percent of GDP and America is 3.7 percent. Japans large economy actually means it has a high amount of military spending overall. Although that doesn't really detract from the point that there's not excessive military spending.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's mostly fake though - lots of empty construction projects (due to corruption), useless infrastructure (arguably infrastructure gets the most budget anywhere in China), runaway city development with absolutely no rules whatsoever (just money and/or corruption)... Just going between HK and GuangZhou you immediately notice the huge difference between continental China and its neighbours.</p></div>		</li>
