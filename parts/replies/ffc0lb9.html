<p>I know there are subs with airlocks for divers to exit/enter, but these - as I understand it - are an exception rather than the norm.</p>

<p>So far as has been acknowledged, there is a single <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawolf-class_submarine#Design" target="_blank"><em>Seawolf</em> class submarine</a> equipped with a Multi-mission Platform, the <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-navy-has-one-nuclear-spy-submarine-so-secret-we-know-24603" target="_blank">USS Jimmy Carter</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All LAs, Seawolfs, VAs, and the OMFGs of the Ohio class all have dedicated lockout chambers. USS Jimmy Carter has a different kind that's theorized to be on the belly of it, so it can deploy UUVs (unmanned underwater vessels) for tapping communication lines for espionage</p></div>		</li>

<p>In a sub, there's only really a few ways to get out 'normally' and they aren't airlocks. They're watertight hatches that lead to the deck. Once submerged you are not really supposed to be able to get in or out easily.</p>

<p>Not entirely true, most military submarines have an airlock, usually called an &quot;escape trunk&quot; or &quot;lockout trunk&quot;.  This is used for emergency escape and rescue, and also to deploy SEAL teams underwater.</p>
<p>Here's a rather terrifying instructional video from World War 2:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most every modern submarine has a lockout chamber for divers. Type 209s, 212s, Virginias, Barracudas, Los Angeles, etc etc etc all have lockout chambers. Afterall, deploying special forces is one of the main jobs of attack submarines, nuclear and non nuclear alike.</p></div>		</li>
