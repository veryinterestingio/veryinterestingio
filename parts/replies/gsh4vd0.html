			<div class="markdown"><p>On the Lorentz invariance -- could this have been momentary?</p>
<p>I suppose to zoom out, if c is changing, then it's a little whacky to even define what &quot;over time&quot; means, right? Like, presumably, the information that c has changed also has to travel at c, right? Otherwise you need to assume some sort of spontaneity, which as I understand, is non-physical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few camps of VSL cosmologies.  Some completely break Lorentz invariance.  Some only preserve Lorentz invariance locally.  But all of them break it on some scale, at all times.</p>
<p>Regarding the notion that information travels at c, some VSL theories set a different speed that gravity is communicated at (so-called bimetric theories).  In those models, gravitational info can be communicated faster than c.  </p>
<p>But otherwise, yes, info travels at c.  <a href="https://www.ws5.com/spacetime/spacetime.jpg" target="_blank">If we think about a 'light cone' that can show all possible past states and all possible future states</a>, the 'past' cone would be wider than the future cone, and both would have curvature based on how c changes over time.  Some point in the early universe would have a wide enough cone that all observable space could be in communication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense, what's harder to get my head around is how it looks for Mage. Or I guess to put it another way -- is the rate of change of c fixed per observer? Is the <em>value of c</em> at some past moment dependent on the frame of the observer? Maybe this is where the preferential frame comes in.</p>
<p>Here's the thought experiment I'm considering: at some point in the past, a laser shines from a source to a receiver (at rest relative to each other) and if it's hit on an even nanosecond (in the receivers frame) the receiver lights up green, odd then red. The speed of light in the past will determine how long it takes for the light to reach the receiver, and therefore whether it's red or green. But the value of c <em>in the receivers frame</em> is different to The current <code>c</code> in Henry or Marge's frame, and now depends on how long it's been since that event happened, but that is different in different modern frames, so would Henry and Marge disagree about the color of the light from the receiver?</p></div>		</li>
