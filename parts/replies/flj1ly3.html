			<div class="markdown"><p>So are layers of graphite... graphite isn't randomly arranged. It may or may not be perfectly regular depending on purity and crystallinity but it is still relatively conductive.</p>
<p>You wouldn't make wires out of it because it's brittle and probably not quite as conductive as copper, but it still has electrical uses here and there.</p></div>		</li>
