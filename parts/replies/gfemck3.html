			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they're referring to the effect where you can always see out to a certain distance (maybe as little as three feet) as if there was no fog there. Then it seems like suddenly the fog is thick enough to block vision completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's an illusion and you can see in a perfect fuzzy sphere but, for example, if the visibility is about 5 feet then you can see someone 5-ish feet away walking towards you but their face will appear first with their feet appearing more like 1 foot from your feet, cuz you're 5-ish feet tall. But if there's no person to look at, the only thing you'll be able to see is a 1-ish foot radius around your feet and gray on all sides. Our eyes can't measure what they can't see.</p>
<p>We've got stories in here of people who could barely see their own hands in front of their face, so it all depends on the density and how much light is available.</p>
<p>I'm sure that there's something exponential about the way light bounces off an object in fog and then reflects into your eyes, as well. For example in anechoic chambers people get real disturbed because they're used to people's voices bouncing off the walls or being accompanied by the sounds of the outdoors a little bit, but when there's nothing to echo off of a person standing and talking real close to you can sound weirdly quiet and distant especially if they're facing away from your face. As if the room is swallowing up all the sound (which it is.) The drop-off of the audible range becomes much steeper because there's no more ability for bounced noises to reach you.</p></div>		</li>
