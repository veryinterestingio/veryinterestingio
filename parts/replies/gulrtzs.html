			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone wondering plastics don't really decay, they just cut up into smaller and smaller pieces, asymptotically approaching monomer size. Stuff still can't really deal with these monomers either, so it isn't that great.</p>
<p>This process is accelerated by water, oxygen, salts, acids, UV, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some reason when thinking/talking about chemistry, the word 'decay' invariably makes me think 'radioactive decay'. I like the other words a little better, though they're all synonyms: deteriorate and degrade. I think &quot;polymers degrading towards monomers over time&quot; is a pretty good description of what you're talking about, ya know? The monomers are intact, but the bonds that hold them together are certainly breaking in that process due to any/all of the reactants you listed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case, the plastic in question reacts with water to turn into a much more brittle material. That may not be what you think of as &quot;decay,&quot; but it's not just wearing away, either. It's degrading chemically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it really is being unworn, too. The chemical process that breaks down some kinds of foam used in shoes can be slowed by mechanical stress.</p></div>		</li>
