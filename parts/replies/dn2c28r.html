			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think of the fourth dimension as a property that every point has, like temperature or density. You can then visualize this using a color gradient on the body.</p>
<p>So the first three dimensions define a point in space, and then the fourth defines the property at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall is it like finding the triple integral that defines the sphere and trying to find what order would best find the area. Like, would it be dy dx dz or dz dy dx or dx dy dz..... or am I thinking of something else, jeez it's been a while but I had the same final question</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Fubinis theorem allows us to choose the order of integration iirc. But it's not just about choosing the order of integration, it's about choosing what variables we want (xyz, r theta z, r theta phi)</p>
<p>Finding volumes of triple integrals requires great understanding of the nature of our solid to minimise work necessary 😊</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have added that, 20 years later, I've lost most of this. I have no idea about the answer to your question. I remember it was performing a series of integrals, first to get the area of a circle, then the volume of a sphere, and then the hardest step was for the 4d part. I imagine you can keep going, eh?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: think about a triangle, now a square, pentagon, hexagon. Keep adding sides like this and our shape begins approaching a circle. </p>
<p>Now picture some curve. What if we use this same process but backward to reexpress the curve as a bunch of tiny line segments? When we do this we can approximate the &quot;slope of the curve&quot; by finding the slope of a tiny, what we call &quot;infinitesimal&quot; line segment. As the lengths of these line segments approach 0 our error in approximation reduces to 0, giving us the &quot;slope of the curve&quot;</p>
<p>Another way to think about it is looking at a curve through a microscope. The more you zoom in, the more it looks like a line. Newton postulated that if you zoomed in infinitely, you'd see a line segment from which we can find the &quot;slope of the curve&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calculus in essence is dealing with infinitely small things. With the tape, you are making each segment smaller and smaller until each section is infinitely small and all the segments form a circle rather than a polygon. </p>
<p>Relating the the comment you replied to, calc 1 deals with finding slopes of infinitely small sections of a graph (a.k.a. a point on the graph). Calc 2 deals with adding up infinitely small slices of a curve to find the area underneath. Calc 3 is just the combination of the previous two, but in 3-D</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm an electrical engineering major, but haven't really done any EE classes yet because I'm only in Calc 1.  But if I enjoy the math, I'm wondering if there's a better degree for me.</p></div>		</li>
