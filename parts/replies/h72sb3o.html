			<div class="markdown"><p>For me songs are huge memory bells. As soon as a certain song starts , the video player in my mind starts to play the  video that goes w/ the song. My emotions, smells , tastes , faces ,convos,etc.   If I have the time I will watch the video to the end , which coud last hours.  It is a gift and a huge curse to be able to recall &quot;memories&quot; in such clear focus.   My sis is the opposite , she can't recall memories of her youth well at all.    I think she uses selective memory recall.</p>
<p>Smells, esp. a perfum or  aftershave bring really pointed , clear
memory vids.  I can go back to kindergarten memories on smells, like  school chaulk. All of my school memories can be called up by steam table cooking of our school lunches. It's a horrid smell , but it is filled with memories.</p></div>		</li>
