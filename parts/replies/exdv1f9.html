			<div class="markdown"><p>It's both. In the developed world laundry fibers and other micro-pollutants are a cause for concern. But one-time use plastics are a huge source of ocean pollution. In much of the world, rivers and streams are choked with plastic bags.</p>
<p>Here are some examples: Many places in Asia sell drinks as a plastic bag with a plastic straw in it, bound together with an elastic band or piece of tape. This refuse is rarely properly disposed of. And I've been scuba diving in bays in Borneo where the bottom is just fields of sunken plastic diapers. </p>
<p>But you're right that virtually zero plastic straws from fast food places in Denver are polluting our waterways. (Bags are worse because the wind moves them further)</p></div>		</li>
