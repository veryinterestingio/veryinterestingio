			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I had no idea that the wavelength of these photons could be lost when bouncing around. Thank you!</p>
<p>Edit: A side question, how would the photon we were talking about change it's frequency? What is the mechanism behind this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absorption of the photon by a particle causes a transition into an excited state. Transition back from the excited state will cause emission of a photon. However, there are many possible transitions back, as any particle will have a number of different vibrational, rotational, and electronic/nuclear energy states with energy levels different from the initial state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like the balls on the pool table. But instead of changing velocity when they bounce, photons change linear momentum (or energy). Since a photons energy is E=h * f where f is the frequency they change frequency as they bounce. Hope this helps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nuance the grandparent is point out that isn’t intuitive is that the re emitted energy isn’t the same as the narrow band absorbed energy. (And it isn’t a finite enumerable set of higher energy level deltas either.) Otherwise the lost/gapped frequencies would just bounce around and eventually come back out intact, in the same proportion, in a stellar take a penny leave a penny mechanism. Sometimes the pennies just transmute into nickels, haypennies ,or farthings due to non-ideal atomic model behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When photons are &quot;re-emitted&quot; they don't preserve their wavelength. They have a range of wavelengths including the original. As the above commenter said, they're &quot;re-emitted&quot; as a black body spectrum. So you're going to have a significant decrease in that wavelength's intensity.</p>
<p>I think your confusion stems from you thinking re-emitting means that the photons' wavelengths are the same when re-emitted. But when the photons are absorbed they're turned into another form of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question, if you don't mind: I know the sun is mostly hydrogen, helium, and oxygen.  Why does it give such a continuous spectra if it's basically just 3 elements?  It seems like there should be more bright lines in the spectra.  Or are there, and when I see models, it's just oversimplified?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stuff in the star is ionised. So even though the elements are few, there are tons and tons of free electrons. These free electrons can scatter photons into any energy (by picking up the rest of it). That’s why it’s continuous.</p></div>		</li>
