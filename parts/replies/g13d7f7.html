<p>Water only exist in a liquid state at a narrow range if atmospheric conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solid answer to the question, but I just want to expound on this a bit for anyone curious for more. All (most?) matter has three forms: solid, liquid, gas. Atmospheric pressure and temperature affect which of these states that any given bit of matter is in. Water is no different. For water, it is diagrammed like so: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/oVzOwya.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/oVzOwya.png</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/A8NVDfj.png" target="_blank">(Here's another version I like less overall but has better axes.)</a></p>
<p>As you can tell, the combination of atmospheric pressures and temperatures that result in liquid water is somewhat narrow. All factors have to be aligned just right for oceans/liquid water to exist.</p>
<p>EDIT: My pun was entirely unintended! I think I'm starting to get the hang of this. But /u/snakely accurately pointed out that the first phase diagram I used was for a generic substance. This is probably the best diagram for water specifically: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/EG6piKB.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/EG6piKB.png</a></p>
<p>EDIT2: This kinda blew up, so here's a cool video of water at the triple-point, simultaneously freezing, boiling, and melting: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Juz9pVVsmQQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Juz9pVVsmQQ</a> (gets good at 1:10)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm imagining an Atlantis type planet, life was seeded from a enormous meteor crashing through the icy crust into the warm waters below. It's perfect really, ice freezes around the outside of the planet and now you are protected from debris and probably decently protected from radiation. It is probably really hard/impossible to ever drill through that much cold ice even if a technologically capable species had evolved ?? I mean probably not but it's insane to think what could be out there.</p>
<p>Edit: radio waves don't travel well through water and only certain kinds can penetrate ice so any seti type search for life is going to find nothing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So one thing I heard once was that life under ice might  be limited to anaerobic organisms because deep cold water covered by ice doesn’t turn over and lacks in dissolved oxygen. If there was an energy source, like a geothermal vent, you’d be limited to microbes and very simple things that can do anaerobic respiration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As fun as this idea is to think about, I think it would be impossible for an underwater species to build any type of sophisticated technology because of the lack of fire. Without that, you’re pretty much stuck using all of your energy on food, not to mention It’d be impossible to smelt metals in that environment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it is one of the possible solutions. Say for example primates never evolved on Earth, what's the next smartest animal? Dolphins?</p>
<p>Dolphins might be very clever, but without hands or the ability to use fire, they'll never start sending radio signals to space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in fact it's theorized that most planets that exist are actually rogue planets. Essentially, planets roaming through the blackness of space without an associated sun. The early history of most star system is highly chaotic, so many planetary bodies are completely ejected from orbit around their own sun, left to drift in interstellar (or intergalactic) space. </p>
<p>While most of our energy comes from the sun, it is <em>technically</em> possible that on such a planet, with a thick enough ice later, many planets could maintain liquid oceans beneath the surface. The ice layer would protect against impacts and harmful radiation, while heat from the planet core would stir hydrothermal vents and other geologic activity to continue providing fresh minerals and nutrients into the liquid layer of the ocean. </p>
<p>In this environment, it's entirely possible for living things to develop. However, it's also extremely unlikely that they would ever leave their planet. The ice layer covering their ocean would be incredibly thick, and with a lack of coal/oil, they may lack serious early fuel sources to power technological advancement (not to mention they would have no concept of suns, moons, stars, or planets). Their technological progress would likely stagnate until, eventually, the planetary core cools enough and is no longer to heat the liquid layer sufficiently, thereby allowing the entire body of water to freeze. </p>
<p>The ruins of such civilizations would then be preserved in their entirety, possibly for millions or billions of years. That means there could be floating, frozen balls with the preserved remains of past life drifting out there in space. These preserved planets could range from simple single celled organisms all the way up to complex ocean civilizations. Who knows. The simple fact that rogue planets may be so numerous, and sub-surface oceans may in fact be so common, is really enticing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also possible that we are first and most of the life that will happen in the universe won’t arise for billions to trillions of years.  We are very very early on in the life expectancy if the universe. Red dwarf stars are the most common stars and are expected to burn for 10 trillion years Or more. Compared to a pitiful 10 billion for our star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>eventually though I've heard that most things will be too far away to get to, at some point in the future civilisations will look into space and see... nothing. because everything has moved out of view. so at that point space exploration would be disappointing. and so would the outlook perhaps of the ppl in that time, they may assume that they are the only thing in an infinite blackness.</p>
<p>it would be interesting if humanity ended up being a precusor race, I think life can just happen anywhere that abiogenesis is possible whatever complex series of events have to take place so that inorganic matter somehow becomes single celled organisms which can persist long enough to become multicelled. then you have life but it could be likely that any 2 locations where this happens at the same time could be separated by billions of light years. and so will never actually meet.</p></div>		</li>
