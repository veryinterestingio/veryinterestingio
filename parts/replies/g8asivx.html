			<div class="markdown"><p>Question:</p>
<p>In fruits since they've adapted to be eaten, are the seeds spread by being leftover from what the animal doesn't eat (say a half eaten apple) or is the animal eating the seed and pooping it out later somewhere else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The latter usually. Seeds are really difficult to digest. You may have noticed this with corn. Unless you crush them with your teeth, and give them a long time to break down in your gut, most seeds will make it all the way through you intact. The animals that eat the seeds, especially birds tend to distribute their leavings over a wide range, giving the seeds a huge area to work with. Birds being so good at this is also why peppers are spicy. The chemical that makes them burn is untasteable to birds, so birds will eat the peppers, but mammals that only travel a short distance before dropping off the cargo so to speak will avoid the burning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both work, but the pooping it out is the main way as the goal is seed dispersal. This allows the seeds to be carried away from the parent plant and then pooped out into a rich, moist pile to germinate. Some seeds actually won't germinate without being passed through an animal first.</p>
<p>Fruits that aren't for eating, like burs and the helicopters, do the same thing. Helicopters use air to spread away from the parent plant, and burs hitchhike on animal's fur to be dispersed elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>
