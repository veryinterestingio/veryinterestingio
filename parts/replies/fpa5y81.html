			<div class="markdown"><p>No because that would promote bacteria and fungal growth.  There's lots of nasty bacteria that can cause bad bacterial infections.  Aside from everyone being covered in sweat, 90F and high humidity is not a good idea indoors, even though it would make covid19 not survive as long on surfaces or in the air.<br />
There's a reason hospitals are cold -- it's much safer overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to make it like a jungle. Where I live it is not exactly super humid in the summer so if we would increase the humidity to equal our normal summers and that would affects the virus it might still help.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This suggests the future potential of artificial humidification as a possible strategy to control influenza outbreaks in temperate climates. … Additional research is required, but this is the first prospective study suggesting that exogenous humidification could serve as a scalable NPI for influenza or other viral outbreaks.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not anywhere near my expertise, but from skimming it only seems to be suggesting humidification to &quot;normal&quot; recommended indoor humidity levels, not to what one would consider  &quot;kept [to] a humid condition&quot;, am I understanding it correctly?  </p>
<p>such as:
&quot;One approach is to maintain relative humidity (RH) between 40–60%, the proposed optimal range for reducing growth opportunities for viruses, bacteria, and fungi[15]. &quot;   </p>
<p>On the other hand, the WH presented slide examples were 80% humidity @ 95F for indoors without sunlight or 80% humidity @70-75F <em>with sunlight</em>.  Which is useful maybe in overnight (except it's probably very inefficient to do create those conditions every night and then re-condition the space again each day, but maybe useful just in areas when there's been an outbreak or positive case identified) but seems a stretch to suggest for working conditions.  80% seems more like what one would usually consider &quot;humid conditions&quot;, right?
The WH slides also compared to 20% humidity @70-75F (as the &quot;worst case&quot;), but that seems like it would be characterized as a very &quot;dry&quot;/&quot;low-humidity&quot; condition.</p></div>		</li>
