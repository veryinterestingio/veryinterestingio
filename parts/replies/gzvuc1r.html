			<div class="markdown"><p>the guys who survived alcohol by avoiding it, shouldn't they become better at avoiding or hiding from  hand sanitizers over time? Isn't that why deers or antelopes developed speed, to outrun the cheetahs of the world ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's just it, their question is flawed - or at least, needs to be clarified further. </p>
<p>It's a good question, but to answer it properly we need to explain why it's not actually &quot;The alcohol tries to kill 100% of germs, but 0.01% survive after being exposed to the alcohol&quot;. </p>
<p>If that was the case, it would be more likely to have alcohol resistant germs growing from the use of hand sanitizer - as OP suggests.</p>
<p>The commenter's 2nd and 3rd point are <strong>why</strong> it's not 0.01% that survive. It's: a) the claim isn't 99.99% because that's what they kill, it's 99.99% is the most they want to legally claim without opening themselves up to possible litigation, and b) the improper use of the sanitizer &amp; difficulty of getting it in every nook and cranny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coat hands in sanitizer and let it dry after vigorous rubbing, or coat and use clean towels to rub/brush off the sanitizer while applying lots of force followed by a another normal coat and dry.  The last method works well for getting the smell of ferrets off my hands.  Guessing the alcohol suspends the oils from the ferrets long enough for the towels to scrape them off.</p></div>		</li>
