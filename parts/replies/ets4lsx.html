			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the information! On the topic of those lasers, about 10 years ago my school upgraded their projectors to super modern laser ones with big ol warnings ‘do not stare into the light’. Well what would cause a temporary sharp pain after a very very brief stare into one of these mini-suns? Is it a sign of permanent damage? I’ve been to the opticians many many times since and nothing’s been said, but I always wondered what caused that brief 5ish second long sharp head pain that day...  </p>
<p>Sorry that was a bloody long ramble for a pretty simple question  aha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love how you give advice, it’s accurate and has a bit of spunk. I’ve laughed while reading your above comments. Plus they’re factually correct. You should do this more often if you don’t already!</p>
<p>Ps. I live in Arizona and need to buy sunglasses that I don’t feel scammed buying, any personal favorites that aren’t from the evil monopoly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laser video projectors (like laser DLPs; not talking about micromirror miniature laser projectors or light show/event laser scanners here) aren't like laser pointers, in that they do not produce a single collimated (focused) beam of light. They just use lasers as a light source for technical reasons. They need to have warnings for legal reasons, but they shouldn't be much more dangerous than regular projectors.</p>
<p>Basically what ends up mattering is how much light hits your eye and how well it can be focused by your eye onto the retina. This is going to be about the same for equally bright video projectors, regardless of what technology they use to generate the light. While there are some subtleties that can matter (e.g. some wavelengths are more dangerous than others, and laser-based projectors can have deeper colors, like a deeper blue, that could be more dangerous), it's not like shining a laser pointer into your eye.</p>
<p>So I'd say you're probably fine. If you'd gotten zapped by a higher power laser pointer I'd be more worried.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some laser projectors actually shoot collimated beams, one for each pixel, they stay focused at any distance (within reason). Are you saying it's only the picoprojectors that work like that? I thought that was a somewhat common approach for all sizes...</p></div>		</li>

<p>when an area is bleached relative to another area the signal becomes muted as the cells regenerate (can take up to 5 seconds for most people....)</p>

<p>I knew that! (Kinda)</p>
<p>I do lighting for theatre. The factory default time for a light cue on most lighting consoles is 5 seconds. I learned somewhere along the way that it takes about that long for people to notice that lights have changed. </p>
<p>Thanks for teaching me <em>why</em>.</p></div>		</li>
