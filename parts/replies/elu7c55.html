			<div class="markdown"><p>One instance of this is the Black Cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa or balsamifera depending who you ask) which is a floodplain species in the Pacific Northwest. Germination of these Cottonwood seeds require very specific flooding patterns during the short window that they release their plethora (millions) of seeds.</p>
<p>Even then, the seedlings that germinate are heavily prone to desiccation due to germination in an unshaded floodplain as most trees within the floodplain eventually become Large Woody Debris (LWD) contributions to the river. </p>
<p>Not to mention the requirement of specific substrate and nutrients, the cycles of which have been heavily altered due to land use changes.</p></div>		</li>
