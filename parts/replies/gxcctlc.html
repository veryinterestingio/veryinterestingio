			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an accident when I was 10 and lost feeling in a bit of my left hand. Since then it just feels different if I think about it and have had no problems with left and right. Just instantly know cause of that.
So you are correct!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah its really weird thinking about it, when I want to know left and right my brain looks for the weird feeling in my left hand and instantly knows. Other than that I don't ever notice it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I've always been bad with left and right; at 18, I lost my sense of heat/pain on the right side of my body below the armpit, but that didn't change anything. I wonder if I was just too old at that point? Or maybe if I had lost sensation in my right hand, too, it would have been different? After all, you explore the world with your hands, but not exactly with your right armpit, haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same for me! I have a really fucked up shoulder so I always know which side is left, cause it's the side that hurts like holy hell and where my arm's hanging a bit limp</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's weird that this doesn't work for me. I've had cerebral palsy predominantly (by a hell of a lot) affecting my right side since birth, and I confuse my left and right so much it's become a joke in my friend group. I also confused my b's and d's until like third grade. Maybe having a change later in life has a more predominant affect, maybe I'm just a bit dim. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or maybe different sources of disability (CP vs physical injury etc) have a different effect on your left/right ability. Different people do seem naturally better/worse at this to begin with though. It would take a much bigger sample size to see if there's any effect.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's definitely possible. It would be neat to see an actual study done on this question.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I contracted a spinal cord injury at age 18 leading to partial sensation loss on my right side only. I'm just as bad with left and right as I ever was.</p></div>		</li>
