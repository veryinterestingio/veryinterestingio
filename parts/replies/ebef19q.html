<p>every other post forgets that you can have 1080p signal but if they have shitty bitrate it looks worse than netflix.</p>
<p>This is also why you can see differencesin stream qualuty with viaplay vs netflix vs any other streaming site.</p>
<p>you could tamper with netflix bitrate on your browser to increase it and it made color edges much more sharp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And their bitrate is significantly lower as well.</p>
<p>And their compression needs to be more robust because there is no buffering or resending of lost information, so it is a lot less efficient. But I guess that is basically just what you said... :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say that resolution says <strong>nothing</strong> about it's quality.</p>
<p>Given the same algorithm and an equivalent bitrate, a lower resolution video will look worse than a higher resolution one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. That depends. At lower bitrates lower resolution will often look better for example.</p></div>		</li>
