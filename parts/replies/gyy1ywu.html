			<div class="markdown"><p>Plasma basically works like OLED, each pixel is separate and can be turned off to create true black. Main difference is that they use a gas (like a neon light) rather than a diode. </p>
<p>The energy use isn't anything insane, about 20% more than a comparable LCD.</p>
<p>Plasma is just plain more expensive to make, and once OLED became viable, it didn't really offer any extra advantage for that extra cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually upgraded from a Panasonic VT50 plasma to a LG CX model.</p>
<p>Picture differences aside, the weight difference between those two panels was crazy.  It's certainly not tube heavy, but it was in its own weight class.</p>
<p>So far as picture, blacks are incredibly inky on both.  The OLED however with HDR support blows the plasma away.  It's made IMO a bigger difference to picture quality than going 1080p to 4k ever did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, the weight is kind of nuts. My 60&quot; was just shy of 100lbs, without the stand. </p>
<p>While the newer OLED stuff is certainly has more vibrant colors, the plasmas still have some of the best color accuracy you can find. </p>
<p>Every test I've seen shows that the Panasonic and Pioneer panels were basically perfect when it comes to color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>QLED is &quot;Quantum Dot.&quot; The general idea is that when you stimulate a quantum dot, it produces pure, monochromatic depending on the dot's  size.</p>
<p>The TVs that have a quantum dot layer stimulate them with the backlight. They use a blue backlight (because blue LEDs can hit the right color primary) and use that to stimulate red and green quantum dots. This lets you get a wider color gamut and higher brightness than a traditional LCD. So the QLED stuff does make a difference, but it's fundamentally still an LCD with an LED backlight.</p>
<p>The waters are also getting muddier with what &quot;LED TV&quot; means. There are starting to be displays that work like a OLED, except they use regular (but very tiny) LEDs. I've seen this called Micro LED, but I'm sure manufacturers will come up with all kinds of silly and confusing names as it come to the market...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IPS panel LCDs are pretty high end. They look crisp and have great color reproduction and the colors look good from many viewing angles. I use an IPS panel as my second monitor and I can see the difference if I put a window between my TN panel and my IPS panel.</p></div>		</li>
