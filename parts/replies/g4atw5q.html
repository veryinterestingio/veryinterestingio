<p>Yes, both Uranus and Neptune have magnetic fields, and they're both weird.</p>
<p>On both planets, the magnetic fields are tilted at a large angle relative to the rotation axis, as well as being off-center. This unusual shape is a by-product of the field being generated in a shallow shell rather than right at the core.</p>
<p>We believe that instead of liquid iron being responsible for the field, Uranus and Neptune use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superionic_water" target="_blank">superionic water</a> for their magnetic field dynamos. If you squeeze regular water under incredible pressure, the oxygens lock into a crystal matrix while the hydrogen ions are free to flow within the matrix. If you had a lump of it sitting on your kitchen table, it would look a lot like slush, but the free flowing hydrogen ions means it could also conduct electricity.</p></div>		</li>
