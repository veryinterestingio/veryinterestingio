Just thought I’d throw it in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only dolphins. A lot of bird species, especially near big cities, are singing with a higher pitch and with simpler songs, to be understood over the low rumble of traffic.</p>
<p>Cats developed new types of mieow, to emulate the human voice. Dogs are able to make up to 117 different noises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Killer Whales even have dialects unique to pods that are also passed down through generations. </p>
<p>I once had a guy on Imgur argue with me trying to say that dogs are smarter than orcas based on the fact that dogs are more easily trainable. </p>
<p>I'm like, ignoring the fact that SeaWorld was a thing (unfortunately), orcas fucking use deductive and constructive reasoning to figure out their hunts. Referencing the video where 3 orcas figure out how to get a seal off of a chunk of ice. So they decide to create a wave by swimming and swinging their tails in unison to knock the seal off. And when that wasn't enough, they brought 3 more friends and made a bigger wave. </p>
<p>WHEN HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A DOG (OR WOLVES FOR THAT MATTER) DO THAT KIND OF MATH</p>
<p>Yeah wolves are great hunters. Intelligent even. But I don't think I've ever heard of anything <em>that</em> advanced from a pack of wolves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, that LA pod took down that Great White Shark by immoblizing it. They turned upside down, because they know that sharks become immobile when in that position, ate the liver only, and let it die. The other great white sharks in the area all fled further off shore.</p>
<p>It is theorized, that they did that because the hunting grounds off the coast of California were overcrowded. The Orcas knew that Sharks become repulsed by the blood of their own species, they killed one in order to open up the hunting grounds for themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the sky is the limit on how intelligent Orcas actually are, although we'll probably never know for sure. I went on an Orca watching tour in Victoria BC and the leader of the expedition absolutely swore that he has hard evidence that Orcas can basically analyze your organs for disease, pregnancy, cancerous growths, pretty much whatever. It sounded like conspiracy theory at first, but the more I listened, the more amazing it got. No idea how much truth was there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs are incredibly smart, but in an emotional intelligence kind of way. We’ve been carefully selecting certain traits in dogs over 10,000 years and we’ve ended with an emotionally intelligent animal that can read us  humans and communicate with us. Not comparable to the kind of intelligence an orca shows, but both are impressive. And wolves aren’t even close to modern dogs anymore, so they shouldn’t be compared.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can't remember if the exact word used was smart or intelligent, but I think I should have tried to ask them to define word &quot;smart&quot; first.. That would have been a smart move.</p></div>		</li>
