			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit to add that this is from someone who went from a BMI of 37.14 to 22. 80+ lbs. and counting. CICO got me to a normal weight with a skinnyfat body. Working out made me strong, and has made moving feel <em>amazing</em>.</p>
<p>I’m 30f and this year I’ve really started to get into yoga, stretching, weight training and all that good stuff for your core and what not, as well as cardio, for my cardiovascular system (hence the name, y’all).</p>
<p>I already feel much better, stronger and more energized. If I keep this up, I will 100% feel and <em>be</em> better in my 30’s than I was in my 20’s, purely because now, I’m actually taking care of my machine.</p>
<p>That’s the thing about exercise, people lament it, say shit like “I hate it,” or “It’s just not for me.”</p>
<p>When in reality, it should be for <em>everyone</em>, everyone’s machine needs maintenance, if you want to keep it running and keep it running smoothly.</p>
<p>It’s like have a nice car, and every year, it gets a little shittier. And all these people are saying “An oil change just isn’t for me,” or “I hate mechanics, and refuse to learn how to do it myself.” And they keep putting diesel into a petrol car, fucking up the insides.</p>
<p>You could have had an extra 10-30 years with that car, and/or it could have run so much smoother the entire time you had it. But you just didn’t want to put in the necessary work.</p>
<p>And they don’t seem to realise that this is <em>the only car they will ever have.</em>
When it stops working, you’re dead. Bye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 57, i'm in better shape now then i've ever been. I bike 40+ miles 2x a week, and do yoga. I look younger (genetics) and feel younger then i did when i had little kids. I think alot of it is genetics, and also maintaining your body/health - though i'm known to hit up Popeyes/MickyD's once in awhile. Balance.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, having small kids is hard on the body. Especially for someone who has problems eating their emotions.
When my older boys were little, I gained a bunch of weight and felt awful. Then I got into running and lost a ton of weight, felt great.
Now, my youngest is turning one this week. I don't have time to run as often as I used to. (from 4+ miles 5-6 days per week, down to 3 miles maybe 3 days a week when I am lucky.)
Plus, I find myself making poor food choices out of convenience and fatigue. My weight is only holding steady because of all the calories breastfeeding burns, but that is almost over so I am going to have to get it together.
They are little for such a short season though. It really is worth every bit of headache!</p></div>		</li>
