			<div class="markdown"><p>Oooh, this is a very interesting question to consider. Purely using ABO classification, I would make a &quot;scientific&quot; argument for blood type O.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is some evidence that shows Type O blood type is associated with less inflammation and a lower risk of coronary heart disease. With the added benefit of showing some protection against malaria.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's all circumstantial though and depends on what is 'best' for any given individual at any given time. If a patient desperately needed a blood transfusion, they would want to be Type AB so that they could receive from anyone. If a person they loved needed a transfusion they might want to be type O negative so that they could donate to them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's important to remember that health and well being are not made or broken by blood type. Genetics, environment and lifestyle are the foundations of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, Kell isn't a classic blood type in the way that ABO and the Bombay phenotype are. Kell is more akin to the whole Rhesus factor range of antigens, like E, e, C, and c, though they are not genetically related. However, you are correct in that, from a clinical standpoint, it is very important, and incompatible Kell transfusions can lead to very nasty outcomes (but not as lethal as ABO incompatibility). </p>
<p>One facility I worked at in the past had a policy of only giving Kell-negative blood to mothers, just to prevent them from forming Anti-Kell. The facility I now work at has no such policy, and I've noticed a lot of patients in the area express anti-Kell, so that kind of policy is clearly a good idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are more than the common types already. </p>
<p>Rare blood types and donations related to that are a big deal. Imagine how hard getting a transfusion becomes when there's only a few people in the world with compatible blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a paper suggesting that canker sores or 'aphthous ulcers'  may be linked to rhesus factor - which is the positive/negative after ABO classification. I will link below. It also touches on a few other interesting links between blood types and disease in the discussion section. </p>
