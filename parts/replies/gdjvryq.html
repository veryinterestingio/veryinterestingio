			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this fun question! </p>
<p>I think the best part is definitely the fieldwork-- hiking, camping on glaciers, boating to the Antarctic, that kind of stuff. It's beautiful and lonely and I love it.  That first warm shower when you get out of the field after 2 weeks to a month is also glorious.</p>
<p>The worst parts are the cold (funnily enough, but it can be kind of tough) and the worrying. Loving the Arctic is hard right now because it means that you are always worried about losing something that you love. It can be heart-wrenching, being just one person trying to make a big difference. That's part of why it's so fun that so many people have joined this conversation-- it's nice to talk it over with a larger group!</p></div>		</li>
