			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they “sew” the veins they do repair?</p>
<p>Oddball thought, could they have something like a small “stint” but with center facing external teeth...like a reverse/external Chinese finger trap? Maybe overlapping the tissue “tube” and just using a device to hold and compress the overlapping tissue together?</p>
<p>Or do they have a much more sensible way to bond small delicate tissues like that and seal them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sutures are used for almost everything, especially for arteries and veins. Stents can be used in blood vessels but not often due to the risk of blood clots. We even have cryovein substitutes and bovine pericardium for artery repair. You can also harvest nonessential arteries/veins from other areas of the body to use as autologous grafts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they do all those techniques, but the real answer is mostly 'none of the techniques are great&quot; they always have a leaky messy, sewn together mess. It's really not meant to be a perfect repair, it's meant to be a repair good enough the body can fix it. </p>
<p>Like go get stitches for a big cut, they do like 5 big stitches across everything that make even more holes in you. but that is 100% fine, because you can fix the rest yourself. </p>
<p>the connections they make when sewing you up are just good enough, then the body makes the real connections after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>some, veins are pretty good at growing back, nerves aren't great. Because veins are like, a bunch of microscopic cells. if one dies who cares. grow another one. A nerve is a bunch of very long individual cells. if you cut an inch long nerve cell in the middle you lose that whole inch of nerve cell. Nerve cells can grow back and you do get some function back, but growing a whole new inch of cells and getting it to line up is a lot rougher than growing back a micrometer of new cells to connect up the two parts of a vein. </p>
<p>In surgery we do our best to mash the ends of nerves close as possible and do things like graft nerves in the holes, and that helps, but nerves are just super long cells, some even a foot or more long, and you can't fix them if they get cut, and just have to hope for long slow regrowth that is always only sort of okay. </p>
<p>People that lose an arm and get it reattached usually have a very very long period of the arm being dead and then after some years get up to like 60% motion and some pretty bad problems with numbness. It's not great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s crazy. I had no idea about the reconnected arm portion. It still blows my mind that something as small as a nerve can even be reconnected by surgeons.</p></div>		</li>
