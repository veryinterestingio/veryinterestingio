			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's true anymore. I think the current leading theory is that after Homo erectus spread across the globe, it evolved into Neanderthals in Europe, Denisovans and possibly other species in Asia, and Homo sapiens in Africa. Then Homo sapiens left Africa and outcompeted all the others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One question: could the modern human breed with <em>Homo Sapiens Neanderthalensis</em>?</p>
<p>In other terms, has <em>Homo Sapiens Sapiens</em> changed much in terms  of genetics from then, becoming something like <em>Homo Sapiens 2000</em>?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite.  While that was true,  after it was found that species could interbreed and they did not want to change the categorization of those species, they added the provision that if they were geographically isolated they could be considered separate species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand this (the Florida panther vs standard mountain lion), but they found Neanderthal DNA in modern human genotypes. This seems to me that the 2 species (subspecies) were interbreeding a lot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Homo translates as man or human, and Neanderthals have long been considered humans, they were just a different species of human than we are.</p></div>		</li>
