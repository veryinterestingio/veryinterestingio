			<div class="markdown"><p>The way the fireflies synchronize exactly in time with each other is so amazing. It’s not a wave of lights, as if they were reacting to the “leader” and set off a chain reaction. It’s very much how xmas lights flash on and off at the exact same time across the entire house. Except it’s fireflies and trees.

<p>Not just in malaysia, there is an isolated pocket of a synchronizing species in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.</p>
