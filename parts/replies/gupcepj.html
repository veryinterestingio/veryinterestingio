			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a tl;dr: temperature boils down to average speed of molecules and radiation. Space simply has much less of both than we are used to on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, that might indeed be true, I haven't considered the additional heat produced. When only considering radiation, overheating sounds correct; no idea about internal heating versus water evaporation though, unless I do some serious math first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is true. People always think space suits are keeping astronauts hot when its the opposite. Those suits are pumping coolant throughout to keep the astronaut from overheating.</p>
<p>Hypothetically if a person could breathe in space, they would die from overheating before much else. (assuming the oxygen inhaled would not be ridiculously cold).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, you radiate faster. Assuming you are naked. With clothes on it becomes super complicated, with your skin radiating to the clothes, and the clothes radiating to space. But a naked person radiates very effectively, at about 500 W per square meter. And has a surface area of on the order of 1 sq meter. </p>
<p>Compare that to about 100 W of generated heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to note is: space isn’t cooling down per se, it’s all becoming the same temperature due to entropy. Space is full of hot things in specific locations. Some of these things are hot because they produce their own energy (stars fusing elements like hydrogen and helium) and some are hot because they are receiving energy via radiation from other hot things (earth, for example). Space itself can’t really have a temperature because there aren’t many atoms to move, so it’s sort of just a void through which energy can radiate via subatomic particles and photons. </p>
<p>Eventually, things making their own energy will run out of gas, and all the energy they had at the end will radiate off through space into all the other bits of matter, over and over until eventually all mater will be the same temperature, aka the heat death of the universe.</p></div>		</li>
