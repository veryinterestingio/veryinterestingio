			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the most important points. Netflix needs SEO for user to land on their website, but not to land on a specific page, so they don't optimize URL for traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it also be beneficial if they targeted specific titles/pages too? Image how much traffic they would get from searches such as &quot;the office watch online&quot; or &quot;office season 2&quot;, etc. The user would land on netflix.com/tv/throffice and there would be a CTA &quot;registrr to watch&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They will get traffic from people who search for that. When you're on the landing page for a specific show the title and description tags will both reflect that you're trying to watch the office.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I wanna watch something and I dunno where it’s streaming, I Google ‘watch _____ online.’ Besides all the illegal sites, one of the top links will usually be the legit site it’s on. Soooo much easier than checking Netflix, Hulu, and Prime separately. Is that not what most people do? Do you go through and search each one? Or do you just have some inner knowledge of what’s streaming where?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure and since netflix/hulu is one if the top results, it shows they don't need focus on search engine optimization as much as other content.</p>
<p>It's not that netflix and hulu don't do SEO at all, it's just that they don't need to focus a lot of effort on it since there's no real competition, since a show will only be on one legit site anyways. </p></div>		</li>
