			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, his response is only partially correct.  Yes we use objective measurements, but no doctor in their right mind uses an autorefractor on infants.  I won’t get into why, but it is a completely unreliable method of examination for infants and even children under 5.  Retinoscopy as well described in the thread is what we optometrists will use to refine a prescription on infants, especially after cycloplegia.  Not sure why this doctor mentions autorefractors first.  As a student below mentions, it is even taught in schools not to use these instruments on infants as it will give the wrong outcome almost every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct.  But I do have my staff autorefract all kids because it at least gives me something.  My autorefractor is also an autokeratometer and I can see if there is cyl present.  But no question, retinoscopy is your primary tool here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is auto refraction more accurate than that for adults? I’ve never gotten a prescription for my bad eye because I can’t even read the top letter of the chart with that eye. Last visit to the eye doctor auto refraction was (I think) between -20 and -25. Is that likely to be accurate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've never been able to see well out of one eye (or both) that is called amblyopia. There are many factors that continue to amblyopia but one of the most common is when one eye has little or no prescription/refractive error and one eye has significant prescription/refractive error. This results in the brain dedicating and reorganizing the lobe for vision mostly for the &quot;good eye&quot; and paying attention to other information from the &quot;bad&quot; eye, which results in losing the parts of the brain that would have been able to interpret sharp acuity in the &quot;bad&quot; eye. If this is caught early enough the brain can still mold itself to have good vision in both eyes, if it is caught too late the brain has already taken shape. So it's not really your eye that is the problem, it's the fact that the part of your brain that is capable of organizing sharp vision is not connected to the bad eye anymore.</p>
<p>This is a very condensed and layman way of describing this, it's actually quite a bit more complicated but I wanted to try and explain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do have amblyopia. I’ve know the basics of what that is. It wasn’t caught until I was 6 (In 1990) and I wasn’t cooperative with the treatment so it never got any better. </p>
<p>I thought the eye was always this bad so my brain just ignores the input. I didn’t realize it shut down the processing of the image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OD student here: they teach us to not use auto refraction on babies at all! It’s all in the technique of the retinoscope. Good response! :)</p></div>		</li>
