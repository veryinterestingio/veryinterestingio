			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a great 99% Invisible podcast called ‘<a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/invisible-women/" target="_blank">Invisible Women</a>’ about how many things are designed with the assumption that women are scaled down men. Its been a while since I listened to it, but automobile safety was one example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. My wife and I were the same height. Early 50s and she has shrunk more than I have. But my feet are not only way longer than hers, but significantly wider as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have known that men and women differ in a variety of ways but I honestly didn't know it was at this level. I think the continued conversation around gender and sexuality largely ignores this stuff or just outright says that aside from sex organs there is no difference. I suspect that a good portion of the population isn't aware that these sorts of differences exist, just look at the other comments in this thread that argue that there isn't any real reason why they sell gender-specific shoes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth mentioning that while some  (perhaps most?) companies now use different lasts (effectively the mold for the shoe) for men and women, there are still some that just use a single 'unisex' last, so their men's and women's shoes are different in size only (and maybe in what colours are available) .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These still take into account differences, they just work around the principle that stretching or lacing will fill in the design gaps in the last (or lastless pattern).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wearing a women's size 12 makes it hard to find shoes. I have worn men's running shoes in the past and they do fit differently. They hit my ankle in an odd and uncomfortable way, but women's don't fit that way. Since I found Brooks, though, I wear their women's shoes exclusively.</p></div>		</li>
