			<div class="markdown"><p>A former roommate of mine is a competitive woodcutter, and a second roommate would sharpen the axe heads for him. Thatâ€™s how he would test the blades. If the could cleanly slice into a newspaper held with one hand, the edge was ready. He would also shave the hair off his arm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how I test my knives. I've got a couple of 'survival' knives... Real big beefy ones and a hatchet and and a machete. None of these blades are thin by any means. My baby is about 1/4 inch thick and my hatchet is much bigger.</p>
<p>But, of course, when you sharpen them to shaving sharp they can effortlessly slice paper. Not cut downwards, but certainly slice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't that hard to get it going without a snip. But snipping it seems to make it a lot easier to get the right angle for the scissor blades and it makes the tension on the paper better to start the run.</p></div>		</li>
