<p>If you're getting a tuned for cruising, you typically want it to be efficient for the aircrafts designed cruising true air speed, and at a low RPM (relatively speaking)</p>
<p>if you just want climb performance (e.g. STOL, or sky-diving plane), low TAS and (often) high RPM is the go.</p>
<p>With high TAS, low rpm, the prop needs to have a much more aggressive twist in the blade.</p>
<p>For extreme example, see reno air-race f1 class aircraft. 250MPH on a fixed pitch prop, you are really pushing the limits of what you can do with a fixed pitch. They have bonkers performance once at speed, but their take-off roll is crazy long</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great summary. I think a critical point people often misunderstand is that the <em>airspeed</em> affects propeller efficiency and the pitch required for optimal efficiency. You mention it quite clearly, just wanted to emphasize it.</p>
<p>Imagine that the propeller is an airfoil, a wing, that moves through the air. Since a specific angle between this wing and the air moving past it causes the highest amount of lift (thrust) to be generated, the airspeed of the aircraft is obviously a factor in selecting this angle.</p>
<p>This explanation also shows why propellers are twisted - rotational speed is higher towards the tip of the propeller than near the center.</p></div>		</li>
