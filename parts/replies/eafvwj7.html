			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two things. Usually you are power limited in space and you want to get to you destination in a reasonable amount of time. For a give power you can either accelerate your ions faster, which gives you better ISP/propellant efficiency, or go slower but accelerate more ions, which gives you more thrust. </p>
<p>For a given transit time and power density the optimal Isp for earth orbit operation is about 1500s which correspond to only about 300eV for electrons. So you don't need to accelerate them that much. You are more concerned about ionization efficiency and energy efficiency. </p>
<p>The advantage of Hall thrusters is that they are quasi-neutral everywhere so you don't get into space charge issues. You can get great current density and lower acceleration voltages with high efficiency which is why they are so popular.  </p>
<p>I hope this makes sense. </p></div>		</li>
