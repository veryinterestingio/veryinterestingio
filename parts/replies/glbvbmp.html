			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a great answer, but unless I'm missing something, I feel like it's missing the main point (maybe because /u/CrustalTrudger thought it was obvious?): the type of eruption Pompeii went through led to the city being buried in ashes and very well preserved, which makes it a great archeological site and tourist attraction 2000 years later. If the town was destroyed by lava, just as many people would have died but there would be nothing left to study or see, so it probably wouldn't be that famous at all.</p>
<p>EDIT: typo</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't think that was the question either actually!</p>
<p>My takeaway was that if it happened so quickly people were frozen in place because they couldn't get away, how are we confident that's not going to happen again? Or do people just accept it as a possible but very small risk?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there may be differences of opinion RE what the original question was asking, part of the issue here is that the question was operating from a series of false premises. In a similar vein, I'm not actually sure what question you're responding to? The question did not (in a clear way at least) ask why Pompeii was so well preserved, which seems more like the question you're answering. Even there, this again a false premise as some of the examples I gave (and others have added in the comments) demonstrate, i.e., there are other examples of entire cities buried  by pyroclastic flows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also was destroyed during the height of Rome and people wrote about it, meaning it's been famous even before they dug it up.  Pliny the younger wrote an eyewitnesses account, for example...and Pliny the elder got himself killed in the blast</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was incredible. Chilling. For me, because the video at the beginning looked like such a normal neighborhood of even today, the people felt more real to me than seeing the casts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When some of the artifacts were on display in New York, we went to go see it. You walked through the whole exhibit that was set up like a Roman house on a summer day, with a birds tweeting soundtrack and gentle lighting etc. Then they would take you into a small theater and show you this movie. They had installed rumblers in the floor so it shook in time with what you were seeing on screen. At the end of the movie the room went black and the screen lifted up; turns out it was not a screen but a curtain, and on the other side was the second half of the exhibit, which was all the plaster casts and bones. It was haunting and eerily immersive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been to Pompeii itself, and the interesting thing to me was how BIG it is. Like a 20min walk from the main square to the amphitheater- it’s actually the size of a city!</p></div>		</li>
