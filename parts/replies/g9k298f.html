			<div class="markdown"><p>The highway near us was resurfaced using a new type of porous asphalt about 20 years ago. When it was first laid, it was marvellous: smooth to drive on, and much, much quieter than normal asphalt (both within the car, and also outside from the perspective of people living near it). Unfortunately, it gradually got louder over time, and after about 5 years, you could no longer tell the difference when you passed from the normal surface to the porous one. When it wore out, about 5 years ago, they replaced it with normal asphalt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called ZOAB here in the Netherlands, we have it literally everywhere and it's amazing when it rains. There is just no water on the road, it all dissappears into the asphalt, ZOAB stands for Very Open Ashpalt Concrete so it's very durable as well. It does however not like cold winters as the water freezes inside the asphalt and cracks it open from inside.
It's expensive though, AFAIK both in maintainance and initial cost</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concrete has a lot of problem. They make excellent driveways for homes but not good for public roads. Concrete don't age well in high traffic areas. They crack and much harder to patch or repave. They are so damn loud at speed higher than 40mph. They don't do very in areas with winters. Water tends to stay on it and ice up in winter.</p>
<p>There has been several long stretches of roads that switched to concrete. Five years later, they all switched back to asphalt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The recyclability makes it super economic. </p>
<p>There are crews of machines that tear up the road, remix it, and reapply it all in one go adding what they need to.  </p>
<p>It's super cool driving past these. It's old worn road, reapplied into basically brand road all done by a small caravan of special machines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's comparing the absolute worst pavement to the absolute best pavement at 70 km/h (about 45 mph -- the effects are even larger at slower speeds), but those pavement choices aren't relevant to the majority of driving miles and fuel consumption, which occurs on highways. And the effect of rolling resistance gets less significant as speed increases, because the vast majority of the energy used to drive a car at highway speeds is dissipated by drag rather than rolling resistance.</p>
<p>Rolling resistance is almost certainly a far more significant contribution to bicycle journeys because of the much lower speed of bicycles, so the comparison between the two is not apt. I wouldn't be surprised if there's up to a 20% difference between concrete and asphalt for cycling, as that's the magnitude of difference observed for cars at low speeds comparable to those of bicycles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats not entirely true.  Concrete roadways are not &quot;smooth&quot; per se as they have a brushed finish to them to provide grip.  The brush is normally plastic indoor/outdoor carpet that is drug along it as a finally step during the paving process.  So really, concrete is more rough.  Asphalt is generally pretty smooth.  Where you get problems is in the winter months the snow/ice melt and freeze in the small grooves making it a bit &quot;icey&quot;
The reason concrete roadways are/were loud is due to the practice of &quot;tining.&quot;  Instead of the carpet providing the final rough finish, metal tines were drug either lengthwise, or across the surface.  This proved to be very loud and thats why they have gone away from it.</p>
<p>I have 31 years in the highway/heavy construction industry in MN.  20 of which were with a company that does a lot of concrete mainline paving.</p>
<p>Oh and concrete is no worse than asphalt for the environment and is just as recyclable.  We recycle asphalt and concrete together, crushing it to provide class 5 gravel for the base of new roadways.</p></div>		</li>
