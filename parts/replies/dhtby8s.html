			<div class="markdown"><p>Get ableton and sign up for Splice sounds. Then, make beats every day for 4 years, and Google/YouTube everything you can about music theory, synthesis, mixing, mastering, etc.</p>
<p>Spend as little money as possible on anything other than a really good MacBook pro, a really solid pair of speakers with a decent bass response, a midi keyboard, and some headphones for when everyone tells you to stop making so much fucking noise and that your music sounds like shit except for that one part of thst one song that you made 2 years ago 🙃</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any reason you specifically require a Macbook Pro?  Ableton has a PC version and if your goal is to spend as little as possible, why pay the massive Mac tax when you can get the same horsepower for much, much less?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I support a mainly mac shop and will say this with your best interests in mind: do not get a new macbook pro with the touchbar and usbc. get last years model 13 inch pro, the one with dual thunderbolt on one side and an hdmi on the other, and full size usb ports. this will cost you a whole lot less than a new pro with touchbar and usbc, while being universally compatible with everything you already have or want to use. </p>
<p>also do not get an air. they are a lot more fragile than the pro while also more limited. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also keep in mind that different programs have different strengths weaknesses, and some might be more compatible to your way of thinking. Lex Luger could make banger after banger on FL, but if I try to use it, everything I make come out like a joke. It took me a bit to realize that ableton was the program for me; it really depends on how you think/compose, and how you organize your workflow, which is always different for every individual. Kind of like how a painter chooses their medium/brushes/canvas size. You develop a relationship with a program and can work intuitively with some and not with others. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer! I'm not a DJ but I spent all of last summer editing a TV show that followed Tiesto, Don Diablo and Mike Williams on tour and every single place they played had this same set up. </p>
<p>What I saw that was really cool was that you can have multiple USBs plugged in at the same time. So as one DJ is finishing the other one can load all the tracks and prepare the next song for a super smooth transition to the next DJ. All 3 of those DJs I mentioned make it a point to not just push play. A lot of times they have a good idea of what their set will look like but when they play big festivals they have to be flexible because someone might have played a song from their set list earlier. </p>
<p>Tiesto even said that one time he was on his way to play a festival in Sweden and found a new track that had exploded there that week. He remixed that track on his flight to the festival and had it ready for the show that night. They all agree that reading the crowd is one of the most important skills a DJ can have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they have zero interest in/knowledge about music production lol. Lots of DJs just have other people make their music and then work their social media and tour. A lot of DJs even have people manage their social media too.</p>
<p>Like, to be a great producer, you have to be dedicated to learning and the craft; it's super hard work, and it was my full-time job for 4 years – I had already been playing piano since I was a 4 – and I was obsessed with mastering every aspect of the process: synthesis, composition, mixing, mastering... I even taught myself Adobe illustrator so I could produce my own artwork and graphics. After half a decade of dedication, I can produce tracks that sound amazing on every system. It wasn't easy or obvious at all.</p>
<p>People who aren't obsessive rarely succeed in the industry as a result of their musical talent; more often than not, it has to do with social media, connections, and money, especially now that EDM has matured. Ghost production is rampant.</p>
<p>None of this is wrong, but I wish DJs were more honest with their fans about the process and who is making the music. Beyoncé doesn't write all of her music, neither does Adele, but their producers and writers are credited fully and clearly on every album. EDM still has a ways to go if it wants to be taken seriously beyond being a wild party.</p>
<p>I had to stop working on music, unfortunately, and started doing software engineering full-time – I'm self-taught in this – in order to pay for my expenses as I transitioned; I'm trans MtF.</p></div>		</li>
