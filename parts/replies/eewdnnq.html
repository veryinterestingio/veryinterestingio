			<div class="markdown"><p>Any idea why labs stop at 5 days? My wife and I used a clinic that (thankfully) grows to 7 days, and they said they are one of the few that do. We got 4 eggs, 4 embryos, and 3 were good after 7 days. First implantation didn't take but the second is so-far-so-good, it had already hatched before implantation (We have a daughter already but she came from a monitored natural cycle with insanely low odds)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The uterus's timeline has to match the embryo's. The uterus is receptive to the embryo at day 5 and the embryo should be at the blastocyst stage. If you're having a frozen transfer they still synch the uterus and do the transfer on what would be &quot;day 5&quot;. Your body 'doesn't know' that the embryo being put back is a day 6 or 7 as long as it's transferred on the correct day in the woman's cycle!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I guess that's the tricky part! My wife has always had longer/unpredictable cycles so part of me felt that we just kept getting our timing wrong... Our only natural success came when the egg came from the opposite side to her tube, which would probably would have given the uterus more time to develop than normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering we were told that we weren't ivf candidates and that we should consider egg donors (amh is less than 1), we certainly feel lucky. My wife only has one fallopian tube and it's not on the side that produces one good egg / month, so the tube actually got the egg from the other ovary for our current daughter to be born. It took us a year and a half to get to now, the point of getting 4 eggs that we could fertilize so it has definitely been a rough road for the past few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Embryos don't do well beyond day 6. They are transferred on day 3 when they aren't developing too well. If possible, it's ideal to transfer on day 5. At this point, the sperm cell's contributions to development have kicked in and the chances for success increase - the egg handled a large part of the early embryo development. Success rates with day 5 embryo transfer are much higher than day 3 transfers. Hope that helps</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What we've been told is that day 6/7 embryos have a higher than average success rate because the failure rate is so high earlier on... And if you know its good at day 6/7 it has essentially proven its worth, unless theres a mitochondrial problem that is xausing slow growth. It's not much mind you 37% compared to 33%, but it's something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Day 5 is the time when the uterus is most receptive to the blastocyst. The &quot;window of receptivity&quot;. Most labs do let the embryos grow to day 6 and 7 and freeze those embryos. Day 6 embryos of good quality have great success rates! Day 7 embryos of good quality have success as well but it is more rare to see nice embryos that late. </p>
<p>In the past it was common to transfer embryos at day 3. Now that incubators have improved so much it is better to wait and allow the embryos to grow in hopes of choosing the best embryo at day 5. You will still see day 3 transfers but it is usually due to the embryos not doing well developmentally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told day four happens to be a weird vulnerable time. I had a blast transferred on day 6, sometimes they do. But three and five are classic ones. </p>
<p>It’s a game between letting them get older so you know they have a higher chance of being the right one to transfer (if you’re not doing genetic testing... which is more expensive and maybe not necessary if it’s your first round) and also not letting it go too long because some people think there are embryos which die in the Petri dish goo but which would thrive in the actual uterus. </p>
<p>(Source: three rounds of ivf and all of the research, gnashing of teeth and pulling of hair.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife and I had two kids via in vitro. I have microscope pics of our divided cells before implanting. I’ll see if I can find them and upload them later. They’re kinda beautiful. </p>
<p>We also got the Petri dish. Less beautiful. </p>
<p>We’re very fortunate, despite the fact we’re still paying one off and neither have paid dividends yet. </p></div>		</li>
