			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be a figure 8, but this would be unstable (not that it couldn't continue forever if the conditions were <em>just</em> right, though I'm not sure about it, but that if any slight change were to occur, it would break down). The big ellipse is a far more stable form and is the form that Alpha Centauri follows, as do most trinary systems to my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>In the case of our solar system, the sun is ~99.97% of ALL the mass. </p>
<p>Jupiter is 0.01%. </p>
<p>Everything else, including planets, moons, comets, asteroids, Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud objects make up the remaining 0.02%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would a blackhole with multiple orbitting suns be considered a solar system?</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia stellar black holes can be multiple tens of solar mass and in your other comment you said the smallest known star is about 0.1 solar masses. So we could have mass ratios above 100 and long (or infinite, not sure what the current science on that is) lifetimes.</p></div>		</li>
