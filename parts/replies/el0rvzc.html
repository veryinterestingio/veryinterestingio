			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi xx-Rain_Maker-xx, thanks for your question. Kendra here. There is a lot of great work being done by Colombian researchers on their approach to cocaine production and trafficking in that country. I agree that the Colombian case is fascinating. We did not explore those dynamics in our study in part because of the complications associated with being both a coca-growing (='source' country) and a cocaine-trafficking country. We were mainly interested instead on the effects of law enforcement on zones through which drugs are (just) trafficked, like Central America.</p></div>		</li>
