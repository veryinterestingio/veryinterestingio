			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the only factor, and likely not the highest
You're also spreading the fuel out so much that it falls beneath the critical mass necessary for the chain reaction of fire.  </p>
<p>I'd bet if you followed behind that gent and tried to pick up the previously burning stuff you could restart the fire easily, and also like burn the heck out of your hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends, liquid fuel like petrol, oil, etc gets diluted when sprayed with water. And since other requirements are already unfulfilled, the fire is extinguished.</p>
<p>In case of a log of wood burning, the wood itself is fuel so spraying water does nothing to it physically or chemically but fire is still extinguished since again oxygen and heat are already out of equation.</p></div>		</li>
