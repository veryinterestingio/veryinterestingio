			<div class="markdown"><p>You gotta make your own to be sure that the cultures are still live when you get it.  If you're not doing strenuous activity then you might be better if just using kombucha - it's much easier to apply but sweats off.  Sauerkraut is good for moderate activity levels, but if you want something that will really stay on while you're exercising then you need to apply a good thick layer of compost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pro tip, get all of your medical information from one source. That way you don’t have conflicting treatments. For example I use Reddit. So I am bringing light inside my body to fight corona virus. But I am concerned about sunburn inside my body. Then I stumbled across this thread which told me bacteria stops sunburn. Now I am coating my insides with unfiltered beer and I stopped showering. When I go out to sun my perineum, my daily dose of light, everyone looks at me. Even when they are not able to see me they come. It’s like there’s something in the air and they think “What is happening? I must know.” They search outside till they come to me. I can tell they are in awe by the looks on their face. I am sure they think I am demigod. To be honest I really feel like I have leveled up after doing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there anything that will do the opposite?  I mean, I know sunscreen exists, but is there anything you can take orally that will lessen the chance (or severity) of a sunburn?</p>
<p>As a pasty white person who puts on sunscreen before spending more than 30 minutes outside over the course of a day, and wears UV blocking clothes if spending any significant length of time outside, and still manages to get occasional sunburns, it seems like something like that could be helpful (not to replace the sunscreen and long-sleeve UV blocking shirts, but to work in conjunction with them).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I know of.  I'm generally starting to get the impression that scrubbing the microbiome off your skin with harsh soap daily is just bad for your overall health.  The answer may be, wash your stinky areas with soap and water daily, and your hands often to maintain hygiene, and stop there.  But like I said, the jury is still out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually, more and more science is saying to do exactly that.  You don't need to shower every day.  Was your hands frequently, obviously... they touch so much including your face.  Wash your groin, your armpits and your feet daily... the stinky bits... hair every 3 days or so and a full shower/bath once a week.</p>
<p>This keeps the protective oils on your skin/hair the most... of course, if you get dunked in mud, you should wash that off.</p></div>		</li>
