			<div class="markdown"><p>And as frustrating as it is, the answer isn't simple.</p>
<p>Most of us would agree that the types of papers in question shouldn't be under copyright (especially per the initial intent of the law). At the same time, I support Disney prohibiting WB or Universal from making their own &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; cartoons and theme parks (as I suspect most people would be). </p>
<p>It is challenging to know where to draw the line and where to cut. As often as copyright protections are abused by larger corporations, they are also the reason why Disney can't simply take your comic strip which runs in the local paper and make a 100-million film based on it.</p>
<p>Disney suing a small-town daycare because they have a picture of Goofy painted on their wall mural is asinine. A competing studio taking an active IP from another studio and screwing with it is also prone to abuse. A scientific journal retaining rights to a paper which should have left copyright years ago is obnoxious.</p>
<p>...but how do we legislate these matters and compromise when studios, creators, artists, authors, and publishers have already hedged entire investments on the current setup? Ideally, the laws also need to be supported enough that they are recognized in other nations. Copyright reform is needed and would be great, but it's farxeasier said than done.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what trademark law is for. Trademarks protect using a word or image as a source identifier of a product or service (this theme park is created and run by Disney, this drink is from the people who make Coca Cola, etc.), and they are indefinitely renewable for good reason. </p>
<p>Copyright protects copying the work in any form, which is much broader. It includes merchandising of minor characters that aren't used as trademarks, making copies of old movies, putting a picture of Spiderman on your son's gravestone, etc. It also means that when you use stills or clips from an old movie, you don't get hauled into court where you have to prove fair use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most people wouldn't be. Yes if it is for 20-30 years. Maybe you could stretch it to 50 years. Anything more than that is absolutely insane. Disney itself would never have existed if copyright laws when it started were as strict as they are now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copyright law was originally specified to be 14 years. It should have stayed that way - or at least only been extended a bit. As it is now, it stifles innovation and prevents people from enjoying/making use of content that sometimes isn't even sold by the publisher anyway.</p></div>		</li>
