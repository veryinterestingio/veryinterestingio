			<div class="markdown"><p>New thymus doesn't necessarily mean better immune system. A lot of disorders have an autoimmune nature, and myasthenia gravis, for instance, is treated with removal of the thymus. Producing T cells is one thing, making them non-aggressive towards our body is another. With time passing, a lot of immune cells become autoaggressive, and chronic inflammation rises.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Most posts are talking about thymus regression size with aging, but this reply is really underrated! As someone doing a PhD in hematopoietic aging, I would also heavily lean on HSC myeloid-skewing. It's not only the fact that when stem cells differentiate more to myeloid cells (thus, creating less T but also B cells!) but these cells (which still have immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes and so on) have also a diminished immune function. There's also other implications of age-related HSC functional decline that can contribute to fragility in elderly people such as increase anemia and neoplasia increased frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that'll probably come with its own complications. It's help with combating infection but you have to consider the slow degradation of all of the other systems around it that the immune system has no effect on.</p>
<p>Things like aortic aneurysms, strokes, myocardial infarction are diseases which aren't necessarily caused by infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, interestingly, there is even <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-09-human-growth-hormone-reverse-epigenetic.html" target="_blank">some recent data</a> to suggest that we may be able to re-grow the thymus by giving growth hormone. </p>
<p>Historically, giving growth hormone to adult individuals often leads to diabetes and other issues, but in that referenced study that seems to have been avoided by also giving patients anti-diabetic medications (metformin and DHEA). However, it was a very small study and more needs to be done. </p>
<p>Whether that actually restores &quot;youthful&quot; immunity remains to be seen. But it's interesting to think that it may be possible and ponder the ramifications of that if it becomes a common treatment. Maybe we'll all get a &quot;thymus boost&quot; treatment at, say, 55 y/o and regain most of our immunity properties and no longer have to worry about things like shingles and other things that take advantage of reduced immunity in old age. </p>
<p>But again, this was a small (but long) study and is still very preliminary.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The OP of this thread is incorrect- you don’t just stop producing T cells after puberty. That’s insane. Your body may become unable to produce them at about age 65- the function of the thymus is merely degraded around puberty but doesn’t completely cease producing T cells until much later in life. Which explains why as you age it might be harder to heal from illnesses etc etc and why young people tend to bounce back faster.</p></div>		</li>
