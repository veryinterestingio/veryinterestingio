			<div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine acts to prevent adenosine from binding with adenosine receptors. Adenosine, commonly found in adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is also found freely in the body as a result of ATP breakdown. </p>
<p>ATP is a currency used in the body, and is frequently used in places where energy is required for an action to occur. The bonds of ATP contain a lot of energy, and thus the breakdown of ATP allows for mass amount of energy to harnessed at a time. </p>
<p>When a lot of ATP has been used, adenosine freely floats throughout the body and makes its way to an adenosine receptor. This make you tired, although in a different way than melatonin.</p>
<p>So, the short answer is no, it does not affect prolonged sleeplessness, but just “tricks” the body into thinking it isn’t tired. Amphetamines do a much better job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that makes you feel sleepy. Caffeine blocks adenosine, thereby increasing noradrenaline, glutamate, and dopamine which make you feel more energetic and alert. His ATP explanation doesn’t really make sense here tbh</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do amphetamines also act on the adenosine receptors? Any chance you could expand on how they act? Your explanation was really good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amphetamines act by reversing the polarity of dopamine transporters which are integrated into the cell membrane (integral proteins).  So instead of acting to suck up excess dopamine floating in the brain like normal, it starts pushing it out of cells at a high rate.  This causes the reward/stimulation.  This is vastly oversimplified, but generally it is what happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacology and neuropharmacology are quite complex, but I’ll do my best to make it understandable.</p>
<p>Amphetamines force dopamine outside of brain cells and into the synaptic cleft, an area between brain cells with dopamine receptors. As we all know, dopamine binds to its respective receptors, and you feel real nice. (For the record, to feel REALLY nice, you want amphetamines and SRIs, aka molly or mdma). </p>
<p>Additionally, amphetamines prevent a certain enzyme from breaking down excess dopamine in the synaptic cleft, and they also prevent dopamine re-uptake from occurring, i.e. helper brain cells absorb extra dopamine. </p>
<p>Since there’s a bunch of extra dopamine and nowhere for it to go, almost all receptors are bound, and remain bound, thus you feel nice. </p>
<p>To be clear, dopamine has many many more effects than just the very commonly understood “pleasure” response. Neurotransmitters do a plethora if things, what determines the affect is the type of receptor, and what type of cell it is located on.  Amphetamines also do more than just fuck with dopamine, but there’s Wikipedia for more information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know for sure, but I'd bet some militaries still do it. The U.S. may not do it now, but if we were in an all out, all resources taxed, &quot;full&quot; war, I'd expect to see this type of thing again. It doesn't sound &quot;nice&quot; but that goes out the window when existence is at stake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>US soldiers fighting in the field right now are at war. They have to be able to fight long hours with short notice in challenging conditions. And they do a lot more with fewer troops than in the past. So the US has as much of an incentive as any other country to boost peak performance for the battles that are being fought. Even when they aren't fighting in major combat, US soldiers can be put through long deployments that wear them down due to troop shortages. The US military is large but not infinite.</p></div>		</li>
