			<div class="markdown"><p>A professor of mine once explained reading ancient sources as looking through a peephole. We only have a taste of the plethora of written sources from antiquity, and we rely greatly on archaeological evidence to supplant them.</p>
<p>There are some historical figures, however, that we know a great deal of. For example, we are blessed to have the histories of Polybius, Livy, Appian, and Cornelius Nepos, among others, detailing the life and successes of Hannibal Barca. What’s more interesting still is that Polybius is considered the most accurate of all ancient authors. Even if he is a hostile source of Hannibal, without his extant written account, archaeological evidence wouldn’t suffice the great deeds and colorful life of Hannibal, the famed Phoenician general of Carthage. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fortunately, Pope Gregory's attempt to burn away the pre-Christian past ran up against the fact that the Church spoke Latin, meaning educated people could always read whatever books remained. And writing material was expensive, so instead of burning books, they just scraped of the ink (sometimes badly) and wrote over it. We can detect the old writings in some of these texts, however.</p>
<p>Even more fortuitously, the Nestorian Christians didn't burn the ancient Greek books they were told to, and when they fled to the outskirts of the empire they preserved them. Then when those outskirts were conquered by the Arabs, the Nestorians passed them on to the new Muslims (mostly Persian). And as the Arabs decided to destroy all pre-Muslim history, those ancient texts made their way again to a fringe Caliphate ruled by disgraced exiles in what is now Spain. And as that Caliphate fell to the Christians, the works were preserved in a town conquered by Christians but without a large enough Christian population for the Christians institute the Inquisition--Toledo. That lasted for about only a generation, but in Toledo the ancient Greek texts were translated into Latin and made their way back to Europe. And as soon as the Greek texts and Islamic ommentaries translated into Latin arrived in Northern Italy--boom, Renaissance.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t really correct. The Renaissance was associated with the rediscovery (in the west) of the works of Plato, which had been preserved in the Byzantine empire (not by the “Nestorians”!). Increased contacts between Western Europe and Byzantine scholars led to these works being circulated and translated by people like Ficino.</p>
<p>What you’re talking about is the works of Aristotle, which were indeed preserved and translated by “Nestorian” Christians living in the Muslim Middle East. However, no Pope or any other Christian authority had told them to burn these books.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We kept the lucky bits.</p>
<p>We have detailed accounts on how to name your dog from writers such as Xenophon, and we have lost entire histories of rulers and peoples.</p>
<p>Personally I'm glad we also have these tidbits of 'normal life', but we have lost much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bulk of our knowledge of Norse religious traditions and mythology comes from the writings of Snorri Sturluson, who was writing in the context of a post-Christianized Iceland. He left us a wealth of detail and information, but given the political and cultural context- that he was writing down the stories of a religion that was already out of favor in a word that had at least nominally embraced monotheistic Christianity- it’s hard to know what was altered or omitted. We don’t have much in the way of primary sources from true-believing practitioners of the Norse religion, so everything we know about it should be taken with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>
