			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel somewhat uneasy about that label, like there are <em>some things</em> where your skin colour will give you an advantage, ie; darker skin colour improves your resistance against UV rays thus allowing you to maintain a low body temperature much easier, which is particularly useful on the African plains, but it is disadvantageous in low-sunlight environments (such as Northern Europe) due to Vitamin D deficiency compared to a whiter skin colour.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are examples of racial differences that give you advantages/disadvantages, I can't imagine researches into these differences would have been done if the process were deemed too &quot;scientifically racist&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's not pretend that everything is a made up social construct. I'm sure I'm imagining it when I notice the physical differences in appearance between, say, someone from midland China and someone from the Congo. These differences are not &quot;a social construct&quot;. There are real, substantial genetic differences between groups from different geographic areas.</p></div>		</li>
