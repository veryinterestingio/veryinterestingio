<p>Overall, alligatorids in general (and Alligator in particular) are more cold-tolerant than crocodylids (true crocodiles).  I don't know why this is, but the two living species of Alligator (one in the US, the other in China) are both known to tolerate short periods of cold temperatures.  South American alligatorids (caimans) also extend further into temperate high latitudes than crocodiles.</p></div>		</li>
