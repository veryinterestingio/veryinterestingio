			<div class="markdown"><p>G = 6.674×10^-11 N m^(2)/kg^2<br />
Moon = 7.3459×10^22 kg<br />
You = 80 kg<br />
Moon distance = 389612 km<br />
Radius of earth = 6371 km<br />
Breath volume = 0.5 L<br />
Mass of 0.5L of air = 0.64 g<br />
<del>Weight difference from moon influence = 8.1 g</del><br />
Edit: Revision: Originally I got ~80 mN of force difference. Today I checked my math, and discovered I was off, both in direction (when moon+earth radius distance, force is lateral, so don't take difference) and in my calculation.<br />
New force = 2.58 mN<br />
New weight@1g = 0.26 g</p>
<p><del><strong>I call BS.</strong></del><br />
<strong>It's pretty close actually.</strong></p>
<p>That said, back of the envelope calculation, check my math. Used wolframalpha for all figures.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting you weigh less on both the moon side and the side opposite the moon. Conversely of course you weigh more in between these points. But your weight will probably be influenced by where you are on earth, the local g, far more than the position of the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason the water is higher is not from only a local effect. The gravity difference is minuscule. It’s from water around the world on the moon side being ever so slightly pulled towards the moon radially. That radial  causes the water to rise a current toward the area under the moon. The area under the moon has the water rise, but it is rising because the water from all around are flowing that way. That’s why a cup of water doesn’t rise with the tide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you won't float better, but not for the reasons most comments are saying. My mind was blown a few years ago when I watched this youtube video that explains tides: <a href="https://youtu.be/pwChk4S99i4?t=277" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/pwChk4S99i4?t=277</a></p>
<p>The main takeaway is that tides are NOT caused by the differential force of the moon's gravity relative to the center of the earth. The difference simply isn't large enough. The tides are primarily caused by the moons gravity acting on the ocean water all over the Earth's surface, essentially exerting a shear force on the water that pushes it down to the Earth-Moon line (rather than &quot;lifting&quot; the water up at that point). The force from the standard tide explanation is way too small to account for the tides, and also too small to cause you to float differently.</p>
<p>Seriously, watch the video and realize that your mental model of tides has been wrong for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are infinitesimally wrong depending on how you define &quot;float better&quot;. While your buoyancy in the water will remain unchanged. Your mass and the mass of the water you are displacing will remain unchanged.   If you float (and how high you float) will be exactly the same assuming there are no other forces. But, if you need to kick at all to float comfortably, your weight, and the weight of the water around you is slightly lower at high tide. Therefore, it'll be easier. You can exert slightly less effort for the same result. That seems like you are &quot;floating better&quot; by just a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to go seven comments down on the highest top-level comment to get to this, which I think is the correct answer.</p>
<p>When people say they're &quot;floating,&quot; they generally mean &quot;keeping their head above water.&quot; I therefore read OP's question as &quot;do I need to spend more or less effort to keep my head above the surface.&quot; A floating person consists of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>most of their body, underwater, with neutral-ish buoyancy; and</li>
<li>some portion of their head and maybe their shoulders, with strong negative buoyancy (it's in air).</li>
</ol>
<p>As our swimmer moves between the Earth and the Moon, net <em>g</em> goes (ever so slightly) down, meaning the above-water portion of their head weighs less and requires less effort to keep afloat. Taking to an extreme for illustrative purposes, if we moved the water surface to the center of mass of the Earth-Moon system, net acceleration would be 0, the swimmer-water system would be weightless, and our swimmer wouldn't need to do <em>any</em> work to &quot;float.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't buoyancy also stop working at 0g? Water would also float and probably scatter into mist as there is no pressure that is keeping them together. Similarly, there is no pressure pushing the swimmer &quot;upwards&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
