<p>We know photons are both particle and waves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some have concluded that <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1204/1204.4616.pdf" target="_blank">there are no particles, there are only fields</a>. Some examples given in the paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, all these particles are bundles of the energy, or quanta, of various sorts of fields. A field like an electric or magnetic field is a sort of stress in space. The equations of a field theory like the Standard Model deal not with particles but with fields; the particles appear as manifestations of those fields.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weinberg</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as there is an electromagnetic field whose energy and momentum come in tiny bundles called photons, so there is an electron field whose energy and momentum and electric charge are found in the bundles we call electrons, and likewise for every species of elementary particles. The basic ingredients of nature are fields; particles are derivative phenomena.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weinberg</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only way to have a consistent relativistic theory is to treat all the particles of nature as the quanta of fields, like photons. Electrons and positrons are to be treated as the quanta of the electron-positron field, whose ‘classical' field equation, the analog of Maxwell's equations for the EM field, turns out to be the Dirac equation, which started life as a relativistic version of the single-particle Schrödinger equation.…This approach now gives a unified picture, known as <em>quantum field theory</em>, of all of nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mills</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In quantum field theory, the primary elements of reality are not individual particles, but underlying fields. Thus, e.g., all electrons are but excitations of an underlying field,… the electron field, which fills all space and time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Listing these quotes here in response is misleading really. The user you are replying to is talking about the historical concept of &quot;wave particle duality&quot;. Meanwhile you are giving quotes that talk about quantum field theory and the discussion of fields vs. quanta of those fields / particles and what's more fundamental. These are two different things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photons do not carry electromagnetic waves, they are electromagnetic waves. Particle wave duality tells us that light is both a particle (photons) and a wave (electromagnetic waves) simultaneously. We can approach natural phenomena from different perspectives by deciding to work things out from a wave point of view, or a particle point of view. The momentum density apparent in electromagnetic waves allows us to assign a “classical” momentum to a massless particle, because really the particle and wave are in fact one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This repeats the same misunderstanding i pointed out in another comment. You're implying momentum can somehow only be assigned to a massless particle &quot;via the assigned associatied wave&quot;.</p>
<p>Quanta aren't &quot;particles and waves at the same time&quot;. We do not decide between these two point of views. In quantum theory there is just one view. Particles  always have quantum behavior.</p>
<p>Momentum has nothing to do with mass as you are implying. Every particle has momentum, including massless particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is garbled. For one &quot;photons are both particles and waves&quot; is very outdated. Photons are (quantum) particles, period. Particles in the sense of quantum theory (not little classical marbles). That is more general then a photon being in states that approximately resemble the two classical concepts &quot;classical wave&quot;, &quot;classical particle&quot;. You then go a step further and falsely suggest 1) momentum is linked to mass / massless particles can't have momentum and 2) the particle and wave both kind of exist and the wave carries the momentum while the particle doesn't. That's just wrong and misleading.</p></div>		</li>
