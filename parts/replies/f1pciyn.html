			<div class="markdown"><p>Along with Khan Academy, PatrickJMT on YouTube is an excellent resource for a lot of physics and calculus math. Very good videos and the presenter is a natural and making difficult concepts simple. Another YT channel called numberphile will go through some interesting applied math problems or derivations, to keep things a little interesting. It isnâ€™t a learning channel, but it adds some flavor and is a nice break.</p></div>		</li>
