			<div class="markdown"><p>It is all to do with how surfaces interact with fluids (air in this case). When a fluid is moving relative to a surface there is a phenomenon near to that surface known as the boundary layer. The size of this boundary layer is dependant on lots of things like surface roughness, relative speed, surface shape etc. but simply the relative speed goes from some number (called the freestream velocity) down to the surface where it is nominally zero. In reality it isn't zero due to fluid molecules actually having some size but for modelling purposes it's more than accurate enough. The reason this phenomenon occurs is to do with the balances of forces at the interaction point where the fluid and solid particles exhibit cohesion and adhesion at a molecular scale and drag the particles at the same speed. It's essentially just friction on a small scale.</p>
<p>Interestingly the boundary layer changes irregularly across its height and at some point will go from turbulent flow to laminar. This area is known as the laminar sub layer and the fluid flow in this area is super uniform. All sorts of cool stuff happens here and I did my dissertation on certain aspects of this area in relation to how blood flows through arteries.</p>
<p>The boundary layer is at the same time the biggest helper and the biggest pain in engineering. Dragging the air allows fans to work but at the same time causes aerodynamic friction. Unfortunately it's one of those things that is always there when you don't want it and never enough when you do!</p>
<p>It is also the reason why when you fly a kite it is better at height than at the ground. The boundary layer on the earth varies but is in the order of a few tens to a few hundreds of meters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that kite comparison really brought it home for me. If you imagine every surface as an earth-like topography of <em>stuff</em> that fluids get stuck on, it makes perfect sense. Or is that incorrect?</p></div>		</li>

I thought RANS just time averaged the local fluctuations associated with turbulence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It could be a factor along with stuff like the properties of dust, but I just don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I always thought too. </p>
<p>Dust particles do carry a charge. Just like wool socks on the carpet, contact between charged mediums (dust in this case) will create static. This doesn't affect metal fan blades though because the blade itself is essentially a ground plane, but you still see dust build-up due to the fluid dynamics explained above! I wonder how dust build-up due to static vs boundary layers compares. Maybe I need more metal fans in my life.</p></div>		</li>
