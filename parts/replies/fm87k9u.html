			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to note that most modern weapons use (we think) fission-fusion-fission designs with a U-238 case. U-238 is depleted uranium, just barely radioactive and a terrible fuel for reactors or bombs.</p>
<p>The primary, which is basically a Nagasaki bomb, goes off and compresses the secondary.</p>
<p>The secondary goes off, releasing some heat and radiation and vomiting an amazingly large number of neutrons.</p>
<p>The amount of neutrons is so high that it's able to burn up the U-238 case and other U-238 internal components, even though it's terrible nuclear fuel.  AFAIK, in modern designs for big nuclear weapons, most of the explosion you'd end up seeing comes from this last stage of fission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For reference about how important the U-238 is to the final yield, the biggest bomb ever built was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba" target="_blank">Tsar Bomba</a>.  When detonated, it had a yield of 50 Megatons (3,333 times more powerful than the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima).</p>
<p>The Tsar Bomba was originally designed to use a U-238 casing, but the version that was actually detonated had an inert lead casing instead, due to concerns about excess radioactive fallout.  Had they included the original casings, it's estimated that the yield would have exceeded 100 megatons</p></div>		</li>
