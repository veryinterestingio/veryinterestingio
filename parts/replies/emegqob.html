<p>If people speak multiple languages, how do they choose which to think in?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not a native English language speaker, but I consider myself to be fairly fluent in it. My inner monologue is both in English and in my native language. When I'm &quot;giving a speech&quot; in my head, discussing some concept with myself, I usually think in English. On the other hand, my inner voice uses my native language for the most of the mundane things, like &quot;My exams are tommorow, yet here I am, browsing Reddit.&quot; Also, on some very rare occasions, I hear nothing and just <em>know</em> what I'm thinking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just that I consume discussion-provoking content like articles or videos almost exclusively in English. I've passively memorized a ton of phrases in English from talks on a variety of different topics, so my mind uses them automatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A scientist friend of mine studied in Germany and said that all technical talk happened in English since it was an international lab but most social talk happened in German. If they were drinking after work and one of them started complaining about a work problem the whole conversation would switch languages and shift back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend not to have any internal dialogue unless im typing/writing or reading.  If im playing a game, i dont really think with words at all, its more...ideas? Instead of thinking &quot;i need to pick up this weapon,&quot; i either think &quot;weapon&quot; or just do it.  Or if i see something i dont want my mind doesnt form inner words, i just glance at it and keep going.  The inner dialogue i use most is &quot;hmm&quot; or &quot;Ooo&quot; :)  If im really focusing on a puzzle game i sometimes think &quot;how.......&quot; or &quot;do i.......&quot; and it fades off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I experience the same thing. Just using a single word or even just acknowledging something I have to do with no words in my head. The fading off part also happens with me as well. I have a verbal learning deficit so maybe that has something to do with having a weak inner dialogue. Very interesting to find someone who has a very similar inner dialogue (or lack thereof) as me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even for people with a lot of inner vocalization, I'd say the majority of peoples thoughts aren't vocalized. Nobody can vocalize every single thought that comes into their head, that'd slow you down tremendously and would probably land you with a disability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend who basically verbalizes every thought that comes into his head.  He does this for hours at a time.  He is very challenging to cope with his nonstop talking.  I’m one of the few people who doesn’t try to get rid him.  As far as he knows he doesn’t bother me any.  I have tried to explain to him it would be nice if he came up for air, but he is too busy changing the subject.</p></div>		</li>

It's very interesting.</p></div>		</li>
