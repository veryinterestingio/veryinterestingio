			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess what I don’t understand is this—a human created that 4d maze game you linked, so do they fully understand the 4th dimension so much that they can create a game? I keep seeing explanations of how you can see the shadow of 4d in 3D because it’s a tesseract but I just want to hear someone explain what the 4 dimension actually is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fundamentally, although there are more complicated interpretations suited to different purposes, space is a way of assigning a set with a geometrical structure.</p>
<p>For flat 2d space, we have the set of all pairs of real numbers, (x, y). As you move in one direction, y goes up or down, the other, x goes up or down.</p>
<p>For three dimensions, we very simply add a third number, (x, y, z). </p>
<p>And then, yet again very simply, for four dimensions we add another, sometimes notated (x, y, z, w). The hard part isnt &quot;what&quot; 4-d space is, its the implication of what figures look like in it. </p>
<p>We can very easily draw the wire frame of a cube on a 2-d piece of paper. This is like the &quot;shadow&quot; of the cube. The drawing isnt really 3d its just a representation of the cube on a flat surface.</p>
<p>Yet again, in the same way, we can draw the wireframe of a cube in 4-d, this is the shape some people call a tesseract, but many mathematicians just name a &quot;4-cube&quot;</p>
<p>A 4 cube, like a 3-cube, is the shape created by enclosing one &quot;grid square&quot; of 4-d space.</p>
<p>I'm going to come back to this in a bit and add some more explicit representations of this 4-cube, but first I need to eat breakfast</p>
<p>EDIT: ok back at the computer.</p>
<p>Imagine a unit (meaning each side is length 1) 3-cube. it's farthest bottom corner is at the point (0, 0, 0) and the point directly opposite it, the far top, at the point (1, 1, 1). If you draw a quick picture for yourself it will be easy to see that the 8 corners of the cube take up all of the 8 points with some combination of 1s and 0s: (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1). It is also easy to see that for a similar construction, the 2-cube (a square) does the same thing with the points (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). even the 1-cube, a line segment, does this, taking up the points (1) and (0).</p>
<p>We can use this analogy to gain some insight into the 4-cube. without being able to easily visualize, we imagine a construction where every corner is on one of these &quot;binary points&quot; (0,0,0,1), (0,0,1,0) ... (1,1,1,1) I won't write them all out, but as you can guess with the doubling pattern of the previous three, this 4-cube has 16 corners where the previous had 8.</p>
<p>some more investigation shows deeper layers of analogy, in the same way that the 3-cube encloses 6 &quot;faces&quot; which are each 2-cubes (squares), and one &quot;volume&quot;, this 4-cube encloses 8 volumes, and has a total of 24 &quot;faces&quot;</p>
<p>How do I know this? I won't go through each one but lets d other easy few. Since we know the 4-cube has corners on each of these &quot;binary points&quot; we know that it's going to have our original 3-cubes poitns as a subset! just ignore the last coordinate, and we have (0,0,0, w), (0,0,1, w), (0,1,0, w), (1,0,0, w) ... (1,1,1,w). we can also easily get that theres a second cube by the fact that there will be a symmetry if we substitute 0 or 1 for w in the above. The rest I believe we can get by inverting the numbers, and switching around w for x, ect.</p>
<p>These things are hard to understand through explanations alone though, if you're genuinely curious, draw yourself a few pictures, list some points, try and figure out what properties make a set of points a cube and which don't, maybe try and figure out why there are 24 square faces?</p>
<p>There's far far more to explore in basic 4-d geometry of course, we can get the 4-sphere very easily in the same way we get the 3-sphere, it's just the set of all points that are exactly 1 unit distance from (0, 0, 0, 0). What properties might this higher dimensional sphere have? I don't know it off the top of my head but it's volume and surface area are still related to pi, and larger than the 3-sphere.</p>
<p>higher dimensional space is deeply interesting, but there's nothing mysterious about it, nothing that can't be figured out or eludes humanity. With the same technique for analyzing the 4-cube I've laid out here, you could easily figure out the structure of a 5-cube, a 6-cube, and so on. If you are particularly passionate, you might even be able to derive formulas for how many n-cubes each one will contain as sub-shapes! This is why mathematicians love math. They love solving little puzzles, applying intuitions and using tools to unlock new insight. I originally got interested in math because of this very topic! Anyways I digress, this has been fun to write and hopefully has no glaring errors, you have a good day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dimensions are orthogonal values that describe something's state.  Orthogonal means that having some value in one dimension tells you nothing about the value in some other dimension.  Knowing an object's X coordinate tells you nothing about its Z coordinate.</p>
<p>For the sake of illustration, rather than thinking about objects in a 4 dimensional space, let's think about objects in a 6 dimensional space!  We'll call the dimensions X, Y, Z, R, G, and B.  Now it's easy to intuit that knowing something's X Y and Z location tells you nothing about what color it is (that is, it's position in the RGB color space).  The only tricky bit is to realize that if we're treating all six of these dimensions as spatial dimensions, it's possible for two things to &quot;go around&quot; each other in color space, which would look to a human like objects of different colors passing through each other, but objects of the same color colliding.</p>
<p>So the way to understand it well enough to create a game is to understand dimensions in terms of coordinates rather than in terms of your visual experience of things.  In 4D points have 4 coordinates, simple as that.  The tricky bit is finding human comprehensible ways to display that information.</p></div>		</li>
