			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, a cartel can be formed to make any kind of agreement that impedes free market mechanisms.</p>
<p>E.g. a cartel could agree to divide a market regionally in order to give each competitor a quasi-monopoly in their area. They could agree on market standards in order to push a competitor out of business.</p>
<p>All restaurants in an area could agree to keep closed on Mondays.</p>
<p>Not all cartels are even necessarily illegal, depending on jurisdiction.</p></div>		</li>
