			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not actually light compared to regular wheels/tires. Thye use them because the  centrifugal force generated at 500+MPH rips rubber tires and regular wheels apart. Solid forged wheels are needed to stay together. The weight of them is somewhat irrelevant when compared to the huge drag forces they have to overcome at high speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even drag racing tired are bolted onto the actual wheel because of the forces generated. These cars are going 0-100 mph in 0.8 seconds, itâ€™s nuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, but land speed record cars that are exclusively wheel propelled don't have aluminum discs for wheels. this comment is like saying airplanes are fast or slow because of the wheels of their landing gear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya the fastest cars (700+ mph) and the fastest bicycles both have skinny tires. OP is probably just thinking of production sports cars and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nothing wheel driven has ever reached 700mph. the wheel driven speed record is 440, and it still isnt even a car, but it does have tires on wheels that are just as wide as the ones on my car. you are thinking of landspeed record vehicles, which use jet propulsion. their wheels don't matter, they only exist so it can be a &quot;land&quot; speed record, and thus those vehicles dont matter to this context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  Also a fast car with thin tyres would be hellishly dangerous in an emergency situation (but probably not as dangerous as bicycles in those situations!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fast is a strange term when it comes to cars.</p>
<p>There is hight speed , acceleration,  and cornering speed. </p>
<p>Fast througjt mountain roads is different than fat down a 1/4 drag strip and is different than a top speed attempt.</p></div>		</li>
