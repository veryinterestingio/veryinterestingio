			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious... do callouses on your fingers affect this? Because sometimes it's difficult for me to register a touch. I've tried on multiple phones. Just wondering if it's me or the phone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. The lack of moisture makes it sometimes difficult for callused fingers to register touch on capacitive screens. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have huge callouses on my hands
And have never had a problem using my phone. Even with thin gloves it works fine </p>
<p>For reference I sometimes use nail clippers to remove calluses because they get so big that they  pinch me when I clench my hand.</p>
<p>Look at my post history to see an example of my hand </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being a roofer,  I know too well about callouses on my hands. Makes it uncomfortable to make a first because the ones just below my fingers try to find with the rest of the meat that isn't so tough. Punching things sometimes hurts because it starts ripping the callous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never measured or tested that but my quick thought is that it would. The callouses are thicker, dryer skin so I would believe it would lower the sensed capacitance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High-end touch screens use a technology called projected capacitance.  You need a nice, wet, salty, electrically-lossy finger; the technology was tuned for the usual person's sweaty skin.  Clean, dry, callused fingers during the winter sometimes have problems.  Rain on your phone confuses it because there's signal everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the size of the finger, but other things like if are you dehydrated or sweaty (salt on skin surface) can have an effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the size of finger only starts to matter if it about the same size as one of the capacitive “pixels” or smaller. </p>
<p>From another reply I made elsewhere:</p>
<p>For a phone sized touchscreen there’s usually about 200-600 capacitive touch “pixels”, not millions. The touch position will be interpolated from there low resolution measurements. They are formed by having a grid of conductive (usually ITO) transmitter and receiver lines each ~3-6mm in width. Depending upon the quality of design and manufacture it might be possible to see the sensor lines if you hold the device at particular angles with a reflection from a light source.</p>
<p>Note that the lower the resolution of the touch sensor pixels, the more variation in sensitively between locations where the transmitter and receiver lines cross and gaps between. </p>
