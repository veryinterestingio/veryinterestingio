			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert but the ELI5 version is that epilepsy is a misfire of electrical signal in the brain - so essentially a cluster of neurons &quot;glitches&quot;. Some of those neurons are for motor and spatial coordination so it would make sense that if they glitch it feels like 0G/weightlessness/a rollercoaster. I am not sure if all epileptic seizures cause a temporary loss of physical control but that would also make sense.</p></div>		</li>
