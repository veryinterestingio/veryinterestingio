			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount or at least shape of the material does matter. The ratio of width to length must be very small for cantilever equations to hold. The equation you gave is also for a uniformly distributed load I believe I didn't see that mentioned and wanted to clarify. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flexibility is actually not an intrinsic property. It is strongly affected by the amount of material. The thinner a piece of metal, the easier it will bend.
Sample size and shape will affect the way it behaves, especially in &quot;bending&quot; situations.
The reason for this is that surrounding material imposes as restriction on the movement of atoms. Less restriction - easier movement.
You clearly know the definition of an intrinsic property. Yield strength and UTS are probably the only truly intrinsic values you work with. IIRC K1'cs are as well, but I don't think you'd work with that too often.
Metallurgical Engineering here. Feel free to ask me some stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for clarifying for me, you learn something new every day ?.  I’m actually a fluid dynamics guy so this is pretty out of my norm.  </p>
<p>Can you explain the difference between the amount of material and the shape of the material?  I assumed the material will yield according to its Young’s modulus, however I also recognize the shape’s control over deformation (hence I beams in construction and circles for columns).  </p>
<p>I am either not defining flexibility correctly in my own mind, or I am failing to see how having more of something doesn’t fall under that shape category, which wouldn’t be an intrinsic property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure thing dude/dudette. I'll explain in terms of stress (F/A)
Amount: how much there is. A square shaped (cross -section) piece of metal and a rectangular piece will see equal amounts of stress if exposed to an equal force. This is only true for the direction in which they have equal cross sectional areas.
Shape: the rectangular piece of metal  experiences more &quot;restriction&quot; to movement in certain axis. The reason for this is that for a sample the get longer in the x-axis- it needs to shrink in the y&amp;z-axis. This affects the way it &quot;handles&quot; stress. So if you bend it in one direction, it will bend more easily than in the others.
It also means that it will behave in a more brittle manner under certain loading conditions. I can expand on this too if you want.</p>
<p>Not sure if Flexibility is the right term here. I believe that you are thinking about a material's ability to deform under load. This is a combination of Young's Modulus and Yield strength (material/intrinsic properties).
I would read up on the stress strain curve to get some clarity on that. </p>
<p>Hope I answered your question
Also I edited for clarity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Euler-Bernoulli’s Beam Theory is only true for small deflections meaning at a certain point it would no longer deflect the same way. I’ve done some googling and found an alternative. Apparently, for extremes Timoshenko Beam Theory is more appropriate.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a civil engineering student, you will need to learn quickly in the real world that determining the exact deflection using crazy calculations is pointless, because in 99.99% of applications you will never truly know the loads you are dealing with, and you wouldn't truly know the exact properties of the materials you're dealing with. If you really, really need an accurate measure of the deflection, you would perform a load test. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do this in mechanical engineering too.  Perform a crazy specific load calculation to figure out how much cooling is required in this room based on equipment heat load, transmission gains, sunlight, people, and even lighting.  Then double it because you just know they're going to throw six more server racks in the room a month after you're done and complain about how it gets too hot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly on topic, but still very applicable is buckling and slenderness ratio.  It's the difference between a beam squishing like a marshmallow or bending over like spaghetti.  Now I understand this is deformation due to compression, but it still demonstrates that a dramatic increase in length changes the failure mode. </p>
