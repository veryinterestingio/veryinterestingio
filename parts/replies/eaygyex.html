			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically... it would be a valid viewpoint to think that 'determinism' at the macroscopic level could be an emergent property of indeterminism at the quantum level? While each atom in your experiment will be random the end result is very predictable, and will only vary by tiny amounts when the experiment is repeated. So rather than be an unstable foundation, randomness can actually be reliable and stable, potentially providing everything needed for a universe that is practically indistinguishable from one that was completely deterministic, at least for us non-scientists.</p></div>		</li>
