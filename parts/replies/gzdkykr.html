			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe the world’s shiftiest or oldest conferencing system works that way still, but today we use much more advanced acoustic echo cancellation processors that use an IIR filter to cancel the reference audio (far end and program) from each microphone input. There’s also a bit of non-linear processing after the 200ms or so of AEC to get the last bit of room reflections out (more similar to what you describe with ducking). If you need a feedback elimination processor (what I’m guessing you’re describing with the comb filter), then that means your gain staging or signal matrix if is wrong or the far end is the problem. Even then, the far end is going to have too much latency to cause near end feedback, so just echo would be the likely result, not feedback. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure it won't be an IIR.   Typical means is to FFT both the signal and the echo to frequency domain, and subtract there, then go back to time domain.</p></div>		</li>
