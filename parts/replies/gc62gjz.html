			<div class="markdown"><p>Arguably that's just two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Self care essentially boils down to management of stress, be it physical, or mental/emotional. So as you describe it, the lack of self care in that time put your body under additional stress as a direct result.</p>
<p>Definitely good to call out as you did. Just would consider self care a way of mitigating an accelerating factor (stress), rather than a second factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they mean it in a more literal sense. People look different than you're used to seeing them because they aren't keeping up with salon appointments and grooming routines. So now they have a different hair cut, their roots are showing, they have facial hair, etc.</p></div>		</li>
