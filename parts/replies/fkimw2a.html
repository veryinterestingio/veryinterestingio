			<div class="markdown"><p>Tha fact that there's no fluid doesn't mean there's nothing. It has basically the same causes. The difference is usually that whatever is causing the dry cough is not/does not produce any phlegm. Also it could just be the tissue on your throat getting irritated over something. Think of it as the skin in there itching.</p></div>		</li>
