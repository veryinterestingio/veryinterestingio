			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any studies about how much of our gait is determined by max efficiency and how much we allow ourselves to be swayed by socialization? </p>
<p>I often feel I recognize people's cultural background by gait -- there's a particular female/NYC/Puerto Rican style I can still spot a mile away after having a friend w/it in college in the 80s -- and myself, I've got a slight  asymmetrical &quot;limp&quot; that has nothing to do with my own body; I unconsciously echo my father's gait -- who's been dead for ten years -- who had a bad leg break when he was eight years old. Talk about durable!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that’s what I was thinking. Physical path of least resistance accounts for a lot about our gaits, but mental influences like mimicking, cultural adoption, etc. are just as important. Super interesting! I’ve noticed myself walk differently in different places, and with certain friends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should experiment with this.<br />
Try a different weight in one hand than the other, see if your stride compensates.  Also, maybe not just weight but inertial arc... like.. walk with a rock in one hand, in a fist, and a long axe handle or something similar (that weighs approx the same as the rock) in the other.
Does the short heavy arm swing faster? Does the long heavy arm swing faster? Does your gait or stride change to compensate? Do you develop a limp?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in the Army (Vietnam) we were told in Basic that the Army way to walk / march was the most efficient way. Not sure if that was true, but when you're in Basic you quickly learn not to argue with the sergeants. I would say that &quot;route step&quot; was easier than marching.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Route step does not have to be in step, maintain distance, alignment, formation as best you can.  Allowed to talk while walking.</p></div>		</li>
