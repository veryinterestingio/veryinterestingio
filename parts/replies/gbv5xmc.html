			<div class="markdown"><p>At first glance that seems pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>First you need to keep in mind that in terms of evolution, 1,000 years is not a long time, and who knows how or if humans will live 5,000 or 10,000 years from now, especially if you consider how much has changed just in the past 200 years or so.</p>
<p>There's also the fact that obesity doesn't really stop you from passing on your genes, because most people won't run into serious obesity-related health issues until after they've had kids. Being overweight today kills a lot slower than being underweight did 10,000 years ago. It only took one bad winter to kill a 16 year old individual with too little body fat. Even if you have a serious problem with overeating today, you'll still live long enough to reproduce.</p>
<p>Aside from that, fitness or being good at surviving isn't really the limiting factor in how much offspring someone can have today. In other words, it's not necessarily the healthiest people that have the most kids and that propagate their genes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Obesity can definitely impact chances of reproduction. Sexual selection for a start. There are also numerous fertility problems, for example erectile dysfunction, low sperm count, increased chance of miscarriage or birth defects in women.</p>
<p>So yes, an obese person might live well beyond their reproductive prime, but evolution is affected by more factors than just dying before that prime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, there are a lot of factors that affect obesity, not just genes, so people who are thin who enjoy sugary and fatty foods would be no less likely to pass on their genes than someone who doesn't like these things as much. Enjoying the taste isn't the only thing killing people, it's also fat storage, availability, education, etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it is killing us, but not fast enough to affect reproduction, yes. It does lower chances of finding a mate, and therefore reproducing though, so I think there is a possibility it will change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your reproductive system may still function fine, but do you think it really has zero effect on finding a mate? Like, obese college kids are having exactly as much sex with the same number of equally-fertile people as average weight people? As college athletes? If there's <em>any</em> correlation it will eventually have an evolutionary effect, even if it's not actually killing people until past reproductive age.</p>
<p>I think it would definitely have an effect, but (like all evolution) would take a LONG time. Like, we'll probably never see it happen because even if humans do survive the necessary 10,000-100,000 years there will probably be other bigger evolutionary pressures in the meantime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No because dying due to obesity doesn't have a negative selection effect - there's nothing about eating too many hamburgers which inhibits your ability to procreate and pass your genes on to your offspring.</p>
<p>If something about obesity harmed peoples ability to have children, then evolution would select against obesity.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, nature doesn't care what happens to you once you have children. You could die the next day, live another 100 years in great health, or suffer from debilitating pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that how evolution worked, in this case? Isn‚Äôt it just as likely that sweet foods <em>want</em> to be eaten (ie, seed-bearing fruit), so <em>they</em> evolved to match our ancestor‚Äôs taste, not the other way around?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point, and the likelihood is a bit of both.</p>
<p>Things have to not reproduce (or reproduce more) for evolution to happen, so the sweeter berries get eaten more and spread more in scat, and the people who liked eating them and got the extra calories lived long enough to procreate over those who didn‚Äôt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since it's a symbiotic relationship, at least when animals eat and poop out the seeds of the plant, it's a bit of both. Plants with sweeter fruits have an advantage because animals spread their seeds around more, and animals with a preference for sweeter fruits have an advantage because they contain more energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember that the vast majority of the fruits and vegetables we eat now has been manipulated to be generally larger and sweeter than the wild versions over hundreds of generations.</p>
<p>Consider the difference between a wild crab apple and a Red Delicious/Honeycrisp apple. The domesticated fruit is much larger, sweeter, and flavorful than the wild ancestor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and also plenty of fruit trees don't grow true to type from seed, so having a sweet fruit on your plant today may not necessarily be passed on to the next generation when the seeds are pooped out by the animal that ate it.</p>
<p>So evolving to taste in the wild might take quite some time even if humans were the only animals eating the fruit (unlikely).</p></div>		</li>
