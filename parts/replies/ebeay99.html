			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, music theory is a set of rules on how to construct music, it’s not a post-hoc analysis. It’s a quasi-mathematical construct based at its core on the harmonic series. This is then expanded to intervals that ‘sound good’ which are all particular ratios. Then to chords, series of intervals played at the same time. Then to harmonic sequences, chord sequences, and how they work in context. </p>
<p>While it’s not possible to predict whether or not a piece of music will be ‘a hit’, there are certain harmonic devices which people prefer over others, and will inevitably surface more often than not in well liked music. Dimitri Tymoczko wrote an entire book on the subject. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Initially music theory <strong>was</strong> post-hoc, it being simply a way to label and communicate what had been done.  I doubt that much &quot;good&quot; music has been produced simply through the theoretical placement of notes on a staff.</p>
<p>As my theory teacher told me, &quot;inspiration came before the theory&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most “good” music has been written with a deep understanding of the conventions of music theory. It’s not a random process. Knowing the rules only aids to enhance inspiration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Music theory is absolutely a post-hoc analysis. </p>
<p>Never has a new rule of music theory existed before the music it describes, and never has a new rule of music theory popped into existence simultaneously to the music it describes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does that matter?</p>
<p>Surely the patterns discovered by music theory exist and are determined beforehand, much like the laws of physics exist before they are/were discovered by physicists, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, agree to disagree on that first point. I'm curious about why you are so adamant that music theory existed prior to music. Can you develop that further?</p></div>		</li>
