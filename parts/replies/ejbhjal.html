			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading a men's magazine (Ralph or FHM I can't remember which but those were the 2 I spent my money on as a teenager) which had an article about free diving and included a &quot;how to&quot; section to teach you to hold your breath for long periods which I personally tested and it worked. You just hyperventilate until you can taste metal in your mouth and then take a deep breath and hold it. I increased my time from about 40seconds to almostv3 minutes on my first try. </p>
<p>The article stated that it was a common thing Navy Seals would do as well and brain scans on Seals showed some negative effects on the brain which they thought would likely be fine for the short term but may cause issues later on in life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m fairly certain that hyperventilation before a dive also significantly increases the risk of blacking out during a dive, which of course would also make hyperventilating very dangerous in the short term if you go under water afterwards. The uncomfortable feeling of holding your breath is actually triggered by having high CO2 levels in your body. Hyperventilating, as far is I remember from life guard training, lowers CO2 levels and therefore it feels like you can hold your breath for longer. However, it is oxygen levels that control whether or not you black out. The problem with hyperventilating is that you risk not feeling uncomfortable, even though your oxygen levels are low. I don’t know if blacking out on land is dangerous, but I suspect it isn’t terribly healthy. Diving is fun, just please be careful and bring a friend </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never hyperventilate before diving.
Your body doesn't measure the oxygen in your blood, it measures the CO2.<br />
When hyperventilating you're getting rid off all excess CO2 in your blood, but you're not increasing oxygen a lot.<br />
This way you can black out during a dive before you're noticing the lack of oxygen</p></div>		</li>
