			<div class="markdown"><p>Worse is a relative term, AZ is highly effective in preventing hospitalization and death but the overall efficacy is significantly lower than with the (currently) two mRNA vaccines. It's hard to compare the two because the study designs were somewhat different in technical terms but the raw numbers suggest an efficacy of 74% (67% for Delta) with AZ and 95% (88% for Delta) for BioNtech (Moderna is similar, at least for anything other than Delta). J&amp;J is somewhere in the mid-60s but I'm too lazy to look up the exact number. Sinovac might be significantly behind and I won't even comment on that clusterfuck the data base of Sputnik V is (seems pretty good but there is so little reliable data, it hurts my brain). </p>
<p>For comparison, your average measles vaccine usually clocks in around 70%, which is considered quite good. </p>
<p>In a nutshell, AZ is not bad by any standard but there are some adverse effects, especially with younger people (and even more so with women). BioNtech and Moderna just are a little better. What that is worth in reality, is a different story though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was under the impression that MMR was &gt;95% effective at preventing infection with measles.</p>
<p>Looking it up, CDC’s website cites a 97% efficacy: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>As someone vaccinated with that one, can you actually do? How problematic is its data? I really wish it got accepted by EMA/WHO so i can travel again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has that ever actually been proven in a controlled test tho? Remember seeing a video on it and how Pfizer was tested under much more favorable conditions and in a different season so those results can't be used in a comparison with the other vaccines... this is a while back tho and there might have been more tests and research done since that I haven't kept up with...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any data out there about whether the vaccine prevents the long-term loss of smell that some people experience? I haven't heard much about that aspect of it since the early pandemic days, and all the results I can find are about whether the vaccine reverses it after it happens, which is not the same thing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be interested to hear what an expert says about why this data is apparently a lot different to the Israel study where BionTech showed 67% efficacy against infection with Delta variant. That fact worries me a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So firstly - the figure you're quoting is about symptomatic infection. The protection against severe disease is much higher - all the studies agree on that.  </p>
<p>It's quite difficult to accurately ascertain the efficacy against symptomatic infection, particularly when you consider that those who reject vaccines are also likely to reject testing. And when the vast majority of the population is vaccinated, a small behavioural difference in the small unvaccinated group can have a huge impact on the reported apparent efficacy.  </p>
<p>So the simple answer is we don't really know what the % is currently, but it's really irrelevant to you or I because the only thing that we care about is NOT ending up in hospital, and on that note, vaccines mean we can sleep rather more easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn’t that number also just a preliminary finding from Israel’s contact tracing? Genuine question (my recollection is that even Israel’s health ministry was telling people to tap the brakes on that number until further study could be done but I could be misremembering).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not unlikely to have outlier studies in these cases. But if 5 studies say a similar thing and a sixth says something different it is much less likely the sixth study is the correct one and every other one is wrong.</p></div>		</li>
