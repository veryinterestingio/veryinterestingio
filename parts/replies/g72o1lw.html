			<div class="markdown"><p>I read the OP and went &quot;huh, I wonder if they are neurodivergent&quot; because I only know other ADHD people or ASD people who have this in a noticeable way, and people without some neurodivergence usually think I'm crazy when I mention it.</p>
<p>Anyways you're normal</p></div>		</li>
