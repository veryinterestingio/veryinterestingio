			<div class="markdown"><p>Elijah Craig is a great example for this thread. It used to be aged 12 years, and was <em>amazing</em> especially for the price. But the manufacturer, Heaven Hill, failed to accurately anticipate demand as word spread of what a great product it was, and as the craft cocktail trend increased demand for whiskeys across the board. They ran short of product. Now, they could have decided to keep the same 12-year age specification, and respond to increased demand and static supply by raising prices to whatever the market would bear (which is what most of the Japanese brands have recently done). But instead they discontinued their 12-year product, and replaced it with a No Age Statement whiskey that is made from a blend of 8-to-12 year whiskeys. That allowed them to keep prices about the same, while increasing the available volume (and thus increasing sales and profits).</p>
<p>Personally I really miss the 12 year Elijah. The NAS just doesn't do it for me. But I've heard some folks who thought the quality of the 12-year was slipping toward the end, and believe the NAS blend is a superior product.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I did the JD tour I could immediately tell that the 10 million litres a year that they make wasn’t coming from that pretty little farm.</p>
<p>Google Earth revealed a massive factory out of sight over the hill!</p>
<p>I still cannot believe that they have over 100 million litres in barrels in storage aging....</p></div>		</li>

<p>The point I’m making is that you just cannot make and age - for even 3 years - that volume of JD in barrels....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite! An age stated label is actually the minimum age in the bottle which is why it’s better to overproduce. An 11 year old barrel can go into a 10 year old whiskey but not the reverse so if I overproduce one year, I know we can eventually put it in a blend. If I underproduce, we can’t pull younger whiskey in to make up for it and end up with a shortage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Age of youngest in the blend must be used in American and Scotch.</p>
<p>In America you can list all the proportions and ages, this practice was more common many decades ago on blends and is rarely seen today, although would be legal in practice. When we had a major glut of supply in the 70s-90s, many age statements were severely understated, I guess for labeling consistency.</p>
<p>In Scotland the law states you can ONLY ever state the age of the youngest whiskey in the blend. Look up the story on the recent release out of Scotland called Three Year Deluxe. I think it was from That Boutiquey Whisky Co. They tried to list all the ages in the blend and the label was denied by the govt. They are lobbying for the law to be adjusted.</p></div>		</li>
