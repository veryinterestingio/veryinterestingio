			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm being induced on Monday because my body isn't coping very well. I'll be 37 weeks +2 days but my heart isn't pumping as well as it should leading to baby's growth slowing and my legs to fill up with fluid. It's all a matter of weighing up risk: until baby's lungs were fully developed it was less risky for him to stay put in my uterus. Now he's full term albeit early it's more risky for me to carry on with a pregnancy and heart failure. This gives both of us the best shot at being healthy after birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whatever happens, remember it's not your fault. Things happen, bodies and babies are all different, and some people just get unlucky. My wife got double zebra unicorn unlucky, and still feels guilty about certain biological things that she knows full well weren't in her control. But it's been almost eight years, and neither of us would trade our daughter for anything. I've only been on the scene for 3 years, we both met as second marriages after kids with other partners. She's a phenomenal mom and everything I never knew I wanted and needed in a partner.</p>
<p>I hope Monday goes smoothly for you, and the weeks after. If you have feelings of depression, please don't be quiet about it. It's normal but under-reported, and can be really rough without support. Even though I was looking for it, I missed the signs after my ex gave birth, and that was really unfortunate for everyone. If you have a partner, or family staying with you, please make sure they are all informed and watching out for you. It's been almost eleven years since my son was born, and I wouldn't trade that either, but some things would have been a lot easier if post partum depression had been caught.</p>
<p>Sending lots of positive thoughts!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason happened with my kid. A significant portion of women have group b strep in their lady parts. It’s a benign infection, but can pass to the child and occasionally cause blindness. As a result, women are kept on IV antibiotics from when the water breaks to birth. It’s not like movies, and water breaking doesn’t normally mean go to the hospital right away, but in this case the antibiotics are called for. It can be days between the water breaking and birth. So they may induce so you don’t have to spend a week on IV antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The typical pregnancy is 40 weeks. Our OB/GYN said that at 39 weeks the baby is fully formed, and that last week and any after it is just the baby gaining weight, getting bigger, and becoming more difficult to birth.  </p>
<p>Also, a woman's first baby is more likely to go post term. For our baby, our doctor scheduled induction on the due date. If it came on its own before that, that would be great, but if not we would induce, which is what we ended up doing. </p>
<p>One thing they don't mention is that induction can take like 24 hours, and it's kinda uncomfortable. Induction doesn't make the baby come out right away!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't, the due date is calculated based on the date of your last period. That's why there's so much wiggle room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re intentionally trying to conceive, you often will know when you ovulate and can determine conception within a day or two. You can’t get pregnant when you’re not ovulating, so it’s a fairly small window.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally it's based off the last period date. You can test for ovulation if you're trying for a baby with fairly cheap kits. You just pee on a stick and it tells you one of the hormone levels which is an indicator of ovulation. This is helpful for women who don't have regular periods.</p>
<p>The formula is last menstrual period -3 months + 7 days.</p></div>		</li>
