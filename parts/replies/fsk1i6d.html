			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonus fact: They split into their own evolutionary tree before developing eyes, yet their eyes are almost identical to mammals (except they don't invert the image) which is used to prove &quot;convergent evolution&quot;, meaning that some things (eyes in this case) usually develop the same, because they are the best design possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard there used to be a lot more examples of pairs of mammal/marsupial that were very close to each other. Squirrels and other rodents especially, but some larger ones too. It's only somewhat recently that a lot of the marsupials have gone extinct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their eyes are significantly different than vertebrate eyes. In vertebrate eyes, the nerve fibers route before the retina, blocking some light and creating a blind spot where the fibers pass through the retina. In cephalopod eyes, the nerve fibers route behind the retina, and do not block light or disrupt the retina.</p>
<p>They're basically like ours, but better.</p></div>		</li>
