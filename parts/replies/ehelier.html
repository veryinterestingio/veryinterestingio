			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised to see this explanation not up-voted more. This was so obvious to me when living in Quebec.  Are there not any other cultures where this is the case also? </p>
<p>In addition, I found it interesting how the alternative or non-swear words in Quebec mimicked non-swear words in English.  Just as an English speaker might say &quot;shoot&quot; instead of &quot;shit&quot; when in formal company, so I heard some Quebecois say &quot;taberwit&quot; (or some other amusing variant) instead of &quot;tabernac.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually spelled &quot;tabarouette&quot; we even have butter that goes by that brand name.</p>

<p>I believe the brand is trying a sort of play-on-word about &quot;ta baratte&quot; (your butter churner).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I found this really fascinating when I lived there for a few months and was exposed to local swearing. I was in a blue collar workshop environment and quite often heard people curse what sounded like &quot;taberna&quot;. I was told it came from a history of child abuse carried out by priests that made a few church related words swear words. Quebec really was a fascinating place to live and work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tabernac (...which i see more commonly spelled as tabarnak or tbk). Comes from tabernacle, which...i dont remember specifically what that is as im not Christian or french. I hear tabernouche a lot, which i think is supposed to be a &quot;milder&quot; equivalent and which i find cute.
Tabernac, criss (christ), esti (host - communion crackers), colisse (chalice) are common</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The movie Bon cop bad cop did a great job at explaining to English speaking people the usage of « sacres ». The movie is in both languages. I can try to find the clip on a popular video sharing plateforme.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tabarnak comes from tabernacle, the cabinet that contains all the holy objects in the church. Caliss or coliss is for the calice, the chalice that is used to drink wine (blood of christ). Saint-ciboire or just ciboire is for the pyx that holds the host (hostie in french, can be used as osti or esti as swear words). There is christi or criss for christ. You could also use sacrament (don't need to translate that), baptême or batinse for the baptism and there is many more. All of them were made to insult catholic priests that tried to force the french canadian to submit to the english who won the battle for control over new france. Today they are more to express emotions and put emphasis in sentences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Russian, the word for swearing is literally the word for mother; because the prototypical swear is &quot;fuck your mother&quot;, although the most common swear words mean dick, cunt, fuck, and whore.</p>
