			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the atmosphere needs to be under very specific conditions for green to show through.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_flash" target="_blank">You can sometimes see a phenomenon during sunset where the sun flashes green for a second,</a> but you probably won't find many planet Nameks out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, often after sunset with a clear sky you can see a spectrum of colors with a clearly green band <a href="https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/ec/5a/ae/after-sunset.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/ec/5a/ae/after-sunset.jpg" target="_blank">https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/ec/5a/ae/after-sunset.jpg</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The scattering is a phenomenon of the small particles that make up the atmosphere, primarily ones that are smaller than the wavelength of the light such as individual atoms or molecules. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" target="_blank">Rayleigh scattering</a>. It will happen with nearly any atmosphere or suspension, in fact it even happens in milk, glass, gemstones, plastics, and so on.</p>
<p>Now, if you have something in the atmosphere that absorbs red light you could be left with just the green/blue end of the visible spectrum but that's not scattering. It's possible but probably rare.</p>
<p>The green (or other colors) flash during a sunrise/sunset is due to separation of the light by wavelength, similar to refraction through a prism. There are various causes but it's mainly through the different thermal layers in the atmosphere. It's a rare phenomenon that would only occur sporadically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. A good example of this is the exoplanet Osiris (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_209458_b" target="_blank">HD 209458 b</a>), a hot jupiter. The high levels of gaseous sodium in the upper atmosphere of Osiris would make its star look green, <a href="http://sciencythoughts.blogspot.com/2012/01/sunset-on-osiris.html" target="_blank">especially around sunset</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up a black dwarf. It is the theoretical end of the lifetime of a star when it cools enough that it doesn't emit a significant amount of radiation.</p>
<p>None are expected to exist yet as it should take much longer than the current age of the universe for a star to cool that much.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pigments like crayons work by absorbing light of some wavelengths, eg. Red crayon absorbs the non red wavelengths making it look red. So when you combine all the crayons they absorb all the light making them look black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The colour from crayons isn't producing light, it's absorbing it. Mixing multiple crayons means that more colours of light will be absorbed, and thus less will be reflected into our eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All light mixing together looks white. An orange crayon looks orange because it absorbs everything <em>except for</em> orange really well, reflecting more orange back to your eyes than other colors. So when you mix a bunch of colors, you are absorbing everything much better than the white paper (which reflects all colors pretty well).</p></div>		</li>
