<p>Interesting, does fish generally follow this rule too? Why do you think this is the case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im thinking it has to do with why food that has been in the fridge will taste better then food that has been left out.</p>
<p>Colder climates simply preserve things better, so the lobsters/crabs can focus on building their proteins as perfect as possible, while those in warmer climate have to focus on rebuilding and maintaining what the heat is breaking down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly due to cold climate crabs are harvested in the cold and so are better preserved? Just a thought.</p></div>		</li>
