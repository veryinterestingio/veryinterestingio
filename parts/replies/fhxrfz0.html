			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious, what do physical chemists study nowadays that isn't related to quantum mechanics? It seems to me that our understanding of thermodynamics that I can't think of much else that needs to be studied other than odds and ends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If varies quite a lot actually although I may be a bit out of the loop since I haven't been involved in research since 2012. Computational chemistry is becoming a larger part of most departments often with materials science or biological applications. There's still lots to study in kinetics, particularly as it apples to catalysis or complex atmospheric reactions. Stuff related to materials science or analytical instrumentation (application of STM or NMR). That summarizes most of what was happening in my department like 10 years ago but a current grad student may have some better answers for you. :D</p></div>		</li>
