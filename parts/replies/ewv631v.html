<p>To look at it the opposite way, there is a concept called &quot;thermal runaway&quot;.</p>
<p>If you get a MOSFET sufficiently hot, it gets into a positive feedback loop: it consumes more power, which makes it hotter, which consumes even more power, and eventually the MOSFET burns out. This exists entirely because hotter MOSFETS need more power to switch than cooler ones (at a given frequency/voltage).</p>

<p>That is more of a BJT problem. Your link even says it only happens to power MOSFETs under certain conditions.</p></div>		</li>
