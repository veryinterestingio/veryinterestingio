			<div class="markdown"><p>YOU WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY!!! I mean, I can't guarantee it 100%, but gaming is one of the most important topics of our time, and people are desperate to understand it better - especially its long-term psychological impacts. My advice to you is to keep an open mind on your research, be flexible about what you expect to find - the most respected researchers in this field acknowledge a wide spectrum of impacts, the good and the bad. Good luck to you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not Jane McGonigal (obviously), but I am a prof working as a games user researcher. If you choose to go down the route of games/play focused research, collaborate with your university's Human-Computer Interaction department. A supervisor or co-supervisor in that area would be extremely wise. Virtually all of my research background is on games and their application to mental health. There will almost definitely be someone like me on your campus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had this idea brewing, and as a dedicated underachiever, I gotta hand it off somewhere.<br />
In the same way that games like starcraft facilitate powerful level editors that can radically change the nature of the game, while remaining easily (and securely) shareable, psychology researchers should have a similar platform, where the  custom maps/levels report back the relevant telemetry to the relevant parties.<br />
People love free games. xD</p></div>		</li>
