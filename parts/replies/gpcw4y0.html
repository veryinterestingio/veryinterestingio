			<div class="markdown"><p>My Rottweiler smiled while baring teeth.  We understood he was happy to see us and it came with a full body wag with his head lowered submissively.  Other people didn't understand his smile and were terrified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure my dog does smile and can honestly see an animal such as dogs that uniquely understand human facial gestures also pick up on these. There's a very distinct difference between energetic happiness and calm happiness in my dog, the latter which she almost always &quot;smiles&quot; when expressing.</p>
<p>I might be wrong, as a dog owner I'm obviously biased/go of by my one dog and not dogs as a whole, but still I definitely remember this from all the dogs I've gotten to known and spent time smiling with - they will pick up on it.</p></div>		</li>
