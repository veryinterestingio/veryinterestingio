			<div class="markdown"><p>If that is the case, how do seasonal day/night differences factor in? For instance, wouldn't that mean people closer to the equator inherently have better sleep because the day/night differences of the seasons are less extreme?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, yes! Although there is, of course, always individual variation, there are known disorders and other sleep-cycle and circadian-rhythm related effects that occur at much higher rates in populations that live very far north or very far south. In far northern countries in the summer, when there is natural light for 20+ hours per day, there are well-documented sleep disturbances. On the flip side, in the winter in those countries, when it is dark for most of the day and night, a light-exposure-related disorder called SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), is much more prevalent (basically a disorder where lack of light and the resultant lack of vitamin D and alertness chemicals in the brain cause depressive symptoms).</p></div>		</li>
