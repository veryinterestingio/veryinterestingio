			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, music often denies you the satisfaction on purpose, ending on a different note than expected, and starting over. This can be done several times to keep up a sort of anticipation until finally it ends as it's &quot;supposed to&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an interview with Maynard (Lead singer of Tool) about his music.  </p>
<p>He explained how he wanted to make music that climaxed when they wanted it to. That music is supposed to be an edging or a tease towards a direction and then having the climax when they feel it's right.  </p>
<p>I suffer from emotional reactions to music/music videos. I'll have panic attack symptoms and once the song does the &quot;climax&quot; is usually when my eyeballs turn into hydrants. Even to the most stupid of music videos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often referred to as Tension  and Release (at least how I was taught it). Some classical composers (Haydn I think) employed this quite a lot to act almost as a &quot;musical joke&quot; to subvert the expectations of the audience.</p>
<p>With regards to sounds happening often enough for our brains to relate them together, Adam Neely has a fairly in depth exploration of this somewhere on his YouTube channel. I want to say the maximum distance between sounds is something like 1.6 seconds for our brains to relate them but I could totally be pulling that number out of my ass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once met a musician who played in Ray Charles' orchestra.  They had a tune under 40 bpm (where most metronomes stop).  She told him she was having trouble locking in on a pulse.  He told her to watch his leg. Sure enough, he was tapping out a super precise tempo.</p>
