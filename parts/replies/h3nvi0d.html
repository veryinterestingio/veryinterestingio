			<div class="markdown"><p>We took in a very young kitten who was rejected by her mother (she has substantial health issues, we suspect the mother sensed that as she took care of the rest of the litter).  </p>
<p>We raised her on bottle and kept plushie caterpillars in her box with her. Now she <em>still</em> keeps these caterpillars in a nest and does the mother mewl when carrying them to us around 7 years later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing how often small-cat and big-cat behaviors intertwine. Makes you wonder how old those instinctual behaviors are, on an evolutionary scale, or in some cases, just how far back the socialization aspect started sharing that specific behavior down the chain of generations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also observed this behavior in cats. I'm not sure if it's because they are related, but the mother cat and daughter cat will often both take care of the kittens. If food became scarce I feel like they would be less likely to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under more extreme stress and scarcity, cats have been known to cannibalize their own young, so yeah, the circumstances definitely change. All the more reason to take good care of nature when possible.</p></div>		</li>
