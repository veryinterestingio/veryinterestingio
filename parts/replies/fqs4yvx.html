			<div class="markdown"><p>Different reactors process materials differently. You can sometimes tell from how much of each isotope is present, and therefore what was used to make it. If you know that, you can say where it was, since there aren't too many reactors used to make it in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is possible. That is a realistic thing. Plutonium is a product of breeder reactors. The breeder reactors each have individual characteristics. </p>
<p>If you have inventoried the radiation spectrum from the product of one reactor you can identify plutonium that comes from that source.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But it appears that this information will only get you so far; you still need to do some good old fashioned detective work to tie up those bits of information to a source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, that's the gist of it, huge boom, lots of gamma radiaton. The people that  survive the blast are heavily irradiated but the radiation dissipates quickly because there are no leftovers emitting radiation.
How long would ground zero be hazardous to be in? Days?
For context I'm trying to figure out what it would do to a city. Imagine a bunch of loonies that have tiny metal balls with increasingly large fractions of a gram of antimatter in them. Leave the ball hidden somewhere till the timer runs out and the sphere loses power and it blows. Bomb squad gets to it, they don't know its antimatter and turn of power to the device, it explodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since there would be no fallout, the safety of entering the area after the explosion would depend on mundane things, like whether buildings are still burning or in danger of collapsing, or if damaged infrastructure like electrical and natural gas posed a major risk. Cleanup would have to be done, then rebuilding of infrastructure, then finally rebuilding apartments and buildings and such. From a radiation hazard point of view, it would likely be &quot;safe&quot; almost immediately, but those mundane hazards could take a while to deal with.</p>
<p>For inspiration, you could literally look at disasters like earthquakes  to see how long it took to rebuild.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't entirely true.  The high gamma flux will leave some portion of the materials at ground zero highly radioactive.  It's the same reason that it's misleading to say that a fusion reactor produces no nuclear waste.  The longer a fusion reactor runs, the more radioactive the device and the shielding ends up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>they're fail horribly wrong rather than fail safe like nuclear. It's hard to make a nuclear bomb go boom. It's even harder to make sure anitmatter does not go boom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm going to wildly speculate here, but couldn't a bomb be engineered (in the furthest stretches of science fiction) that used another mechanism to make the antimatter for the larger reaction (very roughly) similar to the way that modern nuclear weapons use a conventional explosion to improve yield? </p>
<p>As I understand it, that's part of the reason why modern nuclear weapons are 'safer' than older ones - they only produce a fission reaction explosion under very carefully-designed conditions. So, in theory, couldn't an antimatter weapon be designed to be 'safe' in a similar way? Or is there something about the matter-antimatter annihilation that prohibits that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, &quot;making antimatter&quot; requires the same or more energy the antimatter will release. So, if you want to build a bomb where you produce antimatter, you need to pack it with another mechanism that can store the energy. And if you can do that, you don't need to create antimatter, because you already have a way to release that energy.</p>
<p>Plutonium or uranium is naturally (almost) stable, unless &quot;ignited&quot; by a mechanism. Fossil fuels, TNT, hydrogen, or anything we use for energy release is naturally stable, unless we do an action to make them go boom. </p>
<p>Antimatter is not stable. If we create antimatter, we go great lengths to keep it from destroying itself. You need a very powerful and precise system if you want to keep the few atoms of antimatter that you can create in a lab, in a bomb, or any place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible for a few atoms to breach containment, and even if it is just hypothetical, would that create an explosion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually that is kind of the concept I was working on and why I asked this question in the first place. I don't know what I want to do with the story yet or anything.
In this story, a mentally unstable physics savant figures out a way to just make antimatter in an atypical way, and begins shipping them to various extremist groups in small metal spheres containing in suspension anywhere from fractions of a gram to one gram of antimatter.
So now you have a bunch of crazies with what are very easily transportable balls capable of releasing nuclear equivalent yields. And impossible to disarm too, if the device loses power it blows up and takes the whole neighborhood with it.
It would be a thriller I guess?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fission step in hydrogen bombs are used to give a small amount of energy to <em>trigger</em> fusion, which unleashes latent energy as hydrogen fuses into helium.</p>
<p>Meanwhile for matter/antimatter, it takes the same amount of energy (read: lots) to create antimatter as the amount released when they annihilate</p></div>		</li>
