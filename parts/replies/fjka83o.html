			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure where you're getting your info but you're a bit off on a few things. What you're referring to as 'spikes' are actually called spines (dendritic spines), and they are not myelinated. As far as I know myelination isn't directly involved in memory formation/storage/retrieval. Spikes (action potentials) are electrical potentials that are the currency of neural activity, which is kinda what you said in the first paragraph. When an input neuron fires spikes in sync with a downstream neuron that can lead to changes in synaptic strength (hebbian/anti-hebbian plasticity, LTP/LTD). The interesting thing is that often that doesn't actually happen through anatomical changes to dendritic spines/synapses, as you were saying, but molecular changes that affect the synapse's strength (more post-synaptic receptors). Finally, what you mentioned about Na/K ions smashing into membranes and changing the anatomical structure of a neuron is only kinda accurate. What happens is that changes in electrical potential (activity, due to influx/eflux of Na/K/Cl) result in activation of molecular pathways that remodel the actin cytoskeleton to grow new spines, or prune old ones. But as I said that doesn't actually happen in adult memory/experience to the same degree as it does during development.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What mechanism is used to create mylenated dendrites, that channel ions to the terminal portion of the synapse, as one would see in high plasticity brains?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of this information was taught to me in college and university level courses and is still in the &quot;not yet passed academically accepted theories&quot; stage of research.</p>
<p>Synaptic spikes are almost synonymous with neural nets weights of node interactions, so if you want to learn about them in detail pick up a book on neural networks as some of the brightest minds ever to study neurology worked on modeling synaptic growth for computers to get better at mapping human behaviors algorithmically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Synaptic spikes are synonymous with artificial neural network (ANN) 'activations'. You might mean synaptic spines though. ANN 'Weights' are synonymous with biological synapses (or better yet, functional connections, which is a slightly more abstract concept of how one neuron influences another).</p>
<p>How ANNs learn (backprop.) is actually a poor model for how biological networks learn because it involves passing errors backward through the whole network. There's no evidence of that occurring in the brain. Biological brains seem to learn in a 'fire together wire together' or 'fire together unwire  together' way (associative plasticity).</p>
<p>We know a lot more about how things work than you're giving credit for, but there's still orders of magnitude more that we don't know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is also why headaches and migraines seem to be related to new knowledge acquisition and/or back propagation to reinforce previous knowledge.</p>

<p>Could you expand on that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher levels of growth produce higher levels of localized byproducts.</p>
<p>The new knowledge or reinforcement doesnt even have to be accurate, it just has to produce a higher than normal activation in a clustered region that can't be cleared effectively.</p>
<p>Think of microwave pockets in food as an analogy, but you're sending brainwaves through neurons and smashing up the sides of dendrites trying to build new branches of tissue.</p></div>		</li>
