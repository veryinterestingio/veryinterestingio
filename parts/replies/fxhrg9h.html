			<div class="markdown"><p>but mass times acceleration applies to both the accelerating and decelerating force.  Yes, will be a difference is practice b/c not fully rigid object so the impact is not felt equally across the object upon impact, but i don't think that's the answer.</p>
<p>Air resistance is about cross section, momentum is about mass/volume. As an object gets bigger (assume sphere for simplicity), momentum scales much faster than <del>momentum</del> <em>air resistance</em>.  Conversely, as an object gets smaller, air resistance becomes much more significant.  </p>
<p>Imagine there is also an element of strength of all the underlying components. But its too late for me to ponder that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>uh... momentum = mass * velocity, what does volume have to do with it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>momentum scales much faster than momentum. </p>

<p>also this makes no sense</p></div>		</li>
