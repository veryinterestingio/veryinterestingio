			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Burning&quot; really means rapid oxidation.</p>
<p>I think a better way of putting it is that most solids can't burn because they don't have enough surface area. For example steel wool will burn and it's a metal! </p>
<p>Normally the lack of surface area means that heat can be quickly dissipated into the rest of the material before more oxygen can get to the reaction to raise the temperature.</p>
<p>Some materials have special properties such as being self oxidizing (thermite) or release enough energy in their reaction to continue burning even with relatively little surface area (magnesium).</p>
<p>But generally most materials need their surface vaporized - and that vapor is what burns - because the material itself steals too much energy and has too small of a surface area to replenish the oxygen to continue the reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The solid wood itself isn't burning. It's undergoing a process called pyrolysis, whereby the solid wood is breaking down into gaseous products due to heat, and those gases are what burns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a fire-ologist, but a <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/fire1.htm" target="_blank">quick search</a> indicates that the process is very similar!</p>
<p>When solid wood is heated to a certain temperature (about 300F/150C), it breaks apart, which releases gas! That gas ignites, and that's what produces the visible flames.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When wood is heated, it emits water vapour first and then flammable gases and vapours. It's those that burn. The wood first absorbs heat, to vaporize the water, gases &amp; vapours (pyrolysis) before it contributes heat to the fire.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (coal gas) is a major component of the flammable gases emitted by heating coal or wood. They used to make town gas by heating coal (fossilized wood) , with insufficient oxygen to complete combustion. The same process with wood creates charcoal.</p>
<p>If you have a wood fire, with a chimney that's cold, the vaporized tars will condense  on the inner walls of the chimney. If enough accumulates, that can catch fire and it burns like a blast furnace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a related fact, wood fires have the fresh wood piled on top and the air supply comes from below, by convection; warm air rises. The fresh wood is heated by radiant heat from the fire bed below and the hot air stream. When all the flammable gases and vapours start being emitted, they're swept upwards and away by the air current, before they can fully burn. </p>
<p>Wood fires are grossly inefficient, the air flow goes the wrong way.  A downdraught gasifier wood burner  is an impressive thing to see in operation.</p></div>		</li>
