			<div class="markdown"><p>Also Cdn pharmacist. </p>
<p>Can confirm same availability. Though, my pharmacy has only been able to order the following: Flulaval Tetra, Fluzone HD and Flucelvax Quad. I haven't seen the Fluzone Tri? QIV? -- at least, not from the provincial government supplied vaccines we're ordering through McKesson.</p>
<p>We're also being limited to 1 vial of Flulaval Tetra and one box of 5x0.5mL Fluzone HD per every few days. It's kind of scary how many people we have waitlisted for vaccinations and we can't provide them - especially the at-risk patients. I'll take a vial here, and a box there over nothing - but hey. The Public Health organization here has been so unprepared and it's mind-boggling - but also very telling.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you, your staff and your patients. Take good care!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also haven’t been given any Fluzone regular this year (but mckesson and the CPHA list it as an option). The other 3 I have been given. It’s a total gong show. I’ve given more flu shots this year than I did all of last year and it isn’t even November. For my province there are different order #s for flucelvax and flulaval - make sure you order one of each (at least that’s 20 per day as opposed to 10) ....as of yesterday I was told no more HD, but that can change. I can’t keep up......I left a super busy retail environment for a clinic pharmacy......it’s months like this that I really remember why.....I know every pharmacy is in the same boat. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flu vaccine has not caused any deaths in South Korea this year.</p>
<p>The teen who died a few days after getting his flu vaccine in SK, for example, killed himself.</p>
<p>What they are seeing, is the normal background rate of deaths which occur whether people are vaccinated or not. </p>
