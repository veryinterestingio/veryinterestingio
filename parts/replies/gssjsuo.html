			<div class="markdown"><p>This even applies to home gardening, too. The work involved with having a tiny vegetable garden isn't that much less than the work involved in having one 5x its size, provided you are set up well.</p>
<p>I say that from direct experience. We had two little 4x4 raised beds in our yard, hand-watered. Pretty typical little suburban plot. Then I expanded.</p>
<p>These days, I have 15 of them, plus a load of potted stuff, as well as a 10x25-ish section of in-ground garden, and once I put irrigation in (which was cheaper than you'd imagine), the workload barely increased at all. A few more weeds to pull, but even that can be managed by several methods.</p>
<p>My harvests have increased by HUGE amounts while my time and money investment have increased by only a fraction of that. The only MAJOR workload increase is prep time in the spring, which takes me several weeks of on-and-off work, maybe an hour a day a few day a week.</p>
<p>When we first started gardening, it was NOT cheaper than buying things at the store.</p>
<p>Now it is.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks to everyone enjoying my posts. To be clear, I don't want to present myself as some expert or professional. I'm a suburban gardening hobbyist. I'm just someone who has fallen in deep with the gardening hobby to the point where it's now a huge part of my life! Hah! Happy gardening to anyone else on the same journey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you use round-up-ready crops or what? Picking weeds is the work that takes the most time in my garden. And growing more crops increases the area I need to clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing Round-Up at all. At this point most of my seeds are either gathered from the previous year's crop or are just your standard packet seeds from the local garden center. I don't use any herbicides or anything like that.</p>
<p>To control weeds, I cover my beds in sheets of cardboard over the winter to minimize the number of seeds that get dropped in there during the winter months, then during the growing season I use layers of crops to minimize weeds.</p>
<p>By that I mean that if I have a bed of tomatoes, for example, I also put a cantaloupe or honeydew or watermelon plant in that same bed. Tomatoes go up the stake while the melons crawl over the ground and cover the bare earth. Weeds have less of a chance to thrive when they can't get a foothold.</p>
<p>I do the same with radishes and carrots (and to an extent, onions) throughout the year. In areas between whatever else I'm planting, I'll do rows of radishes, etc. When those radish and carrot leaves are spreading out, there is less chance for weeds to invade.</p>
<p>I do still have to fight weeds, of course, but it tends to be pretty manageable.</p>
<p>To be fair, I also have the advantage of working from home, so sometimes I'll take a short break from work and idly pull a few weeds just to take my mind off work. Even if I only do 15 or 20 minutes a day, that can be two hours of weed pulling over the course of the week rather than two hours out of a single Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>I find that most of the work subsides by mid-summer, when the plants have good size. I ignore weed management through most of August.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roundup-ready varatities exist only for arable crops. Unless you are growing soybeans, silage corn, canola, sugar beets, cotton or alfalfa. You can't get roundup ready varieties.</p>
<p>Seeds sprout after being hit by light and getting water.</p>
<p>You can either work the top 5 cm of your garden to awaken all weeds and remove them in one fell swoop to reduce the amount of weed seeds in your soil or mulch so less light touches the surface of the soil and activates weed seeds.</p>
<p>Long term that should help with weeds. Also look if there are sources where weed seeds can come from. Like large weeds near your garden or birdseed being used in compost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a landscaper and gardener and I rarely pull weeds. What you do is once a week take a narrow 3 pronged rake and rake the dirt all around your plants. This will uproot any weeds (just leave the uprooted weeds in the dirt they shouldn't be more than an inch or 2 tall). Occasionally you will have to hand pull a few weeds that sneak in too close to the plants. Takes no time and your garden will look perfect everyday. My friend had a funny 'rake' she made with a 2x2 with 2 nails in the end, works great</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's beautiful, I think we are on this planet to garden. It's very rare to see someone fall out of love with gardening, once you're hooked you'll be in love with it forever. It teaches you patience, gratitude, to share even when you don't want to (pests!) and that the more you cooperate with nature, the more you will be rewarded. Happy gardening to you! ðŸŒ± x</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has changed my life. I didn't start doing this until I was in my late 30s, early 40s, and it legitimately changed my life.</p>
<p>I get so much <em>peace</em> from being out in the garden. It's an escape. I feel <em>productive</em>. It's helped me to eat healthier, too, because I don't want my labor to go to waste. </p>
<p>It's even made me feel more connected to my own home and to the small world around me. I pay much closer attention to it than I ever did before. I see it in ways I didn't before.</p>
<p>What started as a hobby (and still is) has fundamentally changed how I live.</p>
<p>Which blows my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, absolutely! Between beds, hoses, and a mess of other stuff the up-front cost and labor can add up, but once it's done, it's <em>done</em>.</p>
<p>I do home composting and my county provides free leaf mulch compost, so that's taken care of each year. I save seeds and store them in the fridge, so my seed cost is minimal each year. And once I put in cheap drip irrigation, my labor and water bills came down, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their prices are also directly proportional to the individual fruit/vegs ability to be transported. Carrots are super easy to transport, last a long time after they've been pulled out of the ground, don't really need refrigeration and there is very little waste.</p>
<p>However, there are hundreds of varieties of bananas people can eat, but only 3-4 different kinds (and mostly just cavendish) can be economically sold commercially. </p>
<p>Some things you can really only buy frozen or canned since they don't ship fresh at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also why some of the best apples are only used for juice and applesauce. Stores sell the apples that ship best and polish up nice and shiny, not necessarily the ones that taste best.</p>
<p>Another reason to shop at farmers markets...sometimes you can get good varieties of fruits and veggies that stores don't sell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also a number of vegetables that get flash-frozen within a few hours of harvest, fully ripe and at their peak of flavor and nutrition instead of green for overseas shipping. If you're eating cooked <em>whatever</em> instead of raw, get it frozen. Rush shipping and spoilage loss are not part of their cost calculation, and they're every bit as good and nutritious as locally grown, fully ripe, fresh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a conventional corn farmer, this. Corn, soybeans, wheat, rye, etc can all be planted, tended, and harvested by mechanical means. A small group of people can farm a large area easily, plus these crops can easily be transported and stored for years. </p>
<p>People often say &quot;why don't you grow cucumbers or something besides corn?&quot; The answers, available markets and available man power. Seasonal help is hard to find, it's hard enough to find extra truck driver or two during harvest because what are they supposed to do the other 10 months out of the year? Certain crops simply require more man power than what a low populated area can supply. And then there's finding a market for stuff. Dad tried growing popcorn in the 80's. Turns out, the local movie theaters already had contracts with vendors and the only elevator that would take it was 3 hours away. Factor in diesel fuel and it became a loss. Sure, fresh produce gets shipped from all over the world, but those are instances of places that have long established infrastructure and supply lines. It's a pretty tall order for Joe Shmoe Family Farm.</p></div>		</li>
