			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation. Just wanted to add, in case it wasn't obvious from this post, that when you buy a stock on an exchange you're not giving the company money. It's all speculation.
An IPO is an exception where the company initially issues shares (ownership in the company) for a set price. If you manage to get the stock in the initial offering then in that case you are giving the company money in exchange for partial ownership.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically you're giving the underwriters the money. This matters because any &quot;pop&quot; in the price goes to them, and not to the underlying company.</p>
<p>The financiers running the IPO have an incentive to undervalue the share price, so that they can make their favored clients more rich at the expense of the company selling its shares.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely. The company negotiated the price with the underwriter before they IPOed, the company has a choice of underwriters. Furthermore you don’t want to price it to high, because then there would be no order flow after IPO and the price of the share would go down, and the initial investors would lose money. </p>
<p>So there is a balance on what a share price should be at IPO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice explanation yourself!
And to build on this, when people buy and sell shares, it’s called trading. And this is all it is. Two parties exchanging an asset (shares in this case) for another assert (money).  The value of the assets change over time, which is what makes it profitable (or expensive lol)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a lot like buying and selling anything else. If you buy a couch at a store for $500 and sell it to your neighbor for $300, that $200 difference isn’t money that just vanished into the ether. The store still has your $500.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So step 2 in your scenario so what Op is asking. You paid $1000 to OP and tomorrow the item is useless down to $1. OP still has $999 that you gave him. His question is where is the $999 now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When your buying stocks etc.  and we ignore the fees.   </p>
<p>Think of it as a trade between two people </p>
<p>Adam and Bertie. </p>
<p>Adam owns a share (part of a company) of Example Company Inc.  </p>
<p>He decides to put it on the market for 100:-
Bertie is browsing for stocks and buys the stock for 100:-
Adam gets 100:- , Bertie owns a part of Example company with a worth of 100:- </p>
<p>The next day disaster strikes as a financial report shows that Example company Inc have not met the markets expectations on revenue.  </p>
<p>The market is adjusted as some panic sells and prices drops.  What everyone thinks it’s worth.<br />
The price stabling at 95:- </p>
<p>Now Bertie still owns a share of company Example company Inc. the value of that share is lower tho.<br />
But that doesn’t matter until Bertie sells his share.</p>
<p>A stock only holds POTENTIAL value.  Until you sell it</p>
<p>You buy stock (risking) your money that someone else would think the item (stock) is worth more in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the reason company would prefer to be valued at $1,000 is that initially they gave out a small slice of the company (and future profits in the form of dividends) all for just a $1 a slice. Next time they want to borrow money by offering a few slices they will be getting $1,000 per slice, way better than last time. Hopefully the next round after that people will see them as being worth even more and then be willing to pay $10,000 a slice. </p>
<p>Unless, of coarse, if they wanted to buy back all the one dollar shares in anticipation that they are relatively cheap now and will be worth lots more in the near future. Then the company might want to be seen as worthless for a bit or priced as worth closer to a $1 a share and not the $1,000 a share it was almost valued at. Once as many cheap slices are recalled, repurchased or bought back from investors by the company, the new invention is revealed and slices go back to being worth $1,000 or $10,000. Then the company doesn’t have to pay back as much in the future when you don’t owe all these dividends to all the $1 investors that got in for $1 slices.</p></div>		</li>
