			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's crazy the conditions they fought in. I mean dying simply cus you fell into a blast crater that was too muddy to get out of?? Then just the restoration Jackson's team did was astounding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yap, Passchendaele was especially gnarly. I look forward to traveling to Euroupe to take in all those somber sights some day. For now I guess I'll suffice with the swamp, and Florida man for entertainment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>+1 for Blueprint for Armageddon. An absolutely fascinating podcast documentary. The contrasting between WW1 and how armies and navies had functioned even 20 years earlier was particularly eye opening for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also how the armies modified and adapted throughout the war. Didn't French start by carrying swords (sabres) and wore soft military hats? At the same time the German's had a lot more modern artillery. Unbelievable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like in the little BBC video at the beginning Peter Jackson is like &quot;Pan around to it&quot; and points at the film he's talking about. Giving direction while giving an interview haha.</p></div>		</li>
