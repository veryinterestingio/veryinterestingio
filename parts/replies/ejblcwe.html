			<div class="markdown"><p>We were forced to embrace at least partial decimal measurements by the EU relatively recently (20 years or so ago).</p>
<p>I don't know where you are but I order a pint of beer, a cup of coffee, buy petrol by the litre but milk by the pint (it has both measurements on the bottles), measure my height in ft and inches but my weight in kg, distances to drive in miles, but to walk in meters or kilometres, and fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.</p>
<p>We race horses along furlongs (and chains, which is its subdivision), and give directions in either feet or meters depending on who you ask and what time of day it is (we can be fickle like that).</p>
<p>Buy water and soft drinks by the litre in a supermarket but by the pint in a pub.</p>
<p>This level of using both is not going anywhere, especially as &quot;can I have 568ml of bitter&quot; doesn't roll off the tongue as easily as &quot;can I have a pint of bitter&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
