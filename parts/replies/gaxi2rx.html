			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm very interested to see what kind of &quot;post-COVID cognitive syndrome&quot; beings to take shape as the (currently very new) literature base begins to mature and develop. Given some of the preliminary findings I wouldn't be surprised if there were two(ish) subtypes of patients: one group presenting with acute onset of severe difficulties but a gradual recovery into more chronic cognitive issues due to inflammatory issues and/or diffuse white matter lesions, and a second group with reversible cognitive impairment secondary to non-neurologic factors such as residual COVID symptoms and psychiatric distress. Regardless, it's going to be a very interesting area of research (and probably great debate) over the next few years at the least.</p>
