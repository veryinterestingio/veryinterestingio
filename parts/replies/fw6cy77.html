			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly; changing the gas mixture is important, since at a certain depth our normal atmospheric air actually gets toxic when used for diving, so...not nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they have to mix up the ratios. Too much oxygen is toxic.  And you don't want to just go with more nitrogen either.  Typically they start replacing it with helium, since it doesn't have the same problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For recreational scuba diving (&quot;regular/normal&quot; diving), yes, the air in the tank is compressed atmospheric air, although water vapor is removed. Sometimes a recreational diver will use &quot;enriched&quot; air, which is air with a slightly increased oxygen content and reduced nitrogen.</p>
<p>It is only for technical diving (requiring advanced training) where divers go really deep that you start to get in to helium mixtures and multiple tanks of different air mixtures and all of that really intense stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although not the same as what you're responding to, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis" target="_blank">nitrogen narcosis with increasing pressure is a real concern</a>. This has led to many deaths by people diving too rapidly and becoming confused, often not able to find their way back up or ascending too quickly then suffering from decompression sickness and/or death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is doubtful.</p>
<p>1 atmosphere of pressure is equivalent to about 10 meters or 30 feet of water. When diving at that depth <a href="https://www.leisurepro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/divetables-1.jpg" target="_blank">you are allowed about 3 hours before you reach your decompression limit</a>, and almost 2 hours before a safety stop is required when ascending (a safety stop is always a good idea though).</p>
<p>The deepest mine below sea level in the world is Kidd Creek at ~10k feet (3km) below sea level. At that depth the air pressure would be <a href="https://www.mide.com/air-pressure-at-altitude-calculator" target="_blank">roughly 40% higher than sea level</a> accounting for pressure from the ventilation system we could assume it is perhaps 50% higher than sea level.</p>
<p>That would be equivalent to a 15 ft (5 m) dive. At that shallow depth decompression sickness is barely a consideration (note that the PADI tables I linked do not even go that shallow).</p>
<p>As for ascending fast enough, the cage in a mine hoist does move very quickly - somewhat faster than you would ascend from a recreational dive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with all your points.</p>
<p>Additionally, the cage in a mine hoist does move very quickly, but it moves through air, not water - so the pressure change is much slower than coming up from a recreational dive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atmospheric pressure increases with depth the same as it lessens as you rise into the atmosphere, a.k.a. Boyle''s Law. The bends is definitely an issue for both deep sea diving and deep bore mining. This paper is good at explaining the problem in relation to mining. <a href="https://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v105n06p387.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v105n06p387.pdf</a></p>
<p>You might be interested in reading about the deepest bore hole in Russia. It's not used for biological research as much as geological, but it did find microscopic plankton fossils 4 miles deep. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Workers building the Foundation for the Brooklyn bridge suffered the bends over a hundred years ago. Thatâ€™s without modern tools or elevators. How long you stay down as well atmospheric conditions are just as important as the depth and speed of ascent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thinks that is because it was pressurised to keep the water out. Someone above pointed out that the deepest mine at 3km below sea level is only equivalent to being 15m underwater.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although in that case I believe that the tunnels they were working in were pressurized to prevent collapse. Here is a case report from the construction of a different bridge:  </p>
