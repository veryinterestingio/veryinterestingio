			<div class="markdown"><p>These are extremely different topics. I may have misinterpreted the OP, but I read it as real life disturbing images. There is a world of difference between people who can't look away from an actual dead body and people who love horror movies. My reference was to the former</p>
<p>I would also say that horror is far too generic of a label for films nowadays. plenty of people love watching Halloween, but refused to watch a single kill scene from the hostel series.</p></div>		</li>
