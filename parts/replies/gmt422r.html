			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/Z0zConOPZ8Y" target="_blank">Because we think they're cute</a>. So we associate that feeling of softness to cute and being calm/happy.</p>
<p>I have never pet a turtle, so my brain hasn't developed the association that &quot;touching scales &gt; cute &gt; calm&quot;, but I grew up with cats and dogs so I do have that association with mammalian fur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to be more than that they are cute and soft, otherwise we'd get the same release from similar inanimate objects.  Clearly both parties have to enjoy the interaction, which tells me there is some kind of feedback loop that taps into some more primitive shared mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would bet it has to do with some ancient evolutionary benefit to grooming.</p>
<p>Eli5, a long time ago some primate like things started grooming each other because some mutation somewhere made oxytocin release so they survived because they had less bugs living on them and now that circuitry is just part of being human and we stopped grooming each other so we do it to other mammals now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans still stroke and comb each others' hair. We just tend to reserve it for particularly close/familiar individuals, and we tend to do it in private. But even with that tendency, you'll still catch people running their fingers through their partners' hair while they're sitting next to each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just speculating, but I think it has to do with being raised around animals to some degree. If you weren't raised around pets, your brain might not make that association. I believe that's the case for me, at least. If you grew up with animals then my hypothesis is probably incorrect.</p></div>		</li>
