			<div class="markdown"><p>It is true a capping inversion (a letter of the troposphere where temperature increases with height) with moist air below and dry air above, similar to the setups we get east of the Rockies, promote supercell formation.   Your description is a bit off though. The capping inversion is going to erode due to convection in the boundary layer. It is basically mixed away while at the same time the surface is warming and parcels are becoming more buoyant throughout the day. At some point if the cap erodes enough and/or surface parcels are buoyant enough, convection will make it through.</p></div>		</li>
