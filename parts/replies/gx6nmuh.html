			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, in movies like the Indiana Joneses we often see entire pits full of spiders, centipedes, snakes (okay they are not insects, but anyway) and other creepy crawlies. How do they know the difference between their friends and their prey, and won't just attack anything that moves in front of them? I know that spiders do occasionally eat other spiders, but I understand that is only when they're really hungry.</p></div>		</li>
