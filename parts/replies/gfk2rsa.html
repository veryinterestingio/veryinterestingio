<p>Tl;dr - most every day measuring devices are not exact, but they are good enough.</p>

<p>This is perfect, I'd want to add you can also usually pay more money for higher precision.  A ruler in a child's play tool set is much cheaper than a ruler you'd find a machinist using, but is also much less accurate. </p>
<p>It's important to know how accurate you need to be, and have a tool that can measure to that level of accuracy, but theres no need to spend 10x more money for level of accuracy you'll never use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd always recommend finding a good metal ruler - one that is &quot;exactly&quot; 12&quot;x1&quot;</p>
<p>Eg, one of these: <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/metal-rulers/certified-lightweight-aluminum-rulers/" target="_blank">https://www.mcmaster.com/metal-rulers/certified-lightweight-aluminum-rulers/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ironically, the site you linked to only has one ruler that’s “exactly” 12 inches by one inch and it measures in tenths of an inch not eighths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We build race engines and the level of accuracy needed to mic a crank would make most people’s head spin. We have thousand of dollars in tooling just for measuring things to the thousandth or less of an inch.</p></div>		</li>
