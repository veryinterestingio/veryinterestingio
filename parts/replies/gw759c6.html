<p>Your eyes will be a bit stiff for a while afterwards but beyond that there’s just a bit of a scratchy feeling and some mild soreness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the nerve that tells the muscle to move your left eye to the left also send a signal to the right eye to move to the left, and vice versa. So if either eye looks towards the outside of your visual field the other eye is pulled along with it. Of course, this doesn’t apply when you cross your eyes because the nerves that move the eyes toward the outside aren’t getting activated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way of putting it appears to be:</p>
<p>The nerve can only send one signal at a time, and that signal goes to both eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible it's due to a lazy eye, or because of another neurological issue that'll result in difficulty controlling your eyes when you're older. But it could just be a thing you can do. It's a rare ability because evolutionarily it was pretty much detrimental, but it's not unheard of.</p>
<p>Do you have any elder family members with this ability? If so, check with them, because it's likely you've inherited the same cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that’s interesting i never thought about it being genetic, i asked and my mom said no one in her or my dads families ever even knew it was possible. ive never had a lazy eye, and it’s never like happened by accident it’s always been something i do on purpose. the idea of a neurological issue is interesting tho o.O</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you're describing strabismus (eye turn), not amblyopia (reduced vision).  Strabismus is one common cause of amblyopia, but they're not synonymous. There are other causes of amblyopia.  You also can't tell if someone has amblyopia/'lazy eye&quot; just by looking at them.  For strabismus to cause amblyopia the eye turn (inward or outward) needs to be constant and always the same eye.  Otherwise it's just a form of strabismus. Side note: Even normal eyes aren't expected to be perfectly aligned when relaxed (it's called exophoria/esophoria).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. You can do naturally what it took me all of 7th grade to achieve! Gives me a headache, but I can now play &quot;pong&quot; with my eyes.</p>
<p>(This was self defense against several boys who would flip their eyelids inside-out to freak out the girls with &quot;zombie eyes&quot;. I couldn't do that, but independently rolling eyeballs got their attention/fear/respect. I could do &quot;demonic possession eyes&quot; and that made me a badass.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you just describing a voluntary relative inward eye turn? No, that's not a bad thing. It just shows good eye muscle control, and pretty much anyone can learn to do it. If you believe you can voluntarily look upward or downward with one eye relative to the other, you're either mistaken or you have a vertical heterophoria bordering on hypertropia. Small verticals are common but larger deviations can be problematic/symptomatic (e.g. double vision). I guess another possibility is a palsy of one of the cranial nerves causing restriction in certain gazes.</p></div>		</li>
