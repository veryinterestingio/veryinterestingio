<p>I'll be damned. I thought that space elevator on the Moon was impossible. I forgot about Lagrange points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is interesting. However, what benefit would this elevator be to humanity when there is no one or capable robotics on the moon to use it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. You must know many other interesting things that us rather superficial space travel fans don't. I would love to see a post with some of these relatively esoteric proposals. Seriously.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Whenever I hear about Lagrange points...the ZZ top song pops into my head. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that the L1 point isn't stable.<br />
L4 and L5 are points of stable equilibrium, like a ball at the bottom of a valley.  L1, L2, amd L3 are like balls balanced on the top of a hill.  Without constant stationkeeping adjustments, the upper end of the elevator would drift away from the point of stability, and fall out of orbit.</p>
<p>Assuming the upper terminal would be pretty massive, that stationkeeping would eat up a lot of propellant.  Even worse, a breakdown or failure of the stationkeeping system could result in the whole thing falling out of orbit.  </p>
<p>Seems like a risky plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the upper terminal can be easily held stable by the cable on the &quot;far&quot; side of L1/L2. Like putting a ball on a string on the other side of a ridge. </p>
<p>L1/L2/L3 are more like balancing a ball on a mountain pass than on top of a hill, they are stable side-to-side but unstable on the axis between the &quot;big masses&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stability aside, Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, depending on the moon you may induce a current in a conductive space elevator.  This is aside from the electric charge issues the the environment may cause. However could be a good power source.
I'll freely admit I haven't done the math on this, feel free to correct me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: My memory is shoddy at best, and I can't find a source for it again. I do know however that electrodynamic tethers generate a pretty decent amount of power though, so that's nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't you need a sharp gradient of something to produce power? Like, you can't simply make energy by being surrounded by high temperature since you'll just get heated to that and that'll be the end of story, no energy output. Or is it the directionality of the magnetic field that allows it to be used as a power source?</p></div>		</li>
