<p>This is an important point in why micro-organisms don't just evolve to become &quot;resistant to everything&quot;. Defenses are energetically costly, and over time without selection pressure, they get naturally selected into, or out-competed by, strains that lose those defenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is unfortunately not always the case. Some defences are energetically neutral while improving fitness. Others are not constitutively active. For example, certain bacteria can evolve to produce and secrete enzymes that break down antibiotics only when exposed to those antibiotics. In their absence they don’t produce the enzymes and therefore aren’t at an energic disadvantage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, yeah. But given long enough time, they can lose any adaption through genetic drift, i believe but i'm just a layman.</p>
<p>With enough exposure to anti-biotics, they keep those adaptations. It's a reason why hospitals are one of the biggest spreaders of anti-biotic resistant bacterias, the high rate of antibiotics, and people spreading germs to surfaces and other people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't even just &quot;defense&quot;. Forming spores is a last ditch effort to <em>survive</em>. They cannot thrive or &quot;live&quot; in such an environment. That would take absolutely massive changes to their fundamental structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Little longer analogy I heard. There are two kinds of ways to kill bacteria. Deactivate or destroy. It's like trying to disable a car. If you are rooting around in the guts trying to remove a key component or make them not function, the car manufacturer can change the design to make that more difficult. If you are shooting it with a tank, there's only so much armor they can add, and even that won't stop the biggest guns, like alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another simple answer is that if the bacteria has to change that much in order to be resistant to alcohol, it's very unlikely for the resulting evolution to cause the same problems for humans that the original did. If the bacteria survives but the result is it no longer excretes toxic waste products then it's win win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but for clarity (for those who didn't know how this works) , I want to point out that the original respondent here was directly addressing that it is extraordinarily difficult for bacterium to evolve an immunity to alcohol, which deals more with the question asked.</p>
<p>The user I'm responding to directly is trying to fill the gap by pointing out that the 0.1% of germs that survive were just fortunate enough to be in wrinkles or under nails and thus dodged the sanitizer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I think the analogy is apt. The point is that alcohol for bacteria, like lava to humans, doesn't have some subtle biochemical effect that can be dodged by the right mutation and adaptation. It's the scorched earth option; it literally destroys and breaks down the very substance they're made of. So in order to avoid being destroyed by it, they would have to turn into something completely different, which is beyond the ability of evolution (if there's not enough functional jumps in-between the initial and final state). Just like no exposure to lava can push humans to evolve a lava-resistant mineral shell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, I always assumed the 99.9% thing with disinfectant meant &quot;it kills everything it touches, but we can't guarantee you touched everything with it.&quot;</p>
<p>Is the 0.1% just made of alcohol/disinfectant resistant microbes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's also a marketing liability thing - you can't prove that EVERY germ is dead EVERY time.... but if you stick a pitri dish under a microscope and count zero blips, you can say &quot;at least 99%&quot; safely. Extra 9s are just the endless advertising arms race/ circklejerk.</p></div>		</li>
