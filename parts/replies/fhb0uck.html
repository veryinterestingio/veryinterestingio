			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflammation, too. A lot of research is showing neuroinflammation to be a common feature/symptom of long-term depression, and one that makes it incredibly hard to think. It's one of the biological aspects that makes depression feel like a severe medical problem and a social liability. </p>
<p>Inflammation makes it easy to believe the biodeterministic stories that depression is mainly genetic because the physical symptoms seem like evidence of some non-reversible biological disease. It's more complicated than that, though, and those symptoms are entirely reversible.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This may be a pedantic clarification, but as someone doing depression and neuroinflammation research I'd say that neuroinflammation is suggested to be a feature of depression as opposed to a symptom, as there's a significant amount of research suggesting that the inflammation is actually etiological, so inflammation might be causing depressive symptoms as opposed to being one itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s an <strong>important</strong> pedantic distinction. And I really appreciate you making it. It’s really good.</p>
<p>Can you, if it’s not too much bother, explain why you describe it as a “feature” of depression? Rather than a causal factor, or some other term? (I don’t think you’re wrong, I just actually don’t know.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Social isolation might not be comparable as it's more a behaviour than a physical feature or symptom. But you can say it's both a symptom and a cause of depression. Lots of things that are both symptoms and things that can aggrevate or make worse depression or at least its symptoms. Quite an insidious disease really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When physicians refer to major depression we are often just referring to a cluster of symptoms as defined by the DSM-V. When we say that therapy or medication helps depression we are actually saying that these treatments reduce these symptoms. This is very confusing because when doctors talk about other diseases (like gallstones or herpes) we are referring to the actual disease process and we have a very clear idea as to how our treatments fix these issues. </p>
<p>The underlying biological mechanisms that lead to major depression remain elusive and there are possibly numerous diseases that lead to the cluster of symptoms that we call major depression. For example, people who take certain medications, such as beta blockers, might develop all of the symptoms of major depression, but other people may develop these same symptoms after having a stroke. Two separate processes led to the same symptoms. So to answer your question, neurodegenerative processes likely do cause depression but I don't think we can say that everyone with depression has a neurodegenerative disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how well it answers your question but you can actually detect distinct differences in hormone levels in cerebrospinal fluid in people with major depression. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter commonly targeted by depression medication, will be lower. Therefore the medication is intended to correct it to more normal levels, giving somebody a chance at normal brain chemistry. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7508830" target="_blank">Here is a relevant source.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this something disputed, or controversial? I've heard in a conference that serotonin levels could not be properly measured in alive patients, and that it was even considered that depression could be linked with higher level of serotonin. But I'm quoting from memory, am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No; as someone that studies both depression and neurodegeneration (and the two in combination), I would definitely not call depression a neurodegenerative disease. Neurodegenerative diseases have a progressive course without any reversability, and generally (apart from some effects with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) are not treatable apart from symptom management.</p></div>		</li>
