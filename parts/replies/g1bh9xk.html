			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read Dennett’s Consciousness Explained several times, and I think it’s too strong to say he believes it’s not real. He highlights that our mind often fills in gaps and pretends to have a fuller picture than it really does (or it might be better said that parts of our mind tell other parts that they know more than they do). He refers to this as an Orwellian version (i.e. because some parts of our mind are the authoritative keepers of certain libraries of knowledge, they can go back and alter the record and the rest of the mind has to accept these post-hoc changes).</p>
<p>BUT, just because a lot of our self-perceptions are wrong does not mean the whole thing is “not real”. In fact, who is this Orwellian system fooling if there is no consciousness to be fooled?</p>
<p>Also, many of Dennett’s theories specifically state that consciousness is an emergent property of all systems. I believe there is a part where he argues that any system that routinely divides things into two camps is making a “decision.” In this way he has some alignment with consciousness being in the “fabric of the universe.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dennett denies that consciousness has any properties that would make the problem &quot;hard&quot; in the philosophical sense that Chalmers and other philosophers defend. That means there are no qualia. If there are no qualia, consciousness becomes another word for a certain functional processes in the brain that handler perception, memory, imagination, dreams, emotions. And that is no different from the philosophical zombie, who has the same processes performing the same functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that most of what Dennett is doing is to make it less of a “paradox” that we have consciousness. And part of that is helping us to understand that the seemingly unbelievable capacities of the human mind should literally not be believed (i.e. we overstate many of our own abilities).</p>
<p>I guess where I always get tripped up by the “zombie” claims is that people tend to say “another word for” or “just.” To say that the brain “just” handles perception, memory, imagination, dreams, and emotions seems pretty harsh right? If you can do all that and still be a zombie, then I agree we are zombies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His book does a pretty good job of trying to explain the building blocks of consciousness. It's like he's the only guy who takes consciousness seriously, contrary to the popular belief that he's like &quot;consciousness not real!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Active member of the consciousness science community here. &quot;Kochs&quot; IIT is far from the most scientific theory. In fact most serious consciousness researchers consider it UNscientific due to being unfalsifiable and making ludicrous predictions most scientists instantly reject (eg that a series of inactive logic gates is substantially more conscious than a human being). </p>
<p>The actual empirical and scientific theories of consciousness are global workspace theory (gwt), higher order theory (hot), and local recurrence theory (lrt).</p>
<p>Same with penrose and qt. No scientist takes that theory seriously. </p>
<p>Check out the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness. IIT and QT are not received well or considered serious by that community which represents the most serious consciousness researchers at the moment</p></div>		</li>
