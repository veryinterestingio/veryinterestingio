<p>There’s been a lot of research in the last few years that says a minimum of 20 minutes under cool running water will promote the best recovery and give the best chance of avoiding scarring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to clarify what is meant by &quot;cool&quot;. From what I've seen (<a href="https://www.jprasurg.com/article/S1748-6815(12%2900550-5/abstract?mod=article_inline)" target="_blank">here</a> water at 37 °C is better than water at 17 °C, and from what I can gather, tap water at the coldest setting is around 10 °C. This would suggest that you don't want to use the coldest water you can get out of your tap - you actually want something that feels a little warm to the non-burned skin (average human skin temperature is around 34 °C).</p>
<p>But I'm not in this field, so if you know of more recent research that supports colder water, please let me know!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would imply water that would feel warm. Do you have a source? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have experienced this - working outside in below 0° F even with multiple gloves my hands must have gotten close to frostbite. Ran a sonk of room temperature water and soaked the hands &amp; it felt like they were burning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. I cycled through cold weather last year, my fingers were hurting from the cold, then I showered and I was under the impression I had the temperature too high as it started burning instead. (Made a full recovery 30 minutes later).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a near Mr Wizard video somewhere from when I was a kid, where he has someone soak one hand in ice water and one in hot water for a few minutes, then put both hands in room temperature water.  The hand that was in the cold feels like it’s burning and the hand that was in the hot feels like it’s freezing, it’s pretty crazy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why when I come from outside and it's been really cold, like so much that my hands are a bit painful from the cold, I run the cool water and then slowly get the water warmer to a point where it no longer hurts, hands and fingers will still be cold but nothing near as much as before. Warming your hands with just warm/hot water is terrible, pretty much just end up burning your hand, just because you can't feel the heat of the hot water because your hand is frozen doesn't mean it's not burning your skin.</p></div>		</li>
