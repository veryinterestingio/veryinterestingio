			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an excellent question which I do not know the answer to.  With braces of certain metals it would also create a battery, my guess is that the effect would be muted compared to fillings since it has farther to travel before reaching a nerve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. Good question. It might not as there is more of a buffer between the tooth and bracket. The bracket is bonded to the tooth enamel with a cement similar to tooth colored filling. While a silver filling will go through the enamel and right into the dentin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, since braces don't make contact with the nerve inside the tooth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, asking the real questions.  I remember it being a thing with gum wrappers, plenty of ways a kid could discover it being a kid and all [trying to unwrap gum with tongue, gum in sun stuck to wrapper kid didn't know there was some wrapper remaining, etc.] but once one kid knows it suddenly becomes a dare to everyone else to do it.</p></div>		</li>
