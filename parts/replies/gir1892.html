			<div class="markdown"><p>Except when the only clue to the cause of a catastrophic crash is a slight unexplained yaw and a blip in a sensor, 7 hours prior to the crash.</p>
<p>Flight recorder data is a massive jigsaw puzzle of raw sensor data that takes crash investigators MONTHS to pore over and built into a coherent reconstruction of events. A flight recorder doesn't know what a major issue is, and sometimes there IS no major issue. Sometimes a system thinks that everything is A-OK, and lets the crew sleep through with zero warnings right up to the point they slam into a mountainside. </p>
<p>A major issue might be that the system doesn't <em>realise</em> that there is a major issue. A faulty altimeter will continue to read 30,000 feet even as the plane steadily descends down into the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You completely side stepped their point to make perfect the enemy of good.</p>
<p>Some data is better than the no data when you haven't found the plane.</p>
<p>Its especially better if it leads you to find all of the data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Half a terabyte is WAY too much. There are about 500\~ parameters that need to be recorded. Considering each of these is a double (8 bytes), that is about 4 kilobytes per 'snapshot'. Even if the FDR records 50 times a second (usually it's 1-10 times per second), that is about 4*50 kilobytes per second, or roughly 200 kilobytes per second. Even most phones these days can easily manage 5 or more megabytes per second, so your claims are wrong. Keep in mind that I have rounded my number up by a big amount, so it will be much lesser in reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously the specifics of sensor readings, quantities, frequency, what gets recorded to the black box is going to change from plane to plane, but - </p>
<p>GE jet engines collect data points at a rate of 5000 per second</p>
<p>An Airbus A380 has around 25,000 sensors on board.</p></div>		</li>
