<p>Chart says ≥70 but from the notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The estimates for persons ≥70 years old presented here do not include persons  ≥80 years old as IFR estimates from Hauser et al., assumed that 100% of infections among persons ≥80 years old were reported</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even then, it's worth considering what triggered the positive diagnosis.</p>
<p>There will be many 74-year-olds who have had Covid but were never tested - whether their symptoms were mild to non-existent, because they refused testing, or because there were no tests available. Where the test is prompted by exposure, rather than concern for the individual's health, the unadjusted odds of survival will be significantly above 92%. Nonetheless, it's likely that the number of undiagnosed cases in 74-year-olds will be smaller, as percentage of the total, than in the population at large, because of the greater likelihood of severe symptoms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as you say, any weight gain, cardiovascular issues, or diabetes, would also depress the survival rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). The total number of infections is found using antibody tests that detect immune markers of previous infection. This finds previously undetected, asymptomatic and mild cases. It possible to find the risk associated with an infection (not a diagnosis). </p>
<p>The IFR in Donald Trump's age group is indeed several %. </p>
<p>In the UK, the IFR among people 65 to 74 is 3.1%. And it is 18% for people over 75.</p>
