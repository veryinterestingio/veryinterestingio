			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I don't know enough about devices. I should have taken more classes.</p>
<p>That's why it's always a good idea to pair a chemist with an electrical engineer and vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, leakage is a problem. We combat it with lower voltages and power domains/power gating. Basically we turn off parts of the chip which are currently not used. The same has been done for the clock for a longer time. It's the reason why modern chips need much less power while idling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be continuous, but effectively for computation you can only extract up to finite precision.</p>
<p>If you could ever extract infinite precision for computation with an analog device it would allow for hypercomputation, which seems impossible in the real world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent point. Continuous indeed does not mean it is controlled with infinite precision because of noise,  and with smaller size comes larger noise. I believe this is why we do digital instead of analog computation.</p></div>		</li>
