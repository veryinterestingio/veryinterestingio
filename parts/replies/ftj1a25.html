<p>That's something I never got. How come, the immune system remembers certain antigens for the rest of your life, while others are &quot;forgotten&quot; after a couple years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right the flu vaccine isn't really a booster.  It's a whole new strain you are getting a shot for.  Flu changes rapidly and actually just keeps circling the globe.  We typically take the version of the flu going around in China and use that, and hope that it doesn't mutate too much before it gets to the US.  That's why sometimes you'll see &quot;oh this year the flu vaccine is only XX percent effective.&quot;  That's because it mutates.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Inactivated vaccines and toxoid vaccines don't create as much of an immune response, but also with toxins you need to be able to ramp up fast.  So it's good to have our immune response on its toes.  If you get stuck with a rusty nail near access to the central nervous system the clostridium tentani can get you within 4 days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always have to add this to discussion about tetanus: it has absolutely nothing to do with rust.</p>
<p>It’s a soil bacterium. Any time you break the skin there is a chance of it, since dirt/soil is pretty much everywhere. It is more common to get it in a puncture wound than a cut, since it doesn’t like oxygen very much.</p>
<p>I’m an archaeologist- very high risk because of a combo of soil and sharp objects. I’m supposed to get a tetanus shot every five years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Injected polio vaccine is inactivated. Oral polio vaccine is live.</p>
<p>The oral vaccine can offer better coverage (vaccinated people shed the weakened virus and sort of vaccinate those they interact with) and is cheaper, so poorer countries tend to use it. If vaccine coverage is really low, though, the weakened virus can hop through enough hosts it has time to mutate back to a damaging level of virulence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you're only able to vaccinate 30% of the population, it won't really do any good overall because the majority of the population is still susceptible. </p>
<p>For herd immunity to kick in, you typically need somewhere in the neighborhood of 80+% to be vaccinated or have already had it and have immunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;live&quot; vaccine given to the first person was already weakened. It doesn't become weaker, but it's usually weak enough that other people's immune systems can fight it off too, gaining immunity in the process. Until it infects someone with a weakened immune system, or mutates in just the right way to become virulent again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you be willing to comment on possible reason why experiencing a disease like MMR or chickenpox in childhood is not necessarily adequate protection throughout life?
I grew up in Eastern Europe where exposing children to so called childhood diseases was thought to be the best preventative in combination with vaccinating against things like diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, but I'm questioning the validity of deliberate infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that it doesn't provide adequate protection, it's just more dangerous to get the disease.  I grew up in the US, and chickenpox vaccine didn't get licensed here until 1995.  So for kids who grew up in the 80s and earlier, chicken pox parties were all over the place.  &quot;You're going to go play at John's house, he has chicken pox.&quot;  The downside is just that the disease itself can be devastating, vs just the immunity from the vaccine.  Chickenpox can cause a lot of skin scars, and if you get chickenpox when you are an adult it can cause other more severe problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was born in 1984, and chicken pox was a weird concept even then. I haven't seen it -- or even thought about it for more than a few seconds -- in decades. But now that I am, holy hell -- what a weird thing to happen. They were just bumps, all over your body.</p>
<p>I know I had them at some point when I was really young, but I don't have any memories of it, which seems weird. I'm fairly certain I gave it to or got it from my two best friends growing up.</p>
<p>Man, what a weird freaking disease. Weird name, weird side effects, and . . . yeah, weird parties to get everyone infected all at once.</p>
<p>And then there's shingles. You thought chicken pox was a weird name. How about hanging some shingles off your breast decades later. I guess it's different from chicken pox, but if you have it, you can still spread chicken pox. I don't understand how that works. It sounds like I have some apples but give you some of my applejacks. I didn't even know I had any applejacks, but there ya go. Chicken pox for your tits. Shingles.</p>
<p>Ok, it's really early, and I shouldn't be awake. But these thoughts made me rant in curiosity. Have a great day!</p></div>		</li>
