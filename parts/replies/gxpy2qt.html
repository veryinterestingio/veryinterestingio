			<div class="markdown"><p>I just feel bad getting credit when it was u/Stargate525 and the people who responded to him that put it so succinctly. I'm always way more wordy than I should be when trying to ELI5. Even to actual 5-year-olds. :)<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can use this same analogy to explain ketosis/keto diets. To get coal from the tender the fireman has to use a different shovel(ketosis). By eating a diet higher in fat you force him to switch to the same shovel he uses for the tender, making it easier for him to go to the tender the next time he needs to feed the engine.</p></div>		</li>
