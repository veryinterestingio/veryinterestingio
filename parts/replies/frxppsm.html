<p>this is actually true if you get the bits of bread to be smaller than the caloric requirement of picking them up, putting in your mouth, chewing, and digesting it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WTF??</p>
<p>I knew they messed with serving sizes so they could round down, but that says “for fat free cooking” on the front..... And the first ingredient is canola oil of course, after which is a note that says “*adds a trivial amount of fat”.....</p>
<p>Fuck that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's American nutritional information for you. If there is fewer than 5 calories per serving, you can round it down to zero.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the EU, the numbers are listed per 100 grams or per 100ml, and they can't get away with that kind of fuckery.</p>
<p>In the EU, you would find something like 855 calories and 95 grams of fat per 100 gram on the label.</p>
<p>Additionally, the EU only allows for rounding to zero if it is less than 0,1 gram or less than 1 cal.</p>
<p>An example of this can be seen here: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NiBfzNy.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/NiBfzNy.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Siracha does this as well, depending on the bottle size they divide it to where 1 serving is a little less then 1 gram of sugar. So let’s say a bottle has 96 servings and in each serving is 0.95g of sugar they can round down and slap 0g of Sugar per serving on the label. When really that tiny bottle has as much sugar as 3 cans of pop. It’s messed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How big should a serving of cooking spray be? </p>
<p>I mean... I probably spray for 3 seconds to coat a pan for a loaf of sandwich bread. So that is 2.394 grams. Let’s say every molecule of that ends up on one of the 16 slices and let’s pretend the ends have as much as the other pieces. That is .149g per slice. A real human serving of sandwich bread is 2 slices, so let’s call it .3g. That is pretty close to their serving size on the can. So for truth in advertising it should tell me that I am consuming 2.7 calories and .3g fat. If I’m meticulously adding up my calories my Swiss and mustard sandwich with some lettuce is ~530 calories. The Pam has accounted for about .5% of the calories in my sandwich. </p>
<p>But I’m a really fastidious member of r/1200isenough (despite what my sandwich tells you). Shouldn’t it matter then? Well, it’s only about .2% of my calories for the day. Which is slightly more than the 10g of lettuce on my sandwich has on average. But since each individual leaf Varies significantly in calories at this scale, the percent of nutrient and nutritionally dense parts of my lettuce must be shredded so I spread them on my sandwich In equal proportion to the more vascular, water-heavy parts of the plant in order to maintain consistency in measuring anywhere close to what I can get with my cooking spray just by reading the label. </p>
<p>And since the FDA is in on this scheme to obfuscate calories, they don’t even send me a picture of their reference lettuce so I can understand what 5 calories of it looks like.</p>
<p>The only solace I take in these wild obfuscations is the, as long as I chew thoroughly, I will <a href="https://time.com/4736062/slow-eater-chew-your-food/" target="_blank">burn ~17 calories just eating my sandwich</a>.</p>
<p>tl:dr 700 servings isn’t outrageous for a can of cooking spray. If you ever find yourself in a situation where cooking spray is a nutritionally relevant aspect of your diet, PM me and I’ll Venmo you a sack of carrots.</p></div>		</li>
