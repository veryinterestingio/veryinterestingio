			<div class="markdown"><p>Might we add here that that ‚Äúthe proper posture‚Äù is not proper at all, there is a reason sitting straight is tiring, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not natural to our spines curvature which is essentially a rope anchored to two points. Our spines are meant for us to walk on all fours not sit our asses on a damn chair all day.  </p>
<p>Additionally sitting on a chair is horrible for oh so many reasons: </p>
<p>1) it forces your intestines forward, usually the transversus muscle keeps them in place but eventually it will get tired, relax and then get stretched and loose tone causing lumbar instability.<br />
2) sitting on our ass causes the gluteals and hamstrings to atrophy and forget how to properly activate. The purpose of those muscles is to pull your leg back and rotate the pelvis when walking if you don‚Äôt use them properly the muscles that take over that are the lower parts of the erector spinae which are NOT meant to work like that. That causes additional lumbar strain and eventually pain.<br />
3) again out of necessity the subscupulars and trapezoids will give out and let your shoulders roll in and your chest to contract, in order for you to keep watching the monitor the neck muscles
Will pull the head backwards. That will cause them to constantly overwork and shorten which in turn causes neck pain.  </p>
<p>It goes on and on, femurs turn in causing the patella to rub on the femur, shins will roll outwards changing the weight distribution when walking.  </p>
<p>It‚Äôs just a horrible mess, have you ever noticed the posture and movements of people that are forced to work on a chair all day long? Pay notice now. You‚Äôll never sit on a chair ever again haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when working from home is it helpful to change positions frequently? For example I‚Äôll move from sitting at my desk after a couple hours to laying on the couch to sitting on a yoga ball to whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your whole first paragraph is nonsense. Our spines are specifically evolved with the curvature they have because we walk upright. </p>
<p>Humans have a bone structure and accompanying musculature that is specifically organized for upright ambulation on our two lower limbs. The curvature of the human spine is a key difference between us and distant evolutionary cousins who continue to move on all fours. It allows for the movement of our necks and controlling our visual field. The lower curve allows for our pelvis and hips to sit properly while upright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, even concrete, metals, and other materials used in construction wear out, too. Which is why we see so much maintenance and repairs on bridges, roadways, highways etc. All those cracks, potholes, broken asphalt, etc need to be fixed or replaced.</p>
<p>But our problem is that our bones and cartilages can‚Äôt be repaired or replaced as easily as concrete or metal can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a side note, that‚Äôs more a problem with sitting on chairs than it is standing up. When you are standing, your body has to use all your core muscles to stay upright and balanced. If you want to use your core muscles this way while sitting, use a stool or sit at the edge of your chair. It puts your legs closer to your center and forces your body to establish that balance or you‚Äôll fall over.</p></div>		</li>
