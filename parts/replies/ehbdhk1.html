			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if I assume that. It's a hypothetical truck driver who has an identical clone who drives an identical truck. And that immediately points out what I dislike about this question: We're essentially playing &quot;20 questions&quot; with the riddle about what the conditions of the hypothetical situation are.</p>
<p>Because under the very basic conditions that OP posted their teacher is simply wrong. If they are ideal circumstance simple models of equal weight trucks then they will both cross the finish line at exactly the same time. The only way the teachers own answer is correct is if some important detail is being omitted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Loadmaster failed to properly secure three armoured vehicles and two mine-sweeping vehicles which totaled 80 tons of weight. The load shifted to the rear of the plane, damaging the hydraulics, making the airplane uncontrollable. 7 people died in the ensuing crash.</p></div>		</li>

<p>well the question was framed as the nails are just in there. no packing was mentioned. It would be ok to assume just dumped on the bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your load shifts, you’ll accelerate faster in the beginning, but more slowly a bit later. For a traditional geared ICE, you may or may not have enough power to end up overcoming that later slowdown (which requires more energy, since you’re exerting that force at a higher velocity).</p>
<p>Whether the nails shift more, because they slide all over, or the cotton shifts more because it’s compressible is all up to variables we don’t know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you mean &quot;slower later&quot; though, you're talking about the milliseconds before the load hits the rear bed. Right?</p>
<p>At that point the acceleration would be slowed due to opposite forces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might actually be a couple seconds, but keep in mind the truck doesn’t accelerate at the same rate. Once it’s going faster, the acceleration is probably lower (though reality makes this more complicated because of gearing and optimal engine rpm).</p>
<p>If we experienced a constant force that accelerated the truck, the initial velocity of the truck with a sliding cargo would be higher, but after the cargo slid to the back, both trucks would have the same velocity. Trucks don’t have a constant force, though.</p>
<p>Edit: For clarity, the slower later is when that sliding cargo hits the wall at the back of the truck. At that point, your truck slows down and your cargo speeds up so they’re going the same speed. During the millisecond or so that the cargo is impacting the back of the truck, your acceleration is likely negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking along the same lines.  I sold racing parts for about 2 years and one big item we sold a lot was fuel tank foam.  The foam acted as baffles so that in the turns the fuel wouldn't shift suddenly and throw the balance of the cars off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do motorcycles use something like this to avoid fuel cutting out during turns or something? I notice that if I fill my tank all the way and then wait a few seconds, the level slowly goes down. I can fill it back to the brim again several times before it stops &quot;sinking in&quot; like that.</p></div>		</li>
