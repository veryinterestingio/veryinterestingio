			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn’t it normally shut down almost entirely though?  I feel like it stays only active enough to perform basic life functions (which it won’t need for much longer) when your heart stops.  But I am no doctor, and have done little medical research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great point. When I got surgery, I went under like most people do. When it's your first time, a lot of people often think they're going the be the exception, that the anesthetic won't work or that they will feel pain and be able to say nothing. Nope, I remember ziltch after that mask went on and I think I got to count maybe 10 before I went out.</p>
<p>So being told the person went unconscious is something I may ask about if anyone I ever know was in some terrible accident. Considering bullet time is somewhat a thing, who knows how massive amounts of pain are registered in a persons head before death. Hopefully most people they just pass out really fast and feel both mentally and in reality seconds of pain max.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, yes bullet time is kind of a thing brought on by adrenaline, but it also takes a bit to really feel pain. I've done some stupid shit and definitely had the bullet time reaction of, say, looking at my hand bleeding badly and cut wide open and thought &quot;fuck&quot; and it feels like a WHILE before the pain really registers. Likewise if you've ever been knocked out by a blow to the head- you just go black usually, and then it isn't until you wake up that your head really fucking hurts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those who dont know:</p>
<p>When you were at high speed and suddenly come to a halt, like in a car crash, your heart can continue forward in your chest a bit which can rip your major blood vessel which is stuck to the front of your spine and thus can't move forward with the heart. You lose pressure and bleed out very very fast. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have done the same. Obviously, the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I was 99% sure she was dead, had to keep going and doing my best till emts arrived. The one good thing about being pretty sure she was already gone is that I wasn't worried that my shitty, exhausted cpr wasnt enough to keep her alive. </p>
<p>I'm surprised I'm not more fucked up from it. If I didn't have a 5 year old to take care of alone now, I'd probably have attempted to delete those memories with huge doses of drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you ever need to talk with someone who's been there, send a pm. </p></div>		</li>
