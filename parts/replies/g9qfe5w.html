			<div class="markdown"><p>OP is possibly referring to a well-established practice wherein the wealthy avoid taxes by “donating” art to museums.</p>
<p>Step 1: Buy some pieces, let’s say for a total of $100M
Step 2: Donate them to museums for temporary exhibitions; grateful curators determine the value of the donation to be 20M a year in perpetuity.
Step 3: Claim 20M tax deduction every year.</p>
<p>The owner wins because s/he avoids taxes. The museum wins because they get to exhibit a piece at no cost to them. The government wins because it can hasten its transition into overt plutocracy.</p></div>		</li>
