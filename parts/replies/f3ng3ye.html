			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't ever worked with it or know much about it. But just quickly glancing at it, it looks really heavy on the oil which is the most expensive product you use. So I would imagine it's used a bit sparingly due to the cost. A big thing that we're trying to do is make warm mixed asphalt instead of hot mix, which was supposed to be the next big thing but just never really took off. But now with climate and emission issues everybody is doing what they can to save costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very &quot;dirty&quot;. So it has finer rock particles in it which is good for increasing density when needed. But we like it for the oil. It's how we win jobs by being able to use more rap because our costs go down for using oil.</p></div>		</li>
