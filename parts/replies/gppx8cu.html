			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called &quot;Apical Dominance&quot;</p>
<p>The top of the tree produces hormones that inhibit growth of the branches and buds below it.  So you usually get one &quot;leader&quot; branch at the top, which grows vertically. </p>
<p>If the top of the tree breaks off or is cut off, then that inhibition is gone, and all those other branches and buds start growing like crazy. You can end up with a bunch of leaders. If you have several competing leaders, sometimes neither one is able to inhibit the others. </p>
<p>Usually you're supposed to prune one of those competing leaders off. Because if two leaders keep growing they will end up with a wedge of bark trapped between the two trunks, which will cause the tree to split in half</p></div>		</li>

<p>While it is the main factor that prevents lateral stems from out growing the terminal stem, it's not the only thing that affects tree growth. The main factor for tree patterns is genetics though. My reply is more meant to give a general explanation of why a co-dominance split would occur. I'm not really going into the mechanisms of tree growth because it's not necessary for answering the post. (Hope that didn't sound rude lol)</p>
<p>Also co-dominance can occur without damage having been done to the terminal stem. Not sure if that's where you were trying to go.</p>
<p>Co-dominance makes the tree weaker and more prone to splitting, but it's usually going to build itself up as best as it can to prevent that.</p></div>		</li>
