<p>It is also hypergolic (nb: ignites on contact) with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water—with which it reacts explosively. </p>

<p>Also rockets use propellants that will burn on their own such as Hydrazine, check out the comment by u/Jeffy_Weffy.</p>

<p>Technically it doesn't burn, it decomposes, and the decomposition is exothermic. Burning is defined as an exothermic <em>oxidation</em> reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>I believe that quote is borrowed from this excellent blog &quot;<a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/02/26/sand_wont_save_you_this_time" target="_blank">Things I Won't Work With</a>&quot;</del> which catalogues a number of, ahem... interesting compounds.  The author describes some of them as &quot;things that spontaneously go off when someone down the hall curses at the coffee machine&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/category/things-i-wont-work-with" target="_blank">Heres a list</a> of a bunch of them.
Excellent reading, even for non-chemists</p>
<p>EDIT: I am wrong, as multiple people have pointed out, the quote is from &quot;Ignition! An Informal History of Liquid Rocket Propellants&quot; by John D. Clark.  </p>
<p>I still recommend the linked blog for the humor value :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Not only will it burn ash, glass, sand or asbestos, it's hypergolic with all of them: just putting them in contact with ClF₃ will set them on fire <em>instantly</em> (&quot;no ignition delay has ever been measured&quot;). The bloody thing will corrode metals usually considered non-corrodible like gold or platinum. It <em>will</em> set flesh on fire.</p>
<p>You can't actually stop a ClF₃ fire, only contain it and wait it out (cooling and / or flooding the area with nitrogen or a noble gas to avoid the spread). Normal fire containment methods are at best useless and at worst dangerous.</p></div>		</li>
