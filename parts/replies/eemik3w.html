			<div class="markdown"><p>It's getting that way.  Millions of years ago one rotation of the Earth around its axis took about ten hours.  Now it's 24 and some change.</p>
<p>The Earth's rotation is slowing down because of tidal attraction to the sun.</p>
<p>Odds are, though, that the sun will enter its red giant phase before that tidal locking is complete.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason is that we're too far away, so the gravitational gradient (the difference in forces between the near side and the far side of Earth from the sun) is too small. It's still there, as others have pointed out, but it's small. </p>
<p>Since force of gravity goes down with the inverse square of distance, tidal forces are greater for closer bodies. </p>
<p>There's more info <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force" target="_blank">here</a>. </p></div>		</li>
