			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why Ebola isn't and can't really become a huge problem in an educated populous with access to health care.</p>
<p>By the time people with Ebola are infectious, they are vomiting, having diarrhoea, and bleeding. Not likely to be around people. You also have to come in contact with those body fluids in order to get infected yourself. </p>
<p>The only reason it became an outbreak where it did, was that first the locals opted to wash their dead, coming into contact with the virus themselves. And second when some groups refused to listen too, or even report cases to the medical personnel. Leading to more outbreaks that could easily be contained. </p>
<p>This all makes Ebola only a real threat in areas with poor health care, uneducated/refuse to believe science population, and lack of worker rights that allow you to take sick days. So the developing world, and maybe that one developed nation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could someone explain the &quot;not sick&quot; and &quot;asymptomatic&quot; parts to me?<br />
I'm hearing some conflicting information.<br />
Some being that a lot of people can have the virus but never get sick. Does that mean you're immune to the virus? Or you do get sick but you don't show symptoms? If you get sick but not show symptoms, can you still die from it?<br />
Then I hear people do get sick, but they're contagious while the virus is incubating, and then they start getting sick with the symptoms. Some people said that people confused &quot;not getting sick&quot; with the incubation period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People can get the virus, show no symptoms, and still spread it as asymptomatic carriers. They are sick. They just don't show symptoms. This also applies to people who will get sick later and are just in the incubation period. Unlike a lot of diseases, you can COVID-19 for a significant portion of the incubation period / as an asymptomatic carrier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean everyone who &quot;gets sick&quot; will eventually show symptoms?<br />
or if there are people who get it and &quot;recover&quot;, will they be in any danger of dying or having adverse health effects?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the virus does get into their bodies, it replicates, it’s in and on them at a high enough concentration to spread to others. But their immune system takes care of it before any symptoms show up. Symptoms being a combination of damage caused by the virus and the bodies attempt to fight it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, you get 'infected', meaning you carry the virus.</p>
<p>Awhile after infection, you will be contagious because you carry a lot of virus.</p>
<p>For some people, it stops they're until they are recovered and they body fights the virus. They never have symptoms. They still carry the virus and are infectious. Because they feel fine, they might come into contact with others.</p>
<p>Then, you may get symptoms. Those include coughing, which tends to increase the likelihood of spreading it to someone else through saliva droplets.</p>
<p>Some people only have very mild symptoms (like a cold), some like a flu. </p>
<p>For some, the virus starts aggressively attacking the lungs, which is why the need for all the ventilators. One of the reasons is called a 'cytokine storm' where your body becomes so aggressive in fighting that it damages organs that you need (like your lungs). </p>
<p>You're misunderstanding is from the use of the word 'sick' to mean both infection and symptoms, which can be separate. If you're infected but have no symptoms, you're 'asymptomatic'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So questions: 1. How long has this virus been around unidentified? Per say? 2. Pre-mature follow up, If you got it when it first came out/around, and it was “months/weeks” before this outbreak where it was identified, can you get sick from it again?</p></div>		</li>
