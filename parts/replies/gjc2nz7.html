			<div class="markdown"><p>Your facts are correct but your logic is slightly flawed. Yes cold air can hold less water but this doesn't cause our bodies to give off more water. The reason cold air is often very dry is because the water in the air is also as cold and thus is very likely to condensate somewhere and immediately freeze preventing if from being taken up by the air again. The rest is probably right although I don't know anything about buildings so I can't comment on that.</p></div>		</li>
