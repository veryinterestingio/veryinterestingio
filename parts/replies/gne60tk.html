			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a little misleading putting it like this. The heart develops from two symmetrical &quot;primary heart fields&quot; derived from the lateral plate mesoderm which fuse in the first three weeks of gestation. However, these aren't functional hearts, more like areas of specialized tissue.</p>
<p>After that, the heart is just a longitudinal tube with the inflow tract at the bottom and the outflow tract at the top. This tube then elongates which causes this tube to loop and fold while at the same time, the primitive epi- and endocardium start to initiate the separation into the different chambers of the heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea you're right. They fuse early on and it's not quite accurate to call them hearts</p></div>		</li>
