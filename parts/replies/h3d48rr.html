			<div class="markdown"><p>I admit that piece of my answer is a little &quot;a couple years ago&quot;. Though in Michigan, where I am, relying on air-source heat pumps / minisplits as the sole source of heating is still pretty unusual, and in my experience primarily in vacation homes that folks are keeping at 50F during the winter rather than 70F.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I’m in central MA and it’s become very common to see low temp systems like Mitsu’s MXZ line retrofitted on, well, pretty much every period of home one can find in MA. </p>
<p>I installed two MXZ heat pumps on my house last year and they kept the house warm on those rare single digit winter nights ... though I must admit I fit into OP’s stereotype as I’m currently staring a Passive House design book sitting on my desk.</p>
<p>Edit: they’re popular in my local market in part because, unlike eastern MA, central MA has a number of municipal-run CO-OP power companies which keeps the cost of operation very competitive with oil ... the dominant fuel in the local market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In sweden it is very normal to have heatpumps, both for heating and cooling, either air/air, air/water, mountain drilled pumps(geothermal for cooling efficiency and heating efficiency during winter etc.</p>
<p>I have &quot;geothermal heatpump&quot; about 150m drilled down to cold mountain, both for heat and cooling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The kind of person whose house has a heat pump for heating is usually the kind of person who already has maxed out the efficiency of their home with insulation, all-LED lighting, etc; might have rooftop solar and/or a plug-in electric car; and raves about their induction range.</p>

<p>I have a heat pump without rooftop solar or a car.</p></div>		</li>
