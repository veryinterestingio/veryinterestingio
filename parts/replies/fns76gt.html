my mom said it was more like amusement park: the idea is fun but you have to wait for hours just to wait your turn then it's over before you can enjoy it enough</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>Negative outcomes can get super long too if you're actually terrified.  Your brain takes more &quot;snapshots&quot; of highly emotional experiences, so people will recall that &quot;It felt like time slowed way down&quot; when they are about to have a car accident, a mean dog comes around the corner or things like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly my thought as well. This is probably also the main explanation as to why time flies past once you get older, instead of the &quot;a certain amount of time will represent a smaller and smaller part of your total life as your age increases&quot;, which I often see quoted here on Reddit.</p></div>		</li>
