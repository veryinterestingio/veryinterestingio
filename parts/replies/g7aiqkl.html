			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome! I'd read that story about the Judean Date Palm several years ago but had completely forgotten about it. Thanks for posting it!</p>
<p>Since the article was from several years ago I went looking for any updates on how the project to grow more was going, and found an article from February 2020!
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/02/how-to-grow-a-date-tree-from-2000-year-old-seeds/606079/" target="_blank">https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/02/how-to-grow-a-date-tree-from-2000-year-old-seeds/606079/</a></p>
<p>Looks like there are now a total of 7 trees sprouted from ancient seeds! The 2 female trees have not yet reached maturity though, so the hybrid mentioned in the original article (male ancient palm + female modern palm) is the only offspring so far.</p>
<p>More interesting is the genetic variation in the ancient seeds, even though 6 out of the 7 seeds (Methuselah + 5 of the new trees) all came from Masada:<br />
<em>To understand how Adam, Jonah, Uriel, Boaz, Judith, and Hannah are related to more modern date palms, the team also analyzed genetic markers from the seedlings. The seedlings were genetically quite different from one another. Methuselah and Adam were most closely related to eastern varieties now found in the Arabian Gulf; Hannah and Judith to modern Iraqi varieties; and Uriel, Boaz, and Jonah to modern Moroccan varieties. The ancient seeds were also bigger and heavier than modern varieties.</em></p></div>		</li>
