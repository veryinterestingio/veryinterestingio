			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to these reasons, they shift in small, incremental movements for the same reason you stop moving to scan your field of vision in Call of Duty; it is much easier to spot an enemy/predator in a still field of vision and simply have to pick out movement than it is to be moving yourself and have to pick out movement, shape, speed, colour, etc. Small animals are, in effect, &quot;hurrying&quot; from one still frame of vision to another, thereby decreasing the amount of time they are in the danger zone of moving themselves and their field of vision is moving with them.
With similar intentions, but with a different method; if you've seen long-legged waterfowl move in the shallows, you'll have noticed the odd way they walk, first moving their legs out in front of them, then their body following in a snakelike fashion, all the while their head is held still in space. Then their head quickly catches up above their body, and the process is repeated. Again, aiming simply to extend the period of time where their vision is stationary and shorten the period of time where it is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly the way I remember it when reading it a long while ago. Evolutionarily driven mechanics and behaviors. It's easy to be not seen while still, it's easier to see things while still, and you can still move pretty efficiently if the anatomy is set up right. It's just worked well for both predator and prey. I said predator and prey as if they're somehow dichotomous, when in fact if you consider herbivores predators of vegetation and fungus predators of digestible stuff... The overwhelming majority are both predator and prey at the same time. That's basically the point of that ability. It's not something fancy about endurance or whatever the top post has, it's about evolutionarily efficient locomotion and perception. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, recently it was shown that small animals perceive time slower. And large animals faster, like whales. So to a fly we are slow as hell and to a whale we move around super fast.</p>
<p>I'm sure some eagle eyed researcher will find the study.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about this before. I kept thinking how in some cartoons and movies as a kid giants moved slower and how it was basically accurate, same thing in video games too. </p>
<p>It really is a fascinating from a science viewpoint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how you would quantify, but I do know that it takes a certain amount of time for a signal from the tip of you fingers to reach your brain and that signal has to be synchronized with closer signals. Not sure how much of a difference that makes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the perception of motion is based on the size of what's moving and how long it takes for it to move in relation to its size. A giant swinging his arm appears to move slowly because it's so big that for its arm to move an arm-width takes longer than if it were smaller, and thus appears slower. It's hard to describe, but I think the concept is called parallax. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But larger mass has more muscle too. Are small animals generally able to accelerate faster than larger ones? I doubt it. </p>
<p>However, the speeds for small animals are much lower. The house mouse apparently has a top speed of 13km/h (actually surprisingly fast). Accelerating/stopping to/from that speed takes a quarter of the energy required for 26km/h (which is a good running speed for humans).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but when you go pound for pound smaller animals are exceedingly stronger than larger ones. And without real data to back it up, it has to do with muscle length. An easy example would be how a smaller human can more easily do pullups. Less weight and distance. Also something something something a 6 foot ant would be terrifyingly strong.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Mass goes up as volume does (size cubed).</p>
<p>Strength goes up as the cross sectional area of the muscle does (size squared).</p>
<p>This means small animals are proportionally stronger than large animals.</p>
<p>Mice can jump vertically about five times their body length. </p>
<p>Elephants can't jump at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could that be a contributing factor? If lower mass = faster relative movement does this need better reactions? How quickly do snails and tortoises perceive time? What about sloths? Sloths vs cheetahs?</p></div>		</li>
