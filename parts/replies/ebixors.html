			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  But by the time we have the technology to create a manufacturing industry on Mars, we'll already have the tech to mine asteroids.  I'm fairly certain asteroid mining will exist and scale long before there's any significant human activity on Mars.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As we mine more asteroids, they become lighter and start collapsing orbits and could strike earth and destroy lots of things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, still as I say the close to home doesn't matter much, unless you find some fundamental resource that has become very scarce on earth.
Off earth extraction and industry will at first and for a long time be for use out of earth.
The advantage of the moon vs Mars is its smaller gravity well , partially offset by not being able to aerobrake on return trips as possible in Mars.
What we will have to see is how industries in the moon and Mars develop.
I have the feeling that the moon being so close to earth might not develop so naturally an independent industry as initially it will be easier to get supplies in 3 days from earth rather than creating the industrial complex in the moon. For some long time the moon might be more like Antarctica with bases but little industry. </p>
<p>Mars on the other hand will from the start have to rely more on insitu resources just for its own survival and Martian economy.  It is possibly mars might develop industry more than the moon because of the need of industry for its own economy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually yes at least for the specific resources available in the asteroid. </p>
<p>The advantage of Mars I see is that it will be bootstrapped by its own needs . You will need a Martian industry to maintain a Martian colony . Mars will develop its industry even if it is not yet economical to build a plant just for use for exporting to earth and other places in the solar system.
Once the new plant is in place it will however have an competitive advantage vs earth based industries whenever the market appears in other solar system bodies. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The best railgun we currently have can do 2.4km/s.</p>
<p>So that's not <em>yet</em> a realistic option for launching things off of Mars.</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> a plausible way to launch things off the moon though -- the escape velocity of the moon is 2.38km/s: handily just within our best railgun's capabilities. And there's no atmosphere to slow it down, so it should (in theory) work just fine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're saying that like it's some hurdle we aren't yet capable of breaching. Really, the reason we don't have mass drivers like that in the modern day is because we don't really have much use for them (and tbh railguns are a bad idea for mass drivers anyway, coilguns are where it's at for a ton of reasons).</p>
<p>I agree that it's smarter to manufacture stuff for space, in space though, but you <em>do</em> need to move things down to the surface and back (passengers, luxuries, et cetera), and quite a lot of it too if Mars ever becomes largely inhabited.</p></div>		</li>
