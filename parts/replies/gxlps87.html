I always wondered why he was on the field to begin with. Now it sounds like he may have been “judging” the distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Umpire here, it’s usually for a few reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Installing tech is tricky and prone to failures. Tech often requires batteries which burn out quickly in the cold. Athletes moving about can also damage tech depending on sports. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s hard to write rules for it. For most sports you want the grass root game to be identical to the profesional game. A lot of athletes/officials move up and down leagues so having one “pro” rules with the tech and one “amateur” rules for the techless is tricky. </p>
</li>
<li>Umpires overrule tech anyway. I’ve known of a few times players have had scores deleted because of tech and they’ve managed to plead their case successfully to the umpire. If an umpire can overrule it izpz why bother with it?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some events have it, including javelin for watching the foul line. But the landing zone for the javelin is so big that it is impractical to have 100 hi-def cameras watching every potential landing spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, we also have very sophisticated tracking software, and javelins are extremely predictable, have decent air time, and stand out against the pitch.</p>
<p>Seems like a 3 camera system, one which measures release and sends expected landing coordinates, one arial, and one on a horizontal track moving along the boundary line could zero in on the location and work fine. 100 hi-def cameras is hyperbolic.</p>
<p>I'd assume the reasons why it wouldn't be used is that these kinds of accidents are freak occurrences, the predictability of javelins makes it easy for refs to be safe if they pay attention, <strong>Most of these track events are extremely low budget and held at thousands of stadiums at the collegiate and professional levels</strong>, and the whole point of the event is some weird purity shit.</p>
<p>It isn't that its unsolvable, but that it is still slightly cheaper to use humans and there is very little money to be made developing that software package.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, a track meet is complicated enough to set up and administrate as it is. Can you imagine having to set, calibrate, validate, and run up all of those cameras every meet? It'd be a nightmare. The automatic timing system takes its own dedicated professional, often two, to run, and that's just a trip beam and a cap gun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An athletics coach told me javelin is considered one of the most difficult disciplines, more difficult than disc or hammer when it comes to throws.<br />
It really surprised me since imo it's the most natural throwing motion. She also told me I should train and become a professional after I tried, but it's definely too late for that...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of training and muscle memory. Javelin throw is highly technical compared to other throw disciplines where the weight is much higher. Still a lot easier than vault jump if you ask me though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Work on standing throw,
Then there strides
Then 5.</p>
<p>If you can get 5 down, the rest of the run up is just continuing the momentum into what you have drilled before. </p>
<p>As for hip rotation, countless hours of medicine ball work and calisthenics.</p>
<p>Honestly though, if you don't do all the ancillary muscle work , javelin will destroy your body.
I'm dealing with some serious shoulder, knee and ankle pain from years of sudden impact</p></div>		</li>
