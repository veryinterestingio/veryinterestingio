<p>In fact, if the micro black hole would be charged, it's likely that its electromagnetic interaction would be stronger than its gravitational pull, because electromagnetism is in general a stronger force than gravity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not true. A charged black hole always must have a charge smaller than its mass (in suitable units) such that its gravitational field is always stronger than its electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>See e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reissner–Nordström_metric" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reissner–Nordström\_metric" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reissner–Nordström\_metric</a></a>.</p>
<p>Edit: Of course the overall interaction felt by a particle in the gravitational and electromagnetic field of a black hole also depends on the mass and the charge of this particle. So if this particle has a charge much higher as its mass (as for example true for an electron), its electromagnetic interaction with the black hole might be still stronger than the gravitational pull felt by the particle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I wasn't aware of that metric. However, the micro black hole I was discussing (created in a particle accelerator) would be of such a size that quantum mechanical effects would play a big factor. And lacking a theory that unifies general relativity with quantum field theory, I don't think I'll try and speculate what the final effect would be. I'll add a link to your comment to my original reply to refer new readers to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, these results were derived assuming classical general relativity.</p>
<p>There is indeed ongoing research suggesting that if one takes quantum corrections into account this so called &quot;extremality bound&quot; will get modified in such a way that black holes with a charge slightly bigger than their mass could exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would a micro black hole created on earth's surface fall into the Earth? As a layman, I have an image in my head about the black hole orbiting the earth's center like a pendulum as it eats through rock and gains mass faster than it sheds it through Hawking Radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a particle collider, there's so much energy in those collisions that the resulting particles tend to be moving at really high rates of speed, so if a micro black hole was somehow created in the LHC, odds are good that it would fly off in a random direction at a ridiculously high speed and zoom off into space (Assuming they didn't immediately decay via hawking radiation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would still be very difficult for it to feed because its radius would be so tiny it would have a very low probability to hit a particle of matter and swallow it while flying through the vast vacuum that fills the inter-atomic and intra-atomic space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, if I solved the equations right, Q/M * sqrt(k/G) has to be less than one. Where Q is charge, M is mass, k is coulomb constant and G is the gravitational constant. So to get an electron's worth of charge inside the black hole you'd need about 10kg of mass (if I did the math right)</p>
<p>Interestingly such a black hole would exert almost the same amount of force on 1kg of mass as it would on 1 Coulomb of charge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The range at which a micro black hole would be able to interact with other particles through its gravity in a meaningful way would be extremely small. </p>

<p>Just for an example, a black hole whose event horizon is the size of a ping pong ball would weigh 2x as much as the Earth. A black hole the size of a carbon atom would weigh as much as a sphere of water 30 km in radius.</p>
<p>So micro black holes, which weigh a fraction of a kilo, are ridiculously small</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we were to make a micro hole, wouldn't it essentially fall through to the center of the earth? Towards the denser core it could slowly accrue matter due to I would assume at some point interact with particles on the way and absorb them. Would this eventually not slowly absorb the core of the earth given time? All this assumes its large enough to absorb matter before it fissles out from hawking radiation? I honestly dont know how fast that even occurs, given the time scales required for normal holes in space to someday fissle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it would evaporate way before it had the chance to start tunneling through the Earth. The rate of radiation of a small black hole is much larger relative to its size than a large one, so that a microscopic black hole will be gone almost as soon as it is created. And with the energies involved at CERN the black hole created would be exceedingly tiny.</p>
<p>A larger black hole (like the carbon-atom sized example talked about above, weighing as much as a 30km water sphere) would still evaporate well before reaching the core. It would evaporate so fast that it would probably obliterate CERN and the surrounding countryside, because the mass of a black hole is related to its evaporation time by a factor of 10^-27. A solar mass black hole would take 10^64 years, for comparison.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks to a wonderful comment below I see that a carbon atom sized black hole would definitely survive long enough to reach the core. The surface gravity would be 6/10ths of Earth's, but it would drop off to almost nothing within a very short distance. It might eat a tiny hole through the crystal structure of molecules, but it would only be about as wide as the black hole itself. I don't think you'd want one of these near you, but I seriously doubt it would be a huge problem for Earth before the sun destroys the planet anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A black hole weighing as much as Mount Everest would have an event horizon smaller than a carbon atom, so would oscillate through the Earth, experiencing very little resistance in comparison to its inertia. It would radiate as much energy as a decent sized power station, but would still take millions of years to evaporate (through Hawking radiation). Such a black hole could only have been created in the immediate aftermath of the big bang and it's thought to be unlikely that there are any. If we wait trillions of years, there'll be plenty around though (the universe has to cool quite a bit before stellar-sized black holes can start losing mass).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for answering the question I was going to ask! </p>
<p>One question though, what would a black hole of that size be able to consume? Like if that black hole appeared in the atmosphere suddenly, would it destroy the entire earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of what size? </p>
<p>Pebble size? Well you'd start to fall towards it before you could ever see it. The black hole and the Earth would fall into each other. They'd oscillate back and forth around their centre of mass and the black hole repeatedly flies through the Earth and back, leaving it with little pock marks everywhere. Eventually the black hole would come to rest at the centre of the Earth and things would continue falling into it.</p>
<p>Micro? If Hawking radiation is a correct theory, then the black hole would live less than an attosecond and would convert all it's mass into energy. A black hole in the gram to kilogram range would look like at atomic bomb going off (E=mc^2).</p>
<p>In outer space, any black hole lighter than about half the mass of the Moon (so about 0.1 mm in diameter) is doomed as it's now emitting more hawking radiation than it gets from radiation falling into it from the CMB (a microwave hiss that exists everywhere in space.)</p></div>		</li>
