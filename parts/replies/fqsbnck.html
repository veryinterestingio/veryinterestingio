<p>most people overestimate how big it looks</p>

<p>My favorite way to bring that lesson home: Go outside on a night with a full moon. Cover one eye and hold a quarter in front of the other so it covers the moon.</p>
<p>Now move the quarter in or out until it <em>just barely</em> covers the moon. How far will it be from your eye?</p>
<p>If you find the result surprising, it's very simple trig to work it out: the angular size of the moon is 1/2 degree and the diameter of a quarter is 0.955 inches.</p></div>		</li>
