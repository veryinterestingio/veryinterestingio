			<div class="markdown"><p>I taught basic chemistry to 8th graders for several years.  One of the things they needed to learn were the states of matter.</p>
<p>It's always best to start with something kids are likely familiar with.</p>
<p>So I'd ask them, &quot;When you boil water to make pasta, what do you see?</p>
<p>&quot;Bubbles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, what's in the bubbles?&quot;</p>
<p>I'd get all kinds of answers-- Air, hydrogen, oxygen, vacuum...</p>
<p>Only rarely would someone give the correct answer:  water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When all the water is not quite hot enough to boil, tiny water vapour bubbles start to form and then immediately collapse.  All of these tiny forming and recollapsing bubbles make that &quot;roaring&quot; sound.   When things get hot enough the bubbles fully form and rise to the surface.  This is much quieter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small pockets of water get hot enough to boil, but as the bubbles are created they lose that energy to surrounding water and collapse again.</p>
<p>As you get closer and eventually reach the boiling point, the bubbles become more and more stable.</p>
<p>It's called cavitation. Same thing that the OP is asking about, except in OP's question it's caused by water reaching a boiling point through pressure reduction instead of temperature increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my HS chemistry class my teacher asked the same kind of thing.  Is it water in gaseous form or did the water break down to its components of oxygen and hydrogen?  The class was split 50/50 on the answer.  So he produced a 2 liter bottle that he claimed to have allowed water to evaporate in and a lighter.  What would happen if he held the lighter to the opening?  </p>
<p>Of course half of us said nothing, the other half said “boom!”  The teacher hands the bottle and lighter to my buddy.  Confident that only water vapor was present he held the lighter to the opening and BOOM!!  </p>
<p>The teacher fessed up that he really filled the bottle with hydrogen.  Most fun teacher I’ve ever had.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So kinda like the opposite of a supercritical fluid, instead of high-pressure condensing a gas into a gas-like liquid, it's low-pressure turning liquid into a gas?</p></div>		</li>

If you can stomach the USA Cold War propaganda, it’s a really fun movie with Alec Baldwin in his prime as well as Sean Connery. And they include nerdy details about how submarine propellers sometimes get cavitation bubbles when they spin too fast and then the enemy submarines can detect them.</p></div>		</li>
