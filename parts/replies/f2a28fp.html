			<div class="markdown"><p>Skull size matters, but it's probably because of space constraints, not brainpower.</p>
<p>The domestic housecat has a much smaller head than a lion or tiger, so it must have much smaller eyes.  But it still has a need to see well in low light, so maximizing the amount of light that can enter the eye is important.  The smaller the eye, the less light that enters it, and since there's probably a limit to the density of rods in a retina, at some point the light sensitivity of the eye drops off as you shrink it down.</p>
<p>Slit pupils apparently trade a loss of clarity in some conditions (bright light) for increased light transmission in low light conditions.  And housecats apparently have vertical slit pupils because it preserves clarity along the horizontal centerline of the field of view, which is where their prey is typically going to be moving.  And in really low light conditions, the pupil opens up to a round shape anyway, giving clarity throughout the field of view.  (Anyone with a housecat is probably familiar with the saucer-eyed &quot;hunting mode&quot;)</p></div>		</li>
