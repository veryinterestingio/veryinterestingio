<p>First, a one degree change in body temperature is not a fever. Most people's core body temperature changes by one to two degrees over the course of the day.  </p>

<p>I go to dialysis 3x/week and I wanted to point it to OP that it generally fluctuates between 96 to 99. So a one degree change can be normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my friends was on home dialysis (thankfully has a new kidney now) and loved to do it on warm days where it would cool him down.  <del>Can't remember if he cooled the liquids down, or just didn't warm them up for comfort</del>. If he had the opportunity he would normally warm the liquids for comfort.  Either way it essentially cooled his blood and and gave him an internal cooling suit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, circulation definitely has a lot of relation to temperature. When you're hot, blood vessels dilate to allow heat to leave the body. I think at the center they set the temperature to my body temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fever is also more subjective to each person than current medical standards and practices acknowledges.</p>
<p>100.4 is a decent guideline when dealing with masses of people. The truth is more grey than that.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heck, it's normal for temperature to vary by several degrees (Fahrenheit) in the same day even with no underlying health issues.</p>
<p>I used to chart my waking temperature daily for monitoring fertility. During ovulation, waking temperature rises by a couple of degrees. Over the course of a typical month, my waking temperature usually varied between about 96.9 and 98.2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually don't think it's due to the kidney disease. I think it's just fluctuating like it does in a normal human being. I think the reason they test is two-fold: temperature for the machine, and testing for COVID.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A one degree centigrade change is considered a fever. 98.6F is 37C, and 100.4F is 38C. We don't know the system OP uses. Otherwise, great response!</p></div>		</li>
