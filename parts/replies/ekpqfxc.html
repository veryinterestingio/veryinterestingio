			<div class="markdown"><p>The advantage to fingerprints is improved grip. Evolution doesn't care how it's done. So, gradients of two chemicals interfering in fetal development cause some skin to be raised, and some to not be. The initial conditions of this process are chaotic, and very sensitive, but once set, are set.</p>
<p>A similar process governs stripes in animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually people can have the same fingerprints as each other. It's a myth that no 2 people have the same. You should watch the episode &quot;Adam Ruins Forensics&quot; on his show <em>Adam Ruins Everything</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The individuality might just be an effect from the reason for having fingerprints in the first place, maybe it has something to do with grip? Rougher surface, more friction, less likely to slip your grip and win a darwin award.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your fingerprints themselves are not a genetic trait in that you wouldn't have your fingerprint pattern determined at the time of conception.  They form as you develop into an infant, and then further change (more slowly) as you grow into an adult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I would assume that ridges on our fingers, hands and feet are for helping with grasping and holding or creating more friction on objects. Why then, through evolution, did not the most efficient ridge pattern for grasping get selected and be standardized?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So are you saying that skin ridges on our extremities have no effect on our survival (no matter what the &quot;pattern&quot;) and therefore are just passed on?  Some part of our DNA strands must have information for ridges on our skin, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference was too minor that natural selection didn't fix it. Evolution is not perfect in any way, even in our body you will see unnecessary inefficiency but if it's doesn't have a huge impact on your survival chances then evolution will either ignore it or take a ridiculously long time to make it more efficient. Anyways human's evolution has basically halted thanks to civilisation so who cares at this point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn't select for &quot;the best possible solution.&quot; It selects for &quot;the first solution that works.&quot; Hereditary fingerprints don't provide enough benefit to out-compete random fingerprints, so even if the mutation for it happened somewhere it wouldn't spread to everyone.</p></div>		</li>
