			<div class="markdown"><p>Much the same as water. The whole, &quot;8 glasses of water&quot; rule is completely arbitrary made up bullshit. Drink water when you're thirsty. Otherwise you get plenty of water from regular meals and other beverages that are not water.</p>
<p>And it's always been this way. All these food rules over the last 50-100 years are nonsense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad occasionally fasts, and one night about two weeks into it, he said he got extremely hungry.  He went directly into the pantry, poured a heaping handful of salt, and just started ravenously consuming it.  After eating what he said was at least a tablespoon of salt, he reported feeling very satisfied, and resumed his fasting.</p></div>		</li>
