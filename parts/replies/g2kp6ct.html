			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to know this as well. Because I’ve had what OP is talking about. And when it happens, up to an hour after eating, I can tell that it’s what I ate along with everything upstream. (Trying not to sound gross, but by looking at it—corn in Mexican food, bits of lettuce etc. when I know I haven’t eaten corn in weeks).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right...the top answers are not addressing this question. Can food that disagrees with you travel that quickly in 15 minutes, or is that last night's dinner?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not the same food if you poop shortly after you eat. You just expel your previous meal because your bowel starts moving when your stomach inflates (with new food), you don't shoot what you just eaten, excluding pathologies.</p>
<p>And we basically are always full of poop, in different phases of evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense. But it always amazes me, that with green asparagus for example, you can tell within a half an hour by the smell of your urine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But, then why can I see stuff I just ate a few hours ago?</p>
<p>Say the other day with corn. Like 4 hours after I ate it, I could see it in the bathroom. I’m assuming I have a problem cause it’s clearly not digested as I can see it clearly in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Corn, in particular, is a culprit. I can't answer why it travelled through you so quickly (because I don't know) but the outer shell of corn can't be fully digested which is why if you swallow them relatively whole, you'll see them come out the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4 hours is enough time. A half hour is not.  Also corn just doesn't digest fully when it's the kernels. Thats how it is for everybody</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so if you eat  something that disagrees with you you should expect to take several visits to the loo before you've managed to evacuate it. its strange because it often feels like there's little left after that first trip..</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why it feels there's little left is because by that point you've expelled everything in your rectum, but your intestines is still full of poop.
If you need to go for multiple trips, it's because your bowel is still acting up and moving poop from the intestine to your previously emptied rectum.
It's also why the first trip takes longer than the following trips. Because the poop you're expelling in the first trip are poop that has been sitting in your rectum + poop in the intestine that's being moved into the rectum by your bowel movements.</p></div>		</li>
