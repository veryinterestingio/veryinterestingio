<p>we saw a 70% reduction in traffic visibility for a few months.</p>

<p>How'd you get it back?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Slokunshialgo is wondering how they got the visibility back rather than thinking they actually lost 70% of users.</p>
<p>My interpretation of ejmajor's comment is the traffic visibility went down by 70% and never rose back up, visibility just stopped dropping off by 70% month over month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of relying on analytics script pings, they can just monitor the server log, which tells them every site visit as well.  I don't know why they'd be relying on client-side pings for keeping track of traffic anyways, that isn't as reliable as monitoring the server itself, which has complete knowledge of all traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Client-side tracking gives you <em>much</em> more useful information than &quot;this IP requested this URL with those headers&quot;. For instance, you get site speed, browser size, and lots of info about the path the user follows through your website.</p>
<p>Also per GDPR, IP addresses are also personal data, but that's up for debate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You've been given outdated advice. You would have been correct before the GDPR.</p></div>		</li>
