			<div class="markdown"><p>I am an evolutionary biologist and this is correct. Humans and chimps evolved from a common ancestor. This is subtly but importantly different from saying that we evolved from chimpanzees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you are confusing split from with evolved from. We did not evolve from chimpanzees. Our species evolved divergently since our common ancestor, I.e. split from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying we &quot;split from chimpanzee's&quot; is a very simplistic expression. Humans and chimpanzee's share a common ancestor but that ancestor was neither chimpanzee nor was it human. Here is a very basic evolutionary tree. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m still not sure I understand the distinction you are trying to make. </p>
<p>And just to let you know, the word ‘split’ is used in the scientific literature - for example:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two people follow a path. They then 'split from each other.' I assume you understand they are no longer on the same path but once were. A split from B means AB was a thing up until a point, not that B used to be A and is now B</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We <strong>did</strong> split from chimpanzees, it’s “evolve” from them that we didn’t. We split from their branch 4-13 million years ago - that’s how the term is used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point being made is that it is more accurate to say that humans and chimps evolved from a recent common ancestor, rather than saying humans evolved from chimpanzees. The species that was the most recent common ancestor of humans and chimps would not necessarily be a chimpanzee any more than it would be a human—it was neither.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that’s incorrect. The “split” occurs at a common ancestor. Chimpanzees are not our ancestors. </p>
<p>You did not split from your cousin. You shared a common ancestor and split from that common ancestor. </p>
<p>Another analogy:</p>
<p>Population A walks down a road. At a fork, half go one way, and are eventually different enough to be dubbed population B and half go the other way and are eventually different enough to be dubbed population C. </p>
<p>Population B evolved into modern day chimps.
Population C evolved into modern day humans
Population A was the common ancestor. </p>
<p>Chimp  and human evolutionary histories split from the common ancestor (A)</p>
<p>If we follow the ‘C’ path we see some more splits; Neanderthals down one path, Denisovians another, modern humans yet another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, we split from their evolutionary branch. Where did I say chimps were our common ancestor? What do you think I meant when I said that we did not evolve from chimps?</p></div>		</li>
