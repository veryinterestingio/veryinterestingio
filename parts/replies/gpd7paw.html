			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a big reason why &quot;just letting us get herd immunity&quot; isn't a good idea, even if it isn't a particularly deadly virus.   The more people that get it, the larger the chance it changes into something worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being more deadly isn’t necessarily beneficial for the virus. As long as it can replicate and spread then it will keep surviving. It’s entirely possible that some viruses mutated into weaker variants and still thrived.</p>
<p>If you catch cowpox then you gain a natural immunity to smallpox, which is a far more dangerous virus in humans. I’m not sure on the evolution of these viruses though so it’s a bit of a chicken and egg question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the mutations are random. </p>
<p>There are thousands of genetically different SARS-COV-2 strains. The ones you hear about are the ones significantly different to the ‘original’ one in a way that makes them more of a risk. Either by increasing transmission or increased negative effects (death, worse symptoms, increased risk of longer-term effects.)</p>
<p>The longer the pandemic goes on, the more and wider the variations. </p>
<p>This is why vaccinating quick is important. And why getting the whole world vaccinated is important. Because if we all get vaccinated in the USA and Europe but the African continent doesn’t vaccinate, and then there’s a variant that is not affected by the vaccine we’re back at day one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but there's a few things in there that deserve to be addressed:</p>
<p>1) What does &quot;less deadly&quot; mean? Do we mean less likely to produce immediate life-threatening symptoms? Less likely to have long-term impact on the lifespan of the infected? Less likely to compromise you to other deadly illnesses? Because all of these might be described as &quot;deadly&quot; but are very different aspects of how a mutation might distinguish itself. As a result, avoiding all of them becomes an increasingly more unlikely event.</p>
<p>2) As it becomes more transmissible, you are now even more concerned about comorbidities: What else does it show up with? Even if it is not deadly, it might demonstrate a significant comorbidity with other, far more dangerous illnesses. An example of this is that some forms of vertigo have a surprisingly notable comorbidity with heart diseases. While the relationship may not be causal, until the relationship is understood, these increased transmissibility represents a new potential danger.</p>
<p>3) What does the immunity mean? Chicken pox in childhood usually gives an immunity to future cases of deadly adult chicken pox, but as any older adult who has suffered them can tell you, having your latent infection flare up during times of stress and illness as Shingles is absolutely debilitating!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also see: letting it run rampant in poorer countries and IP and trade secrets preventing the vaccine from spreading around as fast as possible. </p>
<p>It is a global interest to stamp this out fast, otherwise we're just making a petrie dish to mutate a better virus where we don't vaccinate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also a major risk with loosening up restrictions right now with vaccines rolling out.</p>
<p>We ideally should be focusing all our resources on stamping things out the next few months. Not plateauing.</p>
<p>A mutation that can avoid the vaccine would suck. It’s not impossible to get just that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, the key point here is that viruses don't reproduce &amp; mutate on their own (like bacteria do), they can only do that when they're in an infected host.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot there is another variable that leads to more mutations and that is time spent infected. Something like HIV has lots and lots of mutations that appear with a relatively small population of infected because the virus multiplies in the body for a very long time. The more time it takes to clear an infection, the higher the probability of a random mutation taking hold. Some of these coronavirus patients are sick for over a month. During that time the virus is multiplying exponentially. That's how many of the experts believe the South African variant came about, from a single person who was sick for over a month.</p>
<p>A billion people that clear an infection in a few days has way less of a chance of mutation than a million people that have the infection for 1 or more months. That's partly what makes vaccinations so important. Even if the vaccine isn't 100% effective, cutting that amount of time spent sick is critical.</p></div>		</li>
