			<div class="markdown"><p>yes this is known as the volume of distribution and would affect how quickly you intoxicate. </p>
<p>to take the thought experiment to its extreme, consider if you lost all body parts and were just a head. then each equivalent amount of alcohol would go “straight to your head,” so to speak. you’d get much drunker much more quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually when people talk about how “fast” they get drunk they mean after how many drinks they get drunk, which is what I think OP means by it. So in a way, you would get drunk more quickly because it would require fewer drinks to get drunk (which require less time to drink).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - &quot;how many drinks&quot; is &quot;the volume of alcohol&quot; which is how we measure the blood alcohol content - the volume of alcohol in the blood. missing a limb will not speed up the process, just lower the threshold. So if it would take you 3 drinks to get drunk, then you lose a leg and it only takes you 2 drinks to get drunk, your body shouldn't process them any faster or slower than it did before. But the rate at which your body processes the alcohol isn't any faster. It takes &quot;less time&quot; because of the volume necessary, not because you process it at a quicker rate. </p>
<p>So if your new tolerance is only 2 drinks but you still have 3, your body is still going to process the three at the same speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the liver's role in this? Because people who weigh more probably have larger livers but amputee's might be able to metabolize alcohol in their system faster than if they didn't have an extra limb</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh? I'd say an otherwise fully-grown adult would not have much difference in liver function due to a limb loss, but that's definitely more of med reddit to answer for.</p></div>		</li>
