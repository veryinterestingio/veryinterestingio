			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true.
There is no evidence of the NSA (or FBI, for that matter) watching your screen.</p>
<p>I know I'm being a wet blanket about this, but it's a pet peeve of mine.
I advocate for online privacy and security and I hate it when people pick up the defeatist attitude of &quot;Oh everybody's already spying on everything we do. There's nothing we can do about it&quot; because it's nonsense.</p>
<p>Yes, the NSA knows everything that you've done using the online services of Facebook, Google, Microsoft or Apple (note: this is <em>not</em> the same as anything you've done using a Google, Microsoft or Apple device or software, only their online services).
That is absolutely terrible and needs to be called out.
However, there are still tonnes of areas of online life that <em>are</em> private, and Edward Snowden has given recommendations on how to protect them.
I think it's important to be precise in talking about what privacy we have lost and what privacy we can still fight for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you but didn't the NSA leaks reveal they had built backdoors into certain consumer products like hard drives and WiFi routers? In that case, it wouldn't necessarily matter what brand device or online service you're using.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your router can't see the content on your screen, thanks to HTTPS (and TLS in general)</p>
<p>Your hard drive is a little more problematic, but I don't remember seeing any of that (but I didn't look that closely)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Snowden certainly claims that once they have identified you, they have the ability to install malware on your computer to do exactly that. The examples he gave was the ability to turn on and monitor peoples webcams, read emails, access files etc.</p></div>		</li>
