			<div class="markdown"><p>A good way to explain this that most people seem to find easier to grasp is to use water as an analogy. The equations are the same anyways, so it's a pretty accurate analogy. Voltage is like water pressure, Amperage is like flow rate, and Wattage is the water pressure x the flow rate giving the &quot;power&quot; of that water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought of it like a waterfall.</p>
<p>Volts is the height of the falls
Amps is the amount of water falling
Watts is the power the waterfall has to move a water wheel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Voltage is like water pressure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and why a taser can be high volts and likely not kill you. But enough volts is like a pressure washer.</p>
<p>High Amps is like a water balloon w/ no pressure/volts. Big enough balloon and it'll knock you out.</p>
<p>put high of both together and you get a fire hose and that's watts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Correct, you can't determine how dangerous an electrical system is without knowing the voltage AND amperage, or the just the wattage. Only knowing voltage or amperage is useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always like the water analogy for electricity. Only gets weird when it comes to open circuit (electricity does nothing, but all the water flows out) vs short circuit (water doesn’t move, but electric current gets moving in a bad way)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For an open circuit, imagine cutting the pipe and instantly adding caps on both ends. Or for a switch which opens the circuit, imagine a valve placed into the pipe and turned off. Then your open circuit analogy is back on track.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't meant to be a perfect analogy for how specific systems work, just the general principles. Beyond that you need to do some research to understand what is going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean it gets weird in a hell of a lot more cases than that, but those are the most basic ones where it does. Go to anything involving actual digital or analog circuit design and it’s completely out the window.</p></div>		</li>
