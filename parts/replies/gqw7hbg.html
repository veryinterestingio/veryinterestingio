<p>The one social issue I've yet to see mentioned here is the rate of domestic violence among impoverished or disadvantaged populations. A concerning aspect of DV is the use of pregnancy to create an obligation to stay. With each subsequent partner, the pattern continues and women are forced to raise multiple children with different paternal heritage. It is incredibly traumatic for the mother and children to get trapped in this cycle. Due to complex trauma, the family struggles to break free of the constraints of poverty.</p>

<p>Replying to amplify this answer. Thanks for mentioning this. Even though we frequently talk about domestic violence in my own country, I admit that I've rarely thought about it in the context of other countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an unfortunate mentality to have but not uncommon within specific communities given the challenges of generational poverty. For example, while living in public housing, it wasn't uncommon to hear similar sentiments or for a teenager to want a baby so she could be assigned her own apartment unit. Other residents gave me some questionable advice related to disability for my son based on a common practice to have a child declared disabled based on a diagnosis of ADHD. There are plenty of anecdotal accounts of abuse within the system on both sides. The systemic issues stemming from corrupt practices such as failing to provide a tenable environment in public housing while claiming to uphold federal maintenance standards must be addressed first. These subpar conditions lead to some residents feeling justified in gaming the system. Often this mentality is based on surviving rather than thriving. Feeling financially secure because basic resources are available to survive is not the same as being financially secure and able to thrive as a household. Our goal as a society should be for every child to thrive.</p>
<p>The minimum amount of child support where I live is 278.4 per child each month. Each state has their own calculations (as far as I know, although it could be a federal limit). Those calculations are based on a projected number limited by the federal minimum wage. Although cost of living continues to increase, both the federal minimum wage and minimal child support calculation remains the same. This leaves many single parent households stuck in an impoverished and disadvantaged position.</p>
<p>For those who have children, consider how small that number is given the cost of living and expense of providing for a child's basic needs. Each additional bedroom in a house is an expense related to parenting. Other expenses include clothing, shoes every 6 months, medical and dental care, nutrition, any recreational activities, furniture, toys and books, transportation, etc it all adds up quickly.</p>
<p>SNAP is meant to be a supplemental assistance program. That means the budget alloted is expected to be less than the need of each household served. Medicaid services are limited to what the program considers necessary. This can leave children without proper dental care due to out-of-pocket expenses. Some providers discriminate against Medicaid recipients because they've had poor experiences with late or absent patients. There are various organizations which offer scholarships and low-cost programs to provide recreational options to these families. </p>
<p>It's important that disadvantaged populations have access to these resources in order to provide an adequate childhood experience. Unfortunately, when one lives with a survival mentality seeking resources is generally limited to those needed to make it from one day to the next.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not to mention the cost of childcare or after-school care.  My daughter's after-school program, which ran from 2:30 (when her elementary school got out) to 6:30 Monday through Friday was $400/month and wasn't pro-rated if you used it less. </p>
<p>Preschool (age 4) was significantly higher: $1700/month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have nothing to add (not the person you replied to), but thank you for taking the time to write this. This is very informative and should give everyone who reads it a lot to think about.</p>
<p>I have a very vague and somewhat personal question for you, if you don't mind. You seem to know what you're talking about, so I'm guessing you gained this knowledge through your career. I've always been very interested in learning more about these sorts of things (there's the vague part), I guess the broader field is sociology? But it's all so complex and so incredibly depressing and frustrating. Everything seems like a huge, hopeless mess. How do you deal with those feelings, if you experience them? If you don't feel that way, what is your perspective?</p></div>		</li>
