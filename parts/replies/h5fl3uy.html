			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too.  And since I was the victim of bullying, it just helped confirm my low self-esteem and the concept that I was an incredibly weird individual who would never be able to fit in with &quot;normal&quot; people.</p>
<p>Good thing is over time (a great deal of it) and with maturity (just enough to get by), I learned to completely embrace being &quot;not normal&quot; and, in fact, thrive being &quot;weird&quot;.</p>
<p>Perpetually working on that self-esteem though - the voices from our childhood echo long in our soul.</p></div>		</li>
