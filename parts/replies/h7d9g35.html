			<div class="markdown"><p>So how does this work with cancer? Does the body not detect that they are damaged enough so it looks them to replicate rapidly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We basically are talking about cancer.  The body can detect and deactivate most cancerous or other malfunctioning cells.  </p>
<p>But some manage to get damaged in such a way that they look normal to the body and thus escape being shut down or destroyed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a doc, but from what I've read, cancer is caused by 'bad' cells basically not realizing they're broken, and still giving out the chemical that tells the body they're good, and not to get rid of them. Then it splits and keeps growing and bam theres a tumor.  Because it all grew from one defective cell, the whole tumor has the defect, and is telling your body that it doesnt need an immune response, and that everything is proceeding as normal.</p>
<p>Edit: spelling/clarity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Among the first mutations in a cell that lead to cancer include corrupting genes that help detect and / or repair mutated DNA.</p>
<p>The cells can also mutate to express proteins that inactivate or block immune cells searching for mutated / cancerous cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true and you are perfectly correct but to add there are caps of extra dna on chromosomes called Telomeres.  These are slowly shortened each replication. Eventually you start cutting into your functional dna.</p></div>		</li>
