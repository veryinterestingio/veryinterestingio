			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure! Sometimes it can be tricky to pin down the explanation, but this one's fairly well-studied. Of course, there could be case-by-case differences, but carefully fixing sleep hygiene does the trick in many cases. Hope you sleep!</p></div>		</li>

In that moment I think to myself &quot;holy shit if this is how depressed or suicidal people feel I don't blame them&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know I have sleep anxiety. I already do all those things mentioned under sleep hygiene religiously - it does not help (though I guess it would be even worse without those things).</p>
<p>I also do the giving up and reading thing. That helps but only if it is very late already and I am very tired. Since I stick to the exact wake up times it means I am consistently getting  less than 5 hours of sleep and am always tired.</p>
<p>Since my problem is only falling asleep and nothing after that, is there some medication I can take to fall asleep which does not mess me up long term?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Careful with that. I got to where I couldn’t sleep without it. Had to go cold turkey for two weeks of brutally sleepless nights before my body recovered.</p>
<p>If you get to where you’re dependent on something to get to sleep you’re going down a dark path because eventually whatever you’re using will stop working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melatonin may help, or an OTC sleep aid. When I have multiple days with little sleep I take 1/4 of an OTC sleep aid and it knocks me out. I don’t take often as makes me feel less alert the next day. (If I get up and read I’m up all night!)</p></div>		</li>
