			<div class="markdown"><p>An infinitive verb is something like 'to be' or 'to make'. A split infinitive is when an adverb is placed in the middle. For example, &quot;I really want to not go,&quot; has 'not' splitting the infinitive 'to go'. In Latin, infinitives are just a single word formed by adding a suffix to the root word and therefore cannot be split.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the most basic form of a verb, without a subject or object or any tense.    </p>
<p>If that's too abstract, in English it's the form of the verb that has &quot;to&quot; in front of it. To jump, to see, to talk, etc.    </p>
<p>In Latin, this form was one word. In English it's two. That's why in Latin you can't split the infinitive, because you would be literally splitting a word. In English, you can, because it's two words. But some monk 600 years ago thought that you shouldn't be able to do anything in English that you can't do in Latin, because Latin is &quot;perfect.&quot;    </p>
<p>Example - Star Trek's &quot;To boldly go where no man has gone before.&quot; This is wrong because they stuck &quot;boldly&quot; right in the middle of the infinitive, &quot;To Go.&quot; Correct grammar, according to Some Old Monk, would be &quot;To go boldly where no man has gone before.&quot; And it would sound like crap.</p></div>		</li>
