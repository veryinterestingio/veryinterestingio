			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of blood spatters, evidently when I suffered a massive concussion back in high school by slipping just outside my garage (wet cement is no joke folks, &quot;no running&quot; signs are there for a reason) when a thunderstorm was absolutely dumping its load on me, blood pretty much exploded all over the walls and floor. I dont remember any of this, but my brother thought he heard a gunshot, came outside (and turned out that &quot;gunshot&quot; was my head hitting the cement), to see me laying in a pool of blood and hauled ass to get me to the ER. My sister took it upon herself to clean all of the blood up, took her all night, but she didn't want me to come home after a few days in the hospital just to see the garage walls and floor caked in my blood. My siblings and I arent total dickwads all the time!</p>
<p>But seriously, do not fuck around with wet cement.</p>
<p>Edit: left out some funny details that really tie it all together. I got that concussion when heading home after kicking it with some buddies. The ER nurse who had the honor of putting 12 staples in my head happened to be the dad of one of my buddies I was with prior. Evidently in all of my incoherant repetitive scrambling I kept on mentioning my buddy's name, pretty loudly too. He said he was like &quot;who the hell keeps saying my sons name? Like what the fuck what did my son get himself into this time&quot;</p>
<p>My favorite part of the story that my family tells me is that when he started putting the staples in the back of my head i said &quot;...DID YOU JUST STAPLE MY HEAD??&quot;</p>
<p>Good times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter sneezes in her sleep. She’s now 2 but I remember the first time was when she was a couple months old. Her snoring became a quick sneeze, and then back to snoring. So she definitely wasn’t faking, and would’ve made her awake self known otherwise. </p>
<p>Side note, I know snoring’s not normal in children. She’s having her jumbo-sized tonsils removed soon </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My 5 year old had hers removed almost exactly a year ago for basically the same reasons. Wonderful decision because she’s much better now (still talks a bit nasally though). Good luck and give her lots of cuddles!</p></div>		</li>
