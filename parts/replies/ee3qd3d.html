			<div class="markdown"><p>It helped my understanding of chemistry to walk along this route.   </p>
<p>Thinking about how things are flexing and bending and frankly, being little mechanical machines.  And a lot of these machines operate at the proton or electron level.  Proton pumps, ATP synthase in mitochondria.</p>
<p>Nanotechnology is already on the planet, we're made of it.  </p>
<p>We may find that the smallest machines we can make share a lot of simularities with life that already exists.  </p>
<p>May, may find!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always thought technology would come full circle with biology one day. We already have tiny little cell sized machines capable of storing and sharing instructions on how to create structures that are borderline incomprehensible in scale and complexity.</p>
<p>As our ability to construct smaller and more complex machines improves we may eventually reach a point where the structure of our machines may be comparable to the structure of our biology.</p>
<p>Both life and technology seek to utilize the smallest available structures in the most efficient ways possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemical properties of the element are virtually completely based on how many electrons are in the outermost cloud/shell, (followed by the number of &quot;shells&quot; the element has).</p>
<p>That's why elements that are in a column of the periodic table are usually pretty similar. They have the same number of electrons that are able to interact with other atoms.</p>
<p>So Sodium, Potassium and Lithium are all in the first column. That means they have one line electron on their outermost shell, that makes them interact with other atoms.</p>
<p>Why is a very useless question to ask for fundamental rules of the universe. They simply are. A better question is to ask how.</p>
<p>And chemical reactions dependent on how those outermost electrons can react.</p>
<p>Those with few electrons on the outermost shell usually prefer to simply give them away. Those on the other end will prefer to steal them, those in the middle may even share them.</p>
<p>This is all because a &quot;full&quot; shell is most favourable.</p>
<p>Why is that the number eight in the more common elements? That's because the universe is that way.</p>
<p>It's like the speed of light in vacuum is 300,000 km/s and not twice that.</p>
<p>You could go a bit further to explain this with quarks and spin etc, but it doesn't really matter for anything, it's always that way.</p>
<p>So number of electrons would be how many &quot;sticky&quot; sides the Lego piece has, and number of shells would be how big the Lego piece is. (Very simplified).</p>
<p>And most of the interaction between those atoms is due to electromagnetism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is rather unfair. You can indeed go deeper into the reasons for the general structure and properties of atoms. It is not a useless question. It just becomes more a physics question, and less a chemistry question, and beyond that, a maths question.  How and why are often interchangeable, and eventually the answer becomes &quot;We don't know&quot; or often more accurately &quot;we don't know <em>yet</em>&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about the electrons, and the shape of their 3D quantum probability distribution. The math for working out where each electron is and how they interact with each other involves integration of partial differential equations, which gets crazy complicated. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital" target="_blank">See Atomic Orbital's for some pictures</a> of solutions for where a single electron might be found. And this is a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMIvWz-7GmU" target="_blank">introductory video</a> of the history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's electrostatics all the way down. It's best to think of bonds as a force, and obviously a strong attraction is harder to break than a weak attraction which manifest macroscopically in weird ways.</p>
<p>It obviously gets a lot more complicated than purely electrostatics because electrons aren't point charges, but I wouldn't worry about that much unless you're a chemist/physicist. The force picture puts you way ahead of most people alone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not so much, if my grad-level quantum chemistry courses are to be believed.  I distinctly recall a graph showing that only about 2% of the H-H bond strength could be attributed to classical electrostatics.  The rest is kinetic energy reduction from the electrons being spread over a larger volume with a nice flat spot in the probability distribution midway between the nuclei - if you rearrange the equations a bit you can show that kinetic energy is something like the square of the gradient of the electronic wavefunction, integrated over the entire space.</p></div>		</li>
