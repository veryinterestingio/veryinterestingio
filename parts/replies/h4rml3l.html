<p>Simplifying here but then your higher brain only has to signal “play jazz pattern on ride cymbal” and your cerebellum does the coordinated heavy lifting for you. Your motor cortex and mind are largely freed up to pay attention to additional things and stimulus you would have had to previously ignore. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would seem to tie in to the &quot;transient hypofrontality&quot; thesis of Arne Dietrich. His research indicates that athletes and artists achieve a state of 'flow', which they report as effortless effort. Music flows from their fingers, or their body moves without thought. In that state, electrical activity in the pre-frontal cortex is slowed down, and the mind focuses on the goal, rather than the action.</p>
<p>I've experienced the state a few times playing golf. Instead of thinking &quot;keep your head, keep your arm straight, bend your knees, follow through&quot;, etc., I just thought &quot;Hit it in the fairway&quot;, and my body did the rest. It only works, of course, if you have hit thousands of golf balls, or done thousands of scales on your piano, or practiced your double Axel over and over. </p>
<p>At that point, your body 'knows' what to do, and your conscious brain only gets in the way, like an interfering manager. For many athletes, the key to superior performance is finding a method to 'get out of your own way'.</p></div>		</li>
