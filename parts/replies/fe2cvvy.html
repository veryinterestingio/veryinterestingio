			<div class="markdown"><p>This idea seems really suspect. Anthropological evidence of hunter gatherers indicate that malocclusion virtually did not exist, and if we consider the kinds of diet we used to eat prior to agriculture (very tough, consisting of partially cooked animal and plant foods, eaten without utensils), we can see that it would require perfectly functioning, very powerful teeth and jaws in order to live and reproduce successfully. </p>
<p><strong>The effect of mouth breathing on dentofacial morphology of growing child</strong></p>

<p>“Changed mode of respiration was associated with increased facial height, mandibular plane angle and gonial angle...longer faces.”</p>
<p><strong>Mouth breathing in allergic children: Its relationship to dentofacial development</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6573147" target="_blank"><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6573147" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6573147</a></strong></a></p>
<p>&quot;The upper anterior facial height and the total anterior facial height were significantly larger in the mouth breathers. Angular relationships of the sella-nasion, palatal, and occlusal planes to the mandibular plane were greater in the mouth breathers, and their gonial angles were larger. The mouth breathers’ maxillae and mandibles were more retrognathic. Palatal height was higher, and overjet was greater in the mouth breathers. Maxillary intermolar width was narrower in the mouth breathers and was associated with a higher prevalence of posterior cross-bite. Over all, mouth breathers had longer faces with narrower maxillae and retrognathic jaws. This supports previous claims that nasal airway obstruction is associated with aberrant facial growth.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Breathing mode influence in craniofacial development</strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16446911" target="_blank"><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16446911" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16446911</a></strong></a></p>
<p>&quot;It was observed that the measurements for the inclination of the mandibular plane (SN.GoGn) in mouth breathing children were statistically higher than those in nasal breathing children. The posterior facial height was statistically smaller than the anterior one in mouth breathing children (PFH-AFH ratio). Thus, the upper anterior facial height was statistically smaller than the lower facial height (UFH-LFH ratio)...We concluded that mouth breathing children tend to have higher mandibular inclination and more vertical growth. These findings support the influence of the breathing mode in craniofacial development&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Skeletal and occlusal characteristics in mouth-breathing pre-school children.</strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15366619" target="_blank"><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15366619" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15366619</a></strong></a></p>
<p>The skeletal pattern measurements...indicated a tendency to mouth-breathing children presenting a dolichofacial pattern. According to occlusal characteristics, only the intermolar distance showed a significant correlation with a narrow maxillary arch in mouth-breathing subjects. Based on the results of this study, mouth-breathing can influence craniofacial and occlusal development early in childhood.</p>
<p><strong>The effect of mouth breathing versus nasal breathing on dentofacial and craniofacial development in orthodontic patients.</strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20824738" target="_blank"><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20824738" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20824738</a></strong></a></p>
<p>&quot;Mouth breathers demonstrated considerable backward and downward rotation of the mandible, increased overjet, increase in the mandible plane angle, a higher palatal plane, and narrowing of both upper and lower arches at the level of canines and first molars compared to the nasal breathers group. The prevalence of a posterior cross bite was significantly more frequent in the mouth breathers group (49%) than nose breathers (26%), (P = .006). Abnormal lip-to-tongue anterior oral seal was significantly more frequent in the mouth breathers group (56%) than in the nose breathers group (30%) (P = .05)...Naso-respiratory obstruction with mouth breathing during critical growth periods in children has a higher tendency for clockwise rotation of the growing mandible, with a disproportionate increase in anterior lower vertical face height and decreased posterior facial height.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From the present study it can be concluded that the effect of mouth breathing was confined to the changes in maxillary arch dimensions. There was contraction of maxillary arch and increase in maxillary arch length. An increased overjet and deep overbite were present in these cases. The palate appeared high, not because its height was actually increased, but due to contraction of the maxillary arch. A higher percentage of Class II, division 1 malocclusion was seen in mouth breathers.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
