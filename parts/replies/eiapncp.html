			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have access to this paper, but it says it contains the proof that being able to perform simple arthimetic on real numbers without any approximations in a single step amounts to solving NP problems in P time.</p>

<p>The magic is in storing it, not in generating it. It's really just a thought exercise of 'what would happen if registers could hold all real numbers, and not just fixed-width rational numbers'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the Encyclopaedia Wand (I first came across it in Haruki Muralami’s “Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World”, but I think it came from somewhere else first, I just can’t find it on google, possibly I’m remembering the term incorrectly).</p>
<p>Imagine a stick of length 1 unit. An infinitely precise mark placed along the length of the stick defines a decimal part of the stick’s length. It could “0.5” or “0.2215” or even an infinitely long irrational number, depending on where exactly (<em>infinitely exactly</em>) the mark is placed. All books of any length whatsoever, including infinitely long books, could be recorded on this one stick, if only we had the means to mark it and read it with infinite precision.</p>
<p>“All of Pi” exists. It’s the ratio between the diameter and the circumfeeence of a circle. The entire number is encoded there, in infinite length, had we only the means to measure it and write it out.</p>
<p>Obviously you can’t write out “all of Pi” in finite time, that’s part of the definition of writing something out in the time and space that we occupy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The program of a BSS machine is allowed to refer to arbitrary real numbers, just like a Java program is allowed to refer to arbitrary strings and (certain) arbitrary integers. So the BSS program you want would simply be the equivalent of &quot;print pi&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The thing about noise is it never goes away.</p>
<p>A lot of it can be demonstrated on the thermal noise that is due to random chaotic movement of the constituents of matter. In physics, there is now a field of &quot;cold atoms&quot; that manages to cool small amount of stuff to stupendously unimaginably low temperatures which looks at what matter looks like at very low &quot;noise&quot; levels, but thermodynamics tells us we can never reach 0K temperatures that would theoretically mean absolutely no noise.</p>
<p>Another relevant field of physics is the &quot;precision (particle) physics&quot; which tries to measure unbelievably small effects, whose successes would probably somehow correlate to the limits our ability to store and work with these infinite real numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes. The curious thing is that if you strip them of their magical infinite properties, they become exactly equivalent. If you have an analog computer that can, say, represent numbers between 0 and 1000 (let's say that more than 1000 of whatever physical unit it is using to represent the number would damage it) with precision up to 50 decimal places, you can represent 1000*10^(50) unique numbers, which is slightly less than what you can represent using 23 bytes of memory. It turns out that IRL the 23 bytes are the easier/cheaper means of storage.</p></div>		</li>
