			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this was neat to read!</p>
<p>Also, maybe you can answer this question I've had.. Is it possible to tell when a bottle of Coke was sealed by looking at the date printed on it? Is that date a sell by date or drink by date or what exactly?</p>
<p>Like, I want to be able to know if I see a bottle with say a July date, how more or less bubbly would that be.. the 3-6 months info you provided goes a long way to helping me but if it was possible to tell based on the date printed that would be cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dates printed on bottles are consume by date codes. sell by dates are not intended for consumers but for warehouses and retailers/distributors. for example 09May22X11242 code means that the product was produced today at 1242H and will expire next year!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It won't get colder, but heat transfer (faster to slower) is aluminum, glass, plastic.  So in your hand aluminum feels colder than plastic, even if the temp is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I buy 5lb CO2 tanks from local air-gas, and as hobby from cocktail work, enjoy mixing syrups and other infusions.</p>
<p>I mix my own cola flavor from citrus, cinnamon, vanilla. Blended with home carbonation is delicious.</p>
<p>Do you agree made at home is the best experience?</p></div>		</li>
