			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual issue is the criteria used to identify a video as for kids or not for kids. Like having bright colors in a video, or animation, or video games and more. Which, let's be honest is 90% of most videos on youtube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the issue in the wording of the criteria, but unlike youtube the FTC does not hand out fines based on an algorithm. Clarity would be helpful but its also an incredibly abstract idea. What is children's programming?</p>
<p>Context counts, and while I don't inherently trust agencies or regulators to do the right thing, there is not enough man power to police all of youtube for people who would intentionally circumvent the safeguards. Much less to entrap people who aren't targeting children. If they were just using the guidelines with no thought to the actual content, things like bojack horseman or family guy would be fined constantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure Family Guy and Bojack don't fall under COPPA. Not to mention those shows no doubt have their own regulations to uphold on when they can be shown, what time, what channel etc.</p>
<p>I don't think they'd be handing out fines by algorithm but even if it was an actual person reviewing said content they still have to follow the broad as conditionals set out in COPPA which wouldn't do much good to the content creator anyway. &quot;oh you got bright colors and use the words&quot; whatever&quot; and/or &quot;free stuff&quot;, well you're in violation of COPPA <em>fine</em>&quot;</p></div>		</li>
