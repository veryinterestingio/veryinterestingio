<p>The first one said &quot;God must be a mechanical engineer, look at the joints! The Skeleton!&quot; </p>
<p>The second one said &quot;No, God is a chemical engineer!  Look at all the chemical processes in the body!&quot;</p>
<p>The third one said &quot;God is a civil engineer.&quot;</p>
<p>The other two looked at him.</p>
<p>The third one continued &quot;Look at the butt, who else would put a waste pipeline in a recreational area.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Each part of the body works just well enough to <em>almost</em> make up for the ways another part can go wrong, it's full of hacky solutions to make  something from a previous version keep working, and the logic running it all is full of bugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only response with a valid physical explanation for a potential physical connection. </p>
<p>To expand, things definitely can get <em>wonky</em> if the source of the sound easily pairs mentally to your teeth on-top of the nerve crossover. Things can be psychosomatic (sensation not of physical source but mental), without being a disorder. Forks scrape our teeth all the time, and remember styrofoam cups? We know their sounds, and amplify it, it may cross a threshold. Think of a cringe-response but in your exposed, nerve filled bones. This would also explain why a good amount of people experience this, but some don’t, as the frequency is not (yet proven to my knowledge) causal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could, but not always - just like how a sensitive ear drum doesn't always manifest as tooth pain. Also, the auriculotemporal nerve isn't the only nerve that serves the ear so hearing isn't dependent on just that nerve (but it is the main player).</p></div>		</li>
