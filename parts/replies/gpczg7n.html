			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this mostly comes from a misunderstanding of primate teeth-baring. They do bare teeth to show aggression but that involves the teeth being open, not closed, with lips curled back (ready to bite). Teeth-baring with teeth closed (a smile as we would perceive it) is a sign of submission, as you said.</p>
<p>And the human smile is indeed a signal of submission even though that's a confusing way for us to think about it. But it's not that complicated... Submissive behaviour = I'm not a threat to you = I'm friendly = symbol of niceness/friendship</p>
<p>I guess a better question would be how did closed teeth smiling become a symbol of submission in primates? The open teeth one makes sense..it's aggressive because you're ready to bite. But closed teeth meaning the opposite? I don't quite see how it developed.. [edit: durr I'm an idiot. It must because the teeth are CLOSED, showing your intent NOT to bite with them]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe the squinting of eyes. It kinda comes with a smile. In some animals, constant eye contact is a sign that they don’t trust you. But if you’re showing that you are able to not look at them, you trust them. Kinda like a cat being able to show its belly at you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats have the same thing since you bring them up. If your cat closes their eyes/squints at you it means they trust you enough to relax around you completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the phenomenon of a &quot;fake&quot;/&quot;plastic&quot;/&quot;customer service&quot; smile that &quot;doesn't reach the eyes&quot;, which seems off-putting to most people.</p>
<p>That's your mammalian hind-brain saying &quot;don't trust this person's show of submission, they don't mean it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also humans have their own version of &quot;baring teeth= aggression&quot;, which is exactly how how you described it for other mammals, with lips curled back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I LOVE these things. My favorite one is how people will nod up to bare their carotid artery/neck as a sign of “I trust you.” Like “Hey buddy” </p>
<p>But it can also be a sign of “You can’t hurt me, I’ll kick your ass if you try.” And then it’s held for longer. As if to say “Go ahead and try” </p>
<p>You can nod your head down to mean “You could hurt me, but I understand you mean me no harm. I respect you.”</p>
<p>Or you can nod down to hide your neck as a sign of submission like: “You could hurt me, please don’t” And that one is also held for longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But many dogs also smile with bared teeth as a distinct expression from a snarl.  Sighthounds (greyhounds, whippets and similar) are kind of known for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But growling isn't a visual gesture. Pretty much no animals other than primates use a display of clenched teeth as a submissive gesture, but using using a display of open teeth as an aggressive gesture is common.</p>
<p>So when a dog growls while displaying clenched teeth, there isn't a confusion. Clenched teeth are meaningless, growls are aggressive, therefore doggo is doing an anger.</p></div>		</li>

is a sign of comfort and trust among felines!</p>
<p>In my experience, they don’t always close their eyes, but that’s the maximum comfort level. Squinting definitely means they like you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Furthermore when we smile we also squint our eyes, which is often a mammalian way of showing non-aggression.</p>
