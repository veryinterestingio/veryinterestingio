			<div class="markdown"><p>No, as mentioned elsewhere, this was essentially an explanation for abundance of coal formation during the Carboniferous, but is not consistent with more recent work. No such hypothesis has been put forward in relation to petroleum as far as I’m aware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a laymen, I've got two questions:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where does the heating you describe come from? Simply pressure from above? Or are there other chemical reactions occuring naturally which generate heat?  </p>
</li>
<li>Is the &quot;oil window&quot; the time where the stuff can be harvested? Or does it lay dormant after leaving the window?</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not OP but to briefly answer these:</p>
<p>1) Oil maturation is primarily from heat and pressure due to burial (more sediments/bedrock on top of the source); the deeper you go, the warmer it gets. Tectonics (mountain building, basin formation, etc.) can also drive this process faster.</p>
<p>2) The oil window is the physical conditions in which oil CAN form. If it goes deeper/gets hotter, gas will start to form. If these conditions are met then you are good! The source then can go to shallower depths or the oil/gas can migrate (which is common).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) The increase in temperature with depth largely reflects a cooling profile, i.e. the internal portions of the Earth are hot (from a few sources including original heat of formation and continued heat generation from radioactive decay in the crust and mantle) and the surface of the Earth is cold, respectively. In the case of basins, material is heated mainly because it is moving closer to warmer sections of the crust as it is buried, i.e., it is getting deeper, not because of a change in the pressure. The pressure is changing because of the increasing overburden, but this is not the origin of the heating. </p>
<p>2) The oil window refers to the temperature range (i.e., a window) over which the bulk of petroleum is formed from breakdown of kerogen. Once petroleum is formed, it often migrates to higher levels of the crust (it is a fluid and buoyant) until it encounters layers that have very low permeability (i.e. fluid can't flow through it easily).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This wonderful comment made me realize that even if an alien planet did develop life, unless all of the conditions necessary are just right they very likely won’t have access to oil. This would clearly severely hamper any industrial revolution. Perhaps oil formation is in fact one of the great filters we have been looking for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood, tallow and vegetable oil are very good fuels. We just exceeded our planets capacity to produce it so had to rely on mined fuel. Sperm oil was very popular till we wiped out the whales.</p>
<p>A smaller population could easily have industrialised without fossil fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that raises the question of how easily a smaller population could industrialize. You could argue that a certain population size is required to have enough people of exceptional talent and intellect, with enough resources available to them, in order to industrialize. This would of course be highly dependent on the physiology and culture of the alien race which would likely be so far from our own there’s no point in speculating about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it. Sun and wind are really old power sources that far predate the use of coal and oil. It would not allow for a massive revolution due to cheap abundant energy perhaps, but there's also little reason to believe it would halt all progress. in fact, looking at the harm industrialization has done, it might be a blessing in disguise (though from a species/ecosystem perspective)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oil products are not only used in energy, we need oil based products for plastics, engines, high energy density fuels, all over chemistry, etc etc. and while we can make some of these without oil, it’s hard to say if we would have solved that issue if the we hadn’t created a need for said products by integrating them into our society. </p>
<p>In other words if aliens didn’t have oil based lubricants and plastics they may never find the need or have the idea to create them otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
