			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 2000's Nielson still asked you to press a button on their little box every time you changed the channel. </p>
<p>You were supposed to key in which family members were watching TV at each time. If you forgot to key it in, the little box would start blinking its LEDs. If you habitually forgot, their telemarketers would call you to give you a nastygram.</p>
<p>If the telemarketers did that repeatedly (because you live in a household of many children who watch TV), the parents would tell Nielson to go f*ck themselves and uninstall all their bullshit after about a month or two. It wasn't worth the $200 a month.</p>
<p>Tldr: Nielson ratings are bullshit.</p></div>		</li>
