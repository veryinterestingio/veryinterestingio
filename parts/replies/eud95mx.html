			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. And, interestingly, why some of us like spicy foods.</p>
<p>They've put people in MRIs while experiencing spicy foods, and the parts of our brain that light up for &quot;hot&quot; food are the same parts that light up for pain, not for taste.</p>
<p>Pain = endorphins = spicy addiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting thing, spicy foods trigger the same parts of your mouth that tell you you've eaten something with a high temperature, hence why we'd describe it as being 'hot'. The pain is your body telling you to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Things like mint on the other hand trigger the parts for something with a low temperature, and doesn't hurt because apparently we aren't designed to feel pain from shoving ice in our mouths.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Almost all human OCD behaviors can fall under this domain: nail biting, hair pulling (trichotillomania), thumb sucking, <del>bed wetting</del> (not really an OCD behavior) etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m going to copy paste what I said to the guy you’re replying to lol </p>
<p>Might help to put some beard oil or balm in. If the hairs are slick, it’ll be harder to pull them out, plus it’ll get your hands all gross. I personally loathe stuff being on my hands, so that would definitely deter me. Might work for you too. Plus you get the added bonus of a healthy, moisturized beard!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, while it can be induced by anxiety it can also be due to outside factors. My cat used to lick herself raw and bloody between her toes and under her thighs. It turns out she was allergic to her flea meds and her food. After a lot of testing she is unable to have any flea meds and a very specialized food with zero allergens. She no longer licks until raw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh for sure! He said specifically stressed animals but allergies or yeast infections cause skin itchiness which animals will then scratch by licking and pulling out hair. Or if they have pain. Same thing. We had a cat who pulled out her belly hair because she had bladder crystals  which caused her pain. </p>
<p>If you have pets that are pulling out hair or feathers you should always do a vet check up to ensure that there aren't any underlying causes (allergies, pain, infections) and when that is ruled out they will diagnosis stress/anxiety and then there are meds that will help reduce that and hopefully break the cycle of self soothing</p></div>		</li>
