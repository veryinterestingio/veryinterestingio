			<div class="markdown"><p>I know very little on the actual terms used, but from personal experience my wife and I got a 3-day and 5-day update.  The 5-day update is also the final number of implantable embryos.  We went from 24 total eggs fertilized on day 1, to 16 still &quot;good enough&quot; on day 3 to continue, and then a dramatic drop down to 3 embryos grade &quot;A&quot; on day 5.</p>
<p>Edit: we had to wait 5 months for my wife's hormones to balance enough for transfer, but we're currently at 26 weeks! Expecting in mid to late April. 2 embryos still frozen because of my spinal cord injury. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wife and I did IVF with a gestational carrier (wife can't carry but has eggs)</p>
<p>We had 13, 5, 1.</p>
<p>The 1 worked....my sister-in-law carried her and we have a 5 year old now.  Science....</p></div>		</li>

<p>One failed fresh transfer, and our frozen transfer is currently growing on target with me right now. Hit 15 weeks today. </p>
<p>Science is amazing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the science part insane? We did 26, 9, 4. When my daughter was born I commented that 20 years ago it would have been front page news. Now it's just like... Yeah we made you in a lab, what of it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had 20 eggs retrieved, 14 were mature enough to inseminate, then there were 9, then there were 5.</p>
<p>The HCG trigger shot I had to take before going in for egg retrieval put me into ovarian hyperstimulation, which made me not such a great candidate to go through with a fresh embryo transfer. They determined that 4 of the embryos were good enough to freeze.</p>
<p>Came back a month later for frozen embryo transfer (FET) after getting off all the hormones and basically resetting my system. We wanted the best chance at pregnancy, so we opted to transfer two embryos. They thawed two, but one wasn't viable anymore. Thawed a third to have two transferred. One of those two took, and we now have a beautiful 4 year old girl. We kept the last embryo frozen until she was almost 2, and now she has an adorable baby brother whose 2nd birthday is coming up in a couple months.</p>
<p>I'm amazed at how lucky we were to get two really great kids after all we had to go through. Life is wild.</p></div>		</li>

<p>WE are calling it quantum parenting because we won't know if we will be parents until we look. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We went from 46 follicles to 22 fertilized eggs to 5 blasts. Put in two, got a baby. Unfroze the other three, one didn’t thaw, the other two did not produce a baby. So 46 down to one. Crazy.</p></div>		</li>
