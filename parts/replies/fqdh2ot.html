<li>IMHO, No.</li>

<li>Well, space is part of the economy and is of course GOOD for it. I often explain that there were three big benefits from the Apollo Program, only the first two of which are widely recognized: 1) It met its immediate purpose of winning the Space Race, i.e. of &quot;beating&quot; Soviet communism; 2) It advanced Science, esp, our knowledge about the origin and evolution of planets. But the most long-lasting benefit to taxpayers, however, is often the least realized: 3) it created a new generation of what I call our &quot;STEM FORCE&quot;. During the few years of the Apollo program, the number of graduates in all STEM fields in US universities DOUBLED (and then dropped back down to &quot;normal&quot; levels of growth afterwards). This surge during Apollo in STEM graduates is what produced the tech generation that has helped propel and sustain the US's economic leadership from Apollo all the way into this new century. So in short, beyond the obvious fact that space is an important business sector in our economy, it has the power to inspire - IF we embrace the big challenge of our time which is to reach Mars (via the Moon, fine, but to reach Mars) - a new STEM generation. Going to Mars will refresh our STEM FORCE, perhaps the most powerful of all forces: knowledge and know-how.</li>
