			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey there, amateur perfumer here with a few quick additions to this well written post:</p>
<p>Essential oils are not the only thing used in scents, and honestly most quality fragrances are a mix of &quot;absolutes&quot; (high percentage of raw materials suspended in oil or perfumers alcohol, sometimes propylene glycol) and synthetics, which are a HUGE category of materials that are made by several companies, each with proprietary blends and formulas. I know this was touched on above but I thought I'd elaborate.</p>
<p>Also in terms of making the scent, a lot of them are built using something called an accord. Many people believe that, in order for a scent to smell like rose, you just need to add some rose essential oil or absolute and call it a day. In reality, the note of rose is often an accord, made up of many other notes that help represent the full smell of rose when combined. In this example, a rose accord may contain a few rose absolutes, raspberry leaf, other fruit esters, hedione (citrus/floral booster), floralozone, etc. Neat stuff!</p></div>		</li>
