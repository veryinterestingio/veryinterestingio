<p>For those that don't watch it, the magic number in any vehicle is 7-10 seconds. If you're idling for less than that, don't bother shutting the engine off, as it'll use more fuel to start it again. Any more, and you're better off shutting it off for fuel economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a cold start yes, a cold idle also requires more gas. This doesn't apply anymore when the engine has warmed up.</p>
<p>This is the reason old cars with carburetors had a choke and many old motorcycles had an enricher. To increase the amount of fuel getting into the engine compared to the amount of air.</p>
<p>A modern car just injects more fuel.</p>
<p>A cold engine doesn't combust as well (very simplified), however modern engines only take a couple minutes to get to a temperature where they run good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be different with older carbureted cars, but with most cars you'll break even if you idle for around 7 seconds or so. More than that, and you'll save fuel by shutting off the engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also only works if the start/stop battery is charged/ECU says OK. The &quot;my car&quot; screen gives the availability status. Our V40 sat for some weeks (during lockdown) and start/stop didn't work for a long time, until the car was used more regularly. </p>
<p>I also periodically drove a 2014 Ford Fiesta after it had sat for 6 months and flattened the battery. The Start/stop worked only once in 2000miles or so I drove the car. I suspect the battery was damaged from sitting so long and the ECU stopped the engine from stopping.</p></div>		</li>
