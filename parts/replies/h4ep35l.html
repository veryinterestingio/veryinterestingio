			<div class="markdown"><p>For a minigun it probably doesn't need to shoot nearly that fast</p>
<p>For the M61 Vulcan though it made sense since it was mounted in the nose of planes.  The enemy fighter might pass through your cone of fire in 0.1 seconds but if you're shooting at 6000 RPM then you have rounds spaced 10 meters apart and 10 of them will pass through its course in that time so one of them will likely hit it.</p>
<p>Most of the need for stupid high rates of fire while also being compact/light came from planes needing a single good dogfighting gun, rather than 4-10 guns across the whole wingspan</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the application. The really high rates of fire are mostly used on high-speed aircraft that might only be over the target for a fraction of a second, or only on-target against another high-speed aircraft for even shorter amount of time. They would only fire in really short bursts, and need to get a lot of rounds out in that time to be effective.</p>
<p>It mostly doesn't make sense to fire that fast from slow-moving land vehicles. Too hard to keep on target, burns through ammo too fast, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also use guns like this for anti missile point defense: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_CIWS" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_CIWS</a> .  Hitting a missile is hard, so you compensate by shooting a lot of bullets at it.</p>
<p>And then you have this monstrosity that could push 1 million+ rounds per minute (for a fraction of a second): <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Storm" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Storm</a></p></div>		</li>
