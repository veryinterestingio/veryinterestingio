			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this response. We deal with so many allergies at my house and I love being able to understand them better. Understanding how they all interact and overlap is essential for effective management.</p>
<p>If you consider the whole household, there are two fruit allergies, three other foods in the top eight, a preservative allergy, cats, all the pollen, a few drugs, dust and mold, and a vaccine. And every single one of these triggers a different response in a different system. We even have to differentiate between a true vegetable allergy (celery) and Oral Allergy Syndrome (cucumbers, but only when the pollen is high). We control for all of them as if they could go all the way, but thank God peanuts has been our only anaphylaxis trigger. I think the only category we don't have a check in is bee stings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geez, that’s a ton!! Just in case you weren’t already aware (with that many differing allergies you probably are). Anaphylaxis is an inflammatory response that occurs in the bloodstream, which causes dangerously low blood pressure as well as a host of other issues. Essentially all food allergies won’t cause anaphylaxis with the exception of peanuts. This is due to the fact that the antigen isn’t able to penetrate the organs of the GI tract. That is not to say they aren’t dangerous, a swelling pharynx can kill just as easily as anything else but (as far as I am aware) anaphylaxis will not occur with other food allergies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you become more and more sensitive to an allergen, how come the body’s reaction to pollen usually won’t become that much worse with more exposure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not an immunologist, and I haven’t learned about the specific functions that go into warding off pollen; however, I did learn that mucus plays a vital role in the immune system and helps serve as a first line of defense. I’d imagine that the body senses the pollen allergen in the mucus and begins to react in what we call “allergies”. Increased mucus production, sneezing, etc help expel the pollen before it can threaten the body in any meaningful way. Not pleasant, but better than a true allergic reaction</p></div>		</li>
