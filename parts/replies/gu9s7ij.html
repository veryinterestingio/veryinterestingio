			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you help me with something? I'm constantly trying to wrap my head around this.</p>
<p>If the photon takes &quot;no time&quot; to get from a to b, but light from the sun takes 8 minutes to reach Earth, how do we quantify that time difference?</p>
<p>The photon left the sun and arrived at Earth instantly. But it took 8 minutes for me to see it.</p>
<p>Why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because time is not experienced the same by different things travelling at different speeds. WE perceive that light takes 8mins to travel, but the light from the sun perceives it as taking no time. This is counter intuitive because day-to-day things we encounter on earth travel at the same speed as we do, and therefore experience a similar passage of time. </p>
<p>Interstingly you dont have to travel at lightspeed to experience this - if you travel faster than something time literally slows down for you compared to that something - so a if you syncronise two clocks, send one into space on a rocket which orbits the earth really fast, then lands - then clock on the rocket will show a different time to the clock which stayed on earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The photon takes 0 time to get from A to B because for it, point A and B are the exact same location. The faster you go, the smaller distances seem. At the speed of light, everything is so shortened its a single point. Hence, you aren't taking any &quot;time&quot; to get there, since you're already there.</p>
<p>For us measuring it though, the distance isn't shortened. It's an 8 minute journey, and we can measure the distance and figure out the speed of the photon to get us the actual time of the journey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to the general belief, there's no universal clock or universal time, everything expiriences time differently so the photon and us on earth can disagree on the time taken in the sun to earth journey and this disagreement is fine according to Einstein's theory.</p></div>		</li>
