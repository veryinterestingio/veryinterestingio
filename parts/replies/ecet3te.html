			<div class="markdown"><p>Just gotta be careful with saying “genetically 99.9% similar.” Using that statement doesn’t encompass the full story of genetics. </p>
<p>Animals like horses, dogs, or even humans have 90 some % of the genome as non coding DNA (meaning it doesn’t code for specific genes). So that ~0.1% is usually the important genes that decide phenotypes (how the genes manifest as traits). </p>
<p>You’re totally right tho! Just thought I’d add my thoughts </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, most of genetics can be called &quot;Will it code or not&quot;. We share a hell of a lot of genetic material, all of which CAN code, but not necessarily all of it will code for various regulatory reasons. It's the whole reason we stopped calling introns &quot;junk code&quot; and just &quot;not currently coding code&quot;. It's also the reason for mutations - Coding happens in the wrong place, or coding doesn't happen in the right place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. There's also a lot of genes which encode basic aspects of life, such as ribosomes, and a vast array of simple proteins which are fairly universal.</p>
<p>For instance, we share about 60% of our DNA with bananas. Two species of different kingdoms life, and yet 60% genetically the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And most of DNA codes for stuff that's really only relevant at the cellular level, like all the proteins necessary to turn sugar into actually useful energy or turning DNA-coded information into actual proteins in the first place. You share most of your DNA with a banana.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the genetic code it stuff like protein encoding, which is pretty much identical even across species.</p>
<p>If you're a mammal, you probably share anywhere from 80-95% of your DNA with all other mammals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are over 3 billion data points in the human genome, yet modern day genotype has is able to look at approx 600K Snps and see most of the genes that code for traits, or have any known variance in humans. </p>
<p>When you pay for a dna test, these ~600k snps are all that is looked at to determine ancestry, trait predisposition, etc. We only have to look at this tiny fraction due to dna among most life forms being so similar. </p>
<p>We share approx 60% of our DNA with chickens, fruit flies, and even bananas. We share 96% with chimps. </p>
<p>Your explanation is great, I just wanted to add some context on understanding DNAs crazy complexity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am referring to common consumer genotyping from services like 23 and me, etc. You can sequence the entire genome, but genotyping is far cheaper and used in most consumer facing products. </p>
<p>It all depends on the chip used, I have mostly seen these 600k chips from ilumina used. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do wonder how compatible German Shepherd and Chihuahua genes are in terms of the physical limits of the dogs. For example, in that particular pairing, it's obvious who is the mother and who is the father. Even if there was artificial insemination, a female chihuahua would have (in my imagination) a harder time carrying a litter of half breed pups.</p>
<p>I wonder if a pairing of two very different breeds (in terms of general morphology) of dogs results in more miscarriages or stillborn pups?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the dairy farms in my area like to keep a young Jersey bull to breed their Holstein heifers the first time -- one it usually produces a smaller calf making it easier for the first time birth, and second if the calf if female it will increase the herd's fat percentage a smidge (which can help with the milk check).</p>
<p>Even though the size difference isn't as great as a German Shepard and Chihuahua it is still enough to ease birthing.</p>
<p>The next time or two the cow is bred they use artificial insemination with Holstein sperm since purebred Holsteins produce more (but lower fat) milk.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's still a question if the father is the chihuahua. Who provided the stepladder?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a chihuahua/shepherd where the chihuahua was the mother. She just ended up having a singleton litter, which isn't necessarily weird for chis anyway. Not super sure how the breeding event itself worked out but life uh, finds a way. </p>
<p>Also, considering most pure breeds have exaggerated features often incompatible with life, I would assume cross-breeds between two very different (read: very inbred) breeds would make the pups <em>more</em> likely to be viable, not less.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not necessarily. Outbreeding depression can also happen. You can get a combination of traits from each parent that are just not compatible or advantageous. </p></div>		</li>
