			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I wanted to treat my ADHD type illness, I would take a stimulant yes, but are there any NONADDICTIVE, NON HABIT FORMING stimulants that I could take? I am kind of paranoid about becoming addicted or having it legitimately screw up my brain chemistry if I end up coming off of it. Your thoughts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you looked into stimulant addiction? It’s very non-addictive. As someone who takes Vyvanse and Adderal they only have potential for addiction when abused. Taking it most days, you will end up craving your “down time” when you aren’t on the medication</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who have an underlying propensity for addiction will easily become addicted. This is roughly 10% of the population, depending on the study It's very difficulty to predict, unless there is a history.</p>
<p>The archetype of addiction is the slippery slope, where eventually somebody is past the point they ever wanted to be. And then it's hard to stop.</p>
<p>So, for many people, it's non-addictive. But people will hear this, become addicted, and then wait LONGER to get help because of a supposition that &quot;it's non-addictive&quot;.</p>
<p>Just food for thought. As an addiction professional, I encourage people to be careful about how they use their words in these situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stimulants by nature have high potential for abuse, but there are some non-stimulant ADHD treatments. </p>
<p>Strattera is the most common one. Unlike stimulants, which are short term treatments which leave your body pretty quickly, Strattera is more like an antidepressant: you take it everyday, it slowly builds up in your system, and you'll start feeling the effects within a few weeks. Unfortunately, while Strattera works really well for some people, it has very little effect in many others (particularly compared to stimulants).</p>
<p>The other option is to stick to extended release stimulants, which still have a high potential for abuse, but not quite as high as instant release stimulants because there's less of an association between taking the meds and the effect.</p>
<p>That said, if you work closely with your psychiatrist, there isn't much reason to be afraid of stimulants. You'll slowly titrate up to dosages which work for you and if you stop them it'll be equally slowly and with guidance from your doc/therapist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atomoxetine (Strattera) is FDA approved to treat ADHD, and does not have the risk of tolerance and dependence like traditional stimulants. All medications can have a discontinuation syndrome, however, and most psychiatric drugs are notorious for this.</p>
<p>There are other options, not necessarily FDA approved, but commonly used and effective (to some degree).</p></div>		</li>
