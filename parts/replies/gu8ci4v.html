			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive had pretty severe nerve damage for like 20 years. Cant feel most my leg. Youll get used to it and it gets a lot better.  Itll happen less and be less severe. The best advice i can give you is take a towel and rub the area anytime you are watching tv or chilling. Its not comfortable and it takes a long time doing it, but helps retrain your brain is the only way i can put it. It sorta accelerates the process. Its basically the nerves along the periphery thatll wake back up as you heal, so that area is going to shrink and may even regain some dull feeling. This process honestly takes like 10 years but its really only the first year or so thats rough. Hang in there.</p></div>		</li>
