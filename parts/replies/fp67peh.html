			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll also add that the issue with Ekman's work is not necessarily that it was flawed--its more that the findings don't hold up once you leave the controlled conditions of the lab and start applying to real life. The research itself is compelling--unfortunately just one of those things that require very specific circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly Ekman's work proved that microexpressions are universal, but in no way you will be able to say if someone is lying or not based solely on that.
I have seen is the use of Facial Acting Coding System (FACS) together with the Six Channel Analysis (SCANS) to verify signs of stress while someone is talking. But in no way you're able to tell for certain if someone is lying or not, at max you can only see some signs that can INDICATE if a person could be lying or not.</p></div>		</li>
