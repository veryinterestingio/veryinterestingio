<p>source: I worked at a physics research firm during university where we used a lot of industrial (not retail) gas canisters; purity was a big concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laser grade gas is the purest you can get from a normal supplier. Gas lasers get really upset from any contaminants.<br />
Also... Also welder... The gas use is only free of certain contaminants, hydrogen and oxygen primarily. Other than that, long as the mixture is right we don't rally care, the arc is strong enough to destroy most things.   </p>
<p>But if you are welding something that get truly upset from little things, like titanium, then you really need to fork out the extra cash for better quality gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be (too?)  specific, I was mostly referring to dirt and oils in the pipes and tubes used in filling. Because of they way gases are produced, the gas may start out relatively clean but then goes into a holding tank, and then a truck, and then another holding tank and then the final canister. </p>
<p>What is &quot;clean enough&quot; to fill a balloon or burn in a torch or backyard grill is way dirtier than what you need for a laser or a patient to breathe. And what the welders here said before I did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, at first blush I would have predicted the opposite effect.</p>
<p>The water vapour in exhaled breath can easily adsorb to surfaces and help them <em>dissipate</em> charge. But that's not what you've seen here.</p>
<p>Perhaps helium seeping through the walls of the balloon has an effect.</p>
<p>It may depend on an interaction with the actual confetti and how charge is distributed in the balloon -- if you just shake the balloon without rubbing it (so that the static charging occurs only inside the balloon), do you see the same phenomenon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure on the last one.  They've all deflated now so I can't try it.</p>
<p>You might be onto something with the helium permeating the latex though.  The helium-filled balloons deflated (roughly) an order of magnitude faster than the air-filled balloons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why helium balloons rise in the air is because of Buoyancy. The density of this gas is lower than the density of air. So the confetti sticking to the inner surface of the balloon with the air may have been supported by Buoyancy, which is significantly larger than in a helium balloon. Hence they would fall because charge + buoyancy does not overcome gravity anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting idea. I wonder if you would see a difference in the height of confetti on the valoon wall if you charge one and not a second then just roll them on a table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. Rock dust is just as dense as rock, on a per-particle basis, but it is also a messy wafting hazard if the wind blows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but I was not implying that Buoyancy on those confetti would be strong. Only strongER than in a helium filled balloon. Regardless of the density, any object in a fluid with a pressure gradient experiences Buoyancy. Its weight is reduced by this amount, regardless of density. So even if it is only a small contribution to the balance of forces, it may just be enough to keep them afloat in combination with the charge (which of course will do most of the &quot;work&quot;)</p>
<p>About drag: I have thought about that, but this only slows down objects, it can not prevent something from falling, only slow down the falling.</p></div>		</li>
