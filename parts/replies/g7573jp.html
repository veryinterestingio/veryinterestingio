			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting.  Thank you.  I know you can sometimes see how fault lines cause buildings, roads, etc, to shift.  I hadn't realized that it would shift things enough it would be visible when excavating older settlements/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They dug a trench across a pretty well-defined section of the fault and could see each earthquake because one side would drop compared to the other. Each time it dropped, the soil surface on the lower side would get covered pretty quickly by eroded soil from above so they could carbon date the plants that had been growing on soil over the fault and tell roughly how long ago each quake happened.
I can't find online info about our fault but this one from Hayward is the same idea. Each time the fault drops, a new soil surface is created on the lower side of the fault. They're shown in the diagram as colored stripes. Bigger drop = bigger earthquake. <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-488/OF03_488s7.3.pdf" target="_blank">https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-488/OF03_488s7.3.pdf</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, how do you carbon date something based on plants that are alive? Or did they find preserved plant specimens in the dig?</p>
<p>EDIT: The poster above me was not talking about carbon dating living specimens and getting useful answers out of it.</p></div>		</li>
