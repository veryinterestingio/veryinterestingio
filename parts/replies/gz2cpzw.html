<p>No matter what, when there's tons of old people and not many young people, there's going to be problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that you could, instead of having social security, invest in a 401k for your retirement. But then to actually find your retirement, you’re going to need to sell those stocks to cash out. If everyone is trying to cash out at the same time, and there aren’t younger people trying to buy into the market, it will tank a lot of the stock prices and put the retirement of the people trying to sell in jeopardy.</p></div>		</li>
