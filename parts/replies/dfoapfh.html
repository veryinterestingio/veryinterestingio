			<div class="markdown"><p>See description <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/62p5un/if_i_roll_two_dice_what_is_the_average_number_of/dforrr9/" target="_blank">here</a> of the general approach using inclusion-exclusion, applied to the specific problem of the roll <em>totals</em> (2 through 12).  For your problem, where the dice are identical but the individual faces matter (e.g., rolling 3-3 is different from 2-4, but 2-4 is the same as 4-2), the expected number of rolls is about 95.0818.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's what doing math is. Looking at a particular situation and recognizing the general pattern it matches, then using that to convert it to another thing that may suggest a further transformation. It's been weird like that for millennia, and taken lots of people with it...</p></div>		</li>
