			<div class="markdown"><p>So am I assuming correctly that it's possible for a person to suffer a fault on the &quot;thermostats&quot; that regulate the amount of a chemical the body needs?</p>
<p>If so, is that treatable?  e.g. how we do prevent the body for lowering the production of something that needs top up if we did top it up by external sources?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, that is exactly how many mental illnesses work. I have lifelong depression and will never be able to go off meds because every time I do my brain sets my chemicals too low and I canâ€™t take care of myself. Fortunately weâ€™ve invented some good anti-depressants and as long as I can afford them I get to be a functional human being.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You treat it by weaning the person off the drug over time. That gives the brain and other organs time to recalibrate the thermostat so to speak.</p>
<p>In fact going cold turkey off some drugs can be extremely risky and even fatal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When certain receptors are overstimulated by a drug, your body shuts down receptors as a way of trying to regulate how much effect the drug has on your body. If there is a chemical your body produces that is similar to the drug being ingested, your body can also shut down it's own production of that chemical. In some cases, if you continue on the drug, your body becomes dependent on it because if your body does not have enough receptors or does not produce enough of that chemical anymore, they need to be maximally stimulated by the drug or critical systems can be essentially shut down. </p>
<p>More often you aren't preventing the body from lowering production, but tapering the dose down to slowly allow your body to recover. A good example is corticosteroids which your body becomes quickly dependent on. These drugs must be weened down over the course of a few days to allow your body to ramp back up it's own production of these chemicals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There aren't really any drugs that we take that are exact copies of what our body naturally produces.  Instead we make drugs that are chemically very similar and bind to the same receptors.  For example the natural opioids our body produces are: endorphin, enkephalin, dynorphin.  We take morphine codeine or some other opioid which binds to the same receptors.  When those receptors get overstimulated your body will slowly stop producing the endigenous opioids because the receptors are already &quot;being taken care of&quot;.  </p>
<p>As for tolerance that is caused by The receptors firing too often so they eventually become desensitized which requires more morphine to achieve the same effect.  Withdrawals will then set in if you stop the morphine, as your body has at this point stopped or extremely reduced the production of the endigenous, natural opioids, but the receptors are so desensitized that even a normal dose of synthetic opioids won't be enough to get them to fire.  Tapering as you said is key to safely and comfortably (as much as possible) reducing the intake of a drug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.
I was just wondering on the possibility of setting the chemical regulator to the desired point, e. g. If the body normal production of a neuro transmitter is too low, basically avoiding tolerance altogether.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when you talk about addictive meds and how they are processed, here's a weird situation: Have taken Percocet as a painkiller on occasion throughout my life with no noticeable problems(dental stuff, etc) Then this: First surgery in January: took Percocet for post-surgery pain, ramped down off it pretty quickly over the course of 5 days, didn't notice anything weird.  5-1/2 months later in June, second surgery: same meds, same ramp-down, but this time, had awful withdrawal symptoms (didn't realize this was what was happening, just felt like hell). About a week later, tweaked something and took one pill to sleep: the next day, wickkit-hard withdrawal symptoms again, finally looked up the effects i was experiencing and connected the dots.  What's happening here?  Am i now allergic, or what?</p></div>		</li>
