I can't imagine OP actually expects a ban to begin reducing the effects of a slow building illness to noticeably change in a few months to a significant degree. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to how I read an Entenmanns box (mind you this was in the 90s so not sure what it says today) and  the package clearly boasted it was fat free.  Reading the label it was full of fat.  But legally, fat was defined as a triglyceride and the ingredients included mono and di glycerides.  You don't have to be a math major to add that up. </p></div>		</li>
