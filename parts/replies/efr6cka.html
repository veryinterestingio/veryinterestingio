			<div class="markdown"><p>A permanent magnet has a magnetic field around it all the time. If you move a conductor, say a copper wire, through that field, you will feel some force resisting that motion. That's because the magnetic field is inducing an electric field (voltage) in the wire, pulling electric current through it.</p>
<p>The inverse is also true - if you induce an electric field in a wire, usually by holding a voltage across it, a magnetic field will be created. The electric field pulls the negatively-charged electrons through the wire, travelling towards the positively charged end, and as they travel a magnetic field is generated.</p>
<p>The key difference between the electric field (voltage) and magnetic field is this: an electric field can speed up a particle, giving it energy, but a magnetic field can only change its trajectory. Conveniently, faster particles are pushed harder by magnetic fields; they will actually follow the same curve regardless of speed. This is very handy for accelerators, because the particles naturally keep to the same path as they speed up. Permanent magnets don't add any energy to the particles so they don't need to be powered or controlled.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to illustrate is that there's no difference in the magnetic field created by an electromagnet and a permanent magnet, but the permanent magnet is much more ideal for the purposes of a particle accelerator. I also wanted to try and clarify the difference between electric and magnetic fields, and how they are intrinsically related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean why one is better than another at different beam energies, or just what the difference is between electric and magnetic fields?</p>
<p>Just considering statics, electric fields are sourced by electric charge, and magnetic fields are sourced by electric current.</p>
<p>To create some kind of electrostatic element for an accelerator, in practice you're just applying a static voltage to some pieces of metal.</p>
<p>To create magnetic element, you're running a current through some coils (could be superconducting or normal conducting).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A magnetic field is a magnetic field. Doesn't matter if it's made by electromagnet or permenant magnets, if that's what you mean.... But superconducting electromagnet can make much stronger magnetic fields than permenant magnets. </p></div>		</li>
