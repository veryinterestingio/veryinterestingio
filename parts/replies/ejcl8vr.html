Eventually he realized he had a problem and went to rehab for his addiction....which at the time they treated with morphine. So he then came out with a coke AND heroin problem and continued to teach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was hoping someone would mention this. An excerpt from <em>Why We Sleep</em> by Matthew Walker: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Halsted inserted his cocaine-infused wakefulness into the heart of John Hopkins's surgical program, imposing a similarly unrealistic mentality of sleeplessness upon his residents for the duration of their training. The exhausting residency program, which persists in one form or another throughout all US medical schools to this day, has left countless patients hurt or dead in its wake - and likely residents, too. That may sound like an unfair charge to level considering the wonderful, life-saving work our committed and caring young doctors and medical staff perform, but it's a provable one. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Walker goes on to provide some statistics:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Residents working a thirty-hour straight shift will commit 36 percent more serious medical errors, such as prescribing the wrong dose of a drug or leaving a surgical implement inside of a patient, compared to those working sixteen hours or less. Additionally, after a thirty-hour shift without sleep, residents make a whopping 460 percent more diagnostic mistakes in the intensive care unit than when well rested after enough sleep. Throughout the course of their residency, one in five medical residents will make a sleepless-related error that causes significant-liable harm to a patient. One in twenty residents will kill a patient due to lack of sleep. Since there are over 100,00 residents currently in training in US medical programs, this means many hundreds of people...are needlessly losing their lives every year because residents are not allowed to get the sleep they need. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He writes a little bit more about Halsted's coke habit,  and sleep and health care in general, but this is kind of the gist. The book overall is a really interesting and enlightening read. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've heard is that the counterpoint to all for this is that the changing over of staff causes more errors than a sleep deprived person...often due to incomplete or misinterpreting information when handing over a case to the next healthcare worker.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is true or not, but it's worth investigating.</p>
<p>So basically, my point is that you cannot simply compare one sleep deprived doctor to one not sleep deprived doctor.  But, you should be comparing one sleep deprived doctor to a case exchanging hands several times over several doctors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually it was William Halstead, the first head of surgery at Hopkins. There's a pretty interesting book about him called <em>Genius on the Edge</em>.</p>
<p>William Osler was the head of medicine there at the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>FYI: this type of training schedule was initially implemented by a guy who was a drug addict—amphetamines or cocaine, I forget which. So staying up for huge stretches of time was not strange for him. For people who are not drug addicts, it can be grueling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As others have said, it was cocaine. </p>
<p>You have to remember, 24 hour on-call shifts started more than a hundred years ago. The average hospital inpatient was a lot less sick back then, and they didn't have nearly as many treatments, lab tests or interventions they could do. That meant that when residents were on call they could actually get a decent amount of sleep, unlike today. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High jacking the top comment sorry. As a resident covering the ICU we would work 29hr shifts, start at 7a and get off the next day (hopefully) at noon after rounds. We would do this typical 5-6 shifts in a row, have a “day off” (so off at noon, off that night and the following day which was obviously spent sleeping) and right back to it. I did this for three month stretch once in residency. I once had to take a break one evening because I was hallucinatory tired, everything had a purple hue and I had to sit down in the hallway and have a microsleep. Was it safe? Absolutely not. How many egregious errors were made? Just one I’m aware of and that patient was going to die regardless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do a shift where once a week, we could work for 24 hours straight. At 3 or 4 am, I'm already shaking, itchy and very agitated. It's not because of the cold in the Operating Room but it's because I'm already at the verge of collapse. The only thing that stops me from doing so is my 5th cup of coffee that night. But alas, it has to be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once I hit fellowship I thought I was on easy street...Nopes. I tried to take the bus whenever possible (bc of a horrible parking shortage) and the regulars got accustomed to waking myself and a couple other up bc once we hit the seat we’d be out. I got so used to the ride I could tell where we were by the vibrations of the bus on the uneven pavement. </p>
<p>I loved my fellowship years, but I severely lacked sleep for 95% of my time there. I still worked a bunch of long years before bailing to private practice. Now if I work more than 50hr/wk it is rare. Basically court cases and crunch time before the holidays are the only exceptions. I gave up most of my 20s and 30s...it was time. I miss aspects of academic medicine, but i’m happier and healthier now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes you know based on how sick a patient is that they aren’t going to have much longer for the world.  It’s all based on your prior experience.  Sometimes that one patient surprises you, so that’s why you keep going.</p>
<p>However, docs definitely talk to each other about their expectations that patient so-and-so may not benefit from surgery after some traumatic event, or they might not benefit from this intervention.  They mention these things to families, too.  But sometimes families have a more optimistic worldview, while your colleagues have seen all the shit so they can relate.</p></div>		</li>
