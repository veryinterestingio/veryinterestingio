			<div class="markdown"><p>Your last statement is wrong. The wavelength of visible light spans ~400 - 700 nm and the average optical microscope has a resolution limit between 200-250 nm. Using a standard research microscope for single molecule fluorescence imaging we end up magnifying with pixels effectively 130 nm large. This means that the wavelength is now ~4x longer than the average pixel. In this limit I can very easily see individual molecules as <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/3mmdw1gLa3Zqgw4gQT" target="_blank">shown in this image</a>. </p>
<p>Your overall argument is not incorrect and is worth considering when designing a microscope, but you can magnify well beyond usability before you need to worry about spreading your light out too thin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry no, I took the image myself 2 weeks ago. This is an image of a HEK(Human Embryonic Kidney) cell that has been transfected with a surface marker and stained with a (bright) fluorescent dye. The image is of the live cell over a period of time (each frame is ~ 15ms) in hopes of being able to track the dye for several frames at a time. The entire file is 980 MB so it's a little tough to share. </p>
<p>edit: Total field of view is around 30x30 um and pixel size is around 130 nm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote only to respond to the claim that as you magnify you spread out your light over your pixels well before your pixels become smaller than light(paraphrase). Answering the original question is a little different. You can't see atoms the way you're thinking because of 2 reasons,</p>
<p>1) If OP had a scope that could view atoms, they'd be trying to measure the position of all the particles in the atoms at the same time, however atoms are (and are comprised of) wave-particles, and these particles are required to 'spread out' during normal use. If you think of an electron orbiting a nucleus, if it was a particle orbiting like a planet around the sun, it would send off light as it spun around and quite quickly would crash into the nucleus. Instead they form 'wave states' which exist as a probability around the nucleus. It is possible to measure and 'localize' this electron during it's orbit, but that measurement is one little part of a much larger whole, so any picture you take like this would be lying to you from the get go.</p>
<p>2) In principle we can do this. The resolution of a scope is related to the wavelength you want to see. This is why electron microscopy is so precise, electrons have very very short wavelengths and can thus achieve really small resolutions. However if you decrease the wavelength of light, you increase the energy of the light, and at some point you'll hit the ionizing energy level. Here when the light hits your atom, an electron will absorb the photon and be kicked off of its orbit. In order to see the electron it would have to 'bounce' the photon back to us, but it didn't, it just shot off and away forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can solve this by adding extra light. Under light-microscopes you usually have huge lightbulbs and focusing apertur to help light it up.
Telescopes have this issue i think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Telescopes definitely have this issue.  The reason that modern telescopes are big and barrel-shaped rather than the thinner spyglass style that everyone thinks of is precisely because the bigger design can capture more light.</p>
<p>It's common knowledge in the amature astronomy community that it's light that limits the amount of magnification you can use.  It's really easy to get some lenses that provide 500x zoom, but unless you've got a giant 16 inch aparture you're probably not going to be able to see much at that level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually work with microscopes that do just that. We can get resolutions on the order of a quarter the wavelength of the laser by using certain methods and sufficient illumination isn't an issue. The diffraction limit means it's physically impossible to do better. Worth noting though that there is a normal illumination mode without lasers and that achieves similar resolution, it's just that with lasers you can be extremely monochromatic and use things like linear polarization to enhance resolution along certain axes. </p></div>		</li>
