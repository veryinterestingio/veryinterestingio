			<div class="markdown"><p>The magnet sensor/compass chip described in this thread is very inaccurate because it is so small and packed in with other components that involve electromagnetic fields. It's an unfortunate fact that phones just don't prioritize an accurate compass, which especially sucks in my case because I frequently use apps like star charts. But you can calibrate pretty accurately if you swing your phone around in a figure-eight pattern at any time that the compass is in use. Also, stay a few feet away from metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was <em>very</em> tempted to violate the &quot;no jokes in top-level comments&quot; rule and answer &quot;very simple: it uses a highly advanced Hall effect sensor to measure the earth's magnetic field, and then points in a random direction&quot;.</p>
<p>I believe Keavon has given the correct and comprehensive serious answer.</p>
<p>If you only need a rough direction (e.g. to find out which street to follow at an intersection after emerging from a subway), and the sun is up, that's your best bet. In North America and Europe, the sun is in the east when it rises, in the southeast in the late morning, the in the south around noon, southwest in the afternoon, west in the evening. Roughly. Eyeballing it isn't precise, but good enough if you have a grid to follow, and more accurate/reliable than an uncalibrated phone compass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never understood how that helps.  I can't tell which way the sun is going since it's so slow (you know exactly what I mean, pedants).  So like let's say I'm facing a stop sign and the sun is up (obviously) and to the front right of me. </p>
<p>I still don't know which way the sun is going to go (down left?  Down?  Down right? Diagonally? Behind me?), so at that point I pretty much need to know which way is east to solve it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you're on the northern hemisphere (specifically, above the Tropic of Cancer/Northern Tropic), e.g. in Northern America or Europe. This removes some edge cases (the sun cannot be exactly above you, pass over your head, or be in the North, no matter what date it is).</p>
<p>First, ignore how high up the sun is. Look only at the direction. The easiest way to do that is looking at the direction of the shadows.</p>
<p>The sun always rises in the east. The sun always sets in the west. The sun always is in the south roughly at noon.</p>
<p>Let's say it's exactly 12:00 (noon), then the sun will be <em>exactly</em> in the south. The shadows will be pointing <em>exactly</em> north. Take a regular north-oriented map, and point it in the same direction the shadows are pointing, and voila, the map is now oriented exactly the same way as the real world. (I'm ignoring the fact that local solar time does not exactly match official local time, especially with daylight savings etc. - that's one of the reasons why this isn't precise.)</p>
<p>If it's 18:00 (6 pm) the sun should be exactly in the west. Let's say it's 15:00 (3 pm). That's &quot;halfway between noon and 6pm&quot;. That means the sun will be halfway between south and west: Southwest!</p>
<p>So if it's 15:00, and you see where the sun is - that's southwest! Face the sun! You're now facing southwest! Turn 45 degrees to your left - you're now facing south! Turn around - you're now facing north! Pull out your map!</p>
<p>So the steps are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Based on time, figure out <em>which direction</em> the sun currently is.</li>
<li>Look at the sun (or away from the sun, following the shadows), you're now facing the direction from step 1 (or the opposite direction if you faced away from it, obviously).</li>
<li>Given that you now know which direction you're facing, figure out where north is. If you're facing east, north is 90 degrees to your left etc.</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting: in the summer, the Sun actually rises in the <em>north</em>east and sets in the <em>north</em>west.</p>
<p>We're talking about northern hemisphere, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I said... roughly.</p>
<p>If you want precision, calculate the local solar time, then the precise angle based on that. 6am = east, 6pm = west if I'm not mistaken.</p></div>		</li>
