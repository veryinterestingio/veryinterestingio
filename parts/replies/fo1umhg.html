			<div class="markdown"><p>One of those major factors is amount of viral exposure (infectious dose).  </p>
<p>Also, the wide variation in asymptomatic people mirrors what we see with SARS-Cov2. If you test for active infection, you will see a smaller proportion of asymptomatic because they probably do not test positive for very long. If you test antibodies, you will get a much larger number. Some who show antibodies may never have tested positive, no matter when you tested them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's basically how some vaccines work. Your body is very smart and even small numbers of a pathogen are enough for your body to create antibodies in response to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not always. Sometimes a small viral load means that the body can take care of it the without antibodies, and if that happens you will not become immune. At least, that's what two doctors told me when I asked about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that a pcr assay would be more sensitive than the antibody assay - I doubt someone who was exposed with so little virus that it was undetectable would mount a detectable antibody response? Though the pcr is only as good as the swabbing which is variable.
I suspect anyone with detectable antibodies down the track would have had a detectable level of virus at some point, we likely just missed it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those detectable antibodies that are produced in the body are then sufficient to trigger the immune response to further antigen introduction. You're right that a low infectious dose could be missed early on but people are generally being tested when they're already fairly unwell.</p>
<p>Either that or I misunderestimated your post</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea you would think. I’m not sure what the sensitivity of the antibody test is, but at least for this SARS-CoV 2 the sensitivity of the PCR seems to be about 70%. So not amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, considering 11% of Swedish blood donors tested positive for the CV19 antibodies, meaning they had already been exposed and had immunity to the virus.  Blood donors are a self-selecting sample in that you can't donate blood if you have been ill recently, and the test used will not return positive until a minimum of 2 weeks after you have had exposure, as it takes a few weeks for your body to produce the antibodies.  This means that it is likely that the majority of these people were asymptomatic, as they felt well enough to go and give blood.  This lines up with the results of other studies we have had that have recorded at least some % of cases that are completely asymptomatic.</p>
<p>In Swedish, so you'll need to use a translator:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It worth mentioning, though, that SARS-cov-2 is not the only Coronavirus, and definitely not the most common. The most common ones, widespread, are those that cause the common cold.</p>
<p>And antibodies tests are not 100% certain to distinguish between antibodies of those different coronaviruses, increasing the odds that in any population tested more or less randomly, most of the detection for SARS-cov-2 infections would be false positieves.</p>
<p>It can be the case even if the antibody test is able to discriminate common cold coronaviruses and SARS-cov-2 most of the time. Just by virtue of being more common, common cold infections would account for most positives.</p>
<p>In Canada, once there was even a &quot;false alarm&quot; of a SARS outbreak, as SARS antibody tests reacted with common cold coronavirus antibodies, the real culprit of the condition affecting some elderly patients. Maybe aggravated by co-infection with something like the flu or rhinoviruses.</p>

<p>[...] Cases at a care facility were epidemiologically characterized and sequentially investigated for conventional agents of respiratory infection, SARS-CoV and other human CoVs. Serological cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and human CoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) was investigated by peptide spot assay. [...] These findings underscore the virulence of human CoV-OC43 in elderly populations and confirm that cross-reactivity to antibody against nucleocapsid proteins from these viruses must be considered when interpreting serological tests for SARS-CoV.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see the connection to covid, considering it's a novel virus and has a decently high lethality rate.</p>
<p>That would more point to the fact that it's at least for humans a new infection and hasn't had the time to adapt and become less deadly and sever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it from the point of view of natural selection. A strain of virus that spreads more effectively will be better at reproducing and will become more predominant.</p>
<p>A major way that respiratory viruses spread is by shedding into droplets when you cough and sneeze. In those cases, your symptoms really help the virus.</p>
<p>But there is evidence that this coronavirus can spread just in your breath, without coughing or sneezing. If that's the case, it may be that an asymptomatic virus actually spreads better, because the infected person will take fewer behavioral precautions. They'll still go the grocery store and whatnot.</p>
<p>But coronavirus still kills epithelial cells, so there are probably observable &quot;symptoms&quot; like irritation of the lining of the airways, but the infected person may not really notice/feel this, especially if they have asthma or hayfever or a chronic condition that often causes similar symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine that most respiratory illnesses can spread through regular breathing.  After all, coughing and sneezing just increases the volume of the exhaled air.  Regular breathing still carries droplets and whatnot, just less of it.  I like to imagine what it would look like if an infected person was exhaling smoke with every breath.  That person would fill a room with smoke pretty quickly, and it would be plain to see just how much their breath spreads by normal breathing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People forget that viruses are pretty much only “successful” if the host is asymptomatic for a good amount of time or the entire time they are infected. Or if symptoms are mild that the host continues to function normally to be unsure if you sick.</p></div>		</li>
