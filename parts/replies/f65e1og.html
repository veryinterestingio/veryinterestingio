<p>Rutile (TiO_2) is the most common ore. Carbon can steal the O away if there’s also Cl to distract the Ti, but then you have TiCl_2. Magnesium is most effective for snatching the chloride away to leave pure(r) titanium, but magnesium itself requires its own whole process to extract electrochemically in the first place.</p>
<p>So it’s like “water water everywhere, but not a drop to drink”.</p>
<p>But processes improve.</p></div>		</li>
