Cone cells function best in daylight and the different types of cone cells (short-wavelength, medium-wavelength, long-wavelength) absorb varying frequencies of light, which correlate to colors on the visible light spectrum. Rods on the other hand, work best in dark lighting and can not interpret the same light frequencies as cones, only differentiating between light and dark. So if a person is colorblind, they are lacking/have faulty cone cells, which is why they see black and white via rod cells. </p>
<p>The electromagnetic waves, or photons, that rods and cones are processing are those that the objectâ€™s particles do not absorb. Thus, those deflected frequencies of light are refracted to the retina to be absorbed and perceived as color.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The most common forms of colorblindness relate to abnormal cone cells, which doesn't result in black/white vision, but a decreased ability to differentiate between colors. Monochromatism, which is essentially black and white vision, is rare compared to other forms of colorblindness.</p></div>		</li>
