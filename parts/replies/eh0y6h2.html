<p>Good question. Vaccines not only vary in terms of their efficacy and effectiveness but also in terms of longevity of their response. While there is substantial variability within different classes of vaccines, generally live attenuated vaccines (i.e. vaccines with live organisms that have been modified to eliminate their disease potential) require fewer doses to produce a robust primary response. Moreover, these vaccines result in longer term immune memory compared to the so-called killed vaccines. Therefore, in general live vaccines require fewer doses and fewer boosters.</p>
<p>There’re several interesting developments in the world of vaccines. I’ll provide more detail in response to some of the subsequent questions but a brief list of things that particularly excite me include: maternal vaccines to protect moms and their babies, better adjuvants, better “platform” technologies to quickly develop vaccines against emerging threats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question: It's my understanding that the shingles vaccine only provides protection for a limited time, and that it can only be used once (which is why it is delayed until much later in life, when the incidence of shingles is highest). Why is that, and are there other vaccines with similar limitations and restrictions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you determine how long a vaccine protects for? Is it more like a “best by date” where it could still protect past the designated time, but just not to the same level? (As in, say a vaccine has a 60% chance of preventing illness but once it is time to get the vaccine renewed it could still protect like 30% of the time?)</p></div>		</li>
