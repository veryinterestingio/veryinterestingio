			<div class="markdown"><p>Very alive.   They have a whole kingdom.  There’s far more prokaryotic diversity than eukaryotic.  We are essentially just big colonies of bacteria that package our genome in a different way such that each cell is reliant on many others for survival while bacteria (and unicellular eukaryotes) don’t need others to exist and divide (although many bacteria can exchange plasmids which is very similar to sexual reproduction as it allows for beneficial traits to be shared with future generations.  Some bacteria can even suck up genetic material just lying around so if you have a pathogenic strep strain and a harmless strep strain and you kill the dangerous strep strain without destroying all the genetic material and then put the live harmless strep in media with the dead pathogenic strep some of that harmless strep will absorb the genetic material of the dead dangerous strep and possibly become pathogenic itself.  Bacteria are more alive than us in certain ways... like how rapidly they can evolve to survive in a specific niche... why do you think we’ve been losing to them for millennia... hell, we’ve had a ~100 year reprieve where we’ve had some effective weapons against them but they are rapidly beginning to pull ahead in that arms race.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how did the first virus evolve, and from what?  If it can't reproduce by itself, it had to have the capability to invade other cells right from the start. as there couldn't be a 'partially successful' ancestor virus that only partially invaded a cell and partially reproduced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is believed that the nucleic acid of viruses (DNA/RNA) evolved from the genes of normal cells. Then through mutation and evolution they became viruses. Some viruses stayed with their hosts and formed near symbiotic relationships. Once they moved to other species they mutated. </p>
<p>An example of this would be the measles virus that effects humans. It started as a different virus in animals and then mutated as measles in humans.</p>
