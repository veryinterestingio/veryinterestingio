			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. So when people go to military or boot-camp, does the military do a lot of conditioning to make soldiers drop that resistance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it also has something to do with the need to survive. Not getting a coffee probably isn’t going to ruin your life, but acting up and getting excluded from a group lowers your chance of survival, so that fear probably overrides the &quot;I don’t want to do it&quot; response eventually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s different there because you’ve signed up to the military knowing that you’ll have your entire life controlled by an authority figure. I know people who’ve wanted to join precisely so someone tells them what to do all the time.</p>
<p>When you in advance agree to being controlled, then when they control you they aren’t robbing you of your freedom in the same way - because you’ve agreed to them controlling you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No amount of military training will remove a persons need for autonomy. Its also age blind. If you're 2 or 82 you strongly desire autonomy.</p>
<p>The 82 year old from not wanting to be taken out of their home and into aged care facility and the 2 year old that wants control of their toy(that makes excessive noise). And it extends beyond that into just about every countries conflict you can imagine. Some other force crossing the border and attempting to remove control.</p></div>		</li>
