			<div class="markdown"><p>penmanship was also taught as a skill.  The beauty and quality of the handwriting was a thing that teachers evaluated you on.  I grew up in France and it was a big deal there - that your letters all fit the same height and proportions according to some standard method.  The ruled paper there has a fine grid within it that lets you know how high to write your letters and elements of the letters.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a teen, I picked up a few speeding fines. Had to pay a few quid a week at the main police station. This was before computers.</p>
<p>An old guy would write out the receipt in copperplate. Wish I'd kept some of them, his penmanship was immaculate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when everyone wrote in cursive legibility wasn't the important part.  It's mostly to keep from dripping ink and breaking nibs.  </p>
<p>You'd have to get used to peoples handwriting.  My brother is an historian and he goes to the British National Archives to read diplomatic correspondence.  He has to take pictures of it and then decipher it later.  He's shown me pictures of some of the letters people wrote.  I can't believe there weren't more wars started over how bad the penmanship was.</p></div>		</li>
