			<div class="markdown"><p>It's achievable, but not using only visible light. The total energy needs to exceed 1.022 MeV, so if you wanted to use two photons of equal energy, they must have at least 511 keV each, which are in the x-ray/gamma ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lasers can't do it because the energy per photon is too low, but we have observed this process in particle accelerators. Photons -&gt; electron+positron, photons -&gt; photons and photons -&gt; W bosons have been observed. Not sure about photons -&gt; muons, and there might be other channels I missed.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It's conceivable that something like XFEL could do it, though the process would likely be at least partly nonperturbative (a form of assisted Schwinger process, essentially).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>an electron has the same mass as a positron, 0.51099895000(15) MeV/c according to wikipedia. so you would need at least 1.022 MeV in photon energy to create a pair. the highest energy photons ever detected had energies above 100TeV (cosmic gamma rays) so it would absolutely be possible. but there are no known laser sources for photons with anywhere near this energy. (though there might be naturally occurring lasers with enough energy somewhere in the universe).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this is not the same as antiparticle annihilation, right? I know photons don’t interact with one another much, but can they annihilate like that if they do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how you define &quot;annihilation&quot;. That term is usually used to refer to exothermic processes where a massive particle/antiparticle pair is destroyed and only lighter particles exist in the final state.</p>
<p>If you take that definition, then massless particles can't really &quot;annihilate&quot;.</p>
<p>But if by &quot;annihilation&quot; you just mean &quot;the particles in the initial state cease to exist and different particles are produced&quot;, then it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If photons <em>could</em> undergo particle-antiparticle annihilation just like fermions, wouldn't it just look identical to the standard explanation of pair production anyways? </p>
<p>If two nearby photons with sufficient energy &quot;disappear&quot; and an electron-positron pair then &quot;appears&quot;, what exactly happened? Did the two photons annihilate like matter and antimatter, producing a particle pair? Or did they just spontaneously become a particle pair in the same way a single photon can? </p>
<p>Both processes seem functionality equivalent to me. To tell the difference, we'd need a much better understanding of <em>exactly</em> what is happening when those two photons &quot;disappear&quot; in the first place, no? That is, if photons actually did annihilate in this matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They annihilate exactly like that, but they need to be high enough energy to support creating the electron positron pair. It's the exact reverse of the electron positron annihilation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the reaction can happen in one frame, it can happen in all frames. Whether or not it happens can't depend on the frame of reference.</p>
<p>But since this reaction is endothermic, there's a threshold energy below which it can't possibly occur. And that threshold energy is different in different frames. It's easiest to conceptualize what it has to be in a reference frame where the total momentum is zero, because then it just has to be enough to produce the masses of the particles in the final state.</p></div>		</li>
