			<div class="markdown"><p>Hazed plastic has lost its original smooth surface due to chemicals eating away at it, or due to sand grains bouncing against it and scratching it. When the hazed plastic surface is wet, the water surface creates a smoother surface than the plastic.</p>
<p>Despite differences in the way that plastic and water bend light, overall this causes light to travel in straighter lines compared to hazed plastic alone. Straighter lines of travel means that light bouncing off objects in the car (or coming from the headlight) reach your eyes directly, making the window (or headlight) look more transparent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a substantial factor in deep water. Water only weakly absorbs in the visible range, but given enough water you're right that most of the light is eventually absorbed.</p></div>		</li>
