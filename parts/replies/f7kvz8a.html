			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for sure right but hydrogen is sometimes a single proton or a proton+neutron so you wouldn't need the positron to make an antihydrogen. Just a guess</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the first time we've actively measured a positron that we created specifically for that purpose. Technically we've been &quot;creating&quot; positrons for as long as there have been humans, considering the possibility of an electron-positron pair popping into existence inside of a human body.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We've been creating positrons since we have nuclear power I think? In any case the positron was first observed in the 1920s and formally discovered in 1932. </p>
<p>Fun fact, it was formally discovered only one year after the neutron (one of the three ingredients of regular atoms)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Positrons are emitted in a number of nuclear reactions but those are generally considered natural production. For example when you take a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan you are injected with a radioactive isotope that emits positrons. It wasn't until 2008 that we were able to successfully mass produce positrons in a lab setting without the use of radioactive materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR version of PET :</p>
<p>It's a medical imaging technique. They inject you with a liquid that will naturally emit positrons (antimatter). The liquid will accumulate in active areas of your body. The positrons will interact with your body and create gamma rays, which the doctors can detect from outside.  That way, doctors know which areas of your body the liquid went in, and thus know if some organs are too active or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I nerded out so hard when I first learned what a PET scan was. It's straight out of science fiction. It literally images your body using antimatter explosions. A positron and electron annihilate each other and launch a pair of high energy photons in exactly opposite directions. When the machine detects two photons hitting opposite walls at the same time it knows it's a result of an antimatter annihilation and can use that data to build a picture of your insides.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, it's worth emphasizing that antimatter isn't just made artificially, either -- it is produced naturally through radioactive decay (albeit in much smaller quantities than matter). At least in the case of positrons.</p></div>		</li>
