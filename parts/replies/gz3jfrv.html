			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add: there are over 14,000 possible extraterrestrial atmospheric biosignatures (that we have identified). The top few candidates are Oxygen, CO2, Methane, Phosphenes, and Sulfides. Any of these being detected in a planets atmosphere, particularly in combinations, is a strong indication of potential biological activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stupid question incoming. So does Mars contain oxygen and other biosignatures we're looking for? I've always wondered why we've settled on Mars as the planet to research and potentially live on in the future. We obviously can't breath on Mars, Total Recall taught me that.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for these replies everyone, great info, much appreciated!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the biggest reason is proximity.  We've been to the moon (really!), Venus is too hot, and Mars is the next closest <em>and</em> it's solid. The next 4 planets are all gasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's the (second) closest to earth, day length (25h), and year length (less than 2 years I think) are similar, and it's colder rather than hotter (its a lot easier to make planets hotter than colder).</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for all the comments and corrections, I was wrong about the gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding as to why we've chosen it as the place to start thinking about living in the future is that it's basically the only planet that's remotely livable in our solar system.</p>
<p>Mercury is way too hot</p>
<p>Venus's atmosphere is poisonous as hell AND it's way too hot</p>
<p>Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune's solid surfaces are so far down inside their atmospheres that's you'd be crushed by the weight of the atmosphere before you got down there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon is actually fairly rare on earth despite being the basis of life, and oxygen. phosphorus, and sulfur are all very reactive elements. These can all be produced by inorganic processes but break down just as quickly. On earth large concentrations of these gases indicate that biological processes are liberating those elements from rocks faster than they're being returned there. It does assume life similar to on Earth, but these are very simple molecules, which has fewer assumptions than looking for something like DNA</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure there is some theoretical chemistry for what silicon based lifeforms might emit, but the fact is the primary elements/chemicals found in Earth lifeforms aren't just used because they are what we find on Earth, they are simply some of the most reactive and have the most possible combinations. Therefore it is most likely for life to evolve in a similar manner on another planet. If they did use some other base form of chemistry, the lack of possible combinations and difficulty forming or breaking bonds limits the number of changes/mutations the lifeform experiences, so the rate of evolution would likely be orders of magnitude slower and unlikely to evolve past very very primitive forms of life in between cataclysmic cosmic events such as meteors, rogue planets, and dying stars. If they did happen to form, given enough time, a carbon based oxygen utilizing organism would eventually evolve and outcompete it just because oxygen and carbon are just better in terms of their chemistry.</p>
<p>In the end, the two most likely forms of complex life of for us to come across are either going to be carbon based, probably using oxygen, or AI that came about from other carbon based life forms. If AI is ever able to reproduce itself entirely, it might as well be considered alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atmospheric Spectroscopy. They take a picture and measure the values of every wavelength of light in the picture - some wavelengths will be missing, indicating the existence of an element or compound that absorbs those specific wavelengths. Search youtube for a video bout it, the stuff is super cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually there's high possibility for planets to have almost pure high pressure oxygen atmosphere and no life at all. Rocky planets around red dwarf stars (especially smaller ones, especially in the warmer region of habitable zones) may have 90+% totally abiotic oxygen atmopheres.</p>
<p>Long story short, small star have very very long life and very very long infancy. Every freshly born baby star is much brighter than the stable stable self. Big stars like our Sun (our Sun is pretty big as stars go, it's heavier than 9 out of 10 stars out there) have short childhood of ten million years or so. But small stars could have up to billion years childhood.</p>
<p>At the same time planets around stars form in few tens millions of years. So while at G-dwafs (that's the class of stars our Sun belongs) they finish forming when the star itself is a young adult with stable brightness, at K and M dwarfs (the classes of consecutively smaller stars) the planets are formed when their stars are still babies. And baby stars shine birighly, often 7 times brighter than their later adult forms. That's because the cloud of gas the star forms from is not fully settled yet and has a lot of thermal energy from falling in (when gas falls in gravity it's gravitational potential energy is turned into heat).</p>
<p>Brighter stars heat their planets more. 7× brighter star heats her children planets 7× more. The planets may have water and water when turned into steam is a very potent greenhouse gas (much stronger than CO2). 7× brighter stars would make a planet without greenhouse effect about 1.6× hotter (counting heat from absolute zero, so say 250K planet would turn into 400K planet; converting to everyday temperature scales this is from -23°C to 127°C or -10F to 260F). But there's water and at the higher temperature all the surface water would start boiling filling the atmosphere with over 2 bars (200kPa, 30psi) of water vapor. Think is a super potent greenhouse stuff. The temperature would raise by hunders of degrees boiling even more water, increasing greenhouse effect even more and so on. The planet's become hot so all the water they have becomes steam (the water is completely boiled). The surface temperature would be well above 1000 degree by now (worse than Venus) and the atmospheric pressure would be huge and it w would be made of water vapor with small amount of different stuff. </p>
<p>Now the baby star produces a lot of UV and quite some X radiation. This ionizing radiation has the effect of breaking water into its constituents oxygen and hydrogen. Star irradiation and its solar wind acting on a Earth like planet would blow away much lighter hydrogen but planets gravity would hold onto the oxygen. Over millions of years the surplus chemically aggressive oxygen would react the all the available metals. All the while all the atmospheric water would be destroyed and hydrogen blown away eventually ending run away greenhouse.</p>
<p>Now there are two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Oxygen consumption processes are fast enough to eat it all. The planet turns into a desert planet, totally dry with a pretty thin atmosphere of whatever is there (nitrogen and likely CO2). It's still hot (especially with CO2) until the star stabilizes and settles on it's normal young adult brightness. It will then become cooler, how much depends on CO2 partial pressure in it's atmosphere. With no liquids it's now dull dry desert world, hot in deep valleys which would be under ocean if all the water weren't gone and cooler mountain. </li>
<li>Initially water reach worlds would produce so much oxygen that it would consume everything available and have nothing more to react with. Halted plate tectonics because of cooking of all the water (water is a lubrication for plate tectonics) would quite likely reduce geological sinks to be much slower than on the Earth, and even on the Earth with its active plate tectonics it would take tens of millions of years to take the oxygen away into mantle. And such planets would have hundreds times more oxygen. It would stay for billions of years. The planets would end up warm (how would depend on CO2 content and general atmosphere thickness) dry deserts covered with thick blanket of oxygen. </li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, If the star were relatively large and the planet was towards the colder end of habitable zone and it initially had good amount of water, it wouldn't cook all the water away. The planet would retain ocean. But it would be still covered with rather thick oxygen blanket. And here we come to another issue with oxygen. It consumes organics like mad. The prebiotic soup is long gone. The oxygen destroys any life before it forms. Mind you on the Earth it was likely the biggest extinction event when cyanobacteria produced enough oxygen to saturate all the sinks. Oxygen was a deadly poison and life clung by places happening to be oxygen poor until it didn't evolve enough oxygen resistance. On planets saturated by oxygen before any life forms all the life building materials would be consumed in no time.</p>
<p>For that reason oxygen by itself is not considered a reliable biomarker. What we want to look for is some out of equilibrium configuration, like a lot of oxygen but also quite a bit of detectable methane (this is how the Earth would look like, with the added bit of water vapor, for far away observers equipped with sensitive enough spectrometers). Or hundreds of combinations of other stuff way out of chemical equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>
