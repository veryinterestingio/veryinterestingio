			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true, but I'm not sure that answers the question fully. If you test negative because your viral load is too low, are you contagious (assuming you are already infected)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contagiousness isn't a binary state, it's a distribution of probability. Getting infected is also a distribution of probability based on the viral dose you get.</p>
<p>You can check <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1491/5912603" target="_blank">here</a> a graph on how viral loads (via Ct values) translates to infectious potential.</p>
<p>The minimum infective dose has not yet been established for SARS-CoV-2, so for now we can't put a number on the lower range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question, why does the distinction matter?  It seems the relevant point is &quot;You can test negative but still be contagious&quot; - I don't see why it would matter whether it was because of low viral load or test error, the result is that same.</p>
<p>Even if it is because your viral load is too low at the time you take the test, it would likely be much higher by the time you get the test result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my worry with the UKs current plan to test schoolkids every day instead of quarantining when they've been in close contact with a positive case. They'll test negative in the morning, be contagious by the afternoon, spread it to others, then test positive the next day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, for one thing the distinction matters in evaluating a test.</p>
<p>There is a difference between &quot;this test is only X% accurate&quot; and &quot;we are testing people that don't have a measurable virus load&quot;.</p>
<p>And then there is a big difference on the conclusions you can draw from a test.</p>
<p>If you test someone 3 days after a suspected exposure you know that a negative test isn't going to be very reliable because the virus load would be very low even if the person is infected. And in this case, you're right, the distinction isn't terribly relevant.</p>
<p>If you test someone after 10 days and the test comes back negative and you know your test is reliable you can be pretty sure that the person is actually negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP isn't asking if it's possible for a human to make an error and mislabel something. We all know that can happen. They want to know if you can get a true negative result from a test but still be contagious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind the PCR test was never designed for testing asymptomatic people.  The creator of it mentioned this, and some scientists have called for a retraction of the original Covid PCR paper which wasn't properly peer reviewed.  </p>
<p>It's better than nothing, but we really don't have a gold standard here.  </p>
<p>So yes, there's no guarantees no matter what results the test gives.  There's just probabilities, and even those aren't certain given different labs, volumes, number of cycles, exact timing of infection, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like it's important to add that, while false negatives and false positives are always a possibility, the accuracy and dependability of the tests that are being used is really good (even for so called 'quick-tests'). Although everything u/IntrepidBullfrog has said is true, it should be interpeted as an argument to stay safe and adhere to Covid measures, even if you've been tested negative. It mustn't be interpreted as an argument for the irreliability</p>
<p>The fact that no measure is 100% effective or reliable, isn't an excuse to behave like idiots.</p></div>		</li>
