			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much all the other answers on this thread are wrong. Well, not wrong, but misleadingly incomplete. The majority of the money spent by Wikipedia isn't on running servers, it's on open-access advocacy. Personally, I think this is a good cause, but it's very much discretionary spending - Wikipedia doesn't need donations to keep the servers going, it wants donations to help further its cause of making information available to an ever wider audience.</p></div>		</li>
