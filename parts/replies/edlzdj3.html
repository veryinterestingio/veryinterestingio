			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes the highest cirrus clouds (the wispy high ones) are frozen- you can often tell for sure when they are made of ice particles instead of liquid- this is the condition when you can get sun dogs, those little slivers of rainbow in the cirrus clouds like little parenthesis on either side of the sun.  With just the right conditions of frozen cirrus cloud cover, there are many more high-atmosphere visible phenomena that are really impressive to see in a set of arcs around the sun. Can’t remember what they’re all called- perihelion, corona... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are still different clouds, each with their own properties. When it comes to weather reports for aviation they can be divided into roughly 12 types. </p>
<p>Each type has its own properties such as what kind of precipitation can come from.them, the characteristics, etc.</p>
<p>I was a weather observer for a while so learned the types, how to identify them, and estimate the height, I was usually within a few hundred feet with my estimation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clouds are generally categorized in how high above sea level they are and how they spread (vertical or horizontal)</p>
<p>In addition to those you have thunderclouds, which are just massive.</p></div>		</li>
