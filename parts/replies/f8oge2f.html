			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get more performance even by under volting, at least on laptops. The reason I think, is because laptop have a very low thermal and power limit, so while the cpu might get less performance at normal load, it can maintain that unthrottled performance for longer.</p>
<p>Right ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Modern CPUs can increase their clock speed above the base clock unless they get too hot for it, which is useful for tasks which require a short burst of power, like rendering a website. Undervolting allows them to maintain a higher clock for longer. For the same reason, it's worth keeping the cooling system of laptops clean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes perfect sense. I undervolted my Thinkpad and saw performance gains in Cinebench ect and no downside in daily use or Adobe apps, but it occasionally crashed while gaming. If put the voltage back to stock the crashes stop. Like you said it seems to be good for short bursts of power but not sustained usage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Undervolting itself doesn’t affect clockrates, but reduces the base voltage needed for the CPU, reducing the chance of thermal throttling. But that shouldn’t change battery life/cooling as we are not voltage throttling. </p>
<p>If that’s what you mean by underclocked by default</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup yup yup!</p>
<p>The tldr or maybe eli5 version of this post is: they do overclock their own chips, but only the best ones. The chips that turned out best get the highest speeds and most cores. The other ones are limited to make sure flaws don't affect reliability.</p></div>		</li>
