<p>oblate spheroid to be precise. I don't know what the difference is ðŸ˜€, other than the oblate spheroid is type of ellipsoid</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, like you said, ellipsoid is the generic term, and &quot;oblate spheroid&quot; is a specific kind.</p>
<p>The way we classify ellipsoids is kind of like triangles, but instead of asking &quot;how many sides have the same length&quot;, we look at the symmetry axes.</p>
<ul>
<li>If all three axes are the same length, then it's a sphere.</li>
<li>If two axes are the same, then it's a spheroid. There's two subtypes:
<ul>
<li>Oblate: the third axis is shorter than the other two. Think Skittles.</li>
<li>Prolate: the third axis is longer than the other two. Think footballs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If all three axes are different, then it's &quot;tri-axial&quot;.</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

<p>The globe is technically inaccurate</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware, at the size that globes are, even if they were shaped perfectly it would be undetectable without extremely precise measurement tools. It's never something you'd be able to tell with the naked eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When using handheld GPS devices (not the kind on your phone), you have to pick a datum based on your local area.  For example, the shape of the earth under Hawaii is different than under Inuvik.  As someone already mentioned, the differences are pretty small, but if you're mapping a local area, for the best precision you're going to select a local datum.  There are also issues with satellite orbits and timing differences, but the technology is still vastly superior to what it used to be.</p></div>		</li>
