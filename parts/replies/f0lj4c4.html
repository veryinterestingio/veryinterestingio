			<div class="markdown"><p>Margalit &amp; Metzger (2017) used the LIGO binary neutron star merger to place a maximum mass constraint of \~2.17 solar masses (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05938" target="_blank"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05938" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05938</a></a>). As we observe more massive neutron stars, we’ll get a better sense of the population’s mass distribution. In some sense, we’ve already experienced what you’re describing — for a long time, we didn’t expect to find neutron stars more massive than \~2 solar masses! Observations certainly changed that thinking (see Demorest et al. 2010 and Antoniadis et al. 2013). Re-reading your question, I wonder if you're asking about the existence of an &quot;inaccessible&quot; realm of really high-mass neutron stars that we just can't observe for whatever reason; I don't foresee that being a problem, because we're already getting close via observations to the theoretical maximum.</p>
<p>Oh wow! That’s super cool. Hmm… this definitely isn’t my forte… what has your university used them for in the past? What are they capable of?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your reply! That's super cool, it's quite a bit outside my field but I'll take a look at that paper. Yeah, that was my question - is there an inaccessible region of masses. I thought it would be technically cool if that was an actual problem!</p>
<p>I just started a postdoc at a new university - my old university had cubesats that I worked on that tested a plasma thruster, and some new attitude control algorithms. My new university had a cubesat that was testing precision geodesy stuff, but that was a while ago. I've attracted a large group of capable students that want to start a new project, and I'm sure we can do a lot of interesting attitude control algorithm tests, but it'd be cool to collaborate with someone that has an instrument that they want shot up into space. /u/notadoctor123's space launch project - you complete it, we yeet it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't get over how funny &quot;you complete it, we yeet it&quot; is — it's perfect. Lemme think about the cubesat question; it's something I haven't put a lot of thought into. Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm waiting for <em>yeet</em> to show up in a peer-reviewed paper. This is at least the second science-based conversation where I've seen it used on Reddit.</p>
