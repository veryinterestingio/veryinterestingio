			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello!  As I am part of the team responsible for researching new crops on the ground to be applied in space flight, the plant that I found to interestingly  not do as well in flight than it did the ground was a  cabbage called Tokyo Bekana.  Also, while screening some peppers a variety that grew very large and tall (too large for current plant growth hardware VEGGIE and Advanced Plant Habitat, APH), dwarfed itself and  became a manageable size when grown in APH analog hardware. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure!  We have tested peas which would be a good source of other vitamins like thiamine.  We are starting to work on herbs that could be mixed in with the packaged diet.  I think things like basil, dill, mint, etc. would be really nice.  Astronauts seem to like strong flavors, so crops like the wasabi mustard we grew earlier this year might be very good.  With the fluid shift astronauts experience some have said it is like having a head cold, with flavors and odors muted.  They like the strong flavors and the odors of plants, so herbs will likely be very appealing!  </p>
