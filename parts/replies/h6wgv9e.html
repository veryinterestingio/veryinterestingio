			<div class="markdown"><p>The lower density should also impact a swimmer's speed.  A swimmer moves forward by pushing against the water.  If the water was replaced with a lower density fluid, it would offer less resistance against that push resulting in a lower velocity.  This effect should be slightly mitigated by a decrease in resistance of ethanol vs. water, but (admittedly without doing the math), I think the net result would be a decrease in velocity for the swimmer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The decreased resistance of both the legs/arms pushing and the reduced drag would cancel out. There was an experiment done with a pool full of fluid much thicker than water, and swimmers went about the same speed.</p>
