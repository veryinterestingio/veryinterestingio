			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting I do have a BS in pharmaceutical Sciences but considering these are made of sugars and linked through ethers I would think they would only like to dipole-dipole/hydrogen bond with already polar molecules. I'm trying to imagine a sugar formation that would allow a hydrophobic center. Do you know how they manage that? Cause it would make sense that they would act more like a detergent </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes a surfactant or detergent forming micelles is a good comparison. The difference is that Cyclodextrin complexes tend to be 1:1 or 2:1 complexes functioning at the molecular level so there is no critical micelle concentration you have to achieve to have some effect. </p>
<p>It’s basically a ring made up of a bunch of glucose units. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cyclodextrin doesn't break down very fast and whether or not the smells so would completely depend on the individual smells so I can't say. More than likely the smell would slowly be released, but at a concentration you can't detect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Odors are made up of volatile short fatty acids, often a byproduct of oxidation (breaking up longer fatty acids). If they're trapped in a sugar ring there's nothing preventing further oxidation and thus neutralization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that: when the Cyclodextrins attract the volatiles, the overall molecular weight increases, and hypothetically it is not suspended anymore.
I just always assumed that was more logical than actual neutralization but perhaps I'm incorrect </p></div>		</li>
