<p>To extend the metaphor, stimulants don't help attention in people without ADHD because they already have a great traffic cop. At a certain point, traffic can't move more smoothly than it already is, and neurotypical people are more or less at that point by default.</p>
<p>(When people without ADHD take stimulants, studies have shown that they don't actually experience improved attention. They just don't get tired as easily, which <em>feels</em> like they have more attention because you can sustain work for longer.)</p></div>		</li>
