			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, as I understand it people who suffer from visual snow have a neurological condition that exacerbates their natural noise, and it comes combined with other visual distortions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had visual snow for some years and it kind of just came out of nowhere. Honestly after having it for long enough I just got used to it, it doesnt even really bother me anymore it's just how I see. Interestingly enough I seem to notice it more if I am having anxiety issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had it many years, while the snow itself isn’t harmful it often goes hand in hand with other weirdness like derealisation and brain fog. Headaches are a thing too, normal painkillers don’t touch them but CBD works!</p>
<p>The trippiest thing is that chessboard or stripe patterns make my vision go apeshit with geometric patterns and vibrating shapes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge visual snow is not related to after images or even retinal in nature.  Most consider it to be a cortical issue causing the “snow”.  Source: I’m an optometrist</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid I would stare at the sun for what felt like hours during road trips with the family. I remember that after a few minutes it would get like a blue swirly outline and after several minutes it would just be this most surreal looking circle. I've always wanted to stare again but I'm sure kid eyes are more likely to heal. Anyway, how much damage could I have? I have bad eye sight but with glasses it's fine.</p></div>		</li>
