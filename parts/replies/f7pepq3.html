			<div class="markdown"><p>As an ex opiate addict I can confirm this theory. I work construction and smash my fingers way more than I'd like to admit. When I was high all the time, that shit hurt, but typically I could work through it. Now that I'm not on opiates anymore,  smash my thumb and i have to take some time and let that pain subside a bit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But yeah you're past the 'worst' part, buddy. Congrats! That's something to be proud of. Keep on staying strong!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who places a lot of these, I can tell you the patients who take something beforehand tend to tolerate the procedure better than those who donâ€™t. </p>
<p>Not always, and certainly itâ€™s anecdotal (could just be coincidental) but... better than nothing. And those few minutes of <em>holy funk</em> pain is still generally better than the agony of unintended pregnancy, labor, childrearing, etc... ðŸ˜¬</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once I was so drugged up in the Army, I was walking around with a gash on my head after hitting my head in the storage lockers. People in my platoon saw me and told me to see the doc because it was wide open and needed stitches. I didn't believe them, it felt like a little scratch until I looked in the mirror...</p></div>		</li>
