			<div class="markdown"><p>Growing up, my mum would always try as hard as possible to have my siblings and me seen by one particular doctor because his answer to most things would be &quot;I don't really know, I'll look it up.&quot; He'd pull out a huge book, reference the index a few times and come up with something. </p>
<p>It kind of taught me that remembering lots of things is really not much better than a parlour trick in most circumstances,. Admitting that you're not sure and taking steps to arrive at the correct answer ensure that you don't make huge mistakes in an effort to be &quot;right.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an aside, memory as a parlor trick is great and super well received.</p>
<p>It scores a lot of points with bosses when they start to ramble and then suddenly stop and say &quot;wait, what was the question&quot; or &quot;what were we talking about again&quot;, and you do a mini recap of the conversation and what kicked it off.</p>
<p>Also works pretty well as just a social trick to be able to recap conversation or reference a random thing they said earlier in the conversation. It always gets a lot of smiles.</p>
<p>So I get why people like when others can rattle things off without looking them up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is definitely a good balance to be struck here. More knowledge and committing facts to memory is always a beneficial step, but also being 100% sure of something very complicated or subject to change is not a good idea. In healthcare, there are a few scenarios that are so complicated and the approaches to management are so subject to change that we have to call in the events to certain agencies that specialize in these cases while we are managing them. </p>
<p>But in science in general I think the key is realizing that for the overwhelming amount of knowledge we have about the human body, there are so many things that we just don't know. One of my favorites here is &quot;what's going on in my brain when XYZ happens?&quot;.  Yeah it's pretty damn difficult for anyone to answer these questions well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's like there's some fantasy, archetypal self-help guru that everyone rags on to juxtapose how trustworthy THEY are, by comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I don't know everything but basically what happens is that when you get a massage the masseuse uses pressure to push tiny, magic, invisible mice into your body. </p>
<p>These mice run around inside your body and when they find a 'knot' they start giving it a massage by pushing even smaller magic invisible mice into the muscle fibres. These mice then massage the fibres causing them to relax.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the first set of mice are often alcoholics and while running around will get lost and massage the wrong muscle fibres. The second set of mice upon seeing relaxed muscle fibres get incensed that basically their time has been wasted and so start drinking heavily leaving empty bottles and cans everywhere. This can cause you to tense up in places which were relaxed before the massage.</p>
<p>Anyway that's an explanation, I'm not sure of all or any of the details but I think it's accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always taught that the second stage isn't mice, it's tiny little midget clowns</p>
<p>It's not just that they're tiny, so then <em>ergo</em> they're midgets - the clowns are small even for what you'd expect a scaled-down clown released by tiny mice to be.  So, on the micro level, taking into account the normal micro clown scale, they're still midgets.</p>
<p>But yeah, they do get incensed and typically they do drink heavily.  Because of certain laws about what can be packed in, they're primarily leaving cans.  Bottles are fairly rare.  </p>
<p>I hope this helps</p></div>		</li>
