			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be closer to the top, thank you for mentioning the inverse square law. Everyone else is talking about how unlikely it would be to actually hit something in space or the fact that everything gives off detectable radiation, but I don’t think these are in the spirit of OP’s question. This is the best answer IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also possible that there are objects moving toward us at near the speed of light and we'd be obliterated before we had time to even see what hit us.  </p>
<p>Could even be something huge.  If a whole galaxy is moving (relative to some objective point) at half the speed of light, and the Milky Way is also moving half the speed of light (relative to that same point), and the two galaxies are on a collision course, then it's the same as being hit by something moving almost as fast as light.</p>
<p>Both things are well lit.  Carrying their own light even.  But they can never see each other until they collide (or pass each other).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very counterintuitive, but that's not actually how it works. The speed of light is constant for everyone. So if I'm moving towards you at half the speed of light, and I shine a flashlight at you, from my point of view the light leaves my flashlight at the speed of light and from your point of view it moves towards you also at the speed of light. And if there is a third person moving towards you at half the speed of light from the other side we both see the light from his flashlight moving at exactly the speed of light. This is due to time dilation and length contraction from Einstein's Relativity.</p>
<p>So you can see anything that emits light no matter how fast it's moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last part is actually untrue from a physics perspective. A car doing 30 MPH hits a car doing 30 MPH head on, they both suffer only 30 MPH damage. Because for every action is an equal and opposite reaction, and half the force of impact projects forward while half backward for each vehicle.</p>
<p>Edit: Though at relativistic speeds in deep space, I can't imagine it would much matter.</p>
<p>Edit to the Edit: I may not have explained it right, because honestly I didn't know this either until Mythbusters showed me.</p></div>		</li>
