			<div class="markdown"><p>It appears the question already assumed what you just described. And I agree with what OP seems to point out: more specific and/or stronger reaction does not explain why the duration of immunity would be longer... At least not to the point of it being obvious to naive people like the OP or myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you prime the innate immune system?
Its not like its going to change the structure of complement.
You aren't going to change macrophages or dendritic cells or neutrophils.
So what is being &quot;primed&quot;?</p>
<p>Introducing an antigen does illicit a response from the adaptive immune system.  I don't see how the innate immune system is involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The innate immune system is tightly regulated by many different pathways. You can modulate the response by stimulating these messenger pathways in certain ways.</p>
<p>The innate system is also key in starting/modulating the initial response of the adaptive system. The 2 are deeply intertwined. For example, dendritic cells are part of the innate system, but they are (among the) ones that present the antigens to the adaptive system. And they don't just present the antigen, they also modulate the activation of the adaptive system. That can be primed to be in a certain way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It finds an antigen and presents it.  Is that what you mean?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immune cells need to be stimulated into the proper phenotype (ie provided a danger signal) otherwise they won’t have a strong reaction to a foreign antigen. This is priming and why adjuvants are combined with vaccines. Normal  infections are filled with danger signals— for example there are several mechanisms by which cells can detect foreign nucleic acids, and others by which cells can detect bacterial components like flagella.</p></div>		</li>
