<p>One of my goats just had kids. She abandoned them. My Anatolian Shepherd Livestock guardian cleaned the kids and stayed closed to them out in the woods until we took the kids in the house. The dog guards everyone in the herd, but she is very sensitive to kids. She even cleans up the fluids and membranes when the kids are born. It's a tasty snack and to get rid of the scent so predators don't notice newborns are around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And that's awesome on the dog's part. Strange how they view a different species from them as needing protection, yet will lick and eat the fluids and membranes and all that  and probably enjoys it, like you said, it's a tasty snack. It seems like such a huge contradiction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dogs do this to after puppies are born as well. It's not contradictory at all. Mothers will do it to regain nutrition and to eliminate a major scent source that signifies vulnerable young to predators. That's also why they'll eat the feces of young puppies. The smell of milk and food that isn't fully digested lets predators know that young puppies are around and, because it's not fully digested by the puppy's underdeveloped digestive system, they do get some nutrition from it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One was too weak, unforunately it died this morning. The other was too slow to stand. The weak one was having what looked like... for the lack of a better word...seziures. the goat was also a first time mother, and not a particularly good goat to begin with, skiddish, and won't load into a trailer. We won't be breeding her again, curry is probably on the menu, a fate reserved for culls.</p></div>		</li>
