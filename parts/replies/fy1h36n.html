			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, absolutely. The Mediterranean, for example, has relatively high salinity as it is largely separated from the rest of the Atlantic and sees hot, dry weather regularly.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bodies_of_water_by_salinity" target="_blank">This link</a> provides a helpful list of water bodies by salinity (the reference appears good, please let me know if a better source is needed).</p>
<p>Notice that the ocean averages 35‰ whilst the Mediterranean is about 38‰ and the rainy Baltic where many rivers empty only about 10‰.</p>
<p>The Arctic Ocean, too, is often more saline than average as freezing ice squeezes out most of its salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At what salt level is salt water considered potable (i.e.: support human or crop life indefinitely)? </p>
<p>If I read it correctly, those extreme reaches of the Baltic seem to be 0.3% salt. Would that be potable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha! That is awesome. I have been to two of the ponds in Antarctica and they are definitely salty. They are also so incredibly stratified that they can be frozen on the top, and sometimes 70 degrees F towards the bottom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to read about a interesting (and kinda creepy) body of water read up on the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Essentially because of water stratification nothing can live below about 90 meters because there is no oxygen in the water. This has led to some amazingly well preserved ancient shipwrecks most notably one for ancient Greece dated around 400 BC.</p>
<p>The stratification is cause because there is a net influx of fresh waters from the major rivers (Danube, etc) this cause a surface level outflow through the bosporus or less saline water, but through the bosporus there is a heavily saline lower current flowing the other direction into the black sea. Due to the density differences in the water the more saline and less saline waters do not mix and thus oxygen does not reach far below the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ocean currents are dominated by discrete and often drastic differences in salinity and temperature.</p>
<p>Long story short: salty water “forms” at high latitudes when sea water freezes to become sea ice, which is practically devoid of salt (brine rejection). The cold leftover surface water is left saltier and therefore denser, so it sinks to the bottom (deep water formation) and is eventually transported away from the poles via thermohaline circulation. Eventually it rises to the surface in places like the western coast of North and South America (coastal upwelling).</p>
<p>Your intuition that density (salinity and temperature) varies with depth is 100% correct. In fact, the boundaries between layers of water with different densities are so distinct that they refract or even reflect sound waves like sonar. Submariners can therefore hide from surface or shallow sonars by diving below this thermocline barrier, although you could easily use a dropped sonobuoy or dipping sonar to get below it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you suggest, salinity varies with depth, and water masses of different salinities resist mixing. Rainfall often creates low-salinity or essentially zero-salinity lenses on the surface. Turbulence from waves can cause this to mix in a little, but even then surface waters will generally be a little less salty than deep waters after a rain (assuming the deep water isn’t sourced from somewhere far away with different properties).</p></div>		</li>
