			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the math I just looked at the world consumes 93 million barrels of oil per day. A barrel of oil weighs ~300 lbs. Meaning per day the earth consumes 13,950,000 tons of oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly natural and very small. Although it's not as much as it sounds, rock is heavy and the earth is big.</p>
<p>A cubic meter of meteorite is 3 metric tons on the low end. A hundred of those would be 300 metric tons. You could fit it in a Olympic pool with room to spare. </p>
<p>Then consider the surface of the earth is 196 million square miles. That's about 1.5 g per square mile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The oil is just being moved around, from underground to the surface and into the atmosphere. So there is no net-gain. The space dust is added to the earths surface every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, the one that does cause some issues is hydrofracking.  To get natural gas out of the ground cheaply, you add pressure, fracturing the rocks; basically, you shatter the sponges holding the gas.    </p>
<p>Which is why hydrofracking can increase things like seismic activity; earthquakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. When Oklahoma was having all of those earthquakes, it was not due to the fracking per say. It was due to the waste water wells that were being developed. They essentially turned the state of OK into a massive creme brulee.  We were having like 1 to 4 earthquakes a week of varying size. They extracted all of the waste water and processed it into passable grey water and the number of earthquakes dropped drastically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydraulic fracturing pumps a few hundred barrels of fracking fluid into the rock over the course of a day or less. </p>
<p>Wastewater injection wells pump thousands of barrels of saltwater deep below the oil formations on a daily basis. The wastewater is just the saltwater that is extracted from the ground along with the desirable hydrocarbons. </p>
<p>Oil wells in my area of KS make anywhere from almost no water and a few dozen barrels of oil per day to hundreds of barrels of water and only 5-10 barrels of oil. That water is salty and nasty, so the only safe and practical disposal solution is to let that water run back into the ground via disposal wells, which are almost always gravity fed. </p>
<p>Oklahoma had a much larger amount of water to dispose of, so they pump it under pressure instead. Hydraulic fracturing has basically no direct impact on the earthquakes. However the increased oil production does. </p></div>		</li>
