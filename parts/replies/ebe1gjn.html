			<div class="markdown"><p>The corner cutting aspect is absolutely huge. Animation cuts corners, that's pretty much a rule, but TV animation is pretty limited even in an era where we have computer animation for all of our 2D animation. </p>
<p>Off-hand, I think it'd be interesting to compare how complex the lighting is Disney's Aladdin versus the TV show spin-off. Something as simple as deciding that you're going to spend time to make sure lighting changes are well-animated will add to your colouring budget -- especially since the lighting in Aladdin ranges from mid-day to ARABIAAAAAAAAAN NIIIIGHTS! to giant treasure caves with ominous lighting and lava to torchlight. And I suspect that colouring reflects the different ambiance in all of these scenes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because animation is outsourced to a different studio that attempts to mimic a specific style.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting that they feel the need to spend more time and money on production to raise the quality, since fans are obviously happy enough with the TV quality.  Maybe the production crew are trying to milk the studio for more cash? :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you have a passion for home building, you really enjoy building homes. Some guy comes up to you and asks you to design and build 30 homes and they need to be all built by July next year. You’re probably going to build something very practical and nice but not exceptional.  Now imagine someone asks you to build one house and you have a full year to get it built and you have plenty of money to implement whatever design you want. You will probably spend more money building that house even though you could just crank out another one of those 30 houses you built and called it a day.</p>
<p>Maybe look at it as the creators actually want their cartoon to look like the movie but are forced to cut corners instead of the creators making it look good for no reason. </p>
<p>Also again the format is a big issue, blowing up something from TV and putting it on a big screen would be blurry shit. Maybe not as much now a days but the early stuff 90s/00s, would have been unwatchable in the big screen without at least some touch up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not trying to milk the studio; a TV screen is only a few inches in size, but a movie screen is about 40 or 50 feet wide, so the corresponding image is much larger.  The primary reason for the difference is that the flaws and imperfections are much more visible.</p>
<p>If you watch the commentary for Serenity (the Firefly movie) the visual artists mention that they had to completely rework the computer-generated ship model because the one they designed for television wasn't detailed enough to look good on a fifty-foot theater screen.</p></div>		</li>
