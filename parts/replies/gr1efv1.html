<li>Can color change?</li>

<li>Nothing determines the charge. It just is, in the same way nothing determines the electric charge of an electron. A particle without an electric charge isn’t an electron. A particle without color charge isn’t a quark or gluon.</li>
<li>Color charge can change and does, regularly. The three quarks inside a proton or neutron each have one of the three color charges (this is actually part of the explanation for “why color charges?” - the question of how three composite particles could occupy one quantum state without violating Pauli). They interact with one another via gluon exchange, the same way electrons might interact via photon exchange. Gluons have a color/anti-color charge, so a green quark might emit a green/anti-red gluon, making itself red. That’s absorbed by a red quark, making it green.</li>
<li>As mentioned above, the charges help explain why several quarks can occupy otherwise identical quantum states within a particle. Electrons share the s-orbital by having opposite spin. Quarks share a hadron or meson by having different color. The “color” name confuses the issue, I think, more than if they were called “a, b, c” or “kappa, nu, chi” or something. They aren’t colors and they don’t blend. They are three distinct charges which can each be positive or negative and when one of each with the same sign are added equal zero. This explains how they share a state and the color confinement (all composite particles must have no color) principle explains the interactions of the strong force.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and the rule that all free particles must be colorless “explains” why we see baryons (bound states of 3 quarks) and mesons (bound states of quark anti-quark pairs), but we don’t see individual free quarks, or bound states of 4 quarks, for example. </p>
<p>Gluons, which are the bosons that mediate the strong force, are even more complex. The carry a color charge and an anti-color charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concerning your second point I'd say your phrasing clashes with point 1. Like how the charge of an electron cant change because it is fundamental neither can the color of a quark. It is more akin to the quark destroying itself and creating a quark that is the same except for the different color and a gluon carrying away the color difference. It doesn't really make a difference here but looking at the similar case of charged vector boson emission I feel like it makes more sense to describe it like this.</p>
<p>Also tiny nitpick: mesons don't have problems with Pauli due to being particle anti-particle pairings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a high school setting I think it's best to remove the confusion of the color analogy and simplify things a bit.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What determines what color a specific quark within a baryon has?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;color&quot; is the charge of the quark. It's an inherent property, a fundamental constant like elementary charge is for electrons.</p>
<p>Basically in the same way electrons/positrons inherently carry a negative/positive charge, quark/antiquark charge is red/green/blue &amp; antired/antigreen/antiblue instead of positive/negative.</p>
<p>There is nothing that determines this. They simply have one of the six charges.</p>
<p>You should talk about mesons first. At the basic level there is a sea of mesons, which are quarks/antiquarks spontaneously coming in and out of existence from the quantum field of the universe. Hadrons form when there is an asymmetry of quarks. This is why things exist, because there are unpaired quarks that aren't annihilating. The strong force confines them into a nucleon, which also binds the nucleons together into atoms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. Can color change?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can, but getting into the complexities of quark interactions requires talking about how different quark combinations can make up other types of particles, which is too highbrow for high school in my opinion. (unless you're teaching a quantum physics class specifically, I'd avoid this)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3. Why is this a useful concept?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's just a way to illustrate a senary (six-way) system instead of a binary (two-way) system. Instead of 1 positive and 1 negative, you have 3 positives and 3 negatives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think my question was too vague. In question 1 I mean, for instance, a proton is made of 2 up quarks and a down quark. The proton is also colorless. Why is one of the up quarks blue and the other is green? Is color a property more fundamental the quarks themselves? I thought quarks were fundamental particles. If so, how can you distinguish them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found it very instructional to ask myself the same questions about electrical charge. You will notice that objectively speaking, the same confusion and &quot;what is this stuff&quot; feeling applies, it's just hidden behind many years of knowing the concept and learning about its properties. That is what makes us feel like we &quot;understand&quot; it.</p>
<p>The subjective feeling of &quot;understanding&quot; we have is created by getting comfortable with the properties and consequences of the abstract concepts we use to describe things. We feel like we &quot;understand&quot; things if we can intuitively predict how they will behave to some extent, instead of having to go back to some abstract equation or thought process. In physics, this intuition is often obtained by again and again applying the model to various situations and getting familiar with the results by example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the spirit of the question is &quot;In the same way that gravity is an emergent property of mass and electromagnetism is an emergent property of electric charge, are there emergent macro effects or properties that derive from the weak/strong forces?&quot;</p>
<p>At least that's how I interpret the question...and maybe you answered it and I didn't realize it because of my lack of knowledge. Does my modified question change your answer at all?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, it's a bit confusing. Because in your question, you label the forces gravity and EM as emergent properties. But then ask if the strong and weak nuclear forces have emergent properties. Gravity, EM, Strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force are all forces. Charge, mass, color charge, weak isospin and weak hypercharge are all properties of fundamental particles that cause those particles (and the particles they can combine into) to exert those forces on each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah okay, I see. So I guess if there's any &quot;hold in my hand&quot; effects of the strong and weak nuclear forces, it's pretty much just going to be, like, atoms and chemistry, I suppose. Duh. My monkey brain was looking for magic in the same way that gravity and magnetism seem &quot;magical&quot;. But I guess the fact that the world doesn't instantly fly apart into a infinite soup of fundamental particles could be magical, too. Meh.</p></div>		</li>
