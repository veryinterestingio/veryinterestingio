			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you read about the shift the author always uses viruses as an example because, I think, they are simple organisms that use surface proteins to penetrate cells. Bacteria don't necessary need to penetrate cells but they do have surface proteins, peptoglycans and lipoproteins that are recognized by our immune system. So yes I do believe it can happen in bacteria too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does make sense. I don't know much about this but I thought there was also a mechanism component to it. When they explain genetic shift in the context of viruses they describe it as a genetic re-assortment between two different strains of virus to produce a new virus, like H1N1 exchanging RNA segments with H5N3 to produce like I dunno H6N4 or something humans are immune naive to, leading to a pandemic. I'll have to look into the analogous mechanism in bacteria.</p></div>		</li>
