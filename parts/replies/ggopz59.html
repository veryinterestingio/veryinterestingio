Since it's method of entry and thus (maybe) mode of action will be different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reducing the number of infected people in the world would reduce the likelihood of mutations, not increase it. If fewer cases exist, then the opportunities for the virus to change as lowered. Each time a virus changes hosts, the environment is slightly different and there is a chance it will adapt to these differences, which is also why having the virus infect other animals and then back to humans increases the likelihood of mutations as well. Vaccines will reduce the number of infected people in the world, slowing down the rate of mutation. Also the vaccines dont just target the spike protein on the tip, they target the whole spike structure, so the virus would truly have to drastically mutate before it could become unaffected by the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, as soon as we apply a selective pressure directly in the form of a vaccine, we are going to increase this rate of mutation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't even make sense. Mutations are random. They arise during errors in replication. Mutations that are beneficial to the virus replicating get spread more. </p>
<p>The greater the spread, the greater the replication, and the greater chance for mutation. Vaccines dramatically slow the spread, which means fewer chances for mutation during replication. </p>
<p>It's just basic math. For example if there is a 0.001% chance of mutation every time it replicates, that means for every 1,000,000,000 replications you'll see around 10,000 mutations. If with a vaccine the number of replications drops to 1,000,000 then you'd only see 10 mutations.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't ring true to me. Mutations are mutations, and happen whenever they happen. There would indeed be some artificial selection happening, but you can only select for mutations when those mutations actually happen, and there's no reason to believe that a vaccine would make mutations more likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;species&quot; is a surprisingly tricky thing to nail down. We have phylogenetic levels in which to classify things, but the tree of life doesn't really care much about that.</p>
<p>Even classifying animals into species can be tricky, let alone viruses. Example: The Florida Panther, puma, cougar, catamount, and mountain lion are all the same species. Dogs and wolves are different species, but can interbreed to make viable offspring (EDIT: incorrect, dogs are a subspecies). Ultimately, something becomes a new species or, for your original question, a new virus, when it best suits us to decide it is.</p>

<p>Not sure I get this example. Aren't those all just different names for the same species, given its wide range across the Americas? If you put one of each in the same room it would be obvious they're the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want another example of how muddy this can get, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species#:~:text=In%20biology%2C%20a%20ring%20species,potential%20gene%20flow%20between%20each%20%22" target="_blank">ring species</a> are a situation where you have say, species A, B, C, and D:</p>
<p>A can interbreed with B but not with C or D. </p>
<p>B can breed with A or C but not D.</p>
<p>C with B and D but not A.</p>
<p>In this way, it may be possible to get a detectable flow of genes from species A to D even though they can't interbreed (which is usually considered a big check box when we call something different species). But in this case are A and D breeding? Obviously not traditionally but....in a sense, you could argue. Anyway, definitely muddy when you get down into some edge cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Better example. Dogs, wolves, coyotes, red wolves, and eastern Coywolves are all visibly and behaviorally different, but can all interbreed. Coywolf is kind of a new terminology, they used to just call them eastern coyote. They're a lot bigger than their western cousins (so they can go after deer fawns and winter weakened deer) , and there's not a real line between coywolf and wolf or coyote.  (probably because its the result of wolves being extripated from the east as coyotes moved in, resulting in some genetic mixing)</p></div>		</li>
