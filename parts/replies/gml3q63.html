The Biden-Harris Administration is working to purchase an additional 100 million doses of each of the two FDA-authorized vaccines â€“ Pfizer and Moderna.  This increases the total vaccine order for the U.S. by 50%, from 400 million to 600 million with these additional doses expected to deliver this summer. With these additional doses, the U.S. will have enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of this summer. --BC</p></div>		</li>
