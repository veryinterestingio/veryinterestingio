			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a lot of people like working at night, you see more younger people starting their carrers then older/more experienced guys.</p>
<p>Also it’s hard to see what you are doing at night, even with big lights and/or head lights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. In particular in hot areas like southern US cities. Both to avoid rush hour traffic and to avoid making workers work in 95°F heat (add in the heat radiating from the road) and having workers drop like flies due to heat exhaustion and heat stroke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Dallas and have seen construction going on at night.  I always assumed these were the reasons.  It's super hot during the summer, so doing construction at night avoids the heat and the traffic, especially during rush hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I’m sure the heat doesn’t help, it’s mostly to avoid working alongside traffic. Working adjacent to live traffic is incredibly dangerous; most drivers have little regard for the safety of road workers.</p></div>		</li>
