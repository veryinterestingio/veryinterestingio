<p>To a human HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH seems a lot more &quot;special&quot; than HTHTHTHTTTTHHHTHTHHHHTTHTHT, but they are both equally probable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, getting any <strong><em>specific</em></strong> pattern in that sequence is like 1 / 33.5 mil.</p>
<p>But there is usually a pattern of <strong><em>roughly alternating</em></strong> H's and Ts, assuming the system is truly random and there's a 50/50 odds for each.</p>
<p>You will get a pattern that &quot;looks&quot; like the latter much, much more frequently, even if it's not that specific sequence of H's and T's you listed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but that's because we have a higher tolerance for &quot;looks like&quot; when there's no discernable pattern than when there is. All results that have no discernable pattern &quot;look like&quot; all the other results with no discernable pattern, it's just the results that do have a discernable pattern that aren't mistakable for anything else.</p>
<p>So, the vast majority of all possible results &quot;look like&quot; each other, and only a few special ones look unique. It's our own failing at differentiating the others that makes this whole thing seem strange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming a universe where personalized number plates aren't available and all plates have to be randomly assigned.</p>
<p>In a universe where people can *choose* their numbers if they like, the probability swings back to it being more likely to be deliberate.</p>
<p>Like in a universe where people can build biased coins, a pattern of HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH becomes more likely to be deliberate than accidental because it's exactly the sort of pattern someone would *choose*.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The odds of that specific plate is equal to every other possible plate combination, but if you're asking &quot;What are the odds that I see a license plate create any words or phrases I recognize?&quot; the odds aren't strictly equivalent.</p></div>		</li>
