			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting how operators use the terms to their liking and how it varies across countries. </p>
<p>In the UK, 3G to the subscriber has included UMTS, HSDPA, HSPA+ and DC-HSPA+. When the operators upgraded to DC-HSPA+ tech, there wasn't really any campaign to notify people, it was more a silent rollout. Then when LTE came along, there was a huge campaign for 4G phones etc.  So in the UK we either see 3G/H/H+ on our display or 4G/LTE usually. </p>
<p>When I travelled to the US the first time, I saw 4G on my phone roaming and though awesome, superfast, then realised it was an HSPA connection, not LTE like at home. I guess differing target markets and competition drive the operators to find new ways to make subscribers think they need the shiniest thing going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine a big player is UK laws on fair advertising. When it comes to advertising connection speeds for example, the UK moved from what's available to 10% of customers at peak times to 50% in 2017. </p>
<p>The US meanwhile has <em>no</em> legally binding standards and ads are still delivered on an &quot;up to X&quot; basis. Literally every broadband provider has ads claiming to offer the fastest, most reliable, customer friendliest service. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really appreciate your comment, I purposefully avoid thinking too hard about wireless for THIS very reason.  The damage carriers and manufacturers have done to the research-ability of wireless specifications makes me want to hide in a trench whenever anyone wonders over it.  Just with everything else in networking, we really need global and clearly defined standards in these things.</p></div>		</li>
