<p>Plus, the permanent look of shock from the time you accidentally overtweezed your eyebrows.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guuurl preach! I'm not menopausal yet but I've had wild black goat hairs on my jawbone for years. And why are they so damn coarse, and grow so fricken fast? I used to use Sally Hansen facial wax strips but they started messing up my skin and I'd always miss several hairs so now I just tweeze. Endlessly. Every 3 days it seems like.</p>
<p>EDIT: And <em>furthermore</em> how does one of them manage to get 17 inches long before I notice it?!?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle" target="_blank">&quot;root&quot;</a> is below the surface of your skin, so pulling it out would not be great for your skin. To continue the garden analogy, think about how much dirt gets everywhere when you pull plants out by the root. Now imagine the ground was your skin.</p></div>		</li>
