			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how old they are, you might wanna have your boys read it too! The past few years I've spent more time reading about both the facets of ADD and it various comorbidities. Doing so has both made my coping strategies more effective, and helped me not beat myself up so much when I have a bad day against my ADD. Being able to recognize that some way I'm feeling or thinking is being influenced by my ADD makes it much easier to manage. There were some things I didn't even know were a consequence of it! Glad to see parents putting in the effort to understand what their kids are going through :) Mine did too, and I was lucky for it, but I've heard a lot of horror stories too</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you can’t afford that, pm me and I’ll make sure you can get it at least for a little while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't like that people keep talking about children when this is a condition that affects all ages. </p>
<p>The worse is that some kids are annoyed at the kind of care they received as kids and don't treat it when they become adults.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree. In addition to my two sons my husband is also ADHD. He was one of the first people ever to be put on Ritalin as a child and he hated it. He stayed on it until he left for college and hasn't touched anything since.</p>
<p>When it came to our boys, we were obviously trying everything we could not to go the medication route. Unfortunately for my youngest circumstances and his particular issues require it now, and even he (7 years old) will tell you that it helps him think and not feel so confused and angry all the time. </p>
<p>Different strokes for different folks. How you treat your ADHD is a personal decision and should be continually reevaluated as you grow up. At least that's how I'm approaching it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, I started controlling it when I was in college. Had I had access to medicine my life would have been very different. ADHD explains a lot. Now trying to handle it while looking ahead at possibly dealing with it should I have children. More research needs to be done about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll start this with a big disclaimer; the following is what adhd is like to experience, separate to what is actually happening physically/chemically.</p>
<p>I don’t think your interpretation is going to be too helpful for your boys, I wish there was more knowledge when I was a kid but here’s a humble strangers two cents:</p>
<p>Inattentiveness and hyperactivity are secondary symptoms. The root of these is something more like an unsettled mind, constantly <strong>feeling</strong> anywhere between ‘not quite right’ and ‘EVERYTHING IS EXTREMELY WRONG’. Hyperactivity and inattentiveness are just 2 of many different coping mechanisms. From the outside it may appear that they can’t stop being distracted, or can’t stop acting impulsively. But imagine it more like an ant in a frying pan desperately trying to escape. The heat in the frying pan can varY, and different minds will (either consciously or sub-consciously) find ways to deal with it. Some might naturally try to frantically scramble/jump/climb/backflip to get out of the pan (hyper) and some might try to think about anything and everything else to ignore the heat (distraction).</p>
<p>The frying pan is most of everyday life.</p>
<p>The adhd brain finds it easier to experience things that fall into the big 4 categories: personal interest, urgent, novel, challenging.</p>
<p>Incorporating those into their lives as much as possible is a great way to make their lives better. If they lack extreme self control this can help them achieve things, and if they <em>do</em> have extreme self control then this will stop them from hating their entire lives because they force themselves to struggle through everyday life.</p>
<p>Personally, even with medication, I barely get anything done at work without simultaneously watching Netflix and also partially daydreaming about the real things I want to do with my life. Those things are enough to keep my brain feeling ok so I can bare the work I have to get through.</p>
<p>For a long time I forced myself to work through the feeling but I’ve now learnt that’s not normal. As a teenager, I thought almost everyone I knew must be a sadomasochist for being ok with the prospect of working full time. The thought was intolerable for me, but I told myself I had to grit my teeth and get through it.</p>
<p>Forcing yourself to just work when you have adhd is like wading through a crowd where everyone is clawing/pulling/screaming at you that you’re doing the wrong thing. That something isn’t right and you should be doing something else. That feeling (whether it’s sub-conscious or you’re fully aware of it) is what drives the inattentiveness and/or hyperactivity.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much for your perspective. As a mum to two ADHD boys,and a partner to an ADHD husband, I'm always looking for new understandings of their challenges in life,and ways I can be helpful and not harmful. I want to make sure I'm setting the boys up for success. </p>
<p>I only answered the question specifically as it was posed, ie. Why do stimulants work. Personally only one of my 3 are medicated with stimulants but that is a personal decision and is not always going to be the right thing for everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering if it was you or the boys father. It helps when the parents are aware/familiar. Yeah stimulants are not perfect, fair enough.</p></div>		</li>
