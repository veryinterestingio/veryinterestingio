			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it is funny. Like for example slapstick comedy will make you atleast chuckle. But when in a group if everyone is laughing you are more inclined to laugh, but let's say you were surrounded by a group of tense individuals you wont want to laugh then too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I laugh at everything. I tend to over laugh. I try to tell jokes or say things i believe are funny,  and even if no one else laughs,  I will. I also try to keep a genuine smile on my face even when dealing with bad depression that day. Just makes me feel better at the end of the day. I smile to people on the street and say Good morning sir or ma'am. I thank people with a smile if they hold the door open for me,  even if they didn't intentionally do it for me. </p>
<p>I just don't understand being a bitter bitch all day.</p></div>		</li>
