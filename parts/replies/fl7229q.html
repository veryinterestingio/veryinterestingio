			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd have to say the following formula for pi. Take all of the prime numbers and for each one write it as a fraction: prime/(nearest multiple of 4). If you multiply all of these fractions together you get pi/4. I have no idea why...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like an Euler product. I’m not sure exactly where pi/4 comes from, but that looks like the central value of a Dirichlet L-function.</p>
<p>If I were asked to prove the pi/4 part, I would probably look at the analytic class number formula.</p>
<p>I like this math fact! The tip of the iceberg for a lot of cool number theory stuff.</p></div>		</li>
