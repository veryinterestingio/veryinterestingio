			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure they do.  There's plenty of cases of animals with bad teeth dying early in the wild. But their primary point is that it's a thing that's really easy to see creep back into a species once they have no evolutionary pressure to maintain teeth is gone.</p>
<p>Also, our diets bear almost no resemblance to the ones that would be expected of us, from an evolutionary point of view. Not to anthropomorphize evolution too much, but as far as it's concerned we're eating the weirdest shit ever and doing super strange stuff with our mouths, which doesn't help. It's hard to say &quot;why have we evolved like this&quot; when the conditions in which we evolved are vastly different now.  It's like coming in from the cold and wondering why your winter coat is no longer comfy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This. One of my cats has lost all her teeth by the age of five. However the other one (same litter, same diet) still has all of them some 7 years later. Vet said it's just bad genetics. Obviously she wouldn't be able to survive in the wild.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but we actually the opposite problem going on. For a very long time, we were evolving by getting bigger brains, but part of doing that meant that we had to engage in an evolutionary trade in where are jaws got smaller and weaker. This happened over a fairly short period of time geologically speaking.  This makes us fairly similar to pugs and other dogs that were experiencing artificial selective pressure towards having shorter muzzles.</p>
<p>Had humans evolve a mechanism to increase their brain size without decreasing jaw size, instead of the mechanism we did end up using, we would almost certainly have better teeth because we would not currently be having to deal with the Fallout of previous selective pressures to decrease jaw side.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The troubles many people have with wisdom teeth may bear witness to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't agree that 'we had to engage in an evolutionary trade in where are jaws got smaller and weaker'. The two changes aren't necessarily linked just because they took place over the same period. Jaw size decreasing could be due to a variety of factors and isn't necessarily required for us to have grown larger brains.</p>
<p>Jaw size may have decreased from the cooking of food, greater tool use, the advancement of language requiring favouring a more dexterous mouth etc.</p>
<p>If you don't need as strong a jaw to eat, or to use your teeth as a weapon, it would make sense for jaw size to decrease over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they aren't necessarily linked. But we actually know the particular Gene in question and had observed the effect of the mutation that occurred between the time we branched out from the chimpanzee line.  </p>
<p>It is like if someone ran a football into the end zone for a touchdown, and then you said that a touchdown isn't necessarily caused by a run. That is technically true, but we I have other observations. We saw it happen. We have reason to say that is why it happened this time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it might be related to the fact that one of our largest evolutionary pressures (up until the invention of the c-section) was fitting the big fat baby head through the birth canal. With a smaller jaw, you can fit more brain in without killing the mother.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read somewhere that it would have to do with us not eating chewy stuff anymore. Heavy chewing would stimulate growth in the jaw at least so much that the wisdom teeth fit in.</p></div>		</li>
