			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in a city where the altitude increases dramatically as you head west. I have to deal with popping my ears on a daily basis. I think everyone is supposed to be able to do it, let's try to figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p>There are two methods I'm aware of:</p>
<p>1) make a chewing motion with your jaw   until the pressure releases. This is the easiest method but it doesn't work well for really high altitudes.</p>
<p>2) take a deep breath, plug your nose, close you eyes, close your mouth then just try to blow the air out of your closed orifices. This is less dignified, requires you to stop what you're doing and can easily be overdone.</p>
<p>Did you try both methods?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I sometimes find the 'best' ones are where I hold on to the click, breathe in through my nose, and push my jaw down and forward. So good...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Next time try holding your nose closed ( pinch nostrils together) fill your cheeks with air, keep mouth tightly closed, and swallow. Where I live we have what locals call The Grade. It's where the freeway is guided over a mountain to get to the town on the other side. Because of the elevation differences it causes pressure. My mom taught me this when I was little because I used to get ear infections and the pressure was so painful. My parents each lived on opposite sides of the grade when I was young, so I had to be driven across every other weekend.</p></div>		</li>
