			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that you didn't mention, solar panels are not mounted directly on the ground, but above the ground. This causes the heat of the sun to be concentrated in the panel instead of the ground. This again causes the ground to remain cooler during the day, but warmer during the night as the panels inhibit wind. This can cause in a lot of enviroments a pocket of relatively cool moist air to build up under the solar panels. In forming deserts this could tip the balance and allow plants to regrow. </p>
<p>Also, the groundheatflux is overall reduced, so the radiative loss of heat is greater than in the normal scenerio as not as able as the ground to lose heat to convective processes or groundwater flows. This counteracts the heating but would make the day nightcycle of weather very extreme due to the quick and large difference of temprature of the panels.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short anwser is maby, the long anwser is that it depends an the reason a place is desertifying, the extent to which that already has happened and the role of climate change. For example, if a place has been a desert for a long time the soil will be very dry and little water is transported to the region. A place that used to be green but now becomes a desert is easier to save with this technique.</p>
<p>It all depends on a lot of factors, but in some regions it could change a dying ecosystem to a stable or growing one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't many creatures that live in the desert depend on the terrain and environmental conditions within the desert? Wouldn't making the ground cooler, more moist, and darker potentially disrupt the existing ecosystem, both by making it less hospitable for indigenous wildlife, and my making it more hospitable for invasive species?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the water works projects in the western US after the turn of the century were considering conservationist at the time like the Hoover dam because they irrigated the area and allowed more vegetation to come in and allowed for human settlement. Meanwhile it destroyed existing desert ecosystems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could probably make a back of the envelope calculation using whatever factors/equations that tell you how heat/energy is reflected/emitted back depending on albedo, work up some rough average to include all manmade surfaces and actions that absorb or create heat including asphalt roads, concrete buildings, transportation, deforestation, and then subtract however much ice melts each year And how much snowy regions regress to indicate reduction in high albedo surfaces.</p>
<p>I’d wager that the loss of white snowy/icy environment far outweighs any dark/low albedo surfaces we’ve created, but it’s a great question!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question;  I don't know the answer (because you're right about my specialty), but if you search for &quot;climate forcing land use change&quot; or &quot;urban heat island effect&quot; you'll find lots to read on this front!  (I think the answer is &quot;not a lot so far in terms of global impact, but definitely affects local temperatures in cities/etc&quot;...)</p></div>		</li>
