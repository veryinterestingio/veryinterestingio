			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Understandable. But Iâ€™m talking about this extremely inhospitable place where even now so few people live.  Yet it had been the bridge for migration to Americas. So a lot of people must have gone through. Just seems too arduous journey to make. I may be under assessing human endurance of the time though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Hmm, food here is getting scarce, we can travel a bit to the north, there's food across the river there and no other people around.&quot;<br />

&quot;Hmm, food here is getting scarce, we can travel a bit to the north, there's food across the hill there and no other people around, the south is taken by the other tribes.&quot;<br />

&quot;Hmm, food here is getting scarce, we can travel a bit to the north, there's food across the forest there and no other people around, the south is taken by the other tribes.&quot;<br />
*5000 years later in the middle of the tundra*<br />
&quot;Hmm, how did we end up here? Anyway, food here is getting scarce but there's nowhere to travel to, other places are either taken or even worse, so let's herd some reindeer.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

The rest (supposedly) kept going south towards the lower 48 and Mexico. Mainly mongolian ancestry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Alaska, especially towards the artic circle is very very hospitable. Though it does get extremely cold, animal furr is abundant. There are tons and tons of caribou and other animals up there to hunt. Most of the year you can actually just store the meat in the snow, not worrying about how to preserve it. You can also eat the typically high acidic vegetables from their stomach too (I don't remember which stomach, but once it reaches the second or third stomach you can eat them). That's why a lot of people who just want to live off grid go to Alaska.</p></div>		</li>
