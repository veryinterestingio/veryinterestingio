<p>No. When all of his superiors had become casualties, Lt. Cox remained a mere lieutenant. He simply was the most senior available officer, and thus the <em>responsibility of command</em> fell automatically to him, but it did not bring any change in his rank. In other words, <em>Chesapeake</em> always had some officer legally in command up until the moment of the surrender, and all such officers can be referred to as &quot;captain&quot; <em>by courtesy</em> when in command, but it was not the case that any such officer automatically received the <em>rank</em> of Captain in the United States Navy.</p>
<p>Compare to the British Royal Navy of that era, for example, where the term &quot;post-captain&quot; was used to refer to an officer who held the actual rank of Captain (his promotion and appointment to command had been &quot;posted&quot; and appeared in the Gazette), rather than a lower-ranked officer such as a Commander or a Lieutenant who was referred to as &quot;captain&quot; by courtesy due to commanding a vessel.</p>
<p>And what OP is asking about really is the historical practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevet_(military\)" target="_blank">breveting</a>, or a temporary acting appointment. The details of what that means depend heavily on the country whose armed forces are being discussed, and the era in which it occurred.</p></div>		</li>
