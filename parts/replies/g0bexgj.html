			<div class="markdown"><p>One small addition to this otherwise comprehensive answer, at the very old end of the scale there are also meteorites formed in space independently of the Earth and subsequently fell to the ground.  The oldest meteorite found is believed to have formed something like 7 billion years ago, so is significantly older than the Earth itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meteorites are pretty rare (and hard to find in most environments). The vast majority of them are the same age as the Earth, i.e. 4.56 billion years old, and in fact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth#Why_meteorites_were_used" target="_blank">meteorites are what we have used to date the formation of the Earth</a>. There, to my knowledge, has never been an entire meteorite that has been found and dated that is 'presolar', i.e. older than the solar system / Earth. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presolar_grains" target="_blank">presolar grains</a> in a select few meteorites, and that is likely what you're remembering, but it is incorrect to say that there are entire meteorites of this age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't claim to have expertise, I just thought it would be worth bringing up the subject of meteorites as a type of rock that doesn't fall into the more conventional geological set of options that your post pretty exhaustively discussed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a bit about space rocks and you are dead right in your assessment. The Allende meteorite of Jan 1969 was a carbonaceous chondrite, and hat had presolar inclusions including nano scale diamonds, which, when heated released an isotope of Xe that was not found in our local space - the implications are that they are extragalactic and blown in from a supernova that provided in the initialisation of our sun and solar system.  These grains date to around 5.1 Billion years. Please note that I am a bit out of touch so updates are welcome!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At 7 billion years is that expected to be a product of another star system, or part of the cloud that formed our solar system? At that age is the differentiation between the two even kinda ambiguous?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of? Stars only form elements heavier than Iron when they go Supernova so we know that our system is a product of an older star that went critical and blew up. I do remember reading once that it's thought that our system is a 3rd generation star, but I can't remember the source so take it with a grain of salt. Basically that 7 billion year old rock could be from another extrasolar source ot could be a remnant of a system that blew up to create the cloud we spun out of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The solar system is only 4.6 billion years old, so yes, these would definitely have been formed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Edit: If they exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dates obtained by radiometric methods are normally the time that the mineral formed and cooled, not the element during fusion in some earlier star.  It's the date the rock crystallized within/on the Earth.  Same story for meteorites.</p>
<p>Sometimes meteorites can include even older mineral grains that pre-date the formation of the solar system that have not been remelted or otherwise heated up enough to &quot;reset&quot; the clock, but these are tiny grains and volumetrically a small fraction of the meteorite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A geologic map of your area would be a good place to start. If you're in the US, then the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/national-cooperative-geologic-mapping-program/science/national-geologic-map?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects" target="_blank">National Geologic Map Database</a> would be a good spot for finding maps of your area (if you're not in the US, looking at the equivalent to the USGS for your country, i.e. a national geologic survey, would similarly be a place to start). Using a geologic map, if you can find (1) where you are and (2) bedrock, then you know how old the rock is. For random rocks on the surface, it's much harder as you would need to know what kind of deposit and from where it was sourced to narrow down the age ranges.</p></div>		</li>
