			<div class="markdown"><p>Since this is ELI5, I feel like this is probably the best explanation. Getting into the details of pricing and supply and demand is meaningless if the chip can't handle it.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, overclocking means more heat, this means you need more cooling. If you're willing to above and beyond the default cooling setup, you can get more performance from the same chip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The newest chips by intel nowdays already essentially require a massive CPU air cooler or a water loop to not overheat. The I9-9900K overheats pretty bad unless you buy an aftermarket water loop for it and that is using the chip right out of the box</p></div>		</li>
