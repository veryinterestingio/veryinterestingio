			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically they use a higher percentage of brain power to process visual information, and they have more photo receptive cells, so the amount of information is increased as well as the speed of visual processing. You can read a little more about it here <a href="https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2015/02/03/eagle-eyes.aspx" target="_blank">https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2015/02/03/eagle-eyes.aspx</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sort of how you can focus on a small TV and it will seem like the only thing in the room... Except imagine the TV is a half mile away now.</p>
<p>You don't need to be optically zoomed in, your brain can do that for you if your vision is super sharp and it allows you to focus on the small part of the image you're interested in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it would be more of a &quot;cropped image&quot; than &quot;optical zoom&quot; to put in in Photoshop and photography terms I can understand.</p>
<p>I imagine that like humans, their vision gets less sharp around the edges, too. Humans just have a tiny little spot that's actually in focus and in color. The rest is fairly blurry and B+W (fun fact for those who didn't know).</p>
<p>Also, I could be wrong, but don't humans have the best/sharpest eyesight of any animal except for birds of prey?</p></div>		</li>
