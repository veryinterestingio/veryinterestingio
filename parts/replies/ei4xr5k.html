			<div class="markdown"><p>Radar uses radio waves that don't have enough energy to damage human cells. It is likely just a myth</p>
<p>Edit: Like /u/mariohm1311 said, high intensity radiowaves can still damage cells by heating them similarly to how microwaves do. However, they aren't ionising and will probably not do any sort of selective damage that would cause a difference in the sex ratio in the offspring of Radar workers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's false. Depending on the wavelengths, it can easily kill you, just not by ionization. Non-ionizing radiation (as opposed to the one generated by radioactive elements) has non-negligible effects at high power levels, the most important being heating. Military radar installations have powers on the order of megawatts. That's around a 1000 times higher than your microwave (which is not a good comparison due to the difference in absorbance, but it's a nice round number for the power levels). In fact, MRI machines are limited in power since the RF antenna used to excite the hydrogen atoms can have adverse effects.</p>
<p>You can easily find anecdotic reports on the effects of navy radars on birds. These radars (such as the AN/SPY-1) work with wavelengths similar to your microwave, and can definitely kill you if focused. I mean, even small fighter jet AESA radars are being used to fry electronics from ranges of the order of kilometers, so no doubt a powerful radar system can have an effect. </p>
<p>TL;DR: It's not ionizing radiation (so no cancer), but you sure do find it useful when you use it to warm up your meal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it have to have a frequency almost close to infrared though? I guess that danger varies by a factors of close to 1 trillion based on what type of radio wave it is. At any rate, I doubt any damage done by a high enough frequency would be as selective as only affecting Y sperm production capabilities of the body. I could see that the radio waves cause the water to heat up and damage every cell and possibly affect total fertility, but not affect the sex ratio.</p></div>		</li>
