			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's ELI5 no one included the element of time - which is a huge factor.</p>
<p>1) The longer you're in debt, the more interest you owe. Also- everyone borrows from banks, who borrow from central banks, who don't borrow anything... but do decide the interest rate.</p>
<p>2) How do central banks have something to lend out? They lend out based on either the government's assets or the government's IOUs and a promise that they're &quot;good for it&quot;. Those IOUs will be payed back 15 or 30 years later, by your kids or someone else's kids. </p>
<p>3) As the economy grow, the money is worth less through inflation. By the time the debt is paid back, the amount paid is not the same value that was borrowed. Imagine passing around a jug of lemonade and every time someone pours out a cup, they fill it back up with water. The last guy has the same amount they had in the beginning, but it's not as lemony anymore. Everyone along the way got more flavor out of each sip- with the best being in the beginning progressively worse.</p>
<p>Basically, we owe what our parents and grandparents borrow from us before we were born, and the banks that lent out what we have to pay back took all the value out of it long ago.</p>
<p>So now we can be responsible, make Trillions just to pay back for their expenses, which gets us collective stability but nothing individually for that trouble... or we can say &quot;we didn't start the fire,&quot; keep on borrowing from the future, and let the next generation to decide what they want to do... but certain individuals prosper heavily from it. Which do you think the world will choose?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2) is not correct. Central banks have infinite money in their own currency. They just hold it and only lend enough to not create too much inflation and lose credibility to other currencies. The government directly emits bonds, whoever's thinks that the state will honor the bond will buy it. Sometimes, the central bank will buy some, but that is a slippery slope and a vicious cycle that leads to hyperinflation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is actually a really good thing from a global geopolitical point-of-view. With countries indebted to each other, they're invested in each other's success.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this is the best 'Why'.  The top comment does a good job explaining how such a situation comes about but doesn't address why it stays.  The sensible thing would be to let the $10 go around the circle and be done with it but that requires trust and stability of all parties involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, yes, but in this scenario, everyone owes $10 and also has a $10 IOU.</p>
<p>Assuming everyone is equally likely to pay back the IOU (which makes sense, in this case, since you all know each other), you can unwind the debt circle fairly easily: you “sell” your debtor’s IOU to your creditor in exchange for wiping out your own debt, etc.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about this example is that it raises the issue of discount rates (how much the debt is really worth).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is also excellent for showing why excessive debt makes an economy more fragile.</p>
<p>Let's assume that none of these people have more money than this single $10 bill in circulation and IOUs from previous people in the loop. This is not crucial, but simplifies things.</p>
<p>Let's also assume that your brother is the one holding the $10 bill right now. If your brother spends it or loses it, he is unable to pay off his debt to your dad. Subsequently, your dad cannot pay his friend, and so forth and so forth. The end result is that no one gets their money back. Essentially $60 of wealth has vanished from this &quot;economy&quot;.</p>
<p>As there are only 6 people per one $10 bill, the probability of someone failing to honor his or her obligations is not very high.</p>
<p>But think if there were instead, say, 6000 people per one $10 bill in the loop. This would mean $60.000 of debt for one $10 bill. It's easy to see that the probability of a single link failing (making the &quot;economy&quot; collapse), would skyrocket.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the $10, passed along the chain through borrowing,doesn't actually purchase anything it just gets moved around creating debt. Wouldn't the $10 need to be traded for some good or service at some point to be called an economic activity?</p>
<p>I thought the multiplier was  more like:  A guy gets paid $10 for digging a hole, uses the money to buy a hamburger for $10, which pays a restaurant and a worker who buy more meat and pay rent, etc. Shows how $10 in your local economy gets spent over and over generating more economic activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Wealth is measured in goods of value as well as currency. When you buy a product for a dollar, you value that item more than the dollar and the person selling the product values the dollar more than the item they have. This is why wealth can be created</p>
<p>When you get a job, you value your time less than the wage you’re being paid</p>
<p>In short: get a job:P</p></div>		</li>
