			<div class="markdown"><p>To take it a step further: a low level function of the brain is combination of neural signals into single bits of information. This includes interpreting the reception of two distinct colors as a third, non-existent color. The brain also does this with audio signals to pick up tonal modulations, e.g. some people with deep voices are actually speaking in multiple higher tones that modulate together to sound deeper. </p>
<p>Why does the brain combine signals seemingly arbitrarily? It enhances pattern recognition success. Information is a huge tool for survivability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of this happens before the signal even reaches the brain. The easiest way to see this is how your eye helps you detect contrasting boundaries. When a receptor sees brightness, it both sends a “bright” signal down its neural pathway, and sends a “not bright” signal down its neighbors pathways. This is how those illusions work where one color of grey looks entirely different depending on what color it’s next to. </p></div>		</li>
