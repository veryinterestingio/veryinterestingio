			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - all elevators will have a PPM schedule - sometimes as often as every month or so or sometimes annually.</p>
<p>They also go through a process called LOLER once every 6-12 months where a 3rd party insurance company sends a trained inspector to check the functioning safety of the elevator.</p>
<p>Faults picked up by them will be split into A, B and C class defects.</p>
<p>An ‘A’ defect is a potentially serious fault which will need to be rectified within a certain timeframe (or immediately - in which case, the inspector will shut the lift off).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory it is enough to save ones life, although it will probably end in a hospital trip anyway as there is only so much a buffer can do for you. The problem is that almost elevator have all its safety systems fail and have to rely on the buffer. And in the rare case of this happening, if it have happened at all, there is a big chance that whatever caused all the other safety systems to fail, be it extreme conditions or lack of maintenance, will also cause the buffer to fail.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All these systems are inspected and tested regularly.</p>

<p>This assumes you're in a country with decent laws and application thereof. I've seen quite a few videos of elevator failures in Brazil (for example) where laws are not always applied evenly and envelopes full of cash may let you pass a failed inspection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is simply not the case and blatantly wrong. The cost of passing an inspection have nothing to do with the actual condition of your elevator. Even with a newly installed elevator any inspector will be able to find plenty of faults unless you hand over the envelopes full of cash.</p></div>		</li>
