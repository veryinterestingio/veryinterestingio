			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, improvements in capture and storage of emissions can be implemented much cheaper and much more successfully at a centralized generation station than can be done at a per vehicle level. This allows a single point of cost/improvement to effect dramatic change across the entire fleet of vehicles charged by the plant (as well as any other loads supported by that plant).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is about 2 to 3 times cheaper, MWh for MWh, to add offshore wind to the grid than to add nuclear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This cost advantage is entirely related to regulatory challenges. If the U.S. simply let people build nuclear without any rules, it would be an order of magnitude (or more) less expensive than any other form of power.</p>
<p>However, the strict regulatory climate not only means that there are enormous compliance costs but there is no economy of scale. Even basic components of a nuclear plant are incredibly expensive compared to their actual complexity.</p>
<p>For example, I worked on an interface display for nuclear power plants a few decades ago. We had to make it form/fit/function compatible with a display that had been developed in the 70s. Since none of the original components were available, we had to take modern components and certify them for use in a nuclear power plant to simulate the functionality of 70s-era hardware.</p>
<p>The result? About $40 worth of parts that sold for over $100,000 per unit.</p>
<p>That's not to say that we should just do away with all regulations regarding nuclear. However, it is important to recognize that the costs of nuclear are entirely self-imposed rather than being an intrinsic feature of the technology. Nuclear remains the most cost-effective and power-dense form of energy generation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not all, but many population centers in the US have tiered electricity costs based on peak usage times. If the pricing was adjusted to encourage people to charge their vehicles at non-peak times (perhaps overnight, like after 9pm?) then people would essentially be faced with the choice of charging their vehicles for double the price or remembering to do it at an efficient time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is literally how it is where i live and with the app on my phone, i don't even have to both remembering, the software does it automatically</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My car has a bunch of charging policy parameters including charging off-peak, charging to be full at a specific time, and staying topped up all the time - and you can combine them (like, saying to charge to be ready in the morning but <em>also</em> do it off-peak, which ends before the morning departure, so it'll calculate how long it'll take to charge and start about that long before the end of off-peak rates. That way you get cheap energy <em>and</em> the battery is warm in the morning!)  </p>
<p>Is that not a common feature?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually it depends where you live.  In places where electricity prices are tied to grid demand people are incentivised to charge at the lowest price time (lowest grid load time).  All electric cars I'm aware of let you schedule charging but there are also some chargers that monitor demand/price and will throttle charging based on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have many good points the peak electricity use problem is currently being made worse by ev, hopefully next generation smart chargers and cars will solve this by mainly charging during the night time (now everyone charge 5-7(17-19). </p>
<p>The new Ford 150? Has an option for charging your house in case of blackout for 3 days.</p>
<p>This way it can make the grid less dependant on fossil fuel and more flexible. Sunny and windy days will charge grid and when not, all these batteries will keep it going for some of the down time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally owned vehicles are never going to be a good example of opportunistic charging because individuals don't have enough flexibility. They drive when they need to drive and charge when they're not driving - regardless of what the grid demand is.</p>
<p>To opportunistically charge at low demand times, you really need a <em>fleet</em> of vehicles. A city with electric busses can easily purchase more busses (or more batteries) so they always have enough charged vehicles to meet transportation demands but have enough excess that they can time-shift the charging to times when power is cheap.</p>
<p>The classic example of exploiting intermittent power is desalinization. As long as your average rate of desalinization meets the demand, it doesn't really matter when you do it. If you've got an excess of power, you just fill up your fresh water reservoir faster. If you've got limited power, you just use your fresh water reserves. Because it costs almost nothing to build a bigger reservoir, you can smooth out the demand curve easily.</p>
<p>For electric vehicles, smoothing out the demand curve is far more difficult. Most fleet operations already smooth the demand curve due to maintenance concerns (if you have exactly the number of busses you need, you run into a problem when one breaks), so it's possible that doing so for power charging wouldn't impose much (if any) additional burden. However, individual vehicle owners don't normally 'smooth their demand curve' in this fashion so the cost of doing so to gain marginal benefits in terms of power costs is almost certainly counterproductive.</p></div>		</li>
