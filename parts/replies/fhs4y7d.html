			<div class="markdown"><p>100g chocolate is 540 kcal. You can heat up 540L (142 gallons) water +1 Celcius (1.6 F) with that much energy. When you think that 1kg (2.2 lbs) fat has around 7000 kcal, we have way more energy to spend on survival instead of dying from hypothermia to conserve energy.</p>
<p>For protein denaturation you need to have 40+ C (104 F) fever which is very rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, when we reach unacceptably low levels of cold for a conscious human, our bodies actually do try to warm themselves up, through shivering, where your muscles make tiny movements to generate heat through friction, to warm the body.</p></div>		</li>
