			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. If we do not achieve sufficient sleep, we accrue a &quot;sleep debt&quot;, which is measurable in terms of cognitive performance and degree of sleepiness. If we are sufficiently sleep-deprived during the week, and try to catch up over the weekend, we may not pay back this sleep debt, and still have evidence of cognitive dysfunction or sleepiness on Monday morning.</p></div>		</li>
