			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Only thing you can do is determine who is on the board and vote on decisions at the shareholders meeting. Those are the only things you can do directly.</p>
<p>You indirectly steer the business unless you put yourself on the board. Then you have direct input on a lot of things.</p>
<p>Now this is all based on if the company bylaws allow it, for instance it is possible to have it in the bylaws that if you have 50% of the shares, you can only determine 50% of the board. </p>
<p>And to top it all off, you have to have shares that have voting rights. Many businesses have the voting shares owned by a small group of people and non voting shares are publicly traded and issued by the business. For instance with Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin have over 50% of the shares with voting rights, but they don't own over 50% of the total shares.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. You can have bylaws that require x% of the shares to vote yes to change the bylaws. For example like 60% must vote yes to bylaw changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I think you are talking theoretically.   I was talking in reality.</p>
<p>If you own 51% of the voting shares of any company, couldn't you just tell the board that you will downvote anything they want to do unless they do what YOU want also?  It seems you could wield that as a very large stick and force the board to do whatever you wanted until you could elect yourself to the board.   Or you could just pack the board with your sycophants and have them do your bidding.   Either way the result is the same, isn't it?   I think everything in my original answer still holds true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, as a share holder, the only time that you can downvote anything is when something is put to a vote at the annual general meeting(AGM). In the mean time the board can do anything it wants. Even if you pack the board, they can do whatever they want till they are removed from the board which requires a vote at the AGM.</p></div>		</li>
