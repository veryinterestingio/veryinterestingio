			<div class="markdown"><p>You misunderstand. It's not about what makes you happy that determines whether you're an introvert at all. It's not about liking books or being alone. Rather, it's about needing alone time to recharge emotional energy levels.</p>
<p>In short, it's about what drains you, not what makes you happy. </p></div>		</li>
