			<div class="markdown"><p>My good boy passed away 9 months ago.</p>
<p>On the day it happened, I inadvertently kept myself super busy.</p>
<p>After we got back from the vet in the morning, I started running errands. I went to my friends house and played some games, came home late and went to bed.</p>
<p>The next morning when I woke up and came down stairs, I burst into tears. Like ugly tears.</p>
<p>It was the shock of coming downstairs and not seeing him on his bed wagging his tail waiting for food and cuddles. I realised he was actually gone.</p>
<p>I still look at pictures of him every day and I still cup my car keys when I pick them up so they don't make noise because he would get excited and want to come to work with me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog was put down in April last year, she was allergic to all sorts of things, and we had to bathe her every day, and she also could only eat one kind of food. We figured it was worth it, but the came the news that she had cancer. When my family went to the Vet, I had to work. I cried by my desk when I got the <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/YubdOcy" target="_blank">last picture</a> . But the biggest heartbreak was when I got home and there was no dog looking down the stairs waiting for me...</p></div>		</li>
