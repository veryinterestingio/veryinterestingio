			<div class="markdown"><p>Should be noted that often a significant percentage of the people who worked on VFX and CGI don’t even get their name in the credits. You’ll see credits like “additional VFX by <em>Studio Name</em>”, and that covers maybe 10-20 extra names who simply are not shown. Even if a studio does get artist names into the credit, ther will be a limit on how many names the studio is allowed to submit for the credits, and at least some people are left out.</p></div>		</li>
