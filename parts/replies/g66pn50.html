			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that is all part of panspermia. Our guess is that Venus used to have water oceans an was more habitable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such a cool possibility on the surface, but really disappointing to me if it actually is how life got to the solar system because it doesn't get us any closer to the actual _origin_ of life. My dream is to find additional life in our solar system that is not DNA/RNA-based; life that could only exist if it originated on its own, separate from the life on Earth. How amazing would it be if life started TWICE (or more) around a single star? It would make the idea of a lonely universe far less likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Or it emerged on another planet, perhaps outside the solar system. If we are ever so lucky as to get a sample we might be able to determine whether it was likely due to panspermia but we cannot be sure. Just because we only know of a single form of life on Earth doesn't mean there were not other forms which were out-competed in the distant path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The calculation assumes an asteroid passing through the atmosphere and striking a stationary object (microbe) would accelerate that stationary object to asteroid speeds over 100m. To me, that seems totally implausible. Does that seem plausible to anyone and why?</p></div>		</li>
