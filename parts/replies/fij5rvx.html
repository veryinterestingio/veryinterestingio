			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why also when we give blood transfusions in some critical cases ( like hypertensive patients, renal failure and heart failure patients) we always tend to give some sort of diuretics ( which will flush liquids out from the kidneys ) and by that, we get only the needed components of the blood transfusion ( the red blood cells/ hemoglobin, etc. ).</p>
<p>Another fun/not so fun fact, an excessive liquid accumulation in the body, an important amount of liquids can, besides getting you into heart failure, can also blow your cells up which will eventually cause death. It's called water intoxication.</p></div>		</li>
