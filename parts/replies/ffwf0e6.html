			<div class="markdown"><p>Devil's advocate here. Prior to that discovery, we'd discovered fire, wheels, language, textiles, medicine, agriculture, domestication, cheese, etc.</p>
<p>I don't think it's ever legitimate to claim any one discovery is definitively the most important, unless it's cats. Discovering cats is the most important discovery in history.</p>
<p>I know you could also argue that some of those examples are developments or inventions rather than discoveries, but what is a development or invention if not the discovery that something works? Arguably all inventions are inevitable given even opportunity for discovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For now, not much. It means that we understand how the world works a little bit better. But historically these kind of things (basic science) have turned out to affect the world in ways that could never have been predicted. If you are reading this comment on a cell phone you are using thousands of separate components that could not be explained without science that at the turn of the last century was brand new entirely theoretical with no obvious direct &quot;use&quot; for society outside the science community</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone still reading the comments, you can probably stop here. The vast majority of the rest are snarky quips and lamentation that the LHC is basically a waste of money and doesn’t provide tangible benefit to the average person (which is an incredibly cynical and reductive view of scientific discovery imo).</p></div>		</li>
