			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer, there is indeed a lot of misinformation in other parts of this post.</p>
<p>Its worth noting that traditional bar soap is typically alkaline with pH in the 9-10 range.  The majority of bacteria thrive in neutral or slightly acidic conditions, so the alkalinity of typical bar soap prevents bacterial growth to some degree.</p>
<p>The same does not apply to most liquid surfactants like shower gel or hand wash, which is one reason that all commercial liquid soap formulations (even those not marketed as antimicrobial) include small amounts of antimicrobial or bacteriostatic preservatives (ie parabens, isothiazolinones, etc).  But as mentioned above this does not imply sterility.. preservatives are there primarily to impede microbes from replicating and adversely affecting the formulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Traditionally, African black soap is made of palm ash and the ash of other burned plant material, mixed with shea and cocoa butters. It is known as a pretty effective antiseptic and is traditionally used in conjunction with other remedies to treat conditions such as ringworm and tinea corporis, as well as eczema and psoriasis in homeopathic traditional medicine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CDC tested used soap bars from hotels and found zero bacteria on them. I did charity work that melted down used soap bars and made into “new” soap bars to send to African countries. The only unsanitary items on the soap was pubic hairs. Apparently this soap is saving thousands of lives from dysentery and other diseases. No I didn’t volunteer again for this charity as the endless picking of pubic hairs from the soap was not my cup of tea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As I said, viruses and exotic bacteria can hibernate on them. But most bacteria will get their cell walls dissolved from the soap (or they'll just dry out).</p>
<p>Anyway, &quot;finding&quot; is a bit of an inaccurate adjective. It's usually tested by putting some on cultures and incubating them. If you'd do a PCR, you'd probably still find plenty of bacterial DNA, so basically the remnants of living bacteria. You'd also probably find viral DNA and RNA.</p></div>		</li>
