			<div class="markdown"><p>No genetically we are indeed closer to chimpanzees no matter how you turn it. </p>
<p>This simply stems from the fact that our common ancestor with chimps lived around 6 million years ago and the common ancestor of Gorilla and the Chimp/Human ancestor lived 10 million years ago.</p>
<p>Unless you specifically craft the method to find genes that are similar for humans and gorillas but not chimps. Every &quot;fair method&quot; will find we are closer to chimpanzees</p></div>		</li>
