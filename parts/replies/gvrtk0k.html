			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also a great question to follow up with, unfortunately it’s really hard to properly explain it like an ELI5. But I’ll try to explain it both ways.</p>
<p>ELI5: Mere exposure doesn’t just work with individual songs, but also as I mentioned genres. So if you like country, you may like a new country song with your first listen to it. </p>
<p>What about a song in a genre I haven’t heard before, and liking it the first time?</p>
<p>Mere exposure will also work on individual musical elements, common in all genres</p>
<p>Why are there cross genre elements strong enough for me to like a new one?</p>
<p>This is about as far as I can go with the ELI5, everything further down is gonna involve some light music theory (I’ll try my best to simplify it)</p>
<p>I mentioned in my previous post towards the end about how most people are exposed to very small amounts of the musical spheres, compared to the larger picture in our world. Specifically I mentioned different music systems.</p>
<p>I’m gonna bet that all of the music you’ve listened to in your life fits snugly into what we know as Western Music. This is the musical sphere that everything from Mozart to Katy Perry belongs in. </p>
<p>So what is Western Music?</p>
<p>Western Music is a set of traditions and understandings about music, which over time solidified and made itself the standard as a musical system in Europe, as well as regions where European cultures were spread to. </p>
<p>Western music has a few base ‘rules’ to it (they are not actually rules, but for the sake of learning let’s pretend that they are) that make it its own system. Tuning is the first, it has a 12 tone equal temperament (12tet) which means it has 12 notes all tuned to be the same distance apart. This wasn’t true back in the beginning of western music, but it established itself strongly, and is now part of its very core.</p>
<p>Scales and harmonic functions of chords and notes on them are also assigned in a unique way for the western musical system. Like a V - I, or a Ti - Do, or a Major vs Minor. This gets complicated quickly as there are many exceptions, scales, and functions, but overall there is a base understanding of how music from a pitch/harmony perspective work, and how to use them. Even in people who aren’t trained musicians, but are in bands follow the ‘rules’ without knowing it, it’s just so ubiquitous in the west.</p>
<p>And for a long time, rhythm, was structured in a way where the strongest beat was on beats 1&amp;3, or just 1 when in a different time signatures, for most of Classical music’s history. </p>
<p>Come 20th century, Jazz slightly changed and added a lot to these traditions, and set up Western Music for its later half, which now all of the ‘popular’ music in the last 100yrs owes itself to, as they develop these new concepts to make new music. This is why making the jump from post Jazz to classical can be hard for some individuals.</p>
<p>These traits in music are basically universal in western culture, and that means that all western music has a common link(s). Other cultural regions and their musical systems are different in one or multiple ways (think tuning, they could sound out of tune to us, but in tune to them).</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with anything? Well because you are familiar with western music (mere exposure) making the jump from one western genre to another western genre, isn’t that big of a difference, and is why you can like a new song/genre on the first try. Some genres don’t even have any musical difference between each other (from a theory perspective) but only contextual and cultural ones. Making them easy for listeners from one to listen to the other.</p>
<p>Many people who try to listen to non-western music have a far harder time liking it. They may think it sounds ‘out of tune’ or dissonant, or have a hard time feeling the rhythm, or a hard time to hum along with it. Of course, some will love the chance to listen to something completely new, in a way genres cannot be, and some may like the sound of something ‘exotic’ (this is what happened when Jazz music first entered the scene, and it is a racist view on things, but unfortunately a true explanation for some people).</p>
<p>TLDR; you have been exposed to western music your whole life, and western music has the same ‘rules’ so it is easy to switch between western genres and like them.</p>
<p>Idk if this is the best explanation, music history isn’t my strongest, but it does play a large role into things here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's the best answer so far, even if I kinda disagree. The more I hear a song the bigger are the chances I dislike it, the first time hearing a song I like is the best time, after that it gets  more and more repetitive. The first time hearing a song I don't like is the easiest one to not get annoyed. I understand how your concept is working for a genre but not for individual songs in my opinion. And like I said nostalgia is a thing for sure like what you grow up to and what kind of memories you connect with something but in my experience I started to enjoy music nobody I know listened to when I discovered music for myself as a kid. I only knew children songs and the stuff my family heard that just existed but wasn't more, I wouldn't just sit there hearing it or be like &quot;Can I hear that please?&quot; but after I found stuff like Linkin Park (as the most known example) it was like scratching an itch I don't know it exist. I listened to many different music before and after but just a few genres really stuck with me and I don't know why especially them. It's hard to explain that's why I asked this question.</p>
<p>I like that analogy, good job!</p></div>		</li>
