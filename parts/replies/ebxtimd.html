			<div class="markdown"><p>Gluons are force carriers for the strong force. The strong force is a force between two things with color (quarks). Color is just another  inherent property of a particle (e.g. Spin, charge, etc.) and has nothing to do with the everyday concept of color (i.e. The color that we see). It's called color because there are 3 different states like we have the 3 primary colors (along with the 3 anti-states). </p>
<p>On a very basic level, it's not much different from charge, there's just a lot more options (Red, blue, green, and anti red, antiblue, and antigreen) and some specific rules quarks have to follow. </p></div>		</li>
