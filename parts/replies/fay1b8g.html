			<div class="markdown"><p>Air attenuates high energy photons very effectively, so essentially all of the energy from a gamma ray burst (GRB) will be absorbed in the upper atmosphere. Radiation received on the ground is mostly due to lower energy UV photons produced in air showers. The total dose from these is expected to be low, with around 1% (large error bars here) of the total energy making it to the ground in a best case scenario. Aerosols like clouds and smoke scatter and absorb UV very effectively and will greatly reduce this value.</p>
<p>The primary danger that GRBs could pose is ozone depletion by nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced during air showers. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0505472.pdf" target="_blank">Simulations</a> suggest that the extent of depletion depends primarily on the total fluence, but is also affected by season and direction of the GRB. There is significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in long-term effects as well. Due to the long atmospheric lifetime of NOx, this effect lasts much longer than the actual burst itself — full recovery may take up to 10–12 years. During this time UVB flux on the ground may reach dangerous levels, especially for terrestrial life. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005GL023073" target="_blank">Additional effects</a> may arise from production of photochemical smog by NOx, resulting in decreased solar irradiance at the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>All of these effects are fairly uncertain as they are based on models with lots of assumptions in the inputs. However what is clear is that the prompt radiation from a GRB will not lead to instant death for anyone but astronauts in space, so you can safely ignore the other answers claiming that everyone will melt from the inside or be roasted alive.</p></div>		</li>
