			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but a stock like Tesla isn't based on anything quantifiable. </p>
<p>It's 100% hype driven and Elon Musk is a very good hype man.</p>
<p>There is no reason for Tesla to be valued where it is other than because people want to buy the stock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is right now but all it takes is one major snafu for the stock prices to plummet and the value of the company to tank. </p>
<p>With the value being base on the stock value all that means is that people are trading the stocks at a high price. That can easily change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you are thinking about companies that can shape the future of civilization do you think of Toyota BMW or GM? Many people believe that electric power vehicles are the future of transportation. Not only that but Tesla is not only a car company but people are expecting them to continue to revolutionize batteries which gives it a lot more potential than just &quot;selling cars&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the future of civilization is some grandeur. </p>
<p>I don't think any of these companies can shape the future of civilization. There are only few companies right now that I would say that of with the number one being google. </p>
<p>Tesla also doesn't even have the market share in electric cars to claim dominating that market. And it is not like they have no competition. </p>
<p>Seems like an awful lot of hype driving stock price</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you actually think that Toyota or any of the other big auto corps don't have world changing tech, you're kidding yourself.</p>
<p>Toyota has the all the tech, better funded RND and a nearly unlimited budget compared to Tesla for example. The VAG group is bringing out it's electric cars that are better than Tesla in every way.Most large auto-corps have their hands in thousands of other companies that are almost entirely RND for cutting edge tech. You really think Toyota isn't ready to revolusionise battery tech? The thing is with these big auto groups is they value reliability over hotboi performance. As someone who is actually in the industry I see Tesla as a wonderful proof of concept, I can't wait to see how the actual titans of industry are going to refine it. Personally I see the Volks-Audi group, Toyota and Geely as the ones that will continue to revolutionise the transport industry.</p>
<p>Tesla is nothing special except the hypeman at the helm as managed to convince people that this young and massively volatile company is somehow better than the actual titans of automotive and battery design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just about the cars. Tesla's batteries on the small scale, and on the large industrial scale are in there too. So are the home solar installations. And the power wall.</p>
<p>The stock market is largely a reputation lottery, and one of the questions in the entire equation is how much the assets are worth versus the stock price. Basically they're constantly asking the question how much would I get if the company closed today and we had to liquidate the assets.</p>
<p>Then there's the volatility of a company. A company that's too stable ends up with an exactly stable stock price.</p>
<p>Most car companies are also diversified. I can't remember which one but I think one of the major car companies also makes jet engines. I think GM maybe? And I know there's at least oneEuropean car company that makes jet engines as well.</p>
<p>So you take the total value of the company and compare it to the total number of stocks issued and then factor in the likelihood of growth and that kind of gets you what the stock price is supposed to be.</p>
<p>Of course the stock market is pure gambling and speculation. The only time a stock has any actual value is when the company decides to buy it back at a particular price. At any other moment you're just looking at The price you expect other people might buy your stock from you.</p>
<p>The stock market is actually sort of a weird fiction on which we base our entire economy. In the initial stock offering people are making a loan to the company in exchange for a little ticket called a stock. The company only pays back that loan if they do a stock buyback. From the moment of initial sale to the moment of buyback The value of the stock is only in the value other people might discourage to acquire your particular ticket.</p>
<p>In this way the stock market is just a reputation lottery. For every person who believes the stock price is going to go down there's another person who needs to believe that it's going to go up and both people need a willingness to exchange money for the ticket.</p>
<p>That's why finding out a company CEO has had a sex scandal can cause a stock price to crash even though nothing about the company's actual business has changed at all.</p>
<p>Preferred stock sometimes issues a dividend, so large old stable companies offer some value to actually owning the stock.</p>
<p>And without the overall belief that the company is worth more whatever that means there's no reason to have the stock price go up except for the fact that it makes the stock price go up.</p>
<p>The other part is that if the company suddenly folds collapses closes or otherwise shutters its doors a certain amount of the money goes to each stockholder based on the number of tickets they have. This rarely happens.</p>
<p>So buying and selling stock isn't really a way to make money off of a company it's a way to make money off of other people who are buying and selling stock.</p>
<p>It's a weird creepy game of poker.</p></div>		</li>
