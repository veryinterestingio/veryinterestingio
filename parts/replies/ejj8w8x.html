			<div class="markdown"><p>That's also partly because &quot;colored&quot; has a very negative connotation, as it was frequently used in Jim Crow legislation/signage as a sort of &quot;polite&quot; means of using the N word.</p>
<p>While basically the same, &quot;person of color&quot; has no such negative background associated with. </p>
<p>Calling someone black, or a &quot;black person&quot; is typically neutral, assuming you don't follow it up with some really racist statement. But calling someone &quot;a black&quot; was also pretty common back in the day, and really gets to that dehumanizing aspect the comment above us mentioned. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, calling someone Asian, or &quot;an Asian&quot; is typically considered neutral, compared to how they used to be referred to as &quot;Yellow,&quot; or &quot;chinaman.&quot; This is actually interesting, because when we discuss an African American's skin color it is typically fine, but bringing up an asian's at all is considered very racist and impolite. There used to be a term, Banana, which described a person who was &quot;Asian&quot; (their race) on the outside but white on the inside (they conformed to western culture, norms, etc.)</p>
<p>White people, or caucasians if you want to quote demographics, have never experienced large-scape systematic racial oppression in the form of derogatory language, mostly because we were speaking English natively when we came here, not to mention holding all of the levers of power and authority. Since we make the &quot;rules&quot; of our language and society, no one can turn it against us, so to speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for saying this. People sometimes jump at the chance to use inconsistent language rules as proof that &quot;PC culture promotes discrimination against white males&quot;, when actually there is more to words than just their literal meanings</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good summary. I would like to add that calling all Black people African American can upset some people. As there are very dark skin people from South America that may be considered Black but are not African American. There are also Indian people who have darker skin than most African Americans but wouldn't like to be called Black or African American. Basically the whole naming thing is bound to piss someone off. But if you speak with genuine respect for others you should be ok. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be really bad at this. I would only call them chinese, and not the specific kind of chinese they are.  I didn't know that some chinese people were from vietnam and some from japan and some from tokyo etc. I had a chinese neighbor who was from korea who always got upset when I called him chinese, so I learned to be more respectful and call chinese people by the specific country they are from.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's also routinely enforced in healthcare to refer to specific patients in the same way. For example, the &quot;patient with COPD&quot; vs the &quot;COPD patient&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
