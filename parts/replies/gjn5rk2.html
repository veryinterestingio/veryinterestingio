			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been in IT for years and the number of friends I have to berate into updating their graphics drivers is astounding. One group had it solidified when the new game they all got was running at like 5 FPS and they couldn't figure out why. It'd been years since they updated their graphics drivers. They all couldn't believe &quot;a single DRIVER UPDATE will fix this&quot;. Well it did. Suddenly the game was running like intended and I had 3 converts on my hands to the church of regularly updating your graphics drivers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My method is to check maybe 2 times a month, but also, if there's a new game I'm downloading, pre loading, etc, that's usually the best time to get an update.</p>
<p>As for Windows, w10 should handle it's own updates for you at an acceptable turnaround. Unless you specifically told it not to</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get why people wouldn't do it... In the case of my graphics drivers, it's like 5 to 10 minutes of <em>background</em> work, and like two times a few seconds of foreground stuff, not 10 seconds in total. On top of this, it automatically checks for updates, so I don't even have to do this !</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just let Windows Update do its thing, for the majority of drivers. Graphics drivers you may want to periodically check their site or use GeForce Experience to automatically check for updates (for NVIDIA cards; not sure what the equivalent is for AMD cards, but I'm sure there is one) but you'll still usually be fine with just the drivers from Windows Update.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're having issues with <em>any</em> device, go to the manufacturer's site and get the latest drivers directly from there. Windows Update does lag behind a bit, so if you think a driver update will solve your issue then go straight to the source.</p></div>		</li>
