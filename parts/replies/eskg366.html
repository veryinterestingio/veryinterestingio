			<div class="markdown"><p>In more detail, the Thea (moon) impact added iron into the mantle.  The mantle convects moving that iron around and creating the magnetic field.  I don't believe any of this has been proven, but is generally accepted as true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My hypothesis is that its related to the lack of rotation. One day on Venus is nearly 117 Earth days in length. You need liquid metals sloshing about inside the core of the planet to be able to sustain a magnetic field of the same strength earth has. Even if it were liquid, if Venus’ core is just sitting there motionless, then it shouldn’t make a strong magnetic field. On earth, we have convection and tidal forces with the moon and sun that contribute to stirring things inside the planet. With Venus’ extremely slow rotation, you’d be relying on convection currents alone to generate a magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is important to note that, contrary to popular belief, dynamo theory does not credit the smallness of the magnetic moment to the slow rotation of Venus... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conjecture that
Venus has no dynamo because of its slow rotation is implausible because the Coriolis
force is dynamically important. As explained in [4] (and see figure 17), the slower rotation may even help the onset of dynamo action.</p>

<p>The second source is excellent and well-worth the read if you have the time.</p></div>		</li>
