<p>But in the end it's probably like most other human traits. There is very little about us that comes from one single gene, almost all of who we are is a complicated interaction of multiple genes, life experiences and environmental influences. Thus from a genetic or epigenetic perspective there may be a number of genes involved in homosexuality, but they will only increase or decrease the chance someone will be gay, not definitively ensure they are gay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear the &quot;there is no 'gay gene'&quot; thing isn't that sexual orientation has no genetic component. It's that there is no identifiable <em>single</em> gene that people can point to. </p>
<p>That doesn't contradict other studies which show a range of genes which may contribute to sexual orientation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But that's kind of misleading. It's very rare for a single gene to give rise to any particular trait, least of all something behavioural.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's only misleading because it's trying to dissuade the idea of a direct genetic link to homosexuality. The use of the phrase is only because of the theory that it could be linked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess what that really means is sexuality really is in fact a spectrum. Or actually rather, perhaps there is a gene or set of genes always absent in gay people rather than always there? And both kinds of genes would be there in bisexual people? And maybe asexual people have none of the sexual variants of genes at all?</p></div>		</li>
