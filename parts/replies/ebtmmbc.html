			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just babies, but there are people who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed and cannot receive vaccines. Examples include cancer patients, organ transplant recipients, people with genetic immunodeficiencies.  </p>
<p>Edit: and there are some vaccines that pregnant women can't receive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was vaccinated as a child, but got cancer as an adult and had a bone marrow transplant (autologous stem cell transplant).  This removes all learned immunity.  I‚Äôve been revaccinated for some things, but nothing with a live virus, so I‚Äôm still vulnerable to MMR.  I need herd immunity to keep me safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also some people (like myself) are immunosuppressed so even though we‚Äôre vaccinated, we can get very sick pretty easily from someone who is carrying an illness. I tend to get flus a few times a year even with the vaccines. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to throw it out there, adults need to get boosters, too. Health Canada showed that only 10% of adults are actually up to date on their vaccines. Td (or just TDAP) is one you need to get every 10 years, and a few others are recommended if your immunity waned (and no harm in getting a booster anyway).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also people who legitimately <em>can't</em> be vaccinated, due to things like allergies to substances in specific vaccines. Herd immunity is important for their sake too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a selfish standpoint. Herd immunity is easily the most important element there. The last thing I want is for my neighbour to become infected and the pathogen to evolve within him/her to become resistant to the vaccine I was given and then there be a titanic epidemic as a result.</p></div>		</li>
