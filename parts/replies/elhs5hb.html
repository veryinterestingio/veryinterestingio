			<div class="markdown"><p>Wind energy, particularly offshore wind energy, has progressed a lot in the last 20 years, with the cost reduced significantly.  Marine energy is expected to follow the same pattern.  European studies have suggested the levelized cost of energy with be in the range EUR 0.17/kWh and EUR 0.23/kWh by 2020.  As arrays are developed and the supply chain becomes more established, the costs will be reduced further.  While the cost is unlikely to be lower than offshore wind energy, other benefits, such as predictability and low visual intrusion, are likely to make the value proposition for marine energy overall.</p>
