<p>I don't know enough about the single-atom catalysis field except for some papers I have seen pass by my desk at <a href="https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/chemical-science/" target="_blank">Chemical Science</a>, where I am an Associate Editor. I think if you can build a large-enough dataset (perhaps of \~1000-10,000 structures) you may be able to make some nice models for it.</p>
<p>There are a few recommendations I made to others in some threads for books (the book by Jan Jensen) and some blogs. Check the other answers for them.</p>
<p>About Kebotix, absolutely, there should be a jobs section where you can apply for internships. We are always open to getting applications for them both at Kebotix and at Zapata Computing (for the people interested in quantum computing).</p>
<p>Good luck with your PhD Studies,</p>
<p>Best,</p>
