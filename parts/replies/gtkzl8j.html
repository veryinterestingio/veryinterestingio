			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody wants to inject drugs at first, but after a while your tolerance builds up so much that you have no option but to use a needle since other methods of consumption (smoking, snorting) aren’t anywhere near as strong as injecting. Plus, withdrawals are so bad that after a while you simply don’t care and will do anything to get high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assumed people always used needles. </p>
<p>So drug dealers offer a different form of heroin to new people to smoke and snort. Then give them the needle form, when they want a stronger hit.</p>
<p>Ok, makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can swallow heroin, smoke it, snort it, boof it (rectally) and inject. A lot of drugs can be consumed in many different ways, but all roads lead to the needle for many addicts since it provides the most immediate and strongest rush (goes directly into bloodstream). </p>
<p>And yes, usually new heroin users start out smoking or snorting. Then once the effects aren’t as strong as they’d like them to be, they start injecting. But even injecting after a while loses its efficacy, and at a certain point you’re not even getting high anymore, but just doing it so you don’t get sick from the withdrawals. Then you can turn to stronger opiates like fentanyl, certain research chemicals, but at that point you’re literally on deaths door.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They sell the same heroin you just prepare it differently. Snorting you crush it into fine powder. Smoking you burn it on tin ”chasing” the smoke with a tin-pipe or whatever. Injecting you dissolve the heroin with ascorbic acid in a heatet spoon an injejt the resulting solution. The biggest difference is the amount of heroin needed to get high. Snorting has the worst bio availability and smoking ”wastes” some heroin. Injecting requires the least amount for the biggest effect making it optimal. When money start to run out you want to get the most out of the small you have.</p></div>		</li>
