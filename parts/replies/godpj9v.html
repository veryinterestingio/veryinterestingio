			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. Also it seems to be coded in Grey code which is useful for position encoding &amp;  can be useful during initiation of a partial shredding. This pattern is often used in position encoders of shafts on motors, robotic arms, etc...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall learning about Grey code an age ago, in a Air Force tech-school back when counters were made with transistors.  Only one bit changes in each transition reducing power spikes.  For encoders it reduces the chance to confuse states because one bit transitioned just before another.  ðŸ˜Š</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A compass pattern is still very symmetrical.  If the parachute was rapidly turning, twisting, etc, it might not be clear which specific spoke was the source of a tear or other problem.  They wanted a high contrast pattern that was easy to do with nothing more than the choice of fabric color for that cell.  Historically, the highest speed cameras have been black &amp; white, so two colors were enough.</p></div>		</li>
