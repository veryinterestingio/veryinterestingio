<p>First, you're right. In the ideal world where &quot;<em>if you die, you become a fossil</em>&quot;, it's much easier to preserve the <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0895/0864/products/42-18438715_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1565834618" target="_blank">immense skull of a <em>Carcharodontosaurus</em> than a pitiful skull of a human</a>, which has a pretty respectable size already. </p>
<p>Then you have to add that this ideal world doesn't exist. Fossilisation occurs under very specific conditions. Most of the famous palaeontological formations (you may have heard about Morrison, Hell Creek, Nemegt, Dinosaur Park, Kem Kem Beds or Dashanpu) were either fluvial or coastal, because that's where fossilisation happens the easiest. As you may imagine, there are many more biomes and ecosystems outside of those, so finding a well preserved fossil in a former jungle is rather hard. And then you have to consider that the once savannah is now a jungle or an ocean, or glaciers eroded the soil during an ice age (which is what happened to the Appalachia fossils from the Creataceous, we barely have records of dinosaurs from New Jersey).</p>
<p>And finally, bones themselves. Not every animal has/had bones. <em>Megalodon</em> had a bony jaw only, everything else was a non-fossilsable cartilage, and that was a pretty big fish. Imagine everything else that didn't have bone and was never preserved.</p></div>		</li>
