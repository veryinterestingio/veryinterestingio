			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow LEO satcom person here. Doing doppler turnaround on the space vehicle is getting more common, and a lot of TTC radios at least are designed to track out the carrier over the expected doppler shift of the orbit (though this can increase lock time and in TDM half duplex systems gets frustrating) and then maintain lock across the pass as your doppler rates shift.</p>
<p>I had a customer on their initial OPs forget to widen out the tracking bandwidth on their ground segment modem... We thought we had a problem with the downlink, turns out it was them only getting the bird when it's doppler shift was near min from Fc. </p></div>		</li>
