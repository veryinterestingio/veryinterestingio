<p>This does not include the theater or distributor's cut. In the US, you'll get about 50% of box office gross back. Internationally, it's more like 40%.</p>

<p>Because Warner Bros had theaters over a barrel, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com./2020/09/06/movies/tenet-box-office.html" target="_blank">they actually got a much better cut from <del>Tenant</del> Tenet:</a></p>

<p>Ticket sales are typically split 50-50 between studios and cinemas, but Warner Bros. was able to negotiate a 65 percent share, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense. Cinemas shouldn't be making more than half the gross, they're only displaying the movies and the upkeep (especially in big chains) isn't really a lot, covid aside.</p>
<p>When you add the food and beverage cost to the equation, cinemas have been actually ripping off both studios and customers for years. Get fucked imo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, however cinemas still have some pretty big costs.</p>
<p>For example, to build a theater can easily be millions in addition to the land. They also have property taxes and sales tax and employee/employer taxes, as well as many others I'm forgetting about. Further, they're usually under obligation to show movies at specific times regardless of how many people are there. There are many times when a theater will struggle to make money for weeks, only to be saved when a huge blockbuster comes out.</p>
<p>Not defending big chains like AMC. They can get fucked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's too bad independent cinemas are very rare. I've always wondered if they have been pushed out because of exclusivity deals or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth pointing out that just making some profit–at any stage–isn't the threshold for success. </p>
<p>If you throw several hundred million dollars at something then you want to get as much as you can out of it.  If you dedicate X% of theater screens to showing that movie then you want to get as much as you can out of that.  If you tie up Y% of the actors, directors, writers, editors, etc that are available you want to get the most profit possible out of those resources. </p>
<p>These opportunity costs are what set the threshold of what success looks like.  If your movie makes $50 million when a better written one could have made $100 million with the same resources then it underperformed. Obviously a movie that takes a loss overall is always a financial failure, but even movies that profit can be financial disappointments.</p></div>		</li>
