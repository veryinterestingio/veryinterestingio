			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting issue about time has arisen on another mission which startled me the first time we encountered it.  The STEREO mission had two spacecraft that were traveling in opposite directions around the Sun from Earth.  But the light travel time from the Sun to the two spacecraft and to Earth could be significantly different depending upon which side of the Sun the event occurred and which direction it was traveling.  It raised the issue of what is meant by simultaneous events. - Russ Howard</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was that related to simultaneous communication from earth to the spacecraft or was the time distortion experienced locally on the spacecraft?</p>
<p>The relative direction the spacecraft was traveling changed the distortion? Why would that matter?</p></div>		</li>
