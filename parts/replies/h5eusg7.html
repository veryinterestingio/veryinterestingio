			<div class="markdown"><p>It was built by scientists, then the lobby groups came in and changed in considerably and eventually caused withdrawal of the pyramid. Especially the grain lobby had a bizarre influence... when the nutritionists handed off their pyramid, it only contained whole grains; the final version (after the lobby had their say) contained a few whole grains and mostly highly processed, sugary white stuff like cookies. See for example <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8375951/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8375951/</a> for how shocking this was (no clickbait, proper scientific publication).</p></div>		</li>
