			<div class="markdown"><p>During the REM sleep cycle specifically, your body essentially enters muscle paralysis (if your nervous system is working correctly). </p>
<p>This is also the physiological basis for sleep paralysis that some people experience, where they essentially wake up from REM sleep and are temporarily stuck in a state where for several seconds they are frozen or can't move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way that individuals experience or describe sleep paralysis is often influenced by cultural context and norms. But yes, one of the most commonly-reported subjective interpretations is that there is a &quot;demon&quot; or other creature sitting on their chest, making them unable to move or struggle. </p>
<p>Absolutely freaky the way our brains try to backfill coherent narratives or explanations for specific physical situations. Part of the reason sleep paralysis seems to be so terrifying for people is that your brain is literally transitioning between dreams and reality when it happens, coming out of REM sleep, and logical reasoning is sort of scrambled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In college my friend started a story with &quot;you know how you can't move for a couple of minutes when you first wake up? Like, your paralyzed for a few minutes?&quot; Nobody knew what he was talking about and he had no idea that it wasn't something everyone experiences. ðŸ¤£</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But when it does happen, it is absolutely f*cking terrifying. I have had it happen exactly once in recent memory, and the only reason it didn't freak me out more was because I have a neuroscience background and was quickly able to rationalize that it was sleep paralysis, and that I just needed to let it pass.</p>
<p>But I still remember that, coming out of REM sleep while I was frozen, I saw a shadowy figure looming over me like they were trying to kill me. Coming out of REM sleep, your brain is literally shifting gears between sort of the random-fire &quot;paradoxical&quot; electrical brain waves that mimic perception of real life, and perception of actual real-life external stimuli. </p>
<p>Unfortunately there is not a lot of valid scientific  research on this topic, since people don't tend to remember REM sleep well, so self-reported data collection is basically garbage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had that happen to me in college. There was a story that the dorms were haunted. I swore that I woke to a ghost holding me down because I couldnâ€™t move at all. I finally got a yell out and then I was able to move. Scary shit but this makes more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you remain in any relaxed position for a longer period of time your muscles loose circulation and the neurons in your muscle fibre won't fire coordinatively. Are those different things from sleep inertia? I know a little about both but I'm in shallow depths.</p></div>		</li>
