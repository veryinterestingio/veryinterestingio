			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't entirely correct: the immune system doesn't fight the mRNA. The mRNA hijacks cells to produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The immune system then detects this protein as a foreign invader and begins to create antibodies against it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I gave more info in follow ups which actually needed that info. I tried to keep it as simple as possible. Some of the other really good replies have a lot of detail that would just scare some people out of reading them which would prevent the more apprehensive people from learning anything. That's why I went with blocks and holes lol. Sorry, I'll add an edit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. The scientists that engineered the mRNA made a very clever modification based off of another lab's design specifically so that the mRNA will survive the immune system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not 100% sure of this, but it's most likely some combination of cutting down on complexity, possible allergic reactions, and efficient transport into the cells.</p>
<p>To stabilize mRNA in cell, there's various proteins that grab hold of the nucleotides and bundle them up. These proteins will let go when the mRNA is going to be translated in a ribosome. Different mRNA needs different proteins to stabilize it. Different people have different copies of those proteins.</p>
<p>So, by not making the stabilizing proteins, they can reduce the complexity of manufacturing the vaccine. This means more vaccines for cheaper, which is what we need right now.</p>
<p>And, by not including extra foreign material, the immune system is trained on the right stuff. Not to mention, the proteins wouldn't be able to cross cell membranes, so they'd actually inhibit the effectiveness of the vaccines. The proteins would need to release the mRNA, which, requires cofactors to make that happen. Cofactors that are in the cells.</p>
<p>Once the mRNA vaccines are administered, they'll pretty quickly spread out through your body and be taken up by cells. The cells will provide all the necessary machinery for keeping them stable, translating them into proteins, and then releasing said proteins out of the cell for the immune system to analyze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So our cells see this mRNA and naturally assume it needs to be transcribed?   It’s transported easily to ribosomes where the antibody proteins are made?   Or is this mRNA producing foreign protein which then allows our white cells to identify and create the antibodies?  </p>
<p>This is really a whole new level than inactivated, heat killed or weak virus immunity. Imagine a future where the mRNA vaccines are joined to stabilizing proteins and able to be kept in a simple refrigerator and dispensed as an inhaled aerosol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The mRNA for the antigen marker of the virus is injected into your own DNA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slight correction, the mRNA is just absorbed by the cell and enters the cytoplasm where it can be transscribed. It never gets anywhere close to the DNA in the nucleus and is definitely not integrated in the DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>mRNA doesn’t need a whole lot of encouraging to break down.</p>
<p>If you’ve used it in the lab, you may know how diligent you have to be to avoid RNAses which rapidly break RNA down.</p>
<p>They are pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>In other words, you really have to make an effort to get RNA to stick around. The proteins that result from its transcription on the other hand, tend to be much more stable.</p></div>		</li>
