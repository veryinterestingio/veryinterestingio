<p>Otherwise it could pull devices off the tables from the weight of the brick, causing damage that mfrs do not want to warranty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the device, in the US at least, there are regulations on minimum and maximum cord length. </p>
<p>I've been out of the industry 10 years or so, but I know a lot of appliances have a max length of 6 feet. Some kitchen appliances I seem to remember being 18-36 inches for max length. </p>
<p>I didn't do much residential electrical, so I don't recall a lot of the exact differences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The higher the amount of power going through the cord, the shorter it needs to be. Otherwise, too much loss happens and the amount of power needed to be pulled through the cord can cause it, the plug, or the surrounding area to ignite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anything that might be used in a wet environment the power adaptor really needs to be off the ground (I would be very nervous if the wall warts for my shaver and electric toothbrush were on the countertop rather than secured to the power point several inches above the countertop). </p>
<p>For things that are not going to be in wet environments (such as gaming consoles, computers), do feel free to put the power adaptor in the middle of the cord, where they might end up on the floor.</p></div>		</li>
