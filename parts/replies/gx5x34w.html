			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! Sounds like a great project and that you are interested in quantifying tree species, biomass, and/or canopy cover. The tools that you might use depend upon the spatial and temporal scales you are after. For example, if you are interested in a wide-area analysis, you could use time-series data from Landsat-Sentinel in addition to NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI). If you are interested in fine detail (e.g. individual trees), you could use a combination of airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) and/or Structure from Motion (from photogrammetry) to get the structure. Good luck and hope that helps! - Nancy Glenn</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great, thank you for the input. I would be conducting analysis on a scale that is finer in nature. I was hoping to see if there are tools/online resources/open source software that you or your team might utilize that would enable me to calculate an individual tree's capacity to sequester carbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just googled and it said an average hardwood tree can sequester 48 pounds of CO2 a year. Maybe research papers could give you more specific info?</p></div>		</li>
