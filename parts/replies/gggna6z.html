			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another type of adhesion that does not use adhesives. Google &quot;optical contact bonding.&quot; For example, 2 pieces of glass are polished to atom-scale smoothness, then pressed against each other. They are held together via inter-atomic forces. I've seen cases where this bond is actually stronger than the bulk material itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically should work with any material.  My old prof always maintained if you could theoretically get two pieces of steel &quot;PERFECTLY&quot; flat at the atomic level and put them together.  They would instantly &quot;weld&quot; into a single homogenous piece of metal.  Not just held together by vacuum, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'll work with any metal, its called cold welding and works because metallic bonding is really just a whole bunch of <del>demoralised</del> delocalised electrons that attract the metal ions and hold the structure together. If two pieces of metal come together the electrons have no way of knowing which piece of metal they originally belonged to and will flow between the metals sealing them together. This doesn't happen on earth though because oxides form quickly on the surface of the metal and shield the two metal pieces from one another. </p>
<p>This is mostly to say that it isn't that the metals aren't flat that prevents it, the peices could be very irregularly shaped as long as they were complementary, but instead that its the oxides that metals form that stops it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that's true. Think of it as two pieces of bread, each covered in smooth peanut butter. When joined together, the interface vanishes. Just continuous peanut butter.
In practice, many materials form thin oxide layers that prevent them from touching each other. Think of that as a layer of jelly. But guess what. Jelly sticks to jelly! So we can sometimes perform contact bonding between 2 different materials by coating them with thin layers of oxide like quartz or sapphire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a machinist tool called gauge blocks that are very smooth metal or ceramic and can be stuck together tightly. They're stuck together in a process called wringing where you just slide them together to get air out from between them and it is a very tight bond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3 points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some adhesives (like tape) have liquid that squishes itself into tiny cracks in surfaces and basically gets itself stuck. I'll call this &quot;type 1&quot;</li>
<li>There are other adhesives (like honey) that are sticky because of complicated chemical reactions. With honey specifically, the chemicals in honey like water. There are tiny bits of water in your finger so when honey touches your finger, the honey likes to connect to the water and stay there. This causes the sticky feeling. This is the second type.</li>
<li>Even surfaces that feel smooth to us have tiny cracks that type 1 adhesives can get itself stuck in. For the parts that aren't in cracks, there's a suction cup effect</li>
</ol>
<p>Disclaimer: I don't actually know anything about adhesives. I just simplified the original comment.</p></div>		</li>
