			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't an answer, but lemons have significantly more vitamins and minerals than limes have. This could make fresh lemon juice solution denser than fresh lime juice solution. Unable to find other sources, <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ap815e/ap815e.pdf" target="_blank">FAO/INFOODS Density Database</a> says that lemonade has a greater specific gravity than does lime juice cordial. Of course, there are a lot of variables like added sugar and water. </p>
<p>I wouldn't expect there to be much difference in pulp densities, but an experiment could be one where we swap the pulps into each other's juice.
Another experiment could be one where we filtered the pulp species out of their respective juices and tested their apparent buoyancy in a control solution like tap water. The results would vary with how thoroughly we evacuate the juice vesicles too. </p>
<p>I'm sorry I don't have a better answer.</p></div>		</li>
