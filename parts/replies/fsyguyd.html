<p>am amazed it's that high tbh...    i was thinking it was going to be more like &quot;how many seconds <em>per bit</em>&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that a potentially large amount of that transfer-rate might be redundancies, parity checks etc. lowering the actual useful information throughput further than the stated value.</p>
<p>Unless the value given by them already factored that in.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>From a quick look:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>3.6.2.2 Error-Correcting Coding.</strong> </p>
<p>Like other deep space links, the Voyager telemetry link is subject to noise in the communications channel changing the values of bits transmitted over the channel—in other words, causing bit errors.
Error-correcting coding reduces the rate of errors in the received information that is output.</p>
<p>Such coding increases the redundancy of the signal by increasing the number of bits transmitted relative to the information bit rate. The Golay encoding algorithm used at Jupiter and Saturn required the transmission of one overhead bit for every information bit transmitted (100 percent overhead).</p>
<p>Voyager carried an experimental Reed-Solomon data encoder, expressly for the greater communication range of the Uranus and Neptune phase of the mission. The new Reed-Solomon encoding scheme reduced the overhead to about one bit in five (20-percent overhead) and reduced the bit-error rate in the output information from 5 × 10^–3 to 10^–6 .</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hardware limitations on those old probes are extreme, but humanity hasn't totally lost the art of efficient coding yet.  Designers had the foresight to allow for big chunks of the software to be overwritten after launch.  Engineers still must make due with really modest processing power, but (if not now, at least earlier in these journeys) they could deploy the latest and greatest in algorithms on both ends of the signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dBm and W are both units of power (0 dBm is 1 milliwatt).</p>
<p>Data transfer rate and power are related by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem" target="_blank">Shannon-Hartley Theorem</a>.  Power does not appear directly there -- all that matters is the signal to noise ratio.  (More signal power increases the SNR, but you can also reduce noise to get the same effect.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, more power at a given distance on a given pair of antennas results in higher transfer rates... As long as you don't cook one end of the connection by using too much power. That's not a concern here.</p>
<p>Decibels are used as a measurement of lots of things, but the most common is measuring the gain or directivity of an antenna.something that receives equally well in all directions has a gain of zero, while something that receives things twice as well in one direction as a gain of three decibels.
If I transmit at 50 watts and that 50 watt spreads out in a perfect sphere, that's called isotropic radiation. Now if I put that into a directional antenna tuned for that frequency, I might get an effective radiated power (ERP) it is significantly higher than the power that I'm putting in. If I use an antenna that has 10 decibels of gain, I can basically pretend that I'm transmitting with 10 times as much power, at 500 watts. Typically, a larger antenna will be required to get higher gain values, which result in more directivity. </p>
<p>All of this is just an effort to get sufficient power to the receiving and that they can hear your signal over the background noise, which is really all that's required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tx is the transmitter, Rx is the receiver (in space).</p>
<p>Rx is the receiver sensitivity (how low it can hear transmission)and Tx is the transmitter power (kW is darn strong) Most mobile radios towers on earth transmit between 20-80W for reference.
Most mobile phones have no signal below 137dBm: A 23dB difference means it can sense signals 200 times better than a typical phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Receive (Rx) and Transmit (Tx).</p>
<p>In satellite communications, the receive signal is converted from higher frequency (such as C, X, Ku, or Ka bands) into lower frequency signal (usually L Band) that is transmitted over coax cable by a device called a Low Noise Block (LNB). The power of the signal is measured in dB relative to a reference (1mW for dBm, so a 0.5mW signal would be -3dBm). The transmit signal does the opposite in a device called a Block Up Converter (BUC), these are measured in the transmit power in Watts.</p></div>		</li>
