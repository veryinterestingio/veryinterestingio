			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, Islamic texts standardized Qurashi Arabic (Western Saudi Arabia, coastal Hejaz region) and it is “Modern Standard Arabic.”  Due to extensive oral poetry and written texts in 800 and 900 CE (Islamic golden age) Arabic from that era is exactly like MSA today.</p>
<p>Arabic had several dialects and versions before 600 CE and they still exist in mutated forms.  Mahri Arabic (Eastern Yemen, Western Oman) still exists and they communicate in their language - it is substantially different from MSA and some consider it a different language entirely.</p>
<p>People might not know this but Arabic only existed in the Arabian peninsula before 600 CE and whole tribes emigrated to Egypt, Morocco, eastern Africa and the Levant and Iraq during the Islamic conquest.  Most of these emigrating tribes are not Qurashi and thus speak a different dialect and that became the dialect of the invaded country.</p>
<p>These dialects are not mutated MSA, they use words from the emigrating Arabian tribe and they are all Arabic (except for a few words from the existing languages).  When people put in the effort to learn MSA, they can communicate with everyone in the Arab world.  It is like the English from Liverpool learning standard English to communicate with anyone outside their region.</p>
<p>Also, every Muslim (Turkey, Niger, Pakistan, Indonesia etc) knows some MSA vocabulary and if they learn MSA, they can communicate with each other like the English utopia of the East.</p></div>		</li>
