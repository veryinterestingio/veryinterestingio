			<div class="markdown"><p>Fresh air and sunlight has been proven to help disinfect things. There isn't full understanding why, but it also helps people to recover. (I'm not sure if this has been fully explained yet, tho I'm betting on it.)   </p>
<p>But if you really want to kill things on an object. Put it to pure oxygen environment and blast it with strong UVC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazon has a <em>ton</em> of UVC wands listed.  Mixed in there are a few UVC lamps, suitable (I guess) for turning on in a bathroom on a timer and leaving the room.</p>
<p><strong>None</strong> of the wands have believable ratings (they look like they've just been added.)  The few that have reviews look like the reviews were left by the vendor -- same poor English.</p></div>		</li>
