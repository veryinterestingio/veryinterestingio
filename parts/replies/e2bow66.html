			<div class="markdown"><p>In my mind, &quot;application&quot; or &quot;app&quot; has the connotation of being lightweight and with a more focused function or...application. To me, &quot;program&quot; implies a wider set of functions and features, as well as simply being more demanding of resources. For instance, I'd probably never call Photoshop an app, and I'd never call Spotify or BaconReader a program, even though the reality is they're interchangeable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I'm still a few years out from 30, and I can't stand the whole &quot;app&quot; thing. </p>
<p>To me, an app is a narrow use, small program.  Even the word application means something else to me.  When someone calls something an app that I would normally call a program, it honestly confuses me at first.  Is this what it feels like to get old?</p></div>		</li>
