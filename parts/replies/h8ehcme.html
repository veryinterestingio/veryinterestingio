			<div class="markdown"><p>I had 0 calorie flavored sweet sparkling water every day after work, became a habit of drinking something sweet that when I didnt have something sweet to drink I would crave it. And I used to only drink water. But luckily there is always 0-cal sweet drinks around so the sweet cravings arent such a bad thing</p></div>		</li>
