			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ideas out there in which the universe goes through some kind of cycle, where it has an ending of some sort and then a new Big Bang. I talk about a few of them in my book (<a href="https://www.astrokatie.com/book" target="_blank">www.astrokatie.com/book</a>), including the ekpyrotic scenario, and Conformal Cyclic Cosmology. There's also eternal inflation, which doesn't result in a cycling universe but does result in isolated independent universes sort of popping up out of other universes, forever.</p>
<p>We don't know at the moment if any of these things happen or not.</p></div>		</li>
