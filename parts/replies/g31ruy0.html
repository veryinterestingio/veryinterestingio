			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not satisfied with that because exhaling on your left foot striking the ground is a sure fire way to fix a stitch, or at least in my experience as a runner. I can’t imagine that would impact blood flow being redirected. Personally I think it’s a diaphragm thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could also be that, or even the physical weight of a stomach full of food shaking around putting stress on connective tissue. Sort of an abdominal &quot;shin splints&quot;. As the other top level comment says, medical science isn't 100% certain what causes them. That's why I referred to just a hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could 100% see the “shin splints” thing. It honestly almost feels like that and considering I drink quite a bit before running (water and pre workout) it could easily just be a big bouncing tummy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get a stitch almost every time I run. It can be first thing in the morning when I've not eaten, after days of ensuring I'm hydrated or with a good supply of electrolytes.
Breathing strategies, foot fall strategies... None of it works for me.
When I hit 80% or above my max HR for a couple of km, it comes on near enough every time.
Had an ultrasound and no muscle tears or anything obvious, so I live with it and run much less than I used to (want to).</p>
<p>I've said it many times before. This shit needs to be studied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's about left foot, but more about regulating your breathing. I avoid &quot;stitches&quot; by alternating breaths every three steps (usually in on left, out on right).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, there’s a method to breathing while running?  I’ve just been trying to avoid breathing really fast and that’s it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have found this to be true as well.  When i was in highschool my cross country coach always told me to breathe on the opposite foot of what ever side ached.  It blew my mind when it worked but he was really just teaching me how to breathe.  My breathing is so ingrained to my left foot hitting the ground that if i actively try to change it I will mess myself up and suddenly be out of breath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See I’m actually big into regulating my breathing while running. It’s my form of “meditation” and even still, stitches. I had read that trick online, tried it, and it’s worked ever since. It could easily just be psychosomatic tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get a stitch  coming on when my body needs water whilst out running. Drink a small amount and it goes.</p></div>		</li>
