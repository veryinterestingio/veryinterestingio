			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s interesting. I do find it particularly difficult to draw my saber when I’m wearing my wife’s blouse, but I’d never considered why. TIL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A modern pistol is usually worn on the dominant side but it's possible that a big ol flintlock pistol would've been easier to draw across the body. Just spitballin</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pistol here is in reference to musket pistols and the like. They are too long to be pulled out of a holster on the same side as the hand that pulls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not so much to make drawing easier, but the buttons are supposed to be able to be undone with your left hand while your right is holding your drawn weapon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS. Sword is worn on the left, most will draw it with the right hand. In order to move your arms properly to fight you’ll usually need to unbutton your jacket a bit and you have to be able to do it with your left hand only, hence the left side of the jacket overlaps the right.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my head it was similar but dirtier. A guy is used to how the buttons in his shirt are, so when he's taking off a woman's blouse the buttons are the same way around.</p></div>		</li>
