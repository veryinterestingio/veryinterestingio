			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in PR for 15 years and have done many, many TV shoots with clients. Cameras have gotten far smaller over that time, and far lighter. I even saw one producer use a high-end pro-sumer camera to record some video for a story we were working on together. I had another cameraman take a very light weight rig up about 30 ft into a tree to do a series of live shots at a treetop adventure course. </p>
<p>None of these would have been possible even a few years ago, much less when I started my career. </p>
<p>Edit: For anyone interested, here’s one of the clips they produced:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://petapixel.com/2010/04/09/house-season-finale-filmed-entirely-with-canon-5d-mark-ii/" target="_blank">An entire episode of House MD was shot on a Canon 5D in 2008</a>, because they needed a camera small enough to fit in a very realistic set of an accident.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is, that when you see camera operators with big rigs of gear, there's a chance they are using a tiny modern camera, but still attach it to a big rig to give the camera decent mass and inertia to avoid handheld camera shake. The more mass your rig has, and the further your hands are from the sensor, the more stable your image.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a massive fan of House I wanted to let people know what episode this is because as far as I can tell the site you linked to doesn't directly say, it just says &quot;Season Finale&quot; which, with a show that has 8 seasons, isn't a very narrow search term.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_Me_\(House\)" target="_blank">The episode is the finale of Season 6, called &quot;Help Me&quot;.</a> It's a pretty good standalone episode if you've never watched the show before and just want to see what it's like to have a high-budget show shot on a 'pro-sumer' camera. It also features one of my favourite lines of the show's entire run, which I won't repeat as it rather quite spoils the ending.</p>
<p>EDIT: A couple people have asked me what the line is that I like so much, so I took u/BrainRod 's advice and pasted it to a Pastebin for anyone curious (MASSIVE SPOILERS FOR THE EPISODE THOUGH.)

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another note about large rigs is that optics haven't shrunk as they are limited by physics of light. That's why you see DSLR's being used more often as their sensor and shutters are up to par with amazing optics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember it being a huge deal that 28 Days Later was filmed entirely in digital at the turn of the century. The lighter, smaller cameras meant action shots were more visceral and immersive, and the limitations on digital photography at the time lead to daytime scenes having a gritty, noisy effect which actually helped convey the apocalyptic feeling they were aiming for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get better results than you used to, but physics is physics and optics are optics. You're never going to get as good results with a tiny little lens.</p>
<p>In perfect conditions, your Android phone takes great photos, which suits 99% of people's use cases. Try taking a decent shot of something at night, or far away, and you're going to really notice the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what the person is trying to say is even modern rigs that look as large and heavy as their progenitors are actually much lighter, and their consistent size is moreso for the optical components than the mechanical ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Planet Earth 2, a 4k HDR documentary, used Sony A7S cameras to shoot several sequences that would be utterly impractical otherwise. They're smaller than traditional DSLRs and cost less as well.</p>
<p>Diffraction limits are only being hit on cellphone cameras, so anything bigger can still shrink. And yes, by the way, you can actually overcome traditional diffraction optics with a technique called <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2091826-metamaterial-lens-is-thinner-than-the-light-it-bends-and-focuses/" target="_blank">metamaterials</a> that can create perfect, tiny single plane lenses.</p>
<p>Cameras will continue to get better and smaller and cheaper. Cellphone cameras and go-pros might have big problems with low light and dynamic range at the moment, but they probably won't a decade from now. Professionals know this as well as anybody, at least if they keep up with their tech.</p></div>		</li>

I wouldn't really say that formfactor has any bearing on it, considering no matter what camera you use, you're going to need to set up your mics independently.</p></div>		</li>
