			<div class="markdown"><p>So in the diabetics case, how long would it take to come down? I tested at a122 with one of these tests, would it eventually come down? If I elimimate carbs would it start to normalise? Can I reverse the damage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! If it is type 2 diabetes, you can actually (nearly) eliminate ALL INSULIN DEPENDENCE AND RELATED MEDICATION!</p>
<p>I suggest reading The Obesity Code by Dr Jason Fung for a jump start, but some people manage to just significantly lower their issues, others (like my father and aunt!) manage to completely eliminate ALL medications! My coworker even went from an a1c of 11 to an a1c of 4.4! He still has a few medications, but is working towards losing the weight and getting off all medications. (With a doctor, of course.)</p>
<p>Generally people choose to follow a r/keto diet and tie in r/intermittentfasting </p>
<p>I know if you go to the keto sub, you will find HUNDREDS of stories of people getting off their meds due to the ketogentic diet. Always speak to your doctor, but it is actually a pretty common thing now a days and that makes me very excited!</p>
<p>(Also, shout out, but I like r/fatlogic because it’s a community of former (and current!) fatties that laugh at the excuses that fat people make, it really helped me to realize all of the excuses I was making and focus on what I needed to change. But that is a funny sub, not a sub for advice or anything.)</p>
<p>Edit: here is just a post I remember reading from the other day, I’m sure you can find many with more details if you search ‘a1c’ in the search bar on r/keto. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8mdp7e/a1c_is_now_normal/?st=JI2G680V&sh=728ab194" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8mdp7e/a1c_is_now_normal/?st=JI2G680V&sh=728ab194</a></p></div>		</li>
