			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to the similarity in architecture between the PS4 and PS5, they’re both basically a PC, it wouldn’t be too difficult to build a basic hardware abstraction layer into the OS for PS4 games. Plus, presuming they continue using x86-64 as the architecture, building that now would lay the ground work for future generations of backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>It’s not like the move from ps3 to ps4 where they moved from CELL to x86-64 and adding backwards compatibility would have been physically impossible without adding hardware from the previous generation due to the performance requirements of emulation. The PS4 and PS5 are both based on AMDs Zen architecture. They’re just different versions of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the processor is the same, the entire surrounding architecture is different. Think about how difficult is to run raspberry software on an mobile phone (both arm based) or, for example, running linux software on windows (x86_64), or running ps4 software on a normal pc (similar but different)...</p>
<p>Steam tried a different approach with their gaming console, with a hardware abstraction layer (the linux kernel), so the software could run on many different platforms but sadly it wasn't successful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying you're incorrect, but comparing x86 to arm is not fair in this context. x86 is heavily regulated, whereas ARM is the wild fuckin west.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth looking at bugs in PC games as an example. You'll have bugs that happen  on very, very similar hardware. Nvidia will issue a new driver update because something crashes on a 1080 GTX TI but not on a 1070 or whatever (This is just an example, don't go looking for that exact case). PC games are built and tested for varying hardware, coded against the lowest common denominator and full of hacks to work around hardware issues and to response to user feedback.  </p>
<p>On a console, you don't have to do much of that (or you do, but only for a very, very specific set of hardware. The biggest issue you'll hit is different TV resolution and the occasional performance issue based on storage type, like Link's Awakening for Switch and SD cards. Some game devs will find a bug that has interesting side effects and abuse the shit out of it. In the new hardware the bug could be gone, breaking everything.  </p>
<p>So yeah, moving to newer hardware would break shit. Probably shit that's trivial to fix, but the game dev isn't going to issue a patch, so...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, Sony (in this example) has all the cards in hand, when deciding *how* to implement their new system (PS5).</p>
<p>They can from the very get go make specs so adjusted, that backwards compatiblity is easily possible.</p>
<p>Whether the parts and software for that endeavour exits - that is another story.</p>
<p>(And lets not even talk about the mess the PS3 was, from a programming standpoint... Let alone lackluster capablity and bloated-appearing-specs.. )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO, it's always a monetary decision. </p>
<p>There's a trope in the car enthusiast world about whether drivetrain from car XYZ will work in a given car. The answer is always, &quot;How much money do you have to spend?&quot;</p>
<p>Sony can throw money at it and make it work but the big issue is whether it's worth it. Backwards compatibility could have been an initial design choice or something added with a emulation or additional hardware abstraction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a big difference here, though.</p>
<p>On one hand, OP believes it’s done explicitly for money exploitation of the end user.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and the reality of the situation is there is a significant hurdle when the new console comes out that isn’t worth putting money into.</p>
<p>One thing OP and others like him seem to forget is that the new console doesn’t delete the old one from existence. If you still have the old one, you can still use the old games on it just fine. Which means you can use both.</p>
<p>The immense cost to make the new hardware compatible with the old game is such that the few who really would benefit from such work would not make it worth it for the company, at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good answer. To expand a little on the hardware issue, PC games sometimes get strange issues from running a game <em>too well.</em></p>
<p>For example, in the game Destiny 2, one character class has an air dash ability. If you ran the game at too high FPS, your character would do the dash animation then plummet straight down as if they had no sideways momentum.</p></div>		</li>
