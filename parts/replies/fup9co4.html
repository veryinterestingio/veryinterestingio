			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  There are a number of fungi which grow on plants and also cause illness in animals.  Most of them don't directly cause disease in animals, but rather produce mycotoxins that do.  I actually just finished my veterinary toxicology class for vet school so we learned about a number of them.  Some even cause issues in humans!  E.g. aflatoxin is a big one that grows on corn and causes liver disease in animals.  There's a huge, regulatory effort behind controlling it as it is excreted in the milk of infected animals and is carcinogenic in people.</p>
<p>Some other important ones include ergot, neotyphodium (both cause tissue death/necrosis, especially of the distal extremities/ears as well as abortions and other reproductive issues.  Zearalenone is another mycotoxin which acts as an estrogen and causes reproductive issues, cystic ovarian disease in cattle, and can also affect humans.  Vomitoxin is another which occurs in grain and causes GI upset, especially in pigs.  There are a number of others but these are among the most important.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is more about &quot;people eat corn containing the toxin (and the fungus that made it)&quot; than &quot;the fungus continues to grow in the person (and makes toxin)&quot;, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another big one is Ergot (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claviceps_purpurea" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claviceps_purpurea</a>) which attacks grains (like rye) but produces a toxin which causes Ergotism - convulsions, nervous system damage, gangrene and often results in death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m currently studying for an infectious diseases exam, a pretty interesting example of this is a fungus called “Sporothrix schenckii” which causes what is commonly referred to as “rose gardeners disease”. People become infected with sporothrix when they get pricked by rose thorns coated in the fungi. The fungi enters the open wound and you get “ascending” pattern of lymphadenopathy which basically means your lymph nodes swell up in a pattern that travels up your arm.  You can also get some gnarly ulcers with it too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I plumb forgot about sporotrichosis. I seem to recall it's most common in folks that wire together topiary- a combination of exposure to cut wire ends, and sphagnum moss.</p>
<p>Nasty disease to try to rout out once it's established.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Otherwise, they’re primarily wood-decaying fungi, but can be found in a bunch of places depending on the exact species- bamboo, bird droppings, soil, you name it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And plenty of people with chronic respiratory problems (like CF or on ventilators) are colonized with Pseudomonas.  It can be a nasty bug, just because it’s often resistant to most first-line pneumonia antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>
