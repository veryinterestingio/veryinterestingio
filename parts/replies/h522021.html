			<div class="markdown"><p>I cut my right index finger this winter from a stupid (stupid, stupid) mistake. Decades of experience with saws and I got too comfortable. I am now 8 weeks post-surgery and have some motion in my finger but will likely never get much more than 10 or 15% back... at least it LOOKS like a finger again. </p>
<p>I respect patents, and I get it, but I cannot wait for this patent to expire. A SawStop was always out of my price range and competition should bring lower prices. My other 9.5 fingers can't wait to get one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad cut 3 of his fingers a year ago.</p>
<p>He lost most of one finger and can barely move the other two fingers that were hit. Index, middle and ring finger on his dominant hand.</p>
<p>Was cutting a wooded pallet, for some reason the pallet flipped somehow and he had his hand in the wrong spot.</p>
<p>A few seconds and the damage was done.</p>
<p>I can't wait for the competition to make the technology more affordable. Sadly it will be too late for my dad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey there.  I lost part of my right ring finger (the outer 1/4) and almost lost my index and long finger in the process (like you, got too comfortable cleaning my motorcycle chain... things happened).</p>
<p>Anyways, do your OT / PT and drive through the pain of the exercises.  And do the assigned workouts they want you to do at home between appointments!</p>
<p>This happened to me in 2017.  After letting the bones heal and going through several months of OT, I was able to gain about 85-90% of my motion on my index and long fingers.  I still cannot (and never will be able to again) fully close my hand into a fist (due to scar tissue build up).  However, I've overcome that and have modified the way I use my hands, tools and whatnot.</p>
<p>I was quickly back to riding the bike and working on my cars and such.  I just sometimes have to use my left hand or hold things a bit differently due to my lack of grip.  </p>
<p>But, you'll get through it!  Our bodies are amazing at adapting to shit like this.  Don't let it get ya down!  :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The magnetic seal on refrigerators is one. Refrigerators used to have mechanical latches and some number of people, usually children, would die after getting trapped in a refrigerator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know man I read about the guy who invented it and he seems like exactly the kind innovator we need to reward. He invented the system and shopped it around to the saw industry and they told him they didn’t want it and didn’t want to get sued when it didn’t work and then basically blacklisted him.</p>
<p>So he made his own saws to get the tech out there but he never wanted to be in the saw business. He just wanted to save people’s fingers and profit from his invention.</p>
<p>The industry really f*cked him around. They didn’t want to get sued for it not working and they didn’t want to get sued for NOT having it when other saw brands did, so they all got together and locked him out. He would rather just license it to everyone and stop making saws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The impression I’ve always gotten from the story about the inventor (who happens to be a patent lawyer) is that he invented the device and wouldn’t agree to reasonable licensing terms with any major tool manufacturers. He then set out to make his own saws and tried to lobby OSHA to require this type of safety mechanism, which would effectively give him a monopoly on table saws, or force the other brands to license his patent. </p>
<p>He seems to be plenty successful despite his lobbying attempts failing, and I’ve heard some insurance companies will either require or lower premiums for shops that use SawStops. </p>
<p>Even though the main patent is expiring soon, he still has numerous other patents relating to aspects of the SawStop mechanism. I expect that he will attempt to use the newer patents to keep his hold on this market segment for as long as he can. </p>
<p>Compare this with Volvo, who after inventing and patenting the 3 point seatbelt, licensed the patent for free because they realized just how many lives could be saved by it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Word on the street is that this is truest of cheapo blades, but less true of high quality ones. The metal stopper is relatively soft (it has to be, if it was harder, the saw could bounce off), so people have just resharpened their high-end blades and moved on. But, SawStop can't warrant that in any way, or encourage stupid uses of blades with cracks, etc</p></div>		</li>

<p>there might be some advantage to triggering on metal as well protecting the blade.</p>

<p>Only if your idea of protecting the blade from the metal nail is to shove a larger chunk of metal into it, causing over 1000g of impact shock.</p></div>		</li>
