			<div class="markdown"><p>haha i meant more along the lines of what causes stretch marks for one person doesn’t necessarily cause it for another. like some people’s skin is able to withstand a lot more stretch before they get stretchmarks. whereas anyone who goes into surgery and gets a massive cut will scar</p>
<p>as for the source unfortunately i use UpToDate which is the holy grail for medicine but you have to have a subscription for it so if i posted the link it wouldn’t let you read the info on it (my school gives it to us for free cos med school) </p>
<p>but the medical term for stretch marks is striae distensae, so if you google that you should be able to find some stuff on it! most of it is gonna be “proposed mechanisms” aka no one knows how it really happens</p></div>		</li>
