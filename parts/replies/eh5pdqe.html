			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, but you should watch out for contamination. Interestingly the freezing point of water does depend on air pressure too but it’s very slight (less than 1/1000th of a degree).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ice water, well stirred, distilled, and at sea level for zero degrees.  Boiling water, distilled, and at sea level for 100 degree calibration. Steam can't be used since it can get above the boiling point of water. That's how the Celsius scale was created, and can still be used for calibration today.  There are conversion calculations to compensate for pressure differences due to change in altitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are better ways, but if your thermometer only goes between 0 and 100°c: touch ice, equilibrate, record, acclimate, touch boiling water, equilibrate, record. Make a regression line. Offset thermometer by that much. Use with knowledge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point you touch will cause the ice to melt due to pressure creating a cavity in the ice surrounded by ice water. As long as you are not taking energy from the system the water on the surface of the ice is freezing. </p></div>		</li>
