			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Definitely the second one. The amount of volcanism depends on how wet and how reduced (metal rich) the rocks areIf the rocks on Venus are as metal-rich as the most metal-rich rocks on Earth’s surface, and contain 1.5% water (1000 times as much as the atmosphere), you still need 220 times as much volcanism on venus as you see on Earth to explain the phosphine. For more reasonable amounts of water and metal you need the entire planet to be covered ploe-to-pole with volcanoes!
2) Not really. Terrestrial  biology can do astonishing things with chemistry, using the same basic building blocks. Make phosphine, metabolise arsenic, chew up steel and uranium. It is really hard to work back from just one gas to what the biochemistry could be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify the question more, Prof /u/WB_oligomath , on the constraints on possible biota producing Phosphine .. given that the volume of Phosphine produced seems substantial and the productivity compared to earth biota seems non-miniscule: </p>
<p>1) does that let us estimate (say using earth-similar biology), the amount of nutrient flow that would be necessary to support such biomass high up in the cloud-tops .. esp in non-volatile nutrients employed by similar biota in earth .. ions of iron, zinc, copper, magnesium etc .. </p>
<p>2) and if so, can we compare them to known or theorized physical atmospheric processes that would allow that amount of heavy-atom nutrients to be transported say 50 km into the atmosphere to be available to support a biota of presumably free-floating dispersed micor-organisms that depend on such typically surface-bound nutrients?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably a bit offtopic, but i'm wondering that since quite a while: How exactly can an organism (on molecular level) produce a substance that's not possible to produce with chemical reactions without extreme pressure ? Do we just not know the right formula to reproduce it or what's happening inside them ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know Venus isn’t 220 times as volcanic as Earth? It has at least 220 times as much sulfuric acid in its atmosphere compared to ours. How do you disprove that Venus is “covered” as you say with “volcanism”?</p></div>		</li>
