			<div class="markdown"><p>What's special with honey that it deserves special mention to say, other unprocessed/raw foods? I mean not feeding infants with raw food seems common sense, but with botulinum spores being everywhere, why is honey always mentioned as containing said spores?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its just the spores can be found in honey, and \~10% of infant botulinum is associated with honey which makes it statistically important. I don't exactly know why this is the case but my guess would be that honey is raw, comes from the environment where spores can be found, doesn't get cooked/boiled, and there aren't that many other food choices for babies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible that such an energy rich environment might cause aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria to colonize it and use up the available oxygen, making it a suitable environment for obligate anaerobes to reproduce.</p>
<p>There's a trick environmental scientists use to biologically degrade certain compounds in ground water that aren't readily degraded by aerobic bacteria.  It mostly consists of putting molasses into the ground water and letting the aerobic bacteria use up the oxygen as they metabolize the molasses, creating an anaerobic environment and allowing anaerobes to degrade the compounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honey is a concentrate, so it probably accumulages <em>C. botulinium</em> spores from multiple, wild, sources. Honey also is not as processed (Vegetables, for instance are washed before consumption, so potential spores are washed away), which probably contributes to the problem</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is just a guess, a quick search yielded no sourced results</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there are a lot of cultures/ family practices that dip dummies/pacifiers in honey to help children sleep. So not only was this a common exposure for children ( whoâ€™s gastric flora is not diverse enough to suppress clostriadial growth once established) but an easy cause to educate and restrict.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gut bacteria becomes more diverse overtime with organisms that outcompete clostridium species thus suppressing their ability to grow sufficiently to cause symptoms. This is why C diff infections are more common for people who have had recent antibiotics, GI surgeries and long term poor diet.</p>
<p>I also worked as a medical technologist in a previous career and am now a PA-C who has worked in 2 specialty areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gastric flora is immature til 6-12 months of life when with food and general children chewing the bacterial biome establishes. One of the key triggers for this is food intake - prolonged breast feeding increases risk and makes it more likely for the older infant to be colonised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone earlier said it was because the pH of babies' stomachs wasn't low  enough, and that low pH prevents the growth of botulinum. So take any of these answers with a grain of salt.</p>
