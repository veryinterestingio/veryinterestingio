<p>The highest likelihood is that the animals can read body language very well</p>

<p>Mostly only with animals they're familiar with though. Similarly, a lion keeper can read the most intricate signals from a lion, while they'd be useless at handling Tasmanian devils.</p>
<p>So if you encounter a raccoon in a city, they may know how to react to a human, but a raccoon on a remote trek may have no idea what you are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on this:</p>
<p>Animals are <em>great</em> at learning other species behavior, if they can see enough of it. An animal can also learn individuals and their behavior, but they rely more on general behaviors and body languages in general for the model.  </p>
<p>So while you might chew your nails, and I might pick at my fingernails, when we're nervous, that's not necessarily what a dog cares about. </p>
<p>What the dog <em>will</em> recognize fairly quickly, though, is if you don't meet his idea of comfortable. Most humans, around dogs, seem at ease. </p>
<ul>
<li>Our shoulders aren't bunched (inwards).</li>
<li>Our arms are relaxed, at our side, and move loosely. </li>
<li>Our posture is upright without being 'tensed'.</li>
<li>Our voices are not rapid, erratic, or strained. </li>
<li>Our faces are relaxed, no scrunched brow, or eyes looking rapidly around. </li>
</ul>
<p>A dog is used to seeing people 'behave' a certain way, just like we are. Dogs can pick up specific cues that specific people have for things, but for strangers they'll rely on more universal traits. Is it tensed? Is it moving erratically? Is it making noises in rapid, erratic, or strained ways compared to other humans I've met? If so, the dog will see you as stressed (or whatever emotional state you're experiencing). </p>
<p>It's really a model of seeing <em>lots</em> of humans, and learning various 'emotional states' that those fit into. Much like how we learn to group species, plants, etc, by they're common factors. It's complex, but it's also basic pattern recognition! </p>
<p>&quot;This person had this kind of behavior towards other people, and these were their reactions to it, and this is how it was moving/acting passively.&quot;</p>
<p>Then they start linking more and more groups of behaviors and how we acted each time we behaved that way. Eventually they build a complex, and functioning (socializing isn't <em>just</em> to make them friendly, it's literally teaching them how humans act, too, in various settings and situations!) model of human body language and behavior!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I worked with horses back in the day.  When I started there I didn't have much horse experience, and the ranch boss told me that in a year I'd be able to look a horse in the eyes and tell if was sick. </p>
<p>Sure enough, I could, eventually.  </p>
<p>They're just as expressive as humans, we just need practice to recognize anything subtle.  It still is amazing to me to see people just walk right up to and flap at horses that I can see very clearly are in a bitey-kicky kind of mood. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Purely by happenstance, you inadvertently chose a poor comparison in that there is peer reviewed and supported research which proves that Lion Keepers are knowledgeable at handling/working with Tasmanian Devils. This is why you see many of them who work with both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We met several bears while hiking in Alaska that had definitely never seen a human before. Doesn't matter how scary you try to be, they're curious. They don't know what a human looks like when it's threatening, they have no reference. So yeah, they got real close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't read the study - only read the article you posted - but fear commonly leads to aggression. (No  Yoda references intended.)</p>
<p>Fear invokes the fight or flight mechanism. Some dogs fight. Others try to flee. </p>
<p>Seriously, I have a fearful German Shepherd and it's so clear that his crazy scary barking is because he's afraid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, dogs coevolved with us so we're quite in tune to each other. I've also heard that looking into dogs eyes releases oxytocin in both humans and dogs similar to how looking in a baby's eyes would. We're definitely best friends ?? </p></div>		</li>
