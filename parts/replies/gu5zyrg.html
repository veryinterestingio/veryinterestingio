			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the references. I world also add that whatever environments existed they would have been stable enough to feel 'permanent' and possess game and edible plants and fruits. Humans most likely did not cross just to get to the other side but probably just drifted in search of food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would have been actively chasing game, not really trying to get to the other side. The Beringia Bridge was something like 600,000 sq miles and the migration lasted for a couple of thousand years. A lot of folks, not referring to you specifically, have this image of folks standing at one side and seeing the other side with a desire to cross and that being their primary mission.  The truth of the matter is somewhat less cinematic in that land bridges like this appear during global cooling periods where ice is formed, lowering sea level, revealing these bridges. Another effect of these cooling periods is that vegetation becomes scarce and herds are thinned and move to find new sources, and then nomadic people follow these herds. These two events combined is how you get mass migrations over long periods of time. It was a survival event that those in warmer climates didn't have to resort to as they were developing subsistence farming around this time (Neolithic Revolution).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were there people still on the land bridge by the time the sea levels went back up? People would have just lived on this land like any other land not knowing it was temporary, and of course we know some people crossed over completely because native Americans exist, but were there people who just got flooded? I guess it depends on the speed of the rising sea levels, how level the land bridge was. But I guess we wouldnâ€™t even be able to do the archaeology to find remains if they were</p></div>		</li>
