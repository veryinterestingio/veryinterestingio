			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't seem like it actually happened, was just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillion-dollar_coin" target="_blank">proposed concept</a></p>
<p>Looks like it was pushed for <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/03/25/coronavirus-stimulus-bill-how-will-us-pay-trillion-dollar-coin/" target="_blank">again in 2020</a> for covid debt relief according to Fortune</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trillion dollar coin would be a way of bypassing the Fed as the Congress retains the authority to mint coin. Using this method would mean we would not have to borrow the money from the Fed at interest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They’ve never actually done it. It was talked about as a last resort because Congress, bizarrely, votes on a budget that increases the debt but then, separately, votes on a debt limit increase. If the US defaults, it could be catastrophic for the global economy but Senate Republicans were grandstanding and refusing to raise the debt limit even after allowing the spending.</p>
<p>So, the backup plan was to mint a $1tr coin and use it to get cash and continue to pay bond holders and other obligations. No one with a half a brain wants to be that dysfunctional but it’s the Senate. Their whole thing is refusing to do objectively good and non-controversial things because there isn’t half a brain between the 100 of them.</p></div>		</li>
