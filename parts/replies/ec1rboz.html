			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, in Fluid Dynamics we often consider water to be incompressible, or more specifically that the density of the water is not a function of its pressure (and sometimes the temperature). This simplifies a lot of the calculations!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The incompressible water assumption is generally accurate (and there are cases where it is not), and even the incompressible *air* assumption works for a lot of applications where Mach number is low (&lt;0.3). Science is about making intelligent choices about what you consider. Even treating water as a uniform continuum substance rather than a aggregate of discrete molecules is an assumption, albeit one that is overwhelming justified by the scale of most fluids problems people encounter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, especially because in fluid dynamics we only consider water to be incompressible just as a hypothesis, as well as we consider some other hypothesis just to make calculations easier. We know it will result in a difference when compared to the real world, but it's so small that we consider it irrelevant. However it's always taught in Engineering classes that all liquids are compressible in some way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah! And sometimes, we even treat gasses as incompressible. For example, it is often considered valid to treat air is incompressible when Ma &lt; 0.3!</p></div>		</li>
