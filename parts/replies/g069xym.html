			<div class="markdown"><p>Some vegetables, especially certain greens, are bitter. Bitterness is an acquired taste, and tends to be very repelling to children, because bitterness is often an indication of poison. </p>
<p>As adults, or with a trusted adult, we can acquire a taste for things like bitterness and spice, when they're in foods that are known to be safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vegetables? You mean strange leaves of dubious digestibility and almost no energetic value, posing a risk of ingesting hidden parasitic larvae or eggs? It's a famine food. You'll lose weight even if you eat a lot of them, which can lead to death. </p>
<p>A part of this instinct goes away with age, but not always.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not when you think about it from an evolutionary consumption standpoint.   Humans who eat high-calorie foods and foods that dont take a lot of energy to process first will survive the lean times.  Things like meat taste good because we need protein. Salt is essential to survive and so it tastes good. Fats, sugars and carbs are low effort, high energy foods, so again, your body instinctually favors them.</p>
<p>Other than giving some vitamins that we need in small amounts, vegetables really aren't that healthy.   They are considered healthy because they have little calories in them, so your basically eating flavored water, which when we have such energy-dense foods like cheeseburgers, is a good thing.    Basically they are healthy because your eating something that's empty instead of a full days calories requirements.</p></div>		</li>
