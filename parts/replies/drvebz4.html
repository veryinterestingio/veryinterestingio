			<div class="markdown"><p>From another perspective you're comparing different.... <em>facets(?)</em>.. of each sport. Consider marathon running. The Usain bolt of marathons can run 26 miles in a row at like 5min/mile. While I'd argue the vast majority of people couldn't even finish a marathon. So in that regard they could increase their running ability in a similar order of magnitude to lifting 10x the average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty perfect comparison actually. Very interesting that top speed and top speed for a long distance can be so vastly different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s actually probably a better comparison for powerlifting. Where a 100m sprint would be more like bench pressing ~50 lbs for 10 reps as fast as you can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The world record marathon average mile pace is 4:41 A 20 second per mile difference is a little less than nine minutes over the course of a marathon. So while it doesn't sound like a ton of time for a single mile, with the speed and distance they're going it makes a huge difference. I'd assume there is a similar difference in lifting 1100 pounds compared to 1200 pounds in OP's example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to take into account gait length (the distance between steps) and the maximum possible velocity a human can move their legs.</p>
<p>Much like gears in an engine have a top speed where it simply isn't possible for it to rotate the tires faster, a human of a given height can only ever run so fast just based on the simple mechanics of movement and the durability of our parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i recently read muscle contraction is done by the muscle fibers 'sheath' releasing magnesium into the fiber and absorbing it for relaxation. often a cramp is the sheath breaking and dropping all mg it carried onto the muscle. thats why rubbing and kneading a cramped muscle helps relaxing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a highly flawed reasoning.  To say simply adding and activating more muscle mass will allow an Olympic weightlifter to lift more is blasphemy.  By that logic, weight classes results should increase relatively to their body weight.  If it were that way, there would be no need for adjusting results to the Sinclair scale.  Also, weightlifting is just as complex movement as sprinting.  It involves accelerating and decelerating a weight, often far larger than one's body weight, changing multiple different muscles being activated during the movement, and the ability to adjust to an external load shifting.  I would argue that weightlifting is far more technical and more difficult to learn.</p>
<p>What you do get right is the bio-electrical and chemical changes that occur.  While runners make improvement in their max force produced, stride length and SSC, many of their adaptations come in their work capacity.  Being able to maintain the top end speed of upwards of say 23 mph (not sure actual tops) is what separates an Olympic athlete from just a national level contender.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good post, but some further info:</p>
<p>In most 100m races the person with the highest top speed wins the race.
The sprinters cannot maintain it for more than 20m worth of running (based on 10m split times).
A runner who appears to surge ahead at the end of the race is decelerating less than the other racers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they can? They both just require training. Few people can run at a high level without training. Lots of people can snatch poorly. They are both technical movements. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One requires more muscle mass. More muscle mass can generate more force. When you lift a weight you can slowly activate more muscles fibres contraction generating more and more force until it is enough to start lifting the object.</p>
<p>Running on the other hand is a very complex movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By your description, I don't think you know very much about olympic weightlifting at all. Oly lifting requires EXTREMELY complex, powerful, precise, and fast movement. It is absolutely not done slowly. There is also way more to oly lifting than strength and muscle mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Performing a snatch (Olympic weightlifting movement) is arguably one of the fastest, most technically demanding athletic movements one can learn. Second only to
the other olympic weightlifting movement, the clean and jerk.</p>
<p>In fact, a sprinter’s training will often utilize Olympic weightlifting to develop force production and explosiveness through “fast” twitch muscle fiber recruitment.</p></div>		</li>
