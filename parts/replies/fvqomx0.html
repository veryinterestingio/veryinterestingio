			<div class="markdown"><p>Different viral vectors have dramatically different capacities. Adenovirus can fit &gt;8 kb whereas AAV can fit about 4 kb before titer and packing efficiency drops off. Lentivirus can fit 9.7 kb and more if youâ€™re willing to sacrifice titer. Integrating vs non integrating is a safety consideration as well but you can pack a lot in 9.7 kb with some clever engineering. I work at a gene therapy company on a team working to develop aav technology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: base 5?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true although worth noting that currently the market sits at about 80-90% aav, so in most discussions on the topic aav can be assumed to be virus time youâ€™re talking about. It is also the most well developed (albeit still poorly) manufacturing process of the lot. Which is why there is so much research going into non-viral delivery vehicles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True! LV is gaining some steam in ex vivo transgenic CAR-T therapies (which I also worked on at a previous company ðŸ˜œ) which is cool to see. </p>
<p>AAV has some of the classic bad science issues plaguing it. Fun fact the ITR sequences in most commercial AAVs have been carried through from really early papers on the viruses. Because sequencing technology was primitive in those days the ITR sequences have several mutations when compared to wild type AAV. These interfere with the formation of hairpins and some papers suggest that just by correcting the ITR sequences the packaging efficiency can be boosted several fold. Iâ€™ve seen foundational issues like this in most projects Iâ€™ve worked on and people just tend to gloss over them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The bitch but is purification of the virus, and the plasmids used are really fucking expensive.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are definitely processes over 30%, but as I said some processes do yield only 30%. I work at a large multinational biotech and weâ€™re one of the oldest viral vector manufacturers in the world so weâ€™re definitely experienced and yet there are specific runs where the entire batch only yields enough usable therapeutic for 2-3 patients. </p>
<p>Point is, the field is all over the place right now, despite being an old technology. Awesome that you worked on kymriah though! We use kymriahâ€™s story as a model for what the field could be and the vast potential it has all the time.</p></div>		</li>
