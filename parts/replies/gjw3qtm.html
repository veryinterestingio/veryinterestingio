			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually impossible to accelerate to the speed of light. Something either <em>always</em> travels at C, or it never will. Photons are in the first category, matter (that has mass) is in the second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's always at C, light can never not travel at C. When it passes through a medium it doesn't actually slow but takes longer due to weird quantum mechanical interactions with the electric and magnetic fields being created in the medium superimposing with the original wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not entirely accurate! The EM field (quantum wave) doesn't slow down, but the particle (photon) does slow down, as it is defined in QM. </p>
<p>Also, it's not &quot;weird&quot; QM interactions, it's just not as trivial as classical physics were everything is a ball. The sum of the EM field generated by the induced dipole fluctuations of the charged particles in the medium (electrons and protons) and the incident wave result in a wave exiting the medium later than the it would without the dipoles. If you do some math, you see that the exiting wave will have the same direction as the incident wave. So by all accounts it is the same particle but slowed down by the medium. (This is ignoring resonance phenomena)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess since photons are just perturbations of a gigantic universe spanning quantum EM field manifesting as a packet of energy, then the vibration was always at C from the moment it &quot;plucked the string&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. It's not that it accelerates, but that the change in the wave function of the atom (the decay from the excited state to the ground state, or whatever) induces the electromagnetic field to wiggle, and when you are &quot;far&quot; from the atom, so that you can measure the photon traveling through free space, it's just propagating as a regular photon, at the speed of light.</p>
<p>There are two problems:</p>
<p>First, atoms aren't finite. There's no point at which you're <em>completely</em> free of the influence of the atom, so it's a gradual move to free space.</p>
<p>Second, when you're near the bulk of the wave function of the atom (i.e., within the Bohr radius) you are much to close to make definite statements about the speed of the light — the photons tend to be several thousand Angstroms, while the Bohr radius is about half an Angstrom. You start running into Heisenberg uncertainty issues, which more or less say that you can't know a particles position (or lifetime) more precisely than its wavelength (or period).</p>
<p>There are mathematical models that use plane waves and radial waves to approximate the behavior, but they're just that — models. What really happens is that for all practical (or, indeed, measurable) purposes, it's instantaneous, but the details are murky and not fully answerable in any satisfactory way, in the same sense that asking when an ocean wave hits the shore (let's assume it doesn't break, but just sloshes) and what speed it's moving at at that moment is a bit murky.</p></div>		</li>
