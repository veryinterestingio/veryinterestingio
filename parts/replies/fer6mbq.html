			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely not. Gun shots have a lot of energy, but almost all of that energy is in the projectile and in the heat of the case/firearm. The sound is definitely not enough to set off an avalanche</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To support this, almost all guns produce &lt;200 decibels.  There is probably an exception to this in that there is some monster gun (e.g., a punt gun at 50mm+) that could do it, but that's certainly not what the movies portray.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine that we already know avalanches can and will occur. There's obviously a tipping point when one sheet of material is sitting on another rather precariously.</p>
<p>I just don't think the reverberations of even a gunshot would cause one. The snow falling on the top sheet from birds shaking it out of the trees is a more likely cause than the sound. But I suppose the sound can't be totally counted out</p></div>		</li>
