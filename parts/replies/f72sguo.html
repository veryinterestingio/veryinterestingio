			<div class="markdown"><p>Without vitamin D supplements and adding it to all kinds of stuff, there would be way less people living above 60 lat (above Helsinki, Reykjavik, Anchorage). I'm almost surprised we don't get government package each month for vitamin D, it is that vital. There are a lot of campaigns about it, especially in the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it is normal for us in Finland to reinforce our dairy products with D-vitamin, the law actually requires fat free dairy to be reinforced, but it is common practice to reinforce them all. Assuming you have normal diet, it is quite difficult to get vitamin deficiency.   </p>
<p>And the reason we do not provide anyone supplements is because we don't want people to get Hypervitaminosis D. Which is extremely dangerous to your health, and can be achieved with the most basic of supplements, including fish oil.  This applies to all non-water soluble vitamins, do not think that &quot;more is good&quot; because they can cause severe damage to your health.  </p>
<p>Just eat some fish regularly, even canned tuna is good, eat some eggs. If you are vegan eat common mushrooms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two thirds of white Australians are diagnosed with skin cancer by age 70. This isn't a problem the dermatologists have invented, wear your damn sunscreen if you're in a sunny place.
White skin is more than capable of making enough Vit D in sunny countries even with sunscreen on, and no-one is arguing that Norwegians put it on every time they go outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without sun you mainly develop lack of vitamin D, which can be easily treated through supplements (while skin cancer can’t be), and is a regular occurence even in people who formally get enough sunlight. </p>
<p>Skin cancer - the black one, melanoma - seems to have different components leading to it, not all understood, but events of extreme exposure to sun (=sunburn) seems to play a role in it, as does genetics (which is why thorough and frequent screening is recommended for people with a family history). Sunscreen does a good job at preventing sunburns. There are probably other environmental factors at play though, because there has been a raise in melanoma cases for quite some decades now that can’t be explained yet.</p>
<p>For white skin cancer (spinalioma, basalioma), a family history and the total time of unprotected exposure to sunlight play a major role - meaning that sunscreen can prevent the accumulation of too much unprotected exposure, no matter if you got a sunburn or not, and thus helps reduce cases of that type of cancer. As people are getting older and older, and the probability of skin cells degenerating goes up and up, it’s good to be protected - it may not prevent every case, because other factors still exist, but it helps keeping the number lower. Also, if it’s detected early (which today happens more often with better medical prophylactic screenings, and more awareness in people to go to doctors if something weird’s up with your skin), it often is fairly operable (but will appear in the statistics - which could also play a role in numbers being higher than say, 70 years ago). </p>
<p>tl;dr: sunscreen is good, use it. You probably suffer from vitamin D deficiency anyway even without sunscreen (at least in latitudes more north than the Mediterranean), and that deficiency is very easily and cheaply treatable with supplements. (Source: I have a Family History of spinalioma, which is also a family history of pale and birthmark-heavy people going without sunscreen, am high risk of developing one myself due to several other factors, and had severe vitamin D deficiency even when I didn’t use sunscreen, which then ceased to exist when I put on sunscreen and took that supplement which cost me 20€ for 6 months).</p></div>		</li>
