<p>they pull water out of this ocean region and make it saltier, which leads to more surface water sinking into the deep ocean. This pulls a tremendous amount of dissolved CO2 into the deep ocean, where it does not exchange with the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Do you think there is any way that we could take advantage of this mechanism to sequester CO2, even temporarily? Desalination plants or methods of increasing evaporation to concentrate the salt?</p>
<p>Or are the required volumes just simply too vast? How do the ice sheets &quot;pull water out of the ocean&quot;, is it just that the water cycle is interrupted by the snow on land never melting or are these effects caused by sea ice formation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! While it might be technically possible to increase ocean downwelling to sequester carbon in the deep ocean, it would take a gargantuan amount of energy to achieve it. Add to that the fact that we’re melting Greenland at ever-increasing rates, which is dumping huge amounts of freshwater into the North Atlantic, and we’ll basically be continually fighting a losing battle. </p>
<p>As to your second question, the simple answer is that when water is trapped on land (in glaciers and ice sheets) it is physically being removed from the ocean. Global sea level was 130 meters (400 feet) lower at the last glacial maximum than it is today because so much water was locked up in Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. When all that water moved, it did so via evaporation from the ocean and then precipitation onto land, so the salt was left in the ocean. There are, of course, much more complex dynamics at work through all this, but this simple depiction does a surprisingly good job of explaining paleoclimate data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These kind of 'searching for lost keys where the streetlamp shines' type suggestions come up often when discussing active climate mitigation. </p>
<p>The reality is that throughout history, the best bets for humans achieving significant nature emulation has always been via human appropriate technologies. We fly with propellers and jet engines and not by flappable wings, we fertilize our lands with industrial ammonia production not based on symbiotic nitrogen fixation, we power locomotion with internal combustion and electric engines not contractile fibers like all of biology. </p>
<p>We will (by necessity) employ many carbon mitigation technologies as this century progresses, but the most successful are highly unlikely to be via emulating natural processes. We want processes that can be massively scalable, powered by clean industrial energy, if possible via factory manufacturable components, and as location independent as possible. One off solutions that cannot be scaled, and are specific to particular localities in extreme environments etc are unlikely to get us there.</p>
<p>Of the top of the head.. the kinds of actual contenders we'd see development along the lines of might be things like direct powdered carbon generation from atmospheric CO2 or by processing otherwise CO2 releasing biomass (i.e. biomass sucks up CO2, we lock it up instead of letting it decay back), introducing direct scalable bicarbonate de-acidification techs into the seas, possible direct sunshade and solar power deployments in space, upper atmosphere modification to block/reflect some sunlight, scalable techs to increase direct radiation losses from earth to space, techs for some minimal atmospheric flows control and so on... None of these will be risk free, and it is unfortunate we have even let ourselves get to a state where such thoughts need to be seriously entertained, but we have essentially run out of time, and last ditch efforts will be necessary to mitigate catastrophe.. its just worth realizing that the most effective of the best of worst options will almost certainly be fully industrial processes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ice is frozen fresh water. The salt stays in solution; ergo, the ocean gets saltier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit of a side question, but directly involving your area of interest. Considering that till the beginning of Industrial Age the process seemed to be going in mostly one direction - storing carbon into fossil fuel deposits, did we have the lowest CO2 concentration in Earth’s history around 18th century? Does that mean that climate was in general significantly warmer before and are there any specific numbers? I understand there are other important factors like land mass distribution or solar activity, do they have a greater impact? Also, what would be a possible future if our civilization never appeared - some kind of dynamic equilibrium or Earth slowly turning into an ice planet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! The first thing to understand is that fossil fuels make up only a small fraction of the carbon stored on Earth as rocks or sediment (0.1% or less I believe). Over long periods of time (millions of years), the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere (and in the rest of the rocks/sediments) is mostly controlled by two factors: the rate of volcanism and the rate of rock weathering. More overall volcanism leads to higher atmospheric co2, more overall rock weathering leads to less co2. These two variables have changed throughout Earth’s history, leading to periods of high co2 (like the Cretaceous) and low co2 (like right now). We are currently in a period of relatively low atmospheric co2, which is due to a reduced rate of volcanism over the last 50 million years and an increase in rock weathering due mainly to the formation of the Himalayan mountains. Note that any changes on this scale take place over millions of years, none of this can explain the recent rapid rise in atmospheric co2 (that’s definitively caused by human emissions)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dear paleoclimate PhD student, I have a sincere question. I found a dude on youtube who is claiming that we are indeed heading to a changing climate, but that rather than devastating warmth, we are headed into a catastrophic ice age. He cites the Vostok ice core data among others; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrhys8n2VpM" target="_blank">this</a> is the video of his that most succinctly sums up the concepts he is talking about.</p>
<p>I don't know enough either way to know which data to trust or not. My question for you, the person studying this stuff at a doctoral level, is whether the idea of low solar activity impacting temperature holds any merit, or if all the data is being completely misinterpreted?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m glad you brought this up. First of all, there is a nugget of truth in that argument. According to our understanding of orbital cycles, we reached peak Arctic summer incoming radiation about 10,000 years ago. In fact, we are near a minimum of Arctic summer radiation right now (Northern Hemisphere summer is currently near the point in Earth’s orbit where we are furthest from the sun). If humans were not emitting greenhouse gases, it is indeed likely that we would be on our way into another glacial build-up period right now (see Ganopolski et al., 2016, in Nature, for more info on this) This would not be a smooth ride into an ice age, as all previous episodes of glacial build-up took roughly 80,000 years and were interrupted every 10-15,000 years by short warming periods. </p>
<p>However, human greenhouse gas emissions are more than compensating for the relative lack of Arctic summer sunlight and preventing glacial build-up. To put things in perspective, the highest CO2 concentration in the atmosphere over the last 2.7 million years was around 300 ppm. It is estimated that we need below around 200 ppm to enter another significant global ice age (see earlier reply for explanation of how that could happen). We are currently at 410 ppm, which has amplified the greenhouse effect to such an extent that Greenland is experiencing accelerated annual ice melt, despite the relatively mild Arctic summers. If you take anything away from this rambling explanation, I hope it gets across just how powerful the greenhouse effect can be. The study of past climates shows us this very clearly!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. I believe you are right about CO2 never being over 300 ppm in the last 2.7 million years. But what about the <a href="http://www.biocab.org/Geological_Timescale.jpg" target="_blank">times in Earth's past</a> where carbon levels were tens of times greater than that? (8000 ppm in the Cambrian, 5000 in the late Triassic)</p>
<p>We are told that if we reach 450 ppm or something, we reach runaway climate feedbacks that end life on Earth. Yet the graph I linked shows that we are in a near-record low period of CO2 concentrations if most of biological time is considered. In the Triassic, a recorded CO2 level increase corresponds to a stable temperature, whereas the carbon increase at the Triassic/Cretaceous boundary displays a drop in global temperature.</p>
<p>Were the climate mechanisms of the Dinosaur age different than current climate mechanisms?</p></div>		</li>
