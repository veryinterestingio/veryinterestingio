			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation as well. I have experimented with eggless recipes and they have worked very well as well. </p>
<p>There's <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-secular-shepherd/201604/edward-bernays-uncle-freud-and-betty-crocker" target="_blank">bernay's contribution</a> to this tradition as well...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my favorite stories is how Bernays was approached to find out why a new product category, instant cake-mix,  was not selling well.  This formula was developed during WWII to create foods by simply adding water to premixed dry ingredients and then cooking or baking.  Bernays declared that an “egg” was needed in the recipe.  Psychologically, he argued (straight from his uncle’s theory), adding an egg to the recipe provided the mother to symbolically give her egg to the family...more likely, the additional step allowed the baker to feel as if she (at that time) was doing more than just adding water to complete a cake recipe.  Sales thereafter skyrocketed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dan Ariely explains it in his book. When you just add water and mix and bake you do not consider it your &quot;creation&quot; - it is no different from buying a finished cake or pre-baked one. So the manufacturer of those cake blends required the customer to add an egg and that made it something that they created (as opposed to factory or somebody else).</p>
<p>Dan Ariely has identified &quot;The IKEA effect&quot; ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect</a> ) - you are more likely to like to things that you invested some effort or parts in. They even talk about this &quot;add an egg&quot; in the Ikea effect wiki page.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny to find this on reddit as I learned that in class just a few days ago. It wasn't selling well because the one making them didn't feel any effort at all, which led them to have no &quot;invested time&quot; into it. When you invest your time or effort into it you are much more biased towards it thus it will &quot;taste better&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes... no source on hand, and it's super late so... Google? Sorry dude, I read a long article on how pigeons are kind of the forgotten domestic animal, I think on r/animalsbeingbros </p>
<p>From what I recall, the reason there are so many in cities is because they were kind of the urban chicken. They took very little space, bred fast, behaved well, were smart enough to be trained, and their eggs are totally edible. We just kinda forgot them once we got decent communication systems and mass produced meat, and they have been hanging around people since. </p>
<p>Also their poop was one of the best and most widely used fertilisers before nitrogen fixation was discovered, if I recall correctly. </p></div>		</li>
