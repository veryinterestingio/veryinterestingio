			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about these externalities is that they are also a tragedy of the commons (another thing the market doesn’t handle well) in that one corporation behaving badly doesn’t create a huge, immediate impact but every corporation behaving badly does. This is how it’s gotten to this point without anybody fighting back.</p>
<p>Think of this like picking flowers in a nature park, if one person does it, NBD, but if every person does it then the flowers could be totally wiped out so in order to prevent that the rule needs to be that nobody can pick the flowers or they have to pay the gift shop for picked flowers.</p>
<p>No one corporation is to blame for pollution but the sum of a lot of small cost saving decisions with small externalities (using one plastic bottle over a glass one for example) ultimately leads to a pile of plastic trash in the ocean the size of Texas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. However, Garrett Hardin didn't get it quite right. The commons should not be conflated with open access. His paper should've been called tragedy of the open access, not tragedy of the commons. A true commons includes a series of tacit social codes/laws that are enforced either socially/legally. Many traditional economies/societies have had successful forms of commons, the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09538250120102769" target="_blank">Pastoralist Maasai of East Africa</a> for instance. There are many alternate (and historically successful) economic frameworks/systems that span the spectrum between private property rights on one end and open access on the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you can call them rational, but sociopaths. Rational is not killing the planet for the sake of short term profit, as that leads to their own doom, which is highly irrational. They are sacrificing their own futures and the futures of others for profit now. They gamble on dying or others solving the problem before climate change is a real issue which is more sociopathic than anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You get to the nash equilibrium in a prisoner's dilemma through rational thinking. If every company knows they won't make a difference by themselves by pulling out, then might as well profit from the situation in order to have money when it all goes to shit. </p>
<p>Even if you got all companies to sign an agreement, behave and take care of the planet, if you have no way of punishing anyone who break the agreement, then it is not an equilibrium cause every company has incentives to start misbehaving cause no single company will doom the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but they have every incentive to ensure no one can punish them for doing it. </p>
<p>Its like your parents having you and your siblings decide if stealing from the cookie jar should be punishable or not. Its obviously a bad idea to let those who benefit from the wrong choice make the decision, and yet the government does just that. The corporations are feeding the people crumbs to pacify them, and the government cookies to keep them on their side, all while they steal all the cookies they can handle from the jar. </p>
<p>In the end, the government is supposed to step up here and be the parent its supposed to be, make the hard decision for the better future. Instead its feasting on the cookies while the toddlers are being tricked as the teenager raids the jar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you're the head of a major plastic-producing company, at the moment it is very difficult to reduce plastic production significantly without repercussions for your job. Companies are designed to make a profit, and therefore they will never do anything which does not help achieve that goal and you cannot expect them to.</p></div>		</li>
