<p>Dr. <del>Creepy</del> St. Martin would dip stuff in the hole to see what happened and contributed greatly to our understanding of the gastric system. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit - when he died in 1880 his family had to let his decomposition get all good &amp; juicy to avoid anyone digging him up to perform an autopsy which was against his wishes, he was illiterate and Dr Beaumont made him sign a contract to become his personal servant, doing odd jobs and forcing him to go through with the experiements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is also important to note that the “plug” goes into the rumen of the cow.  That part of the stomach is not full of stomach acid.  It’s a 50 gal vat of sauerkraut.</p>
<p>The rumen is where all the microorganisms break down cellulose.  This is why a cow can do so well on grass, the microbes are doing the work not the cow.  The cows “true stomach” is similar to ours, and I have only seen a few cows with ports in that part.  They had to be kept in head stalls as that port could kill them if it was bumped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do this to patients all the time. It's called a PEG tube - we pass a camera into their stomach and push it up against their abdominal wall, then make a hole through the skin right into their stomach. This way we can feed people by putting food right into their stomach when they cant swallow.</p></div>		</li>
