When I was younger (now 23)  I hadn't heard of nda's, until like call of duty got into modern warfare, but I feel like there weren't as many leaks when I was like 7-15 because of the pride.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do NDAs have spousal / close friend /whatever privleges in them? I imagine if you had an NDA you might be able to claim that surely. I mean, for one it almost definitely happens harmlessly. I.e, does the law just cover public domain release?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked in games for a little over 10 years for 3 different companies. Each NDA I've signed has not had spousal or close friend privileges, they're pretty strict from a legal stand point. Most industry vets I know will talk to their friends/family about details, but people new to the industry usually take their NDAs very seriously. Some people use it as some sort of weird bragging right, &quot;my job is so secretive I can't tell you about it&quot;.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just to give you an idea of how strict companies take NDAs, a person was fired from my company the other week for taking a selfie of himself sitting in one of the office windows. There was no sensitive media in the picture, just a dude in a window holding a guitar. Our NDA does not allow any kind of photography without management permission, which he did not have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing as the legal and medical fields don't allow you to tell your spouse I'm sure they can make it that strict if they want and why wouldn't they want to? If your spouse blabs the company doesn't have much to do about it. If you trust your spouse to never say anything how would your work know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously not. Why would they? That would be directly contradicting what the NDA is for. But yes, it does happen. I work at a hospital and I would be a blatant liar if I said I have never violated HIPPA by talking to my husband. But my husband is also not stupid and isn't gonna post that shit on facebook. It's usually work talk at dinner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, along with compartmentalization.</p>
<p>The vast majority of employees only touch small parts of the game. Textures, animations, hitboxes etc... One guy might be able to tell you what the protagonist's face looks like, but he won't be able to tell you where the game is set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very important piece of it. Because projects are often compartmentalized like this, it isn’t a matter of “I’m one of thousands of employees, I’ll never get caught.” </p>
<p>If, for instance, the protagonist’s face did get leaked, the number of people with access to that information is much, much smaller than the total number of people on the project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. It is pretty easy to leak info anonymously online. The reasoning that millions of people don't because &quot;They agreed not to&quot; is a lazy one. This is a pretty ingenious way to keep lots of people in the dark and track who has access to what information. Not a sheet that you signed years ago that tells you pls dont.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope this is pretty wrong. The first part is true. But obviously you can know everything about your own game. It's been 6 years I'm working in a big company in big games, and even without being a lead I know 95% of the games I'm working on.</p>
<p>Edit: it is really important to be curious about your own game, when I'm working on a feature I have to know everything related to it, to design it better, to avoid incoherences.</p></div>		</li>
