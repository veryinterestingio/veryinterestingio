<p>I don't think any studies have been done to actually show a link between decreased sleep and Alzheimer's</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, plenty of observational studies have found a strong association between sleep disturbance and Alzheimer's (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5990625/" target="_blank">source</a>). The question is, which comes first? It's a chicken-and-egg problem. Since we can't pinpoint the exact time when Alzheimer's begins (usually long before initial symptoms), it's difficult to determine if sleep disturbances cause Alzheimer's, or vice versa.</p>
<p>There's also a potential confounder in the mix. Many people with sleep disturbances use antihistamines as sleeping aids. Antihistamines are anticholinergic medications, and they are known to increase risk of Alzheimer's. So, it's possible that the real culprit is the <em>sleeping aid</em>, not the sleep disturbance itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much does each night of good sleep &quot;clean away&quot;?</p>
<p>They talk of 'sleep debt', but is it like &quot;a solid night of sleep will only clear x amount of beta-amyloid&quot;?  </p>
<p>To speak plainly, I've had terrible sleep for years now, for a time it was only 4-5 hrs a night for months on end.<br />
How many nights of good quality, good length sleep is required to restore your brain to optimal condition? Even ballpark number.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance if you see this and have an answer, as I'm genuinely interested. The fact It may personally impact me was simply what began my interest in how sleep works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the answer to your question, but I recommend you listen to Matthew Walker on the Joe Rogan podcast posted below by another user. Really a wealth of information about sleep. Can read his book either, but I think most of the information was included in the podcast. He seems unique in that it seems he wasn't just trying to peddle his book and genuinely wants to spread the message about how important good, quality sleep is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spaniard here, the siesta is not as common as people think in Spain, it used to be, people working in the fields 70 years ago had to go to sleep during peak heat hours, but nowadays very few people do siesta, that is why we might not see its effects on the chart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hmm, but isn't this also related because people with longer life expectancy are able to get alzheimer's?</p>
<p>also the fact that being able to diagnose it properly in the first place should be noted as well.</p></div>		</li>

I was in Madrid earlier this year and every night of the week the restaurants and bars were busy until very late. I just assumed they caught up sleep some other take during the day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the problem with resting and naps is that often it takes an hour and a half to go through one full sleep cycle, and beta-amyloid's aren't wiped until the deepest stage of sleep.  Taking a nap isn't going to have any meaningful impact on sleep health unless you get at least an hour and a half.  It'll make you feel better, but it won't impact something like beta-amyloid eradication.</p></div>		</li>
