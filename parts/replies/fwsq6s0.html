<p>It varies slightly every time I discover one of my friends fall for it but it's essentially a forced magazine or website subscription <em>filled with success stories</em>, self help tapes/CDs/paid podcasts, and &quot;motivational&quot; speeches from the upper tiers. MLM get really sly about how this money flows upwards. For example, members have to buy the motivational tapes but are encouraged to give them away to bottom dwelling members as a tool to entice them to buy the next ones for themselves. Lower tier members aren't allowed to make their own recordings for distribution. </p>
<p>The speeches are usually rehashed, sometimes for decades. Different people will tell the same stories. I had a (no longer) friend attempt to get me to join an MLM when I was young and dumb. Gave me a tape with the &quot;Corvette story&quot;. Prompted me to join him on a trip to Las Vegas to visit a convention (for fuel, ticket and hotel costs) to listen to.... the same damn speech, verbatim, as on the tape by a different individual. The whole damn thing smelled so fishy it took me six months to get the smell off of me.  </p>
<p>But as long as the MLM members cycle through new patsies and brain wash the rest, those on the upper tiers have another source of income that has nothing to do with products.</p></div>		</li>
