			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither of these are likely outcomes (or maybe even possible outcomes) based on the sources above. Coming at this from the perspective of the Jackson et al, results, as for an &quot;ice age in Europe&quot;, weakening/destabilization of the AMOC certainly leads to cooling of Europe but not necessarily to the point where you'd expect a reformation of something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weichselian_glaciation" target="_blank">Fennoscandian Ice Sheet</a> (plus the models suggest a drying along with the cooling for Europe). As for &quot;desertification in the American northeast&quot; this is not suggested in the Jackson results at least. There you see a modest reduction in precipitation (&lt;0.5 mm/day), but also less evaporation, so on balance, it gets wetter in northeastern North America (i.e., less rain, but an even larger reduction in evaporation). All of this is predicated on one model, so the caveats above are extremely important and the answer might differ depending on a lot of details. Also critical for questions like this are things like this are the duration of the effect and how this would play out in concert with rising CO2 and global temperatures as a whole. There may be models out there that look at a weakening AMOC along with a projected CO2 forcing, but I didn't see much in my admittedly quick digging over my morning coffee.</p></div>		</li>
