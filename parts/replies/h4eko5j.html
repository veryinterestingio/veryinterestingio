			<div class="markdown"><p>When you signed up to be a &quot;Neilsen family&quot; and have a ratings box on your tv to record what you're watching, you had to fill out a questionnaire - so they knew exactly how many people live in your house and whether or not who would be watching - i.e. they knew your children were 5 and 8, so if your household was watching Nightline for example, they would assume that your children were probably NOT watching, but that the two parents were.</p>
<p>But yeah, in general its a statistical approximation/extrapolation.  They don't know <em>exactly</em> how many people are actually watching.</p>
<p>Funny, nowadays with streaming and digital cable they DO know exactly how many people are watching and when.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Netflix know exactly how many people are watching a specific piece of content, and can definitely multiply that by the average number of people in a room watching tv.</p>
<p>Even without doing that, just knowing the number of concurrent streams is massively valuable data.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the commenter is kinda okay.  I'm not sure why they did it that way (i.e., still confused).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No - they didn't do that. You are thinking in terms of how they did modern Nielsen TV surveys in the 1990's before digital cable boxes.</p>
<p>At that time there were 5 channels on the television. It was a safe bet to assume that everyone who owned a television wasn't watching Bonanza and was instead watching man LAND ON THE FUCKING MOON.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the easier and more accurate calculation would be &quot;how many TVs are there and how many people can feasibly get in front of one rn&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they did in fact do that.  </p>
<p>The Neilson surveys as that person described started in the 1950s.  The moon landing was in the 1960s.  They did indeed do exactly what the other person described.  </p>
<p>But no globally. The global figures I'm not entirely sure where they got from, but there appears to be some guesswork involved, so you are probably right when it comes to countries that did not have Neilson data.  </p>
<p>But the US at least did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They know the survey works because if they surveyed 10 times the usual people then the results don't change, they already have their representative sample. And they did test their survey methodology like this. They can also correlate their survey results with the increased sales experienced by advertisers, or by how many people call into the show, or any metric they can find. Having the best understanding of all that data is extremely valuable.</p></div>		</li>
