			<div class="markdown"><p>Most faults creep to some extent, it's not an either or. The fault mentioned in the quote also has a 30-50% chance of producing a 6.7+ earthquake within the next 25 years or do. </p>
<p>I also don't see how that invalidates &quot;when displacement becomes too much, fix it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aseismic creep does not equal interseismic creep. The former is essentially slow slip at the average slip rate along a semi-discrete fault plane and thus can produce slow, but localized displacements. The latter is distributed over a width roughly equivalent to the locking depth of the fault in question, so usually several kilometers. Essentially all faults experience interseismic creep because of viscoelastic rheology of the upper crust, but aseismic creep is kind of a special condition that you don't find on that many faults (and usually only on certain sections of faults, e.g., <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/books/book/911/chapter/4671158/A-field-guide-to-the-central-creeping-section-of" target="_blank">the creeping section of the San Andreas</a>).</p></div>		</li>
