			<div class="markdown"><p>If by calculations, you mean &quot;evaluation of historical information&quot;, then yes. The sources don't give us consistent information, the main piece is that Herodes died 4 BC, so Jesus must have been born before that. The census which caused his parents to go to Bethlehem is most likely a false information (introduced to motivate the voyage to the symbolic &quot;David's city&quot;) since there was no such census until 6/7 AD. We therefore estimate Jesus to be born in the three last years of Herodes' life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would have put the census right around the time when Jesus was 9 or 10. Perfect time to start forming long term memories, must have been a traumatic experience to essentialy move countries and become homeless. Would explain why which ever version of Jesus that story happend to would have related it. From a narative standpoint the story really isn't anything impressive, but it would have been a pivotal moment in young Jesus's life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Roman Empire was pretty much on its last leg&quot;</p>

<p>This can't be true. If you date the end of the empire in the west by the convention or by Nepos, it ends in AD 476 or AD 480. If dating the destruction of the rump state in Soissons it ends in AD 486. The Eastern Roman Empire, in which Dionysius Exiguus lived, continued until AD 1453. Exiguus even lived during the reign of the emperor Justinian, called 'the Great', whose accomplishments against the Vandals and Ostrogoths led to the reconquest of Roman Italy and Africa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you give us an example of what a year would look like on a calendar before Dionysius came up with what we use now? Also, was the Roman empire the first to use years on the calendar? I'm curious what other civilizations used before Dionysius.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dionysius' dating system did not become widespread for many years after its invention. The way most people counted years in the late antique period was pretty traditional: they continued to do what they did previously.</p>
<p>The Romans in the republican period through to the late empire dated in terms of consuls. If the consuls in this year are Pompey and Crassus, this year is the year of the consulship of Pompey and Crassus (in this case, both 70 and 55 BC, because they were colleagues in both years). In Rome, the consuls for every year were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasti_Capitolini" target="_blank">carved into stone</a> and put up in the forum. Other common dating systems in classical antiquity were the year of the monarch (used in Britain until reforms in 1962, eg this year is 69–70 Eliz 2), the year of the Olympiad (starting in 776 BC, each Olympiad lasts four years), etc. Common in the Hellenistic world also were years of Alexander or the the Seleucids. Bonnie Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens, The Oxford Companion to the Year (1999) 765. The Romans sometimes dated from the foundation of the city, but this was used &quot;very rarely as a formal dating system&quot;. Ibid.</p>
<p>Other calendars also used were the year of Abraham (starting in 2016 BC), the year of Christ's death (depending on who you ask, it starts in AD 28 or 34, inter alia), and years from the Jewish Exodus from Egypt. Ibid 766. Most calendars also were not counted in terms of 1 Jan, 2 Jan, ... 31 Jan. Greeks counted the last ten days of the month in reverse. The Romans traditionally counted days before the Kalends (first of the month), the Nones (9 days before the Ides, inclusive), and the Ides (the middle of the month). Ibid 783. For example, the second Battle of Philippi occurred on 23 Oct 42 BC, or 10th day before the Kalends of November in the year of the consulship of Lepidus and Plancus. There also were various systems of months, years starting also at various times. Eg the prehistoric Romans traditionally started the year on 1 Mar (ie 28 Feb year 2... 1 Mar year 3). The Byzantines started the year on 1 Sept. Ibid 784–5.</p>
<p>The <em>fasti</em> with which the Romans used to official date their years (with the names of the ordinary consuls, eg 59 BC being Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Bibulus) were irrelevant after 534 and 541 in west and eastern Rome, as consuls stopped being appointed. Jorg Rupke, <em>The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine</em> (2017) 156. This doesn't mean, however, that Dionysius' dating system was adopted wholesale: the death of the philosopher Proclus is dated in terms of years after the accession of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_(emperor)" target="_blank">Julian</a>. Ibid 156–7. The calendar itself only became widely used in the early modern period. Ibid 157.</p>
<p>Dionysius' year was calculated at the behest of religious authorities who wanted new tables for when to celebrate Easter. The old tables dated in terms of years from the accession of the emperor Diocletian. Blackburn supra 778. This was common in Egypt, which had until the reign of Diocletian used imperial regnal years; Diocletian changed it over to consular years. Ibid 767. Later, Dionysius – in the cover letter for his work – dated in terms of the then-consuls and the then-indiction (along with some astronometric observations). The indiction was a tax reassessment period lasting 15 years put in place by Constantine. Some of his contemporaries dated in terms of consuls and regnal years (eg the 43rd year of Augustus's reign). Ibid 779.</p></div>		</li>
