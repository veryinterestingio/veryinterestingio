			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not exactly <em>believing</em> contradictory things. It is the confusion and discomfort when a <em>believable</em> idea is encountered which appears from your perspective as incompatible with a belief you already have. The example you gave is a good illustration. Most people do not believe in both creationism and evolution (though some actually do). Normally, someone who believes in creationism will encounter evidence for evolution. That evidence, of course, is credible, believable (if it was not, and was rather seen as absurd, there would be no dissonance). That’s when the discomfort and confusion hit. And the brain reacts defensively. At that point, the person inevitably chooses to hold onto their belief or change their belief, given the incompatibility. FAR too many people choose the former.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify your first paragraph, it's the discomfort created by <em>recognising</em> the competing or contradictory nature of two ideas. We don't experience dissonance by just holding the views, we experience dissonance in the fleeting moments when we recognise their incongruence. This feeling is usually resolved very quickly, often with biases like the confirmation bias.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's exactly what I was thinking. It's not that there's a contradiction, but that something challenges your <em>cosmovision</em> (borrowing the word from spanish) and doesn't fit within the moral framework that defines you as a person. So you find aspects of who you are in conflict and your have to choose. But it's entirely based on opinion and context. (Feel free to skip the next paragraph, it's just examples of how they can easily fit together with no contradiction).</p>
<p>For example there's nothing about creationism and evolution that are directly under contradiction. Creationism states that God created the universe and make it all work according to his ineffable plan. Evolution states that living organisms adapt and change across the generations to whatever is needed in the environment. There's no contradiction there, you can believe that God created life with the ability to change and evolve and that this would lead to better species for the situation. God, knowing everything, knew this would inevitably lead to a species that looked in his shape (God being perfection would be a shape evolution would try to approximate as much as possible) and that this would be humankind, as he planned it. It's nuances that Moses (who might have understood how the universe came to be and worked at a Quantum level even now we do not understand, because God is the perfect teacher) didn't see the point in teaching a bunch of refugees who were not bright (after literally seeing a God that parted the seas for them, and burnt their enemies with a column of fire, they decided to follow some golden idols because how bad could it be to anger that same God)  the details (Moses wasn't God, therefore not as good of a teacher after all) and instead have them a simpler sorry they could understand that pushed the important points forward. When you accept that you could claim that all of Genesis is a metaphor for the actual creation. But even assuming a literal interpretation (understanding that <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm" target="_blank">&quot;a day&quot; in the bible can represent arbitrary lengths of time, as defined by the bible itself</a>)] evolution fits perfectly as a detail that's not mentioned in genesis but happened.</p>
<p>So if there's so many ways to have these two beliefs of the universe fit, why is it a contradiction to many people? Because they chose to believe it. And they chose that this belief had moral points, and that these morals are a key view of who they are. The problem appears when other arguments fight it. That is a person that believes that traits can be inherited, and that culling those with weak traits will result in a better offspring. And this knowledge makes them a good farmer, and this is part of they're identity. But they also believe they're good Christians and that this requires they don't believe in evolution. The conflict here is that they're definition of a good a farmer and a good Christian oppose each other, so (following their definitions) they can't be both as they claim. Basically they have to be a bad christian or a bad farmer, or both. And people don't like to believe they're bad. Si the brain kind of short circuits and avoids the though that makes them realize this. Si they end up believing contradictory thoughts of themselves (I'm a good person because I'm a good farmer who understands and uses evolution, and I'm a good person because I'm a good Christian because I refuse evolution and refuse to use it as a framework) and simply avoid stressful thoughts that bring the contradiction to light. When it does appear you see a panic in the brain to avoid this redefinition of a person, and that's cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>Now people will maintain cognitive dissonance (that is find a way to avoid the conflict, and therefore avoid the stressful full redefinition of who you are) through a multitude of ways. One of them is cognitive bias, where the brain ignores facts that reveal a cognitive dissonance (that their interpretation of the world, and therefore &quot;the person they think they are&quot;, is wrong) and instead focus and double down on whatever facts they find that they can use to their benefit. There's many other ways this happens. Even violence (that's exactly what happened in Capitol a few weeks ago).</p></div>		</li>
