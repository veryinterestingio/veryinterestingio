<p>Is there any explanation as to what sets the speed at which they unravel? Or will we just have figured out immortality when we know that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I have a friend who is a doctor and I remember him telling me about people trying to cut down their movement/caloric intake  to extend their lifespan. &quot;Do nothing, live longer,&quot; I think was his quip.</p>
<p>So, sorry for another follow-up, but, what about amoebas that are supposedly immortal?</p>
<p>I promise I'm not trying to be obnoxious, but this is so interesting to me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When telomeres deplete, those cell lines generally apoptosicize and are replaced by stem cell lines which <em>do</em> produce telomerase.</p>
<p>However, those stem cells <em>also</em> can accumulate potentially-deleterious mutations as you age, so the older an organism the more likely problems will arise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Larger animals (elephants, whales, and humans to a lesser degree) have extra mechanisms in place to do error-correction for just this reason, to the point that elephants &amp; whales don't really get cancer. Humans are actually pretty resistant to cancer, given our size and long lives.</p>
<p>They have to have these mechanisms or else they wouldn't survive to adulthood. An African elephant at birth is already larger than most full-grown humans, and so their cells have undergone a lot of divisions.</p>
<p>The downside of these error-correction mechanisms is that since mutation rates in your offspring are lower,  your species adapts to changing environments more slowly. Mice will definitely get cancer if you can keep them alive long enough, but they'll have lots of babies with varied traits along the way. Stick them in a new environment and they'll adapt pretty fast.</p>
<p>Humans have a nifty trait with regards to this: we can adapt via technological and cultural changes, which don't require breeding a lot and hoping for a lucky mutation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seen lots of press about human trials of telomere arresting and reversal. </p>
<p>Essentially they may be able to take years off, but it is not immortality. People die from diseases, sudden injury, and other things frequently enough that we would just die looking a lot younger.</p>
<p>Since most organs are transplantable, brain disease would seem to be the biggest concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's tied with cancer rates.</p>
<p>Basically cancer is cells mutating to stop doing their jobs and going rogue. Telomeres are more or less &quot;kill switches&quot; to kill cells by a certain point to lower cancer rates. Obviously cancer still happens, but if telomeres were longer cells would live longer thus giving them more time to go cancerous and we'd see cancer happening even more often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presumably, if immortality was evolutionarily advantageous, a mechanism for fixing this could have evolved. But immortality is opting out of evolution, and is dangerous in the event of evolving predators or a changing environment. Shorter generations mean faster evolution, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first take on this: you could theoretically have an organism that matured rapidly, reproduced abundantly, and was immortal. This would still allow for short generations. But unless that organism self-limited its own reproduction, there would be a race to the bottom with a limited resource pool in any given ecological system. Just more and more organisms piling up until they overshot the carrying capacity and had a massive die-off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, bacteria do fit all of those requirements. They have no maturation stage, they can double every 20-30 minutes, and a bacterial cell is as immortal as it gets.</p></div>		</li>
