<p>Wasn't even thinking about that, but yeah. The diminished just doesn't really approximate anything except maybe 7/5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the instruments being used. </p>
<p>String and woodwind instruments could easily do either, but any keyboard instruments are fixed to (usually) 12 tone even temper, which means for the most part so are all other instruments. </p>
<p>If they aren’t tuned to even temper it also means that key changes don’t work because the intervals in the new key will be way out of tune. Even temper allows every key to be played without retuning the instrument each time you change key.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No shit.  I've been trying to understand modes, temperament, naturals, accidentals, etc. and where they came from for years and I'm 12 times older than 5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be: for a specific set frequencies you use a set crayons. Crayons can be 440hz. Then 432 can be markers. When you try to make green, you can't do that by mixing a blue crayon with a yellow marker, they dont mix. It'll look ugly. There's harmony! To further that tou can designate a color per note, and if you do it right then notes too close together will immediately just make bad colors, while the one's further away would blend nicely. </p>
<p>This actually might be a good introductory theory if someone can perfect it!</p></div>		</li>
