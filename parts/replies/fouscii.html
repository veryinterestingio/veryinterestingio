			<div class="markdown"><p>They are indeed small, but they still reflect sunlight. NASA funds telescopes to survey the skies for near-Earth asteroids and other small bodies. A telescope is a light bucket, and it can collect even that small amount of light from a far away asteroid or comet if it is large enough, to help discover the undiscovered asteroids, comets, and interstellar objects.  Those objects also radiate heat, so the right type of telescope in space can be used to see infrared light from those objects and discover even more. ~KF</p></div>		</li>
