			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seriously had Jurassic Park quoted to me for my entire career...especially the &quot;nature finds a way&quot; quote! I wonder sometimes if other fields have the same thing happen. Do trekkies quote science fiction to rocket scientists to dissuade their research? One thing I have learnt is you can not &quot;re-educate&quot; the public - rather you can have a discussion. And many have the type of dystopian future in their minds as that is how scientists are typically portrayed in the movies - typically either as evil maniacs or hapless souls being manipulated by evil companies. However, in my experience my colleagues are working on really important problems - for which genetics provides one potential solution. In my experience having a discussion about the problems we are trying to address in the presence of the editing animals which typically are indistinguishable from unedited animals (except in my case perhaps lacking horns), helps to demystify this technology, which is typically  being used to inactivate or alter a single allele in one gene. It also enables a discussion of the WHY this technology is being used and the problem that is being tracled. Come visit my lab at UC Davis - I am always happy to show visitors around and of course go and visit the cows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your answer, and thank you for not being dissuaded from your research! You make a very valid point about portrayals of different fields of science in fiction. There’s definitely a double standard, one I will likely see with a more critical eye thanks to your pointing it out. Thank you for having these discussions and being willing to share. If I were ever out that way I’d love to see your work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's also very telling that, litterally, the first science-fiction book ever is Frankenstein. It sets a precedent for how innovation in biology is portrayed, both in the thesis of the book, and the powerful image of the monster.</p></div>		</li>
