			<div class="markdown"><p>climbing chalkâ€™s primary purpose is to remove moisture from the hands, modern climbing chalk has shit like magnesium to add grip. that has come with revision of the sport to get maximum performance. og climbers used plain chalk
e: plain chalk meaning writing chalk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;plain chalk&quot; is still not the same substance as talcum powder though.</p>
<p>Chalk is magnesium carbonate, talc is magnesium silicate. Baby powder is talc + corn starch, or just corn starch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I were a guy I think I'd be more inclined to try this, but I don't wanna accidentally dry my lady parts right out haha!  I'll definitely try using baby powder to climb once just to try it out though, sounds like an interesting challenge ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		</li>
