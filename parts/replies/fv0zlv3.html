			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;giving somebody else's antibody&quot; only offers to the immune system of the other person to continue to create that particular antibody (which helps the system to be stronger), but it WONT give the person immunity at anytime. The negative thing is that sometimes it can be named as an infection as well (bc they are not atibodies produced from your own system). The opposite happens with vaccination. You get the vaccine which TRAINS your body to produce a highly-specific antibody before you getting infected, so whenever you get infected you are already strong enough to fight it, and it will never be treated as a threat by your system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is the exact concept behind plasma donation as treatment. It is called active immunization, has been shown to be very effective against other viruses, and early results for COVID are promising. </p>
<p>It does last, the reason being that the antibody complex that forms has a dual purpose of keeping the virus in check, as well as jump starting the production of your own antibodies. </p>
<p>The process of coding for the new antibodies is completely separate from developing them, so in theory you are cutting out the main source of lag time that typically occurs with a new exposure.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Briefly.</p>
<p>Vaccination isn't having the things in your blood, though.  It's teaching your immune system to make them consistently.</p>
<p>The stuff you'd bring over in the blood ages out in a couple days.  Your system needs to make more</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If somebody with antidotes donated plasma and then was immediately exposed to the virus, would the response of their immune system be slower at first, before they created what is needed, or does the starting numbers of antibodies not play a role?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Number of antibodies does play a role, but the amount present in an 800 mL donation is negligible compared to the amount produced during an active infection. The most important factor by far is the immune systemâ€™s ability to build the weaponry necessary to mount a response within the first couple of days- donating does not affect this process in the slightest.</p></div>		</li>
