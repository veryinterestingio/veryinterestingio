			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! We work with a wide range of applications of remote sensing data. My own work is really focused on studying tropical forests and trees, especially mangroves. These trees and shrubs grow in coastal areas in the tropics and sub tropical areas. We have been using remote sensing data to map their extent, their height, biomass and Carbon Stocks. The most unusal thing we found was giant mangrove trees - up to 65 m/213 feet tall! We would not have found them if it wasn't for the really cool remote sensing datasets we have available. - Lola Fatoyinbo   </p>
<p>We are estimating biomass of trees and shrubs using Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation on the International Space Station, airborne lidar (light detection and ranging), and ground based terrestrial laser scanning (equivalent to a ground based lidar). One fun challenge of this is to estimate not just the biomass but the different shapes and structures (between and within species) of the trees because they influence how much snow reaches the ground surface. We are interested in estimating snowpack! An unusual challenge is that when it comes to shrubs, they are short, and with the technology we currently have, are difficult to estimate biomass. We love challenges! - Nancy Glenn</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your answers! Do you have any complications working with mangroves, since they’re often found over peat or other soft sediments?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we sink into the mud a lot and it's really difficult to get around, above and below the giant prop roots. Plus there are tides, so sometimes we stand waist deep in water. It's still a lot of fun and such an important ecosystem to study and conserve! Lola Fatoyinbo</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Measuring the location and number of trees provides really important information about the carbon cycle. We are interested in understanding the biomass locally, regionally, and globally…anywhere a tree can grow!  Yes, the GLOBE Program and the GLOBE Observer mobile app allow you to record the type of trees or forests you are looking at, but is not required. Describing the shapes, textures, and making measurements to group tree types is a great skill to learn. A big surprise is finding the solitary trees that are growing at the extremes (farthest north/south, highest elevation). Get to know your tree neighbors and contribute your observations as those trees keep changing over time!  – Peder Nelson</p></div>		</li>
