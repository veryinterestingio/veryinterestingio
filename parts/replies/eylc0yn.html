			<div class="markdown"><p>After a certain threshold, it just kinda can't...like I believe there were studies where 30% of a liver can end up growing back and doing its job...but if 68% of it is inflamed or scarred...well...you know, too much damage for it to try.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That depends on the way you define &quot;fully&quot;. Your liver is made of two lobes, you can donate one lobe as a transplant and the remaining lobe will grow to take the load. It is ~3/4 as effective as a full healthy liver, which is pretty effective, I guess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then why cirrhosis?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cirrhosis is a result of chronic liver disease. Something like Hepatitis or alcoholism will do that type of damage.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Why the downvote, not ELI5 enough?</p></div>		</li>
