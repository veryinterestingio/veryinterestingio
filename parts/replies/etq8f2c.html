			<div class="markdown"><p>This is supporting what you've said, but there's an interesting case in the Allegheny National Forest.     </p>
<p>Prior to the NF being created, the area had been clear-cut from a \~300 year old forest (the 300-year-old forest had grown back after a major wildfire).    Once the national forest was created and they started managing tree growth there, they discovered that there were sections where the forests didn't grow back.     </p>
<p>The problem was the water table: once the trees were gone, the water table rose in these areas, and made them inhospitable to trees.   The meadows have been gradually getting smaller as the trees at the edges make headway against the water, but it's a century-scale process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>disturbance like a fire or landslide</p>

<p>Is another possible explanation snow cover? In more mountainous regions at least, would longer strips of land with fewer trees be caused by or be the cause of increased snow pile-up / resulting runoff?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even snow cover but just straight temperature is often enough. In the mountains you'll see a distinct vertical gradient, with a fairly defined tree line that (in NZ) only tussock grass can grow above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I've explored a lot of the rocky mountains and I've very often come across meadows in the middle of absolute nowhere, miles away from any civilization, just right in the middle of a forest. Trees on all sides and just a meadow. They're actually really nice to see because it allows you to get out from under the trees for a bit. :) You can also clearly tell if animals frequent the meadow simply by the trails and nesting spots.</p></div>		</li>
