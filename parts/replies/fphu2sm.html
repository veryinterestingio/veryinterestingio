<p>I've bought 4 TV's for every monitor in my house.  The TV's get outdated quickly and I don't care.  Meanwhile, my monitor is coming up on 5 years old and I still think it's &quot;new&quot; because it's been a trooper the whole time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, isn't the update cycle for a TV like 10+ years? I know people that updated to LCD/plasma/oled last year.</p>
<p>My parents are on their 5th TV since the 80s. But have updated monitors like 30 times by now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer and it becomes much more important with higher spec TVs.
A LG C9 Oled is going to be sold millions of times - even with its high price tag.
How many 144hz 4k monitors are sold a year? And then split it across the companies creating it. </p>
<p>And then factor in research. Monitors are indeed better at certain things (so please dont discount this completely) which means you need constant upgrades while TVs rather make small updates every year and then a big update once some new screen technology is being pushed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What fancy pants office are you working at, lol. Every office I've ever worked at has had a Dell or HP 1080p monitor/s for their workstations. <em>Maybe</em> a couple larger than that here and there for special cases.</p></div>		</li>
