			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this: simple cost viability.  Basically even if something works, it may never become cost effective to put into widespread production.  While things like cancer treatments or other life saving products, etc would still be pushed forward, battery technology etc may be relegated to niche markets for specific uses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Science and medical reporting is notoriously premature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who works in the field, I think it's important to point out that the vast majority of the headlines OP is likely thinking of are not examples of science or medical reporting. They're press released written by the researchers' institutions or the journals that published the original study. </p>
<p>Sometimes they'll be lightly rewritten and packaged up by aggregator sites to make them seem more like journalistic articles, but they are not passing through any sort of &quot;newsworthiness&quot; filter that would block 95% of these releases for being premature. </p>
<p>Which is not to say they're inaccurate! In my experience as both a science journalist and someone who writes those press releases, all of the caveats about necessary next steps are in there — they're just hard to capture in a headline, or that nuance is flattened out as it gets laundered through various social media channels (very much including r/science).</p>
<p>Real science reporting is slow, expensive and increasingly <em>rare</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this would have been my comment as well. Professor X makes an exciting and significant finding, it’s published in a top peer-reviewed journal; the university’s PR dept. writes a brief because it’s good prestige for the school, and they put it up on the splash page of the college website; Buzzfeed picks it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're missing the crucial step — the press release is picked up by aggregators and bots that publish literally everything. The actual humans who work at Buzzfeed, etc. are skimming the top of that churn for things that at least superficially seem interesting or noteworthy. </p>
<p>But Buzzfeed is actually the perfect example of this dynamic, since without that high-profit-margin churnalism, the journalists who work at Buzzfeed<em>News</em> wouldn't get paid. BuzzfeedNews has two Pulitzer nominations and its previous top science editor left there for the <em>New York Times</em>, for what it's worth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember during some submissions/revisions of papers there was a checkbox if I thought my work was “news worthy”.  It never was. But I did see some of this ground breaking cancer curing news reports. You have a scientist that goes up in front of a camera that has zero social or laymen skills. Babbles on a bunch of big words and then it’s up to the reporter/journalist to make heads or tails of it. It gets oversimplified for the average reader and as such some things get exaggerated or misconstrued.</p></div>		</li>
