			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually one of the major plot threads in Ice Age: The Meltdown. It's a documentary about (amongst other things) a wooly mammoth raised by possums. Worth a watch if you're into art-house (Cannes type) movies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, with the vast amount of intellect required to digest information presented in a documentary like Ice age, I doubt that anyone capable of understanding such complex concepts would be caught wasting their time on a subreddit of this nature. I myself am merely browsing as a means of gaining some insight into the dull interactions that obtuse persons take part in to exchange simplistic information. A somewhat refreshing pastime after the copious amount of studies I conduct through the viewing of the highly rated educational media known as Prick and Shorty. </p></div>		</li>
