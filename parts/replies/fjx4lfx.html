			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but I would say security and cost. Bank transfers are done under much tighter scrutiny either in person, via an online portal or via telephone banking. Debit/credit cards are meant to be convenient so the security is arguably watered down but has lots of steps in between. In the UK we have CHAPs same day payment) and BACs (3 days to clear). These are not free and carry a cost for most businesses. When you pop into the bank and transfer money this cost your bank and they likely built this cost into their model either via account fees or by paying you less interest on your money in your bank in exchange for the services they offer. If all payments were instant it would likely push prices up and make fraud so much hard to trace and follow as everything would be happening in real-time. Think stock market on a bad day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be the difference between and ACH and a fed wire, assuming you’re in the U.S( I’m unaware of foreign countries). ACH’s generally go through a couple processors that then post to your bank and then the bank will post to your account. Usually the last step is systematic. But there are some banks that post some entries manually ( depending on how they come through)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many flow charts and they vary in complexity but most don't address the question as to why it takes so long. They mostly show lots of steps (which doesn't equate to taking a long time). The only thing I took from them is that most of the steps involve your money being in limbo with a bank or intermediary system. Some have suggested the banks gain by keeping money in limbo (I can't disprove that) but I can tell you overhauling the whole system to be quicker would cost a lot of money and banks wouldn't massively benefit from this investment. It's what has allowed the likes of PayPal to do so well, as they've started from scratch and designed near instant payment systems. There are likely some security benefits to the slow banking methods, one is that it allows interrogation of transactions which can be flagged and blocked, if everything was instant I doubt these systems could be quick enough to respond before the money was diverted to 100 other accounts. I'm not claiming to know details but I worked in retail, testing and helping roll out ePOS (till) systems so I know first hand the built in limits of debit/credit payment but not the banking systems themselves apart from what has been explained to me from the card processors themselves e.g worldpay, streamline. If anyone technical from banking answers they can go into detail but this explain it like I'm five.</p></div>		</li>
