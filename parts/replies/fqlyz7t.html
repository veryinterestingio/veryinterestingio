			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a side-note, we've co-opted the envelope protein from one rhabdovirus, the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and use it quite commonly. A common biologic tool for genome manipulation is to infect a cell line with a cored-out retrovirus (uses many of the HIV proteins but is completely replication incapable and numerous other modifications to make it biosafe). In order for maximum utility, we swap out the HIV envelope protein gp120 with the VSV-G protein. gp120 only binds to receptors on T-helper cells in humans whereas VSV-G pretty much can allow viral entry into any mammalian cell (and many other distant animal cells).</p>
<p>For biology, the difference between organisms is of course huge, but just as huge is the difference between cell lineages. Not only can VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus infect liver or kidney cells, it can infect neurons and white blood cells and stem cells. </p>
<p>When I first started working with these, it sounded absolutely terrifying (HIV that can infect any cell????) but there have been years and years of development and now four generations of it, with each generation ensuring higher biosafety and lower potential for misuse and accident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s funny when you realize that it would be really easy to take something biological and mix it with something or modify it in such a way that serves no real medical use but makes it deadly in whole new ways. I study snake venoms and venomous snakes, and I’ve always been very curious whether just the right DMSO concentration would be able to make the normally impermeable proteins (specifically small, non enzymatic but highly toxic venom proteins like alpha cobratoxin or scutatoxon) toxic via aerosalization due to DMSO’s ability to increase the lipophilicity of certain molecules and help them cross cell membranes when normally it’s impermeable.   There’s no reason to do the experiment, but it’s fascinating to think about.  We obviously have much worse chemical weapons easier to mass produce than any venom protein... but the mad scientist in me wants to know, haha.  Obviously anything self replicating or pathogenic has a much greater reason for making more redundant safe guards.</p></div>		</li>
