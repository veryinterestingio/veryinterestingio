			<div class="markdown"><p>The Israeli data seems to contradict other studies pretty strongly, both the effectiveness of the vaccine against Delta and in the supposed rapid drop in vaccine effectiveness. The NEJM just released a study suggesting the Pfizer vaccine is still nearly 90% effective against Delta.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Israeli data is preliminary and only suggests that the Pfizer vaccine is less effective at breakthrough infection for delta (news sources say 64%, cannot find a good link to published study so someone like if you have one, the NEMJ one above is an example of a thorough study, search for the Israeli study and you get linked to financial websites, so what do you make of that?)</p>
<p>What the Israeli study does admit is that the Pfizer vaccine is still 93% effective against hospitalization, meaning the people who do get Delta infected will have mostly milder to no symptoms, they remain a transmission issue, meaning they can contribute to unvaccinated people getting sick. </p>
<p>Basically, the unvaccinated decided they are going for herd immunity, so at this point may as well let them all catch Delta, take their fatalities, and move on accordingly. As stated somewhere above, the Delta is contagious enough that any expose will likely lead to infection. So, say 1% of unvaccinated people to die in the next year, well, 1% of unvaccinated people who haven't already had the virus. Assuming under reporting, that's about 35MM positive cases, so assume 3x that which is 1/3 of the US population, divide by 2 since we are 50% vaccinated, leaving 100MM people will get Delta in the next year if not vaccinated, meaning 1MM antivaxers and small children (ineligible yet) will die in the next year. I expect the amount of vaccinated people dying will be no more than the number that die of the flu annually. </p>
<p>Until children are able to get vaccinated, anyone in contact with small children, vaccinated or not should mask up, otherwise at this point let the chips fall. Also the question remains how long vaccines provide immunity and how long natural immunity from infection lasts. One study indicated years of protection, and almost permanent if both infection and vaccination (assuming no major virus mutations)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. Hadnt heard the out competing theory before, but at a glance it makes sense. Any virologists or immunologists on here to give their two cents? I'll probably google around some too. More data is always better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this &quot;out competing of variants&quot; work? Does this mean the other variants were eradicated because of measures (like e.g. many vaccinated people). I guess delta does not actually fight the other variants and there are not enough cases that we could say delta &quot;immunized&quot; already so many people that they cannot be infected anymore with alpha. </p>
<p>So how does this work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since having any variant of COVID makes people resistant to all variants (regardless of how strong the resistance is, it's clearly not zero), a very fast-spreading variant effectively inoculates the population against other variants. </p>
<p>The people most likely to get infected are the same for all variants (i.e. people not masking or isolating), so those people all getting Delta makes it hard for other, less-contagious variants to get a foothold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am just a layman here, and my question will be based on thinking from whatever info we have heard from the news: even if Delta variant is highly contagious and as Slavitt's example said that in case of India, Delta variant ripped through it's population and giving kind of immunity to a large population (that's what I understood), don't the antibodies and the memory of those antibodies in the immune system last only for few days? When the pandemic started spreading in India in June 2020, it was estimated that millions of Indians were infected by it. If that was true, then was there herd immunity achieved by infecting such a large population? There was a drop in cases after that, so that's why this comes to my mind. </p>
<p>Another question is, even if Delta variant cases have dropped have dropped in India now, there is a new Delta+ variant and some other variants are also coming up. Even if there is a herd immunity achieved by Delta variant infections, won't be there a danger of getting new variants after some time like what happened in India: surge in cases in both years caused by different variants?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because delta is more contagious its infecting people faster than other strains. This allows delta to outcompete other strains because it can spread itself around faster. Another strain would come along, let's say the alpha variant or another that is resistant to vaccines, and find there is nobody to infect because delta got there first. The other variants are still there it's just that delta is more prominent because it's so much better at spreading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses can't survive without a host, in this case humans. If you prevent humans from being infected through vaccination, masks, cleaning etc the virus will start to die out because it can't spread to any new hosts. Once a person has been infected with a variant of covid they'll have antibodies against it which will recognise the other variants as well (to a certain extent depending on variant). Because the Delta variant is better at spreading, it's beating the other variants to infect the hosts. Once the host has been infected by the Delta variant, the other variants can't infect the same host* so we say they've been &quot;out-competed&quot; as it's literally like they've been beaten in the race to infect and survive. This is good news for us because the vaccines don't protect us as well against some of the variants so the fewer of those variants floating around the better.</p>
<p>The next bit doesn't answer your question but I think it gives a useful perspective that people don't often think about. It isn't the goal of viruses to be the most deadly. Dead person = dead end, the person is no longer walking around coughing/sneezing/vomiting the virus over everyone else so the virus can't spread to new hosts as easily. It's much more beneficial for the virus to just make us a little sick or not sick at all. So variants that are more transmissable or more infectious do well compared to super deadly ones. </p>
<p>*They are still capable of physically infecting the host but they will not be able to establish themselves and replicate because they'll be picked up by the immune system before that can happen. However there are some cases where people are being infected with two different strains because they didn't produce a great immune response to the first.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a nice piece of pop science, but so far the more transmissible variants also appear to be more deadly ones, is that not true? The variants of concern we’ve seen so far generate generally increased viral load, and it sort of makes intuitive sense that a variant that is simply better at making more copies of itself could be both more transmissible and more pathogenic at the same time.</p>
<p>There’s not much short-term selection pressure for a pathogen to be less deadly as long as it gets ample chance to transmit itself before causing severe disease/death. See: HIV, tuberculosis, smallpox.</p></div>		</li>
