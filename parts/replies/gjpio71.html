			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a beekeeper friend, and he showed me one time how his bees had entered into a business arrangement with a local ant colony. The ants were carrying away parasitic mites, dead larvae, and other stuff, presumably to eat them, and basically cleaning up the hive. My friend said that once he stopped trying to kill the ants, he started losing significantly fewer bees to disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard of similar things as well. Bees usually have areas around their hives that they use for trash. They can then let ants clean out this trash. That is much cleaner then letting other parasites infect this trash. However the bees will usually be very protective about their honey and do not let the ants near this. If you look at apiaris they often have screen mesh on the bottom for this reason as bees will not care about ants under the screen to get out the trash. The trash that is too big to go through the mesh will be carried out by the bees where the ants collect it on the ground. It may be possible for ants to enter the hive to collect trash themselves or even live mites but only under the careful supervision of the bees in the hive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Everyone wants their shit. But if you aren’t tricking them into joining your cartel (an apiary by a human) or grow them inside it, you’ll get a bloody mess trying to take them out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>i watched a video where just 2 hornets tore a beehive up. Just absolute destruction.</p>
<p>Ah, I found it. I was wrong. Not 2 hornets. But Giant Hornets vs Honey Bee Hive Colony. Narration saying 1 hornet can kill 300 bees/hr.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess like an army tank could tear through a drug mansion, probably? Doesn’t mean drug mansions are much less scary or effective in doing what they do. </p>
<p>And from my extensive research of watching movies where stuff goes boom and bang, drug mansion guards are much more reckless in their actions. Just like the guard bees, they have not much more to live for than guard the product. </p>
<p>I think the analogy still kinda works. At least that’s how I’ll explain bees to kids from now on. </p>
<p>Like “What’s a bee?”</p>
<p>“Well, imagine a drug cartel...”</p></div>		</li>
