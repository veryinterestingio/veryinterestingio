			<div class="markdown"><p>Simpleton question here, Is all earthbound lead a product of uranium decay? Can we assume that at the start of the process of earth formation that the crust essentially had no lead? Does lead form in supernovae? Since it seems lead is in abundance, is the decay of uranium geologically fast and does it indicate that uranium was once a principle constituent element of crustal geology?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a simpleton question at all.</p>
<p>The Earth contains lead that originated in the Solar Nebula from which the Sun and the Earth formed. </p>
<p>Lead has four stable isotopes 204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb and 208Pb. Of these, 204Pb is called a 'primordial nuclide' which means it is not formed by the decay of heavier atoms; instead it is made in supernovae. It makes up about 1.4% of all the lead found on Earth. So we can definitely say that 1.4% of the lead down here is not from radioactive decay and came from the Solar Nebula.</p>
<p>The three remaining isotopes can also be made in supernovae, but are  each the final result of a chain of radioactive decays from uranium, actinium and thorium respectively. This is called radiogenic lead.</p>
<p>There is a method of radioactive dating called lead-lead dating which uses changes in the concentration of radiogenic lead isotopes with time compared to their primordial values. It is the method most commonly used to date especially ancient rocks and meteorites.</p></div>		</li>
