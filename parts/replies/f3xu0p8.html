			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd consider myself slightly above average fitness but I also own a contracting business. I can assure you that if I don't eat enough calories on any 8 hour day of work, there is a very obvious lack of energy, clear thinking and I get very sore the next day. I absolutely require a solid breakfast, lunch and nutrition bars in between or I'll be paying the price that day and several after. I'd have a hard time comparing what I do to marathon levels of exertion but I'm not sure if I'm not giving myself enough credit. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if this it's arguing for or against you, I'm just providing my personal and easily repeatable, experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd go with you aren't giving yourself enough credit.  By your description you have an active job where you expend a lot of energy that needs to be replenished.  It might not be a marathon, but your work day could easily be six or seven hours (allowing for breaks, some administrative desk work, etc) of activity.  I'd call that endurance exercise, especially compared to someone lifting weights for maybe an hour. </p>
<p>Just walking for six to eight hours is endurance exercise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My comment was specifically about carb timing and athletic performance.  An example would be someone wondering how mant minutes after weightlifting they should consume a recovery product.  For the average person who is doing active things (e.g., going to the gym, working construction, running marathons), when and what carbs one eats around exercise aren't going to heavily impact one's athletic performance with the exception of refueling during endurance exercise.  Carb timing around exercise is another layer on top of being properly fueled, hydrated, and meeting nutritional requirements.    </p>
<p>Another possible exception are diabetics, but controlling blood sugar is a more pressing issue than athletic performance.</p></div>		</li>
