Some people's brain's have the built in systems to mitigate said DDoS attack, whereas others have a poorly (not trying make this sound like an insult) designed system that allows the DDoS to happen. In these poorly implemented systems the DDoS (flashing lights) does what it does best and seizes/crashes the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A seizure can be triggered by just about anything, it depends on the person with epilepsy. So yes, audio signals can trigger them too.</p>
<p>Or it could be none of them, as it is with me. I also have seizures, and a team of neurologists watching and testing me for a week couldn't find a trigger for mine. Mine are effectively random, though my personal neurologist suspects stress is at least a part of it.</p>
<p>They recently put a device in my head that will detect when I'm about to have a seizure (it detects brain waves now and compares it to the last minute, and reacts if it detects massive changes in the brain), and if it does detect one is coming, it sends out 5 tiny, directed pulses of electricity to try and &quot;reset&quot; the neurons causing it. Like catching the out of control swing and pushing it in the same smooth rhythm as it started from.</p>
<p>It doesn't always work, but only because the device noted I am <em>always</em> having a minor seizure. I just started ignoring parts of it (twitching jaw/tongue, inability to speak clearly, so on). Its having trouble neutralizing them because it doesn't know what my baseline actually is. (I'm actually having one as I type this)</p>
<p>Febrile seizures are also a thing, but those are often triggered by brain damage or infection of the brain. High fevers can also induce them. These are not the same as typical seizures, thus are not included in the definition for epilepsy.</p>
<p>Important to note is that having one seizure does not mean you have epilepsy, and most adults have at least one in their lives, usually while they're sleeping. It's when the seizures are constant that the person is diagnosed with epilepsy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get febrile seizures! I've gotten them since I was a few months old. It's happening less and less the older I get, but the first three or four years of my life were pretty intense for my parents. Basically, I would suddenly develop a fever for no apparent reason, and then seize. The first time it happened was at night, and my parents heard weird noises over the baby monitor. My dad jumped into the shower with me and ran cold water all over my little back. Apparently, by the time we got to the hospital I was laughing and a perfectly content baby. Now it usually only happens if I have a legitimate fever from being ill and let the fever get above 102. Fever suppressants are in every room of my house. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The doctors never did figure out why I would suddenly become feverish, and I still have difficulty maintaining an appropriate body temperature. I don't sweat properly, and overheat easily. I have terrible circulation. Babies have even more difficulty regulating their body temperature, so it likely had something to do with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To repeat a question I never get responses to:  </p>
<p>I have epilepsy, and PTSD.  I have only ever had seizures at night, while sleeping, except for the ones I had from being without my medication.   I also have emotional &quot;fits&quot; that feel like absent-seizures but instead of &quot;absence&quot; filled with bewildered, crazed confusion and rage. While we call them panic attacks, they've always felt far more intense and disorienting and sometimes happen when literally <em>nothing is happening to trigger it.</em> Sudden but with a slight &quot;hint&quot; it's coming- like the aura I get before a seizure, but for the rage instead. And they are over within 5-20 minutes as if they never happened (except I'm exhausted and confused). Additionally, I have a cousin who had seizures when he would get overwhelmed as a child. So my question is- do you think the panic attacks could actually be a form of seizure and the nighttime seizures a result of overwhelming dream stimuli?</p>
<p>Currently, after many years of dirt insurance and doctors not caring, their diagnosis is : Unexplained early adult onset epilepsy. We don't know why, take these drugs. </p>
<p>Where on earth did you get the idea that most adults have at least one seizure? My doctors have always insisted there could not be a link between emotions and seizures.  I feel really misinformed right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the person. Not all types of epilepsy are triggered by external stimuli like this... the ones that are a classified as 'reflex epilepsy', usually triggered by something visual or auditory but it can be anything. A smell. A touch. I've met much fewer people who have auditory or 'musicogenic' epilepsy... I don't know how representative that is of the general population.</p>
<p>Most people who can feel a seizure 'coming on' experience what are called 'auras': sometimes it is literally light, but it can be sounds or feelings or even just a sense that something is 'off', like a glitch in the Matrix or the shape of space changed or... something. People I've met who are triggered <em>solely</em> by music all say they have some emotional connection to the music that sets them off, almost like they ride the emotion into the seizure, or (more to the point) have to make an effort to <em>stop themselves</em> from doing so. I don't recall any of them mentioning visual/light auras, which - like people who only react to lights - might say something about the part of their brain that is glitching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS IS AN AWESOME EXPLANATION!</p>
<p>So, if I understand this correctly, to keep a flashing light from causing such a potential seizure, all you have to do is keep it out of the necessary rhythm -- slow it down or speed it up -- so that it doesn't synch with the brain wave rhythms and push the &quot;swinging kid&quot; up and over, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not exactly, and the analogy is imperfect in this way. Slowing it down enough might prevent seizure activity, but speeding it up almost certainly would not because the neurons are going to keep firing. There might be a magic frequency that seizes someone quicker, but if you continue to overload a person with epilepsy with stimulation, they’re going to seize eventually. In clinical settings it’s relatively easy to induce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Working as an EEG technologist in an epilepsy specialised centre we put all our patients trough photoelectric stimulation to check for photosensitivity. Not everyone with epilepsy is photosensitive but compared to people without epilepsy it's significantly higher, especially when they suffer certain epilepsy syndromes (like Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and Juvenile absence epilepsy). So we test our patients with a range of frequencies starting with 1Hz up to 60Hz. The range of sensitivity is different for each individual but my experience is that the most sensitive range is between 10 and 20Hz.</p>
<p>Also a difference in sensitivity is seen between different situation. If someone appears photosensitive we perform the photoelectric stimulation again the next morning (our EEG registrations usually last 24hours) since people are usually more photosensitive in the morning (like bathroom seizures). We also test them in 3 different situations; eye closure, closed eyes and  open eyes. With eye closure we ask the patient to close his/her eyes at the same time we start photo stimulation. This is often the most sensitive situation since the brain as already in a transition.</p>
<p>A super useful and amazing thing to mention is that when a photosensitive patient covers one of his/her eyes with their hand we hardly see any epileptic activity in the EEG, also patients mention a lot less stress/bad feeling compared to the series without blocking one eye. How this works exactly I don't know yet, but signals that reach your eye get transferred to the occipital lobe of your brain (it's in the back). They transfer the medial part contralateral (crossed) and the temporal part ipsilateral (straight), maybe blocking half of the signals is enough to inhibit the epileptic activity and prevent a seizures trough photosensitivity. So if you suffer from such seizures try blocking one eye, this way you are not completely blind and are able to get to a safe place or last till the flashing is over (like when driving past a row of trees with the sun in between.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of seeing some segment about tunnel building in Norway, and how there was one old tunnel where there was an unproportionate amount of accidents for no good reason.</p>
<p>Turns out that the lights in the ceiling were spaced at such a distance that if you were driving at the speed limit they synced up with some natural frequency that made people sleepy, which caused them to fall asleep at the wheel.</p>
<p>To combat this they started spacing the lights differently and also added artificial curvature to the road inside the tunnel so it wouldn't become as monotonous and forced you to stay alert.</p>
<p>Edit: I can't find any source on this now, but I'm certain that I saw it some time. Take it with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>
