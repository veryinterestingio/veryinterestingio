			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning is that a modern teardrop sub is faster underwater than surfaced because that design is so efficent underwater. Think the shape of a Dolphin or a Tuna. Two very fast species in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Old subs were more like boats... they stayed on the surface much of the time, so the bow was more like a typical boat shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also evident with WW2 submarines which remained surfaced unless they went for an attack - they have pointy bows too.  </p>
<p>Although you could argue that they didn't knew better and built the submarine like they used to build boats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was more the fact that they could not stay submerged for long since the engines needed fresh air intake to work, so once submerged you were running on batteries with a very limited timer. Going long distances under water was not feasible, that was only for escapes and attack runs. So it made sense to go for a pointy bow, as the vessel would be going at sea level the vast majority of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they did actually &quot;know better&quot;. WW2 subs were specificially designed to stay on the surface most of  the time, and just dive to carry out an attack, or escape from one. In fact German sub captains used the &quot;UZO&quot; which was like a binoculars fitted onto the conning tower to conduct most attacks, not the periscope.</p></div>		</li>
