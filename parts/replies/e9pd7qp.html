			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it makes more than just the helium atom, i.e. the EM radiation and neutrinos, and it doesn't all happen in just one step.  See the wiki page for illustration of the chain reaction:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I worded it wrongly by lose its charge I mean it gets converted. I only meant to ask if hydrogen fusion is possible with only 2H since I was taught it uses 4H</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand upon Lorus' explanation, the sheer magnitude of the energy released comes from the mass conversion relation. Since E=mc^2 and c^2 is utterly huge (9x10^16 m^2 / s^2 ), converting a tiny amount of mass in the explosion yields huge amounts of energy relative to typical human scales of energy. The Little Boy dropped in WW2 converted less than a gram. The largest bomb ever tested (Tsar Bomba) converted only about 5 lb (2.33kg, IIRC). Less than 1% of the available material, in both cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is where the energy in atomic bombs comes from. Nukes either use just fission or both fission and fusion reactions (that's what thermonuclear weapons).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome explanation.  The tipping point between fusion and fission occurs at iron.  Atoms with less mass than iron release energy when fused together.  If we attempted to fuse atoms with more mass than iron, we would need to supply energy.  This occurs with Supernovae and Brookhaven National Lab with their Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.</p>
<p>Atoms more massive than iron can be split into smaller parts and release energy.  If we were determined to, we could split atoms with less mass than iron, but would need to supply energy.  I cannot think of an tangible example analogous to Supernovae and Particle Accelerators.  </p>
<p>William Mook on <a href="https://www.quora.com/Could-you-split-a-helium-atom-into-two-hydrogen-atoms" target="_blank">Quora</a> provides an example of splitting helium into deuterium (a hydrogen isotope).  The helium atom would need to absorb a 12 MeV gamma ray for this to happen.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray_spallation" target="_blank">Cosmic Rays</a> are able to.  These high energy particles emitted by the Sun can bombard atoms with enough energy to split them apart.</p></div>		</li>
