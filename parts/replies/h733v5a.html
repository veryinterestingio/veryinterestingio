			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds similar to what I'm after. I was picturing the globe and trying to decide whether there is a numerical way to quantify a 'best place and worst place for us to inhabit'. I was actually about to submit it as an economics question rather than Earth Science.</p>
<p>The ERS (Economic Research Service) says that their natural amenities scale is based on the premise that people are drawn to areas with varied topography; lakes, ponds, or oceanfront; warm, sunny winters; and temperate, low-humidity summers.</p>
<p>Their measure include:</p>
<ul>
<li>warm winter, </li>
<li>winter sun, </li>
<li>temperate summer, </li>
<li>low summer humidity, </li>
<li>topographic variation, </li>
<li>and water area.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be nice if I understood how this had been validated or whether they're just guesses at what people prefer. Flat topology makes sense. I can't see anything related to geological activity and extreme weather. I thought that the index might at least favor places without earthquakes and hurricanes/cyclones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it's not flat topography, the varied topography, i.e. mountains. </p>
<p>This link gives a summery of the preferences <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/natural-amenities-scale/documentation/" target="_blank">https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/natural-amenities-scale/documentation/</a></p>
<p>And there is a link there to the complete study. I would imagine it explains the methodology and selection process. </p>
<p>I think you might have a bit of a bias against natural disaster, as silly as that sounds to say. California is the most populous state in the US and LA had a massive earth quake in the late 80s or early 90s. Florida is routinely hammered by hurricanes and is very populous as well. Volcanic areas, I think, tend to have rich and productive soil. I don't know that people pattern their movements and habitation around these natural disasters as much as you might think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm glad you brought this up. I was going to mention the volcanic soil thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't currently but doesn't it seem reasonable to think that we should avoid those areas, all other things being equal? </p>
<p>I guess that gets into whether the metric should score for current desirability or ease of success in getting living infrastructure set up given an untouched environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's tough because a lot of your comfort and enjoyment of a landscape will be affected by what you're used to and personal taste. There was a cold snap in Thailand a few years ago where the local public reacted with horror at temperatures that most westerners would consider &quot;kinda brisk&quot;. And what's locally considered a reasonably comfortable day in Bangkok is probably oppressively hot to those westerners. It's not totally subjective - &quot;comfortable room temperature&quot; is roughly 65-72F the world over - but all people aren't going to agree on which deviations from this are more forgivable. Things like weather are subjective too, nobody likes getting plans cancelled by rain, but some might consider regular rainfall a decent tradeoff to avoid arid environments, wildfire risk, and constant bright sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm familiar with the concept of thermal comfort, and related thermal comfort indices; there is a psychological component to it, affected by the distribution of radiative heat across the body, airflow, the clothing people wear, and even their metabolic rate, which is a far cry from relying on just temperature and relative humidity measurements. I've not yet seen anything on how the mean thermal comfort scores vary around the world or even vary between different ethnic groups.</p></div>		</li>
