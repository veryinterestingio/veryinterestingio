			<div class="markdown"><p>In case anyone is wondering, the orbit isn't &quot;crowded&quot; in the sense of satellites being physically close to each other and in danger of collisions. The orbit is 22,236 miles up, so the circumference is over 100,000 miles. That's a lot of space. The problem is that most of these geostationary satellites are communications satellites, and we only have a limited range of radio wave frequencies allocated for space communications. So all those satellites transmit at the same frequencies, and the only way to pick up the signal from a specific satellite is to aim a directional antenna at it (the big satellite dishes you see at TV stations). So satellites transmitting in the same frequencies must be placed far enough apart for a typical satellite dish to pick up separately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure they were mistaken.</p>
<p>The result is 140,000 even if you &quot;forget&quot; Earth's radius. So they clearly went with &quot;over 100,000 miles&quot; as being good enough for the purpose, which they might as well have truncated from 160 or 140 (or even deliberately ignored Earth's diameter because they figured it wouldn't change the end result after truncating)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, that's just for one-way communications, like satellite TV. If you need two-way communication, like most Internet applications do, you're looking at double that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two ways with respect to the satellite, yes, but I meant to refer to communications between two parties on the ground. One-way communication between two points on Earth requires a signal to travel that distance twice (A-&gt;GEO-&gt;B), but two-way communication between two points on Earth requires a signal to travel that distance four times (A-&gt;GEO-&gt;B-&gt;GEO-&gt;A).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is why very little 2-way communication happens through geo sats.  The time delay is long enough to be annoying/distracting.  Some of the remote war reporting in the Gulf Wars was done with a remote reported being interviewed by a studio reporter...the delays made it almost unwatchable.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How stable is this? I've heard earth rotation may vary a bit due to heavy earthquakes or large floods. Is this large enough to have any impact on such spacecrafts?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/electric_ionland" target="_blank">electric_ionland</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>The variations in Earth rotation are negligible. The main instabilities are due to the Moon and Sun gravity as well as things like photon solar pressure and the fact that the Earth gravity is a bit lumpy. Spacecraft in geostationary orbit will have to turn their thrusters on every few weeks to make sure they don't drift out of their designated &quot;parking box&quot;.</p>
<p>This is actually one of the limitation on their lifetime. When they start to run out of propellant they have to lift up to a &quot;graveyard&quot; orbit so that they don't clutter the space in that valuable orbit. </p>
<p>This is one of the reason why there has been a lot of development in ion thrusters for more efficient propulsion systems. And also why we are starting to see mission extension spacecraft being built that will grab a spacecraft running out of fuel and take over the propulsion need.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why not down enough so that they eventually burn up on re-entry and don't clutter up <em>any</em> orbit? Plus wouldn't moving to a higher circular orbit require two burns as opposed to just one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other issue is that satellites have to use their thrusters to maintain proper alignment of their instruments and antennae. If the thrusters stop working, the satellite will lose the ability to communicate with the ground, because its dish antennas won't be pointing at the ground stations any more. Its sensors won't be pointing in the right direction either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on. They &quot;wobble&quot;, often in figure 8s, due to how the earth rotates. But the wobbling from ground perspective is typically negligible. Communicating with a satellite is more akin to a shotgun blast or a spotlight than it is to a sniper rifle or a laser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually the orbit of the satellite that does that. It's why comms sats are usually referred to being in geosynchronised orbits as opposed to geostationary, as they have the same orbit period of the earth but not the exact same speed.  The orbit might be slightly eliptical, giving the left/right component of the figure 8 as it speeds up and slows down, and a slight tilt, which is the up/down component.   It's really expensive to get an orbit absolutely perfect so if near enough is good enough..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here’s a good layman’s way of looking at it: there’s a simplified formula for gravity just about everyone uses. However, that one is made from simplifying a massive and larger one, with a whole lot of terms to deal with how “out of round” both the shape and field the gravity field is.  For determining how far you can jump or ballistic trajectory of like artillery, you can use simplified one.  However, if you want to use a ballistic missile into someone’s window from hundreds of miles away, you need the complicated version.  Back in the Cold War, the usa used a very sophisticated system of measurement between 2 satellites they launched on same vehicle (rocket) and measured to tight precision the distance between them and how it varied over specific parts of the earth.  That “equation” and it’s terms have varied minimally since the measurement took place</p></div>		</li>
