			<div class="markdown"><p>Oops. Missed the line about it being a single vessel in a limb specifically. I’m sure it happens, but with all the unfortunate folks I’ve seen bleed out, its been internal bleeding, or a neck wound. I’ve never had someone with an isolated extremity wound bleed out (knock on wood.) My jurisdiction has been extremely aggressive with teaching the public bleeding control, though, in light of recent events.</p></div>		</li>
