			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of those things affect the size and movement of the vocal cords. Men have larger vocal cords (and their adam's apple sticks out to fit them), age changes the tension of the vocal cords (and length if we are talking pre/post puberty), height general correlates to size of the vocal cords, weight can affect the thickness of the vocal cords. Race/ethnicity would really only be something based on the linguistic culture they were around rather than actual race/ethnicity. Same with country of origin. And that changes how they use their vocal tract. </p>
<p>But fun experiment!</p></div>		</li>
