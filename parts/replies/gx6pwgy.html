			<div class="markdown"><p>North-Eastern South America also has some of the oldest exposed cratons in the world, but there’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_impact_craters_on_Earth" target="_blank">very few verified impact craters</a>. There’s also very little geologic activity in the region. Do we know why there’s so few craters there in comparison?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that the key is glaciation. A rainforest collects a lot of biomass and, being ancient rock adjacent to nearby mountain ranges, there has been a lot of debris accumulating on top of it. Another example of this is North America South of the Candian border, the great plains are just as old as lands further North, they've just repeatedly been submerged creating limestone and then exposed creating other sedimentary rocks and then hardpan clay and finally top soil on top. In Chicago there's 120' of clay and mud until you get to the limestone which in turn sits on top of the ancient crust of the North American craton. </p>
<p>The Rockies were once the size of the Himalayas, over two miles higher than they are now. All the debris has to go somewhere. In the case of the plains it's spread out over thousands of miles of ancient crust. The Appalachians were also once much larger and about the size of the Alps. They much more ancient that the Rockies and again, all the debris on the gulf side of the Appalachian divide is making it's way to the Mississippi and out to the delta. </p>
<p>The youngest rock in central north America (not including sediments like limestone) is actually found around the upper great lakes region which is actually (excluding Lake Michigan which is a giant glacial moraine) a mid continental rift that failed. In the process of failing new crust was created in the middle of the North American craton about 1 billion years ago resulting in a volcanic mountain range which has also been worn down to 1000-1800' nubs sending yet more sediment over the rocks to the South. Of course all the loose sediment north of the great lakes was shoveled South to the plains by glaciation leaving exposed ancient rock in Canada and hundreds of feet of the most fertile soil on earth in the United States.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Check out the Manson crater in Iowa. There's nothing to actually see now, but there's a crater (now buried under glacial till) that is 24 miles wide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume that the lack of glaciers that can expose the bedrock has something to do with it. Wouldn't it be hard to verify the presence of craters if they're covered in dirt?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but if you can find some tell-tale evidence like stressed quartz, this squarely points at an impact crater. This was used to verify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araguainha_crater" target="_blank">Araguainha crater in Brazil</a>, the largest known impact crater in South America.</p></div>		</li>
