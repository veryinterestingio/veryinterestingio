			<div class="markdown"><p>Most homes with a “wireless repeater” or “extender” will have this issue.  You need a controller of some sort to negotiate you moving to another access point, or your device will just wait until it actually disconnects to reconnect to a better source. </p>
<p>The unifi access points have a run once controller that I’m guessing runs locally on the APs, it’s always what i recommend for home WiFi deployments. Fixes a huge number of issues for people for the price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unifi is used for control, monitoring, updates, etc.</p>
<p>If you use Unifi to setup an AP, and then disable Unifi never to be run again the AP will just keep doing what it was configured to do, forever. It'll remember it's association with the Unifi controller, but it will keep going. You just won't have any control over it again until Unifi is there again.</p></div>		</li>

High aggressive switching can help but in a large building like a university or when moving around it can cause near constant switches so generally best to leave default or maybe bump up one notch</p></div>		</li>

Your explanation would make sense if there were indeed multiple access points, but most family households (and I assume OP's) have a single router/access point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or a dual band Router, the 5GHz is still connected but have less range, restarting the wifi the phone connects to the 2.4GHz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. Even if it's two bands, the 2.4 GHz range is probably a <em>stronger</em> signal at any distance even though it will have less bandwidth. Generally the router will only broadcast on one channel at a time, but if you were listening on an adjacent channel you would still see it.</p></div>		</li>
