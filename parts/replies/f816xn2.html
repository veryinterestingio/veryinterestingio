The professional riders you see in the head to toe body suits are rocking custom fitted roo leather that runs several thousand dollars a pop. I myself have a pair of kangaroo motorcycle gloves and they're pretty sweet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well the falcon doesnt have as much piercing power as it does tearing power, so the danger isnt in it getting its claws to you, its in those talons being pulled around across your arm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do more with the direction of force applied. The bird will not try to destroy your arm, if it's coming to land on it. And more often than not a falcons toes and talons will be long enough to wrap around the arm, instead of stopping somewhere in the middle of it.  The tearing or scratching is a different story. If the bird loses balance, or doesn't completely release,or lands at a weird angle, all of those things can cause a scratching or tearing force.  Thus, tearing is a much more dangerous situation when handling a large bird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kangaroo is the toughest of leathers in both tear and puncture resistance. The anti tearing aspect is  needed not for gloves so much but for anklets (the cuffs that go on the bird's legs) and leashes (though these days we usually use synthetic materials for leashes, because leather gets stiff over time). Birds sometimes try to fly while leashed and you don't want anything tearing when that happens.
For the most part trained raptors just stand on your glove. You're a perch and aren't gripped super hard. Leather is useful here because skin on your hand is flexible/loose and slips around. Leather has stability.  Sometimes if you feed your bird when they are on your glove, they will grip somewhat hard but not like you're a struggling prey trying to get away. And once in a rare while things get crazy and your hawk does grab the glove like it wants to kill it, but that's really rare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hadn't really thought of it, but having a hawk rest on your hand seems scarier one you phrased it like that. I'd imagine that they would have enough strength to really mess up your hand.</p></div>		</li>
