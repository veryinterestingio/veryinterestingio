			<div class="markdown"><p>Long story short... the atoms in the metal have a charge but are oriented randomly such that the charges of each individual atom mostly cancel out... the bandsaw is moving in one direction through the material and it forces the atoms nearby to be reoriented in that direction. Now all of the charges of all of the atoms near where the bandsaw passed are aligned and... that is magnetism.</p></div>		</li>
