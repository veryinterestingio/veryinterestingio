			<div class="markdown"><p>Latency doesn't affect videos that much, as that is a continuous stream of data. Though satellite connections usually are fairly heavily data limited, more often the cause of buffering. </p>
<p>Games and responsiveness while surfing the web will be effected by latency though. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I helped beta test the Hughes satellite internet system many (Gods, 20 years?) ago.  Downloads and videos rocked!  Pretty neat for being in the middle of nowhere.  Uploads were limited to IIRC 768k, so not really a great option for pushing data.  The latency was the killer for any sort of interactive session though. We tried remote telework using a VNC type connection, and it was like watching a slide show. Move the mouse, wait for the screen to catch up, correct slightly when you miss the icon, lather-rinse-repeat.</p></div>		</li>
