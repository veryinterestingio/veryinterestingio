			<div class="markdown"><p>When we were getting granite countertops in my parents home, we went into the shop where the manufactured them to order ours. The size of the boulders they were cutting them from were insane, they said each boulder lasts them about a year and when they get a new one shipped in, there are numerous oversize load requirements and permits and it's a huge ordeal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It makes sense I'd say. I doubt it's expensive in and of itself.  </p>
<p>Same with wood if you don't buy the processed stuff. My parents bought a wood table made from one tree directly; sculpted. It was a lot more expensive than some composite shoved together.</p></div>		</li>
