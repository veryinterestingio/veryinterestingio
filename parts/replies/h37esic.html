			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, reentry heating is mostly from the <em>compression</em> of the air in front of the object and not from friction. Re-entering objects move crazy fast (thousands of <del>kilo</del>meters a second) and the air in front of them can't get out of the way fast enough so it gets compressed. This compression causes the insane heat because it's transferring all of the kinetic energy into thermal energy until it reaches terminal velocity. The friction plays a very minor role, and it still exists, but is virtually non existent compared to the compression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small correction: Since you mention re-entering objects, I assume you mean satellite debris or (un)manned spaceships. Their orbital velocity is more like 8 km/s rather than thousands of km/s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, compression causes insane heat because of the friction is between compressed air molecules that can’t get out of the way.  As molecules bump into each other they heat up.  The coefficient of friction on these molecules is ordinarily extremely low but as they’re compressed they get really high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something similar underwater, right?  The pressure in front of the moving object restricts it's speed?</p>
<p>I remember something about stirring up the water in front of a torpedo, for example, allowing it to reduce that compression and move more quickly within the bubbling pocket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Injecting air in front of the torpedo decreases the density of the water which allows the torpedo to launch at a much faster velocity, and reduces the shock of the launch to the submarine firing the torpedo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It also can't fall fast enough upon it popping to create enough air friction to burn up, it just doesn't have the mass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no object that can fall fast enough from high altitudes to burn up, unless it starts with a very high speed in the first place. The only reason spacecraft and meteors burn up is that they're traveling at tens of thousands of kilometers per hour before they enter the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>
