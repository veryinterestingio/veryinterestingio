			<div class="markdown"><p>The press conference is live right now and a reporter asked about long term expectations.  Dr. Slaoui responded that, in his opinion, this long term immunity is a reasonable expectation if there is a strong CD4/Immo response at an early stage of infection. Early and vigorous response corresponds with long term protection.  A dual dose approach stands the best chance of triggering the a strong response by teaching the immune system to respond. After, immune memory is more effective.</p>
<p>Follow on vaccine candidates, such as single dose, are meant to give health authorities multiple options and are targeted towards different risk populations.  So if you are younger and have a stronger immune system and no co-morbidities, the single dose designs might be sufficient.</p></div>		</li>
