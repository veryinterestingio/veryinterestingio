			<div class="markdown"><p>Lifestyle and nutrition have major impact on the likelihood of preterm labor or fetal distress.  One of the odd effects of lockdown last spring was a reduction in numbers of preterm deliveries. I don't think the causes are known, but less stress on the mother's body from traveling throughout the day, standing at work may have increased gestational age at delivery.</p></div>		</li>
