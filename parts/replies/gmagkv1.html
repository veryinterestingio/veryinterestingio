			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm aware I didn't quite emphasise the right part.  My point is that we're only listening in stereo anyway!  We have 2 ears.  All headphones need to do is have the left headphone simulate the waves in the left ear and the right headphone simulate the sound in the right ear.  It doesn't matter <em>where</em> the sound is made.  It only matters <em>what</em> it's like in the ear.  So hearing front vs back over headphones is similar to hearing it in real life.</p>
<p>Motion is the main difference, but if you're looking at a screen then that's hopefully not such an issue.  Or, if you have a VR headset, you can track the motion of the head and simulate that for the sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard some recordings I believe they did with something like a dummy with microphones in the ears and I believe that's where more modern algorithms for the 8d were developed. As in the past surround sound was not as good but since doing a lot of recordings with these special mic'd dummies they redeveloped the algorithms. </p>
<p>Specifically I remember hearing a recording of getting a haircut which was recorded this way where you can really sense the clippers and buzzer going around your head when just wearing headphones.</p>
<p>So from my understanding yes it is just computers doing the audio math <em>now</em>, but it's based on creating a microphone that mimics our hearing by basically using as realistic of a dummy as possible (with ear flaps and nasal cavities etc.) as the microphone. Or am I way off?</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, it's to do with what's called the Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF).  You put microphones inside the ears (either of a mannequin like KEMAR or of a specific person), and then record a bunch of clicks from different locations around the head inside an anechoic chamber.</p>
<p>A recording of a click is called an impulse response.  You can use a recording of a short click to simulate being in a room by doing what's called a convolution.  Essentially mixing the sound file with the recording of the click.</p>
<p>To make sounds feel like you're actually there, you use the HRTF.  Say you want something to sound like it's coming from 30째 left, 10째 up.  You convolve it with the recordings from both ears when the click was at 30째L, 10째U.  For spots in between where clicks were, you can sort of mix things together.  This works well for a lot of folk using a generic set of ears (like KEMAR's), but it's insanely good if it's done with recordings of your own ears!</p></div>		</li>
