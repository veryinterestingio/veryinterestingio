			<div class="markdown"><p>No, we got that version of homo from Ancient Greek (Anglicized version of ὁμός).</p>
<p>English is the kind of language that ambushes other languages in dark alleys, then rifles through their pockets looking for loose vocabulary.  And to make matters worse, sometimes those languages are family and we steal the same word from more than one of them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That sounds remarkably like something Terry Pratchett would write.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe it's the rural upbringing speaking but mule and/or hinny was the first thing I thought of. Liger seems kinda, exotic. </p>
<p>But yeah, it's nothing new, mules and hinnies are crosses between donkies and horses. They've been a thing for, at least 2000 years.</p>
<p>But in relation to the homo spian/neaderthalensis, something curious, mules are generally considered better than horses and donkeys in a lot of aspects. Maybe that 1% Neadertal in all of us is a good thing?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, but mules and hinnies are sterile and cannot produce offspring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true. Female mules and hinnies are rarely able to reproduce, but it can happen. And as has been pointed out elsewhere in this thread, traces of neaderthal DNA in modern humans is on the X chromosome, and not the Y, suggesting that children of homo sapiens and neaderthals were either all female, or only the females were fertile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All wolf like dogs can interbreed, and although the domesticated dog and wolves are the same species, that group includes like more than 6 species across 3 genera.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wolf-like canids are a group of large carnivores that are genetically closely related because their chromosomes number 78. The group includes genus Canis, Cuon and Lycaon. The members are the dog (C. lupus familiaris), gray wolf (C. lupus), coyote (C. latrans), golden jackal (C. aureus), Ethiopian wolf (C. simensis), black-backed jackal (C. mesomelas), side-striped jackal (C. adustus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus).[2] Newly proposed members include the red wolf (Canis rufus), eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), and African golden wolf (C. anthus). As they possess 78 chromosomes, all members of the genus Canis (coyotes, wolves, jackals) are karyologically indistinguishable from each other, and from the dhole and the African hunting dog.[3][4]:p279 The members of Canis can potentially interbreed.[5]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>if you are a bit more expansive and think about how all the canids interbreed, then yes.  Closely related species can interbreed and backcross resulting in horizontal gene transfer.</p></div>		</li>
