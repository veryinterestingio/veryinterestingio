			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m going to disagree with this, they’re looking for something that describes heat transport, not a thermodynamic description of heat. Like I said, and like what others have said, they’re looking for the general heat equation. </p>
<p>What you gave was just a rearrangement of the definition of specific heat capacity under the assumption that heat capacity is constant. (Which in most cases it isn’t.) </p>
<p>I’m not sure what your line of reasoning for using the definition of heat capacities is, because it’s not really helpful to his question. Would you mind clearing that up for me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct. My intent wasn't to disagree with the other answers, which focus on the time-dependent answer requested. I was providing supplemental information on a closely related parameter (final states) which can be calculated quickly and with very little data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m just confused because this is relating specifically to a heat transport proble, (Newton’s law of cooling, dQ/dt) so I don’t think introducing thermo would be as relevant. Also, he specifically asked for the temperature profile as it depends on time. </p>
<p>Anyways, have a nice day!</p></div>		</li>
