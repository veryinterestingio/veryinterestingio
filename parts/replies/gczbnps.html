			<div class="markdown"><p>The covid trials excluded anyone with covid symptoms or covid diagnosis, and people were tested for covid and covid antibodies. But at least at least in the Pfizer trial, people were given the vaccine before waiting for those results. </p>
<p>Pfizer certainly has safety data to show that their vaccine does not cause adverse effects even in patients with preexisting Covid antibodies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. So, the idea is more of, every participants receives treatment or placebo, and then when they get tests results back showing they already had it, those participants’ data points are no longer reported for statistics. The only statistic they’d be moved to is safety in people who have had it, since that’s the only thing that data can show. Good question, btw</p></div>		</li>
