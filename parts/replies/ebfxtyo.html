			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true.  There are also multiple systems affected by stress that share the same nerve bundles, so when you're sad or hurt emotionally you'll feel what is known as referred pain in the region of your chest.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When my uncle passed away my grandma was so distraught and in pain that she ended up in the hospital a few weeks later. They told us that it was a result of her pain but my family for some reason told her she had a minor heart attack. Thankfully she is with us but her experience makes me believe it is possible to die from a broken heart.</p>
<p>EDIT: It is called “broken heart syndrome” and yes it is possible to die from it as it can lead to a heart attack.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. It's why it's so widely abused.</p>
<p>It's a great escape. It costs more as your tolerance builds (rapidly) - often to the point where it becomes financially unviable. This is why you'll see addicts rob their own family to support their habit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Not to mention the brain changes where addiction becomes a compulsion where the user has all but lost the ability to choose. It's a horrible illness and I'm glad more of the public and professionals are coming round to that fact instead o just abandoning addicts as write offs.. clearly they are sad, overly emotional people that find it difficilt to cope being themselves.. i know a lot of recovered addicts, and in order to maintain their sobriety, not only are they the nicest, most understanding people (having gone to and been through to the other side of hell in the process) but they have to stay busy to stay well.. so a lot of them give back or becoming overtly productive members of society.</p></div>		</li>
