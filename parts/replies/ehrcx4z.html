			<div class="markdown"><p>My dermatologist told me that “any change in skin color is a bad change in skin color.”  I practically glow in the dark I’m so pale, and had been trying to argue in favor of getting a “base tan” in preparation for a beach trip when he dropped that knowledge on me.  And tbh it would have been more of a base burn than a base tan, but a girl can dream.</p></div>		</li>
