			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the celebrity and how much money is involved. As a non-speaking character in the role, the cost of the lawyers would easily exceed any money he might get so he just accepts their position.</p>
<p>As for auditing, good luck. An example in one article was to imagine George Lucas going to NYC to appear on a talk show and during that talk show, he mentions how they are working on plans to show Return of the Jedi in 3D. Voila - the trip just became a &quot;marketing expense&quot; for Return of the Jedi and would include the airfare, cabs/taxi charges, all food, any clothing bought for the trip, hair styling, and any other cost they could think of attaching to the bottom line. If multiple movies are mentioned, the cost would be split between multiple movies.</p>
<p>Does it seem like he got ripped off? Pretty much. Is it legal? Technically, yes. It really comes down to knowing that you want to have your contract state you get a cut of the GROSS profit versus getting a cut of the NET profit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And someone like Prowse, who never spoke or actually appeared on screen would never be able to get gross points. If he'd tried to negotiate for them, they'd have found some other tall guy to wear the suit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also important to note that Prowse and Star Wars do not have a good relationship at all. So while he probably would be getting ripped off anyway, the idea that his relationship with them is sour likely doesn’t help either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's likely getting ripped off.  There's a mountain of creative accounting that happens.  Studios can pretty much post whatever numbers they want.  Experienced people (agents, for instance) know to get a percent off the top - no net.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually they achieve no net profit by creating a new company specially to distribute a specific film.  So the owners of company A create a new company B.  Company B handles the distribution of the film and sends company A an inflated bill.  Company A is perfectly fine with paying this inflated bill because the owners of company B are the same as the owners of company A.  Now company A made no profit on the film because they paid company B so much for distribution.  Unfortunately, the actor contracted with company A, not company B, for their net profits which there are technically none.  I hope this makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He got ripped off because he agreed to have his portion paid out of profits. Most others are paid out of gross receipts. Almost no hollywood film actually makes a profit... by design...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is the explanation. Studios deliberately inflate costs and structure the corporation in such a way that they are charging themselves for a service, and putting such a high mark up on it to ensure the movie is never profitable.</p>
<p>This was done purely to screw over actors et al who had contracts based in % of profits</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's another part of it too. I went into that in another reply. There's also the fact that the media reports box office receipts of which some naturally has to go to the movie theaters too. They're not showing those movies for free ya know... :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would consider all of that was part of the costs of the movie though?</p>
<p>You don't claim you run a fishing business and only pay for bait, you also factor in insurance, fuel, licencing etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not much. Theaters make their money on concessions, by my understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way they do that is the distribution side of things. The distribution house charges massive, absurdly huge fees to get the movie shipped.... but the distribution house is part of the same corporate structure as the production. So in reality the money just goes from one column to another in the same ledger, but the production is now technically a few hundred million in the red.</p>
<p>Hollywood accounting is legendary for a reason.</p></div>		</li>
