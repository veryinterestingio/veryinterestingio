			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of an ancillary question, but does the FDA approving mRNA vaccine tech mean that we're more likely to be able to develop vaccines to the more common influenza mutations that come about? My understanding is that a lot of that process is a good bit of guesswork on what mutation ends up being the most common while the vaccines for it are in development, but does the ability to make vaccines faster with the mRNA technology mean we're more likely to see more effective flu vaccines for the common mutations of it each year?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ways that mRNA vaccines can help with Influenza:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of how we make Influenza vaccines, CDC/WHO/etc have to make predictions about the most common and dangerous strains of flu well before the flu season. mRNA vaccines can (at least potentially) reduce the time between selecting the highest risk strains and shipping vaccines. That means that they can make predictions more often, and with less lead time before the flu season.</li>
<li>Some flu vaccines have &quot;failed&quot; because the method used to produce them (incubation in chicken eggs) produced an imperfect copy. Simplifying things a bit, some genetic structures replicate differently in eggs vs. the human body, so the vaccine version of the virus was slightly modified and no longer matched the wild virus.</li>
<li>Since we wouldn't need to base vaccines off of actual viral samples, we could design mRNA segments that match more than one strain, or could at least produce immune responses against multiple strains.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Went into that read being pretty skeptical, but that tactic may actually have some potential. If you create an abomination of a strain that almost no body will have seen before, the body will produce antibodies for that entire target, rather than just to kill what it’s already seen before (which mutates into “unseen” rather quickly). </p>
<p>Maybe with enough of those strains in one shot, the body will learn to attack the non-mutating section since that will be the common thread among all of them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what we have to look forward to with COVID. It's endemic worldwide now. We learn better ways of treating it, cycle through vaccines with varying levels of effectiveness, and just kind of live with it as background noise. Exactly like the flu today. Thinking it will ever be completely gone at this point is a pipe dream.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not as insane as you expect. Go check out SARS. COVID-19 is a SARS variant (same binding site, etc). SARS never became endemic, because even while it was quite transmissible (though not as much as COVID/SARS-CoV-2), it notably did not mutate quickly enough to avoid human immune systems. </p>
<p>Right now, COVID is mutating relatively slowly, and the mutations we see are minor and infrequent. Their existence is owed mostly to the number of infections and the high viral load. We can make vaccines to fight/prevent it faster than it mutates, even in a pandemic situation. Outside of a pandemic, the mutation rate will be far, far lower and partial immunity from existing strains/vaccines will dampen the virus's spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, I 100% agree that we may eliminate SARS-Cov-2 due to its slower mutation rate. But I don't think saying our immune systems are why we beat SARS is at all accurate. We eliminated SARS because its high death rate homebound/killed some people before they could spread it; and because of the immediate, Herculean efforts of the CDC's EIS and other public health services worldwide to contain the spread. </p>
<p>If it had reached the general population and had uncontained transmission, we'd probably just have a more deadly covid outbreak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coronaviruses do not mutate very quickly. The vaccines are still effective against the variants. Evidence suggests that COVID will attenuate like the other now-human coronaviruses. Worry that we're going to be dealing with this disease evading vaccines and causing severe illness is, at this point, sheer FUD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point. The other problem is that people will get vaccine fatigue and it will be difficult to vaccinate the community at the 70% level needed for herd immunity. I don't know if the vaccination coverage for the flu is any indication of what the vaccination coverage might be for Covid over time but <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/coverage-1920estimates.htm" target="_blank">this</a> article shows what it has been for flu.</p></div>		</li>
