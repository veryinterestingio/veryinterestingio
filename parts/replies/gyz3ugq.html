			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in grade 3 when the switch was made to metric. The teachers taught us both as they tried to teach themselves. I can work in both individually, but only easy peasy conversions one way or the other.  Now in UK, I refuse to learn my weight in rocks or what differences there are in gallons lol.</p></div>		</li>
