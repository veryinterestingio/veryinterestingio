			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not see how the short answer would be &quot;yes&quot; from what you have cited. </p>
<p>I only saw the phrase &quot;my life flashed before my eyes&quot; in English works and translations of English works, and not in the other languages I read... so I am a bit skeptical that this is a widespread, let alone universal experience.</p>
<p>Can anyone with knowledge of foreign languages confirm, or provide counter-examples?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finnish speaker here. We have a phrases (often not exactly similar way said tho as in my example but the idea is always still the same) : &quot;Elämä valui kuvanauhana silmieni ohi&quot; &quot;life went as a film front of my eyes&quot;</p>
<p>I have diabetes and I've few times fell uncincisous because of miss calculated amount of insulin. (over dose basically)</p>
<p>I've not seen anything like that, even tho waking up from it had been awful experience every time. Not sure how close of death I've been tho. Might be that I wasn't do close of death, because my body was able to revive itself? </p>
<p>I think diabetic people might be good control group for finding nde experiences, because your brain will stop working properly if you don't have sugar in your system.</p>
<p>So compare their experiences to the experiences of other people. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And I can confirm, this expression exist in other languages as well, independently from English (at least in French and Italian)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s probably an expression left over from Latin.  If Chinese or Japanese have the same expression then maybe this isn’t just a phrase left over from earlier dialects and is instead a more broadly shared experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something similar happened to me when I was put in a sleeper hold in highschool. Except, I didn't feel any of the anger or memories.</p>
<p>I just remember an arm going around my neck, thinking it was just a joke, and then the next moment I was waking up on the ground completely confused and it took a few seconds for me to put reality back together.</p>
<p>Kind of like anaesthesia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I'm going to pretend to be an expert, but do you think the difference is was that going in you never felt it was a NDE? </p>
<p>Also if you suddenly get knocked out you wouldn't remember anything that was sitting in short-term memory. I was knocked out in a biking accident this past year and have done a lot of reading on it because it was such a strange experience. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think that applies to the lack of &quot;life flashing before one's eyes&quot;, which seems to be characteristic of situations in which one <em>believes</em> he is about to die. </p>
<p>The other common things with NDEs, such as being in a tunnel or seeing a bright light have been suggested to be physiological responses that result from lack of oxygen to the brain. Possibly, because OP's sparring partner released immediately when OP blacked out, there was just enough lack of oxygen/blood flow to the brain to cause him to pass out, but not enough to cause the other responses. In other words, maybe not actually an NDE?</p></div>		</li>
