			<div class="markdown"><p>The landing was all performed autonomously anyway, so the communications delay was not of any great practical significance.</p>
<p>It's more accurate to say they timed the launch for the least energy required for the transit to Mars.</p>
<p>Editing to add a source, including for the choice of saying &quot;energy&quot;: <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/cruise/" target="_blank">https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/cruise/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mission is timed for launch when Earth and Mars are in good positions relative to each other for landing on Mars. [...] As Earth and Mars orbit the Sun at different speeds and distances, once about every 26 months, they are aligned in a way that allows the most energy-efficient trip to Mars.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched the video posted by u/mikelywhiplash and it's quite interesting how Perseverance chases after Mars.</p>
<p>I would think it would take less energy to have Earth 'pass' Mars and then launch it along a similar trajectory but at a slower velocity so that Mars actually catches up to Perseverance.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Slower orbital velocity = smaller orbit. You have to go faster to get farther from the Sun. Learned something new today. Thanks everyone!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming that by &quot;energy&quot;, you mean fuel and/or Delta-V?</p>
<p>I'm also guessing that the DV requirement to actually insert into Mars orbit then land would be higher (deceleration, etc.), however how much of DV savings is that? I was only able to find what seems like an Orbit DV (3.9 km/s) and not a DV comparison for an orbit vs direct entry trajectory.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It was in fact of GREAT practical significance, but the change in delay from being closer or further didn't add any problems that weren't already there. Even the shortest delay it's too long to do anything but have an autonomous landing!</p>
<p>I'm begging pedantic, yes, but I'm paid for it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you point out, the distance traveled is 480 M km along a path from the Earth's orbit to Mars' orbit as both traversed along the in their orbits around the sun. 39,600 km/hr is really just escape velocity from Earth orbit, give or take 1000 km/hour. However the Earth's orbital speed around the sun is 108,000 km/hr. Mars orbital speed is only 86,000 km/hr. So, you've got to get going fast enought to escape Earth,  but you're already traveling at 108,000 km hour around the sun. Part of what you have to do is actually slow down, which you will do if you attempt to speed up relative to earth's orbit --ie orbital mechanics says if you increase your velocity along your orbit vector, you will enter a higher orbit moving at a slower orbital velocity. The bottom line was Perseverance traveled 480 M km by escaping Earth, starting at 108K km/hr, then working to slow its sun orbital velocity. I believe it still arrived at Mars traveling 17,000 km.hour faster than Mars 86K km/sec. Over the 480 M km, it averaged somewhere between 108K and 103K km/hr.     </p>
<p>--- Check the math ---
7 months <em> 30 days </em> 24 hours = 5040 hours<br />
480M km/5040 = ~95K km/hr.  So maybe Perseverance wasn't going 17K km/hr when it arrived. I'll have to double check that number. Average between 108k km/hr (earth) and 86K km/hr (mars) is 97K km/hour, pretty damn close to 95 km/hr</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to include the effect of planet gravities at both starting and end points. </p>
<p>When it was getting close to Mars it was traveling around the Sun about 3km/s slower than Mars. But as Mars caught it from behind it pulled it accelerating to some 5.6km/s or so.</p>
<p>When it left Earth's influence it was moving about 3km/s faster than the Earth. As it climbed out against Sun's gravity it lost about 6km/s to be eventually caught by Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>within a given context, particularly public communications like this, why don't they use the same frame of reference for both the speed and the distance traveled? I've never done the math and noticed this before but now I'll never unsee it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the speed stated is lower the way they said it. They're just showing the speed relative to us, and the total distance.  Left us to do the math on our own for actual speed.  Now the question is how did they measure the distance traveled,  just locally in our solar system,  or did they count in the fact our solar system/ galaxy is moving? Probably the first,  but it should have all been explained better in the article I think.</p></div>		</li>
