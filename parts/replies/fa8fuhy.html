<p>Most of the heat produced by rockets is radiated from the nozzle of the rocket. Rockets are incredibly powerful though so there is still a lot of heat left over which needs to be dealt with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You seem to forget that the propellant has an heatcapacity itself and usually takes most of the heat with it while exiting theough the nozzle. Something that makes heat Management in rockets actually quite easy</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there a satisfying logical explanation for why this is the case?</p>
<p>Edit: There's an explanation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law#Origination" target="_blank">here</a>, but I haven't worked through the math yet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not aware of a good intuitive explanation for why it's the fourth power specifically, but it's easy to explain why it's a function that grows quickly with increasing temperature: at higher temperatures, blackbody radiation gives you a lot more photons, and on average each photon carries more energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really liked the fictional use of this concept in Mass Effect <del>1</del> 2 to give a reason to require &quot;ammunition&quot; for energy weapons. The idea was that the guns dissipated massive amounts of heat which was dumped into ejectable heatsinks. Unfortunately the hard sci-fi decreased throughout the series until 3 was basically a space opera.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find out that the ejected brass actually serves this purpose in real weapons. Attempts to build caseless firearms resulted in excessive heat buildup in the chamber, causing unintentional firing and damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Changing phases takes far more energy than just the amount required to heat or cool the object up or down by a degree. So, if you can dump a bunch of energy into the phase change itself, and then get rid of that object, you've successfully dumped more energy into an object than just the amount required to heat it to a specific degree.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Two of the important ways to shed heat in our atmosphere (conduction and convection) don't work in space. This leaves just a single heat transfer method: radiation. All objects emit electromagnetic radiation, with the amount (and wavelength) depending on the temperature of the object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true in most cases, but when you're using a nuclear reactor for propulsion, the whole idea is to use the reactor to heat propellant, which then expands, exits through a nozzle, and provides thrust. This process removes a lot of heat from the reactor. In fact while the reactor is being used for propulsion, the heat flux via exhaust flow is probably larger than any other cooling methods working at the time. As far as heat transfer methods go, this is basically an example of convection - heat is stored into the propellant, and the propellant then leaves the spacecraft.</p>
<p>Assuming the mass flow of the propellant is about the same in atmosphere as it would be in vacuum, that would mean the nuclear rocket itself would probably work in both environments.</p>
<p>However, the lack of convection and conduction kick in once you shut down the rocket engine and can't move heat away from the reactor with propellant being thrust out of the spacecraft. At that point, you absolutely have to have radiators big enough to radiate away the heat of the reactor in power-generating mode - assuming you're using the same reactor for power in cruise and thrust during burns - and all the spacecraft's systems besides that. And you need some extra radiators to have some wiggle room in case some of the radiator systems fail, or if you need to operate in hotter conditions than anticipated.</p></div>		</li>
