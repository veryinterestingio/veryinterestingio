			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this thorough response. I was curious how all of that worked, because I feel like there are too many factors at play to really determine anything with any level of confidence. It would still be interesting to see what they say, but it's good to know that it's just a rough guestimate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Colour me skeptical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so. I hear a lot of people express their concerns with this. My question is, what could they realistically do with my DNA? All I can imagine is that they'd clone me, or try to frame me for a crime, but neither of those options sound reasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of this is true, but I will say, I have done extensive genealogy research and found that the regions of origin for my ancestors do in fact coincide with the results of my DNA tests. I had done the genealogy research first, and was fully expecting my DNA results to not be totally accurate, but I was surprised by how well they matched up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The information these companies give you are obviously not completely off. Imagine you're Swedish and it says youre 80 percent south Indian. Business wouldn't work so well, the methods they use are definitely based in science, but the percentages they give are not accurate. But they do provide error bars, and change their info often. At first they told me I'm 30 percent Turkish, with 29 to 31 percent confidence interval. Now they updates the file &quot;in light of new data&quot; and it says I'm 7 percent Turkish with a confidence interval of 0 to 10. That's what I mean, it's not accurate, but not totally wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also constantly improve their data. They generally ask people who submit their DNA what they understand their ancestry to be, and I believe they use the samples you (and thousands of other people) send to improve their database.</p>
<p>Also, to be very clear, I can't say this is true of every company, but the ones that I know don't give you &quot;historical&quot; results.</p>
<p>If it says you are 25% Italian, they mean you share 25% of those markers (approximating 25% of your total DNA) with people who live in MODERN Italy. Not people who lived in Italy 500 years ago. So as OP says, if a large group of Turks moved to Italy centuries ago, and you share DNA with them, you will likely get that DNA marked as Italian unless that same DNA also shows in modern day Turks as well - though they will try to find other marks that distinguish the Italian group from the Turkish group to narrow it down. <em>EDIT: It appears they do now attempt to do &quot;historical&quot; ancestry.</em></p>
<p>But the important part of the 'marker' method is to know that even if the geography is right, they aren't testing 25% of your full DNA as Italian, but markers that suggest approximately 25% of Italian. It doesn't necessarily mean that one of your grandparents is a full blooded Italian. Firstly, some of those markers could have come from several Italian ancestors on multiple branches, but also, 25% might not be the actual number for your total genome.</p></div>		</li>

<p>they think are quite common in Britain, because the people they first looked at in Britain think of themselves as very British.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it's a little better than that. They aren't just asking people how British or German or whatever they are when building the reference library. The reference samples are supported by well-documented genealogical evidence.</p>
<p>The problem is that genealogical documents are not as reliable as you might hope. They don't cover infidelity, often hid adoption, and sometimes were made up whole cloth to legitimize claims to land, title, resources, etc..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, that's why I edited the first comment. From a scientific perspective, family trees hold a very similar value to self reporting compared to say quantitative tangible evidence. And in some regions, genealogical records are too scarce and need to be complemented by self reporting methods. I just used self reporting as an example to emphasize inaccuracy (to a 5 year old).</p></div>		</li>
