			<div class="markdown"><p>It is partly that but also the fact that camera lenses distort the face depending on their focal length, a lot of phone cameras are wider angle than the ~50mm lens you need to be close to real life.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite accurate. We perfect our appearance based on what we see in the mirror. The reason why celebs and stuff &quot;look better&quot; is because their appearance from the perspective of people looking at them rather than how they see themselves in the mirror.
It's the same reason why little kids have a struggle with their parents at a certain age. The kid starts seeing their reflection and it looks wrong to them because their parents have been styling them from a viewer perspective.
We think we look better than we do because if we looked like our reflection, that would be correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the truthful answer. Being photogenic is not necessarily the same as being attractive or vice versa. I have always been considered an attractive woman by most standards, but I have a bit of a chubby face and it isn't a photogenic shape. People love it in person, in photos it makes me look a lot heavier and it just isn't flattering. It's not &quot;if you're ugly in photos you're ugly,&quot; it's &quot;you might not have very photogenic features.&quot; Yes, the image flipping plays a bit of a part of it, but ultimately we're talking about 2 different qualities.</p></div>		</li>
