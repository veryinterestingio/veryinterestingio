			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, it's basically impossible to spot if done well, and it can be done well really easily and cheaply nowadays. There are companies that specialise in astroturfing websites like Reddit or Twitter. </p>
<p>They create accounts and make them look like a normal person is using it for a few months and then when they get a job to say promote a movie they'll suddenly start talking about that movie. From an outside point of view, it's basically impossible to distinguish any such account from a normal one without a lot of work for at best a flimsy confirmation, with little or no payoff (there's a few markers you can look out for that makes it pretty likely an account is astroturfing).</p>
<p>And then even if you have conclusive proof that someone is astroturfing something... what's the best case scenario? You call them out and it'll get drowned in the sea of astroturf like a fart in a hurricane.</p>
<p>Though it can be pretty hilarious if you find <em>bad</em> astroturfing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What can make it more insidious is that in a given event, you'll usually have a mix of paid protesters (yes, its a job, and very common even for things like union protests), any local people they can get to go along with them for free recruited off social media, and their own people that are bussed in.  They'll also have the signs made up in advance to hand out to make sure the locals don't hijack or screw up the message.</p>
<p>They'll also have their own &quot;reporters&quot; and photographers to make sure the pictures make it look like far more people are there than in reality.</p>
<p>If any real reporters happen to show up, the genuine locals will be pushed towards them for interviews while the organizers duck out of site.</p>
<p>Without good investigating or undercover journalism, its nearly impossible to prove anything, so they easily get away with this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Grassroots movements are somewhat rare, but can be very powerful.  Occupy Wall street and the Tea Party were both grassroots movements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tea Party was completely astroturfed, it was not grassroots at all. </p>
