			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/mit-new-blackest-black-material-scn-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">here is a recent CNN story on it</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently the new version of 'blackest black' is much easier to use (apply to various surfaces) than the older Vantablack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty similar, but unlike vantablack that has straight nano-tubes pointing directly up, the material that's probably being mentioned is a kind that is more of a tangled weave. Basically the remaining path for light to reflect out of, straight out from inbetween the tubes, is largely covered up. It's more effective simply by being messier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Guy was holding a foam head that he painted with Black 3.0 and it looked like he was holding a shadow. Was really cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't specify &quot;Vantablack&quot; on your computer, you'd just specify &quot;Black&quot;. Then when you print it, the actual colour that is on the paper depends on the ink your printer can use.</p>
<p>The computer monitor <em>also</em> displays a different black, which depends on the monitor.  Different monitors have different methods of displaying black, but in the common example of a backlit LCD monitor, there's a light behind some kind of panel.  For the pixels that are black, the panel tries to block the light.  There will often be some small amount of light that bleeds through, and that determines how close your monitor can get to &quot;Black&quot;.</p>
<p>Short answer... yeah they'd probably be indistinguishable on your computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well yeah, since the blackest that a monitor can display is simply no light through the pixels, and whatever surface your screen is.</p></div>		</li>
