<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Bombard" target="_blank">dude</a> tried doing that and while his claim is contested it's still pretty plausible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very quickly multi hulled vessels were developed to overcome lateral wave action. Proas (essentially outriggers) of substantial size were common in floatillas. I’d have to check the book at my studio for specific size, estimated a good 60-100ft? With the floor space created but the “outrigger”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Canoe&quot; vastly undersells Polynesian boats. IMO, they were easily the equal of -- if not superior to -- any European ships of the same period.</p>
<p>To put it in perspective, u/TattooJerry cites Polynesian ships as being up to 60-100 feet long. In comparison, Christopher Columbus's ships were 50-60 feet long.</p></div>		</li>
