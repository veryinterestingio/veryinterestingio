			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a helicopter mechanic in the army, back before YouTube was a thing, we would get some horrible videos of helicopter and aviation mishaps.  Generally they were naval accidents, not because the navy had more accidents, but because they have CCTV recording all their decks and hanger spaces so it's more likely to be caught on film when it happens. </p>
<p>How does this relate?  Well it really sticks with you when you see a guy get the top of his head chopped off by a Seahawk main rotor during a shutdown.  As the engine spools down and the blades slow they loose lift and start to sag.  He was passing in front of the helicopter when it dipped low enough to hit him.  Ugh.</p></div>		</li>
