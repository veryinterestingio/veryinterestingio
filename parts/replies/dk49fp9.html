			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a couple retired racing greyhounds and have a couple fun facts for you. They are universal blood donors, and with few exceptions, blood from any greyhound can be given to any other breed of dog. They are also lean with big neck veins, thin skin, and very insensitive to pain. This combination is simply perfect for blood donation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Greyhounds also have a higher PCV (packed cell volume) than other dogs. This means that their blood has more red blood cells by volume than blood from the average dog, making it great for transfusions. </p></div>		</li>

Or can they donate plasma like we can donate plasma?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for encouraging dog blood donation. It saved my dogs life a few months ago. She had surgery and it turns out she has Von Willebrand disease, she had massive hemorrhaging. A greyhounds blood took her from no hope to making it through to the morning when we could get other dogs to come in and donate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ex-wife is a vet.</p>
<p>She noted that her clinic gives greatly reduced vet service to 4 greyhounds in exchange for them being on an emergency donor program.</p>
<p>IE: They're 6 month check ups cost around 25% of normal to cover the hard costs associated with bloodwork etc.</p>
<p>Might be something to look into if you're looking to save some cash, and your dog has a &quot;DGAF&quot; temperament. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. While apes have the same blood types as us, the antigens are slightly different. So, you can't really use ape A type blood for an A type human. But, things are more complex than that: <a href="https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/01/25/ape-human-pig-human-blood-donations-xenotransfusions-work/" target="_blank">https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/01/25/ape-human-pig-human-blood-donations-xenotransfusions-work/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually true, but not always. Best practice is to cross match all transfusions in dogs and cats, regardless of first time or not. I have patient react to first time transfusions - sometimes fatally so. A cross match limits that risk. </p>
<p>Dogs have many types - DEA 1.1 Negative is considered &quot;universal donor&quot; but cross matching will still pick up incompatibilities between donor and recipient.
Cats - Most are type A, less commonly type B or AB. The wrong blood can be fatal, even on first transfusions. </p>
<p>Ironically cats can almost always receive one transfusion of dog blood with little statistical risk. This is called a &quot;xenotransfusion&quot;. I've had about a dozen cat patients go through this in the past two years alone. All did great for the transfusion. </p>
<p>Source: Veterinarian. Internal Medicine Senior Resident. Do about 2-3 transfusions a week on average. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I used to work at a vet clinic that also had a rescue. We had a few long term dogs we used a couple of times for blood transfusions for patient's dogs.</p></div>		</li>
