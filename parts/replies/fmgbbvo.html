			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add to this excellent answer by saying that there is one Australian study that suggests one species of bacteria is becoming more tolerant to alcohol-based hand rubs but none of the species they tested were able to withstand 70% ethanol sterilization. The study suggests that there could be ways for bacteria to become progressively more tolerant to alcohols, though these mechanisms remain poorly understood.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best analogy I've heard is that bacteria developing a resistance to alcohol is like a human developing a resistance to fire. You can train yourself to withstand more heat that most people, but you're still going to die if I set you on fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a very interesting way of putting it, you have inspired me to set myself on fire several times for as long as possible to find out how much heat I can take!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem being that many (domestic) usages of alcohol based disinfectants are improper, i.e. too short, concentration too low. That's like only one or two seconds on fire, and might be survived by a number of germs, especially the ones that are more resistant already, thus driving evolution to develop further resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't these things already &quot;developed&quot; though? So it just favours e.g. spore-forming bacteria, non-enveloped viruses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there are some spores and other states bacteria can go into and they will be resistant to alcohol. However once these spores develop into active bacteria those bacteria are no longer able to survive alcohol. The bacteria C. diff is notorious for this. </p>
<p>As far as i’m aware nothing can survive bleach. Some bacteria may tolerate a little bleach for a short period of time but it will destroy them eventually.</p>
<p>Also soap and water will wash anything away, so no matter how resistant the bacteria is if you wash your hands it will be gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work around a nasty spore former. We use 70% isopropyl, a peracetic acid solution, and acidified bleach.  The isopropyl is for other organisms and doesn't do much harm to our spores.  The peracetic and acidified bleach need long contact times to be effective.</p>
<p>they are easier to kill once they leave the spore form, but they do that when they are in a good medium for growth, like say, your body!  </p>
<p>For most everything, isopropyl, ethanol and bleach are very very effective. For spore forming bacteria, those disinfectants aren't enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have, but that's like expecting an elephant to evolve wings and turn into a bird.</p>
<p>It's possible, but a lot harder than antibiotic resistance.</p></div>		</li>
