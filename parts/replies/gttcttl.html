<p><em>Because the Concorde moves faster than sound, the air pressure and friction (collision with air molecules) really heat up the plane. The temperature of the aircraftâ€™s skin varies from 261 degrees Fahrenheit (127 degrees Celsius) at the nose to 196 F (91 C) at the tail. The walls of the cabin are warm to the touch. To help reflect and radiate this heat, the Concorde has a high-reflectivity white paint that is about twice as reflective as the white paint on other jets. The heat encountered by the Concorde causes the airframe to expand 7 inches (17.8 cm) in flight.</em> </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting fact about the Concorde is that its speed was generally limited by the air temperature - the maximum allowable temperature was 127 degrees on the nose, and if the atmospheric temperature was high you had to keep the speed down to avoid hitting the temperature limit. A difference of a few degrees outside could make a big difference in your speed limit and your cruise climb performance.</p>
<p>Interestingly the tropics are actually colder at high altitudes than high/low latitudes (Generally speaking) thus the Concorde got better speed and high altitude cruise climb performance in the tropics, basically the opposite of what you experience at lower altitudes in the tropics with regular airliners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, very good point. The temperature doesn't start rising until about 150K feet ( <a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/standard-atmosphere-d_604.html" target="_blank">https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/standard-atmosphere-d_604.html</a> )</p>
<p>I think the primary causes of the heating do not include high ambient air temperatures.</p></div>		</li>
