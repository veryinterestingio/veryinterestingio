			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been a great optimist that we'll find life somewhere in the universe. However, in parallel with that, I've always been a pessimist about life in our own solar system. Of course, I hope I'm wrong in this respect, because life on Mars (say) would be so much easier for us to study than life on a distant exoplanet. But so far our exploration of the solar system makes it look to me like a very lifeless place (other than Earth, of course!). The recent findings you mention don't change my view at all. Take phosphine on Venus,  for example. It's so rare that it's not even present at a level of 1 part per million in the Venusian atmosphere. Of the two hypotheses the author of that paper suggest, my money is on the non-biological one. If you press me to say where I think a sceptic should look in the solar system for a place that there just might be microbial life, I'd go for the subsurface oceans of Europa and Enceladus.</p></div>		</li>
