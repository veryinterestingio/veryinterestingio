			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not particularly familiar with the turbines themselves, but I'm having a hard time believing that they are are adjusting the AC frequency with the blade speed itself (for purposes of grid matching).</p>
<p>I feel like it would be much more efficient to generate what power you can/want and then rectify-invert to match the grid frequency. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And Not sure why the person also stated they rotate at a constant rpm... they do not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The generator / alternator on almost all big wind turbines is synchronized with the grid, and is connected to the turbine with a fixed ratio gearbox. </p>
<p>Since the turbine will spin at a constant rpm,  the control system will vary the pitch of the airfoils of the turbine to control the power output. </p>
<p>Too much pitch and the airfoil will stall, too little and no power will be generated.  There is a wind sensor on the turbine that provides input to the control system.</p>
<p>Very efficient over a wide wind speed. Only needs to shut down in calm or very high gusty winds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think thats wrong. The power is likely transformed by an inverter inside the windmill. Otherwise the windmil woukd have to move at that one speed regardless of wind velocity and that clearly isnt the case</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are totally correct!
You know the old saying, if you want to find the truth on the internet, just post bogus info?</p>
<p>I was dealing with old info, looking at the GE site their turbines are asyncronus and use a double IGBT converter to sync with the grid.  </p>
<p>Lots of efficency upgrades in the last 20 years! Always be willing to learn! Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. Except they're called wind turbines, not windmills. </p>
<p>Energy is produced in AC, converted to D.C. Because it is easier to clean up, then converted back to AC to go into the grid. </p>
<p>Reason for that is wind speed varies from second to second. This would create dirty power. </p></div>		</li>
