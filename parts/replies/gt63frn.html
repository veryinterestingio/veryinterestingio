<p>Fun fact: Make yourself known to ants by breathing on them. They can &quot;smell&quot; your breath and will panic, thinking you're a predator who didn't floss your teeth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You’re a million times their size, taller in comparison than our largest skyscrapers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ant height \~4mm (.4cm) Human avg height \~180cm. Human to Ant ratio 180/.04=4500.     </p>
<p>Tallest building in the world Burj Khalifa 828 meters. Khalifa to human ratio 828/1.8=460.  So smaller by an order of magnitude.   </p>
<p>Mt. Everest height \~8,849 meters. Everest to Human ratio 8849/1.8=4916  </p>
<p>So to an Ant Humans are almost as tall as Mt. Everest is to Human.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To insects, humans are gargantuan lovecraftian horrors immune to the march of time. We're eternal to them. Before a child reaches adulthood, the insect has gone through potentially thousands of generations. That's like a single living creature having been around since before we were even homo sapiens, and only just now reaching adulthood. Outside of a select few insects, they can do nothing to harm us, and we can kill them with such a lack of effort or care.</p>
<p>But fucking flies see right through that horseshit. Flies know we aren't God.</p></div>		</li>
