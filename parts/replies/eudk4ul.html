			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that’s definitely part of it, but some people have an idea of their identity separate from anyone else. So when I was like 11 I asked my mom if we could get gothic clothes. I didn’t have anyone in my life who dressed that way or listened to that sort of music, I actively sought those things out. When I had access to the internet without my parents over my shoulder I’d turn on heavier music (I like punk rock and metal core, mostly). I had found it on my own because punk was pretty in when I was a kid, but it didn’t take long before I found heavy stuff. My music taste has always been entirely separate from anything social. But I never grew out of the clothes thing either, just had to wait quite a bit longer than other humans to be allowed to express myself. My parents always took away any dark clothing I bought myself. </p>
<p>I think when it comes to music taste it can be social, but it could be that you’re drawn to people who see the world like you do in some unconscious way. Like someone else previously said, sort of like soulmates</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But at the same time, punk and metal songs are still based off the occidental scale, the building block of western music. They still use typical scales and still use chord combos that are common and liked in western music. Major chords still sound happy/bright and minor chords still sound sad/heavy. However, if you had grown up in Indonesia for example, their music developed off of a different scale. Even with the same internet access and ignoring language barriers etc., it is very unlikely you would have gotten into those genres.</p>
<p>There was a report a while ago on the Tsimané (an Amazonian tribe) because they hadn't been exposed to Western music. They found that given no prior exposure, people didn't have any preference between dissonant chords (associated with evil/tension in western music and usually thought to sound bad) and consonant chords (associated with good/happy things, usually thought to sound good). They ranked them as equally pleasant.</p>
<p>While I agree that it's not as straight forward as automatically liking the same specific genre of music as those around you, environment absolutely is a huge factor in what possibly genres you might like.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prrtty much this. What you grew up listening to is a huge part too. For example, I grew up to my mom listening to the hip-hop station in the car when I was little. That helped cultivate my enjoyment of hiphop music today. Also in middle school, rap music was a big thing there and that’s when I started getting more into it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that for about 80% of people the music they like is just choosing which crowd they want to associate with.  When you were a teen if you wanted to hang with someone you listened to the music they listened to and grew to like it.</p></div>		</li>
