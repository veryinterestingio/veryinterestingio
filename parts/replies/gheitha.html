			<div class="markdown"><p>I would have to find the study, google is not helping, but It was about how the brain remembers details in almost any elevated emotional state.  The study involved using certain scenarios to elicit emotional responses and then test how well they remembered specific features of the event.  Like what people were wearing, did they smell anything, what time it was etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The only consistency was that people had a much better memory if they were in a more positive emotional state.  They also found people could remember things in detail when angry, or afraid, but it was a much narrower focus, i.e. that people would remember everything about the person, or the object that was casing the stress but couldnt tell you anything about other people/objects in the room.</p>
<p>Long term memory was also a lot better overall for people in a positive mood.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the study was really interesting, but I also remember our teacher said to be skeptical of the results as it was seen as subjective.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It read it for a psychology 101 class, as the class was pretty much only about how the brain learns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is super interesting to me right now. I've been reading about OCD and modifying behavior. I think of kids that come from angry homes. It really brings in perspective of children that have a hard time learning cause they are emotionally afraid or panicked all the time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will never forget the <em>crushing</em> feeling that came from talking to a coworker with whom i was not compatible (fifteen year age difference) because it was the first time i felt that way about someone for maybe twelve years.</p>
<p>It was beautifully tragic, in a kinda trivial way. But man it felt like my heart sank.</p>
<p>I just about cherish that feeling. I never thought i'd <em>feel</em> again, yet here i am. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is the reason behind a recommendation to chew strong gum while studying for a test and chewing the same while taking it.  If you can &quot;strengthen&quot; memories by adding this sensation, it makes recall much easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's wild.  Is that association tied to anything in particular or just an unusual response?</p>
<p>I feel that'd be overwhelmingly distracting for me to have those separate emotions alongside studying.  The closest I can relate, though, is an aversion to watermelon flavoring that would induce some undesirable flashbacks.  Can't imagine harnessing that for study</p></div>		</li>
