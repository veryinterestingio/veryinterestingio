<p>Lower wavelength means a shorter wavelength and higher energy</p>
<p>Higher wavelength means a longer wavelength and lower energy</p>
<p>So for example, it might absorb light with a wavelength of 300 nanometers (shorter and higher energy, ultraviolet so we can't see it) and emit 500 nanometers (longer and lower energy, and visible)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Id written it as &quot;higher energy&quot; and edited it to &quot;wavelength&quot; instead but didn't switch the &quot;higher/lower&quot;. (Id be worried if it was absorbing light of 300 nm as that is squarely in the UVB range)</p></div>		</li>

<p>well that is not true, not to be pedantic but those words define opposite things. I'd just avoid the use of &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; when associated with wavelength, sticking with &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot;. Low wavelength = wavelength is not that big = short wavelength, but it's just ambiguous as hell.</p></div>		</li>
