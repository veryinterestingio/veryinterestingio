			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. But in addition sometimes fake documents are inserted into real databases. Corruption is everywhere. In my country (South Africa) many people buy their drivers licence through corrupt people working for our licensing department (our DMV) </p>
<p>Although I have no knowledge of this being done with ID documents or passports I believe it should be possible with enough corruption in place</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately it happens with those documents too. My cousin from South Africa, moved to Ireland, met a guy and decided to get married. On returning to SA to file the papers, she found out she was already married to someone  else. Turned out someone used her identity details to lodge a marriage paperwork so that they could apply for citizenship. I am not sure what happend in the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also some people sell their passports, even if they don’t get stolen some people will willingly give them up. People are so stupid, young people especially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I lived in Manila I knew a guy from the US that was living there as an “expat” )but really an illegal alien since he didn’t have a visa any longer.) He told me he sold his passport, Social security card, birth certificate, and basically his identity in the US for a shitload of money. Some dude is out there just living this guys life and he’s ok with it, he joked about how his credit has actually improved with this dude living his life. </p>
<p>Reminded me of when I sold my World of Warcraft account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What this post says about databases not being accessible is correct as far as I know. However, the electronic chip, if present, contains a digitally signed copy of your data, including your picture.</p>
<p>This can be cloned (copied verbatim), but not modified, and it can be verified with the (widely available for many countries afaik) public keys from each country).</p>
<p>AFAIK you can also ask the chip to prove that it wasn't cloned, but you may need special keys for that (that are only given to &quot;friendly&quot; countries and that expire). So the UK could probably check a US passport, but Iran probably couldn't.</p>

<p>TL;DR; there is no secret world wide database with everyone's information for them to connect to.</p>

<p>Well if you knew about it, it wouldn't be a SECRET database.</p></div>		</li>
