			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that's interesting, because I was going to say I once witnessed two wasps come and pick up the corpse of a wasp that had drowned and fly away with it. Freaked me out and increased my fear of wasps exponentially. I was sure at that point that those fuckers are intelligent enough take names and get revenge too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Where I live, and walk a short way to get to the train station there is a (what I think is a singular crow - I can’t really tell if it’s the same one) crow who will follow me to and from the station. At first it was a little eerie, cause it just perched along the path I take keeping up with me. They are ridiculously intelligent problem solvers too. So cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember some 4chan post where the OP encountered two different murders of crows on the way to work. One he would languish with treats, the other he would harras and abuse. Eventually one group loved him, the other reviled him.</p>
<p>Then one day he took the time to Peter Piper the group that loved him towards the ones he would be attacked by. The loyal ones saught to defend him. Crow War.</p>
<p>Probably not true, but kind of fun to think about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never seen drones have this dying behavior. Usually a drone doesnt want to leave the hive, and they have to be tossed out by the girls. In some cases, the girls will chew off the wings of the drone, carry his ass out, and toss him. I got scared once because I saw a noticeable amount of bees crawling on the ground, away from the hive. Could be a sign of disorientation due to disease. But when I picked some up, they were all wingless drones. Poor bastards.</p>
<p>Also, the drones get kicked out in Fall. This behavior occurs, or is at least noticeable, in dead of winter. </p></div>		</li>
