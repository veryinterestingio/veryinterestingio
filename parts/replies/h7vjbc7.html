			<div class="markdown"><p>just got a bidet and it's the best thing I ever did, why didn't I do it sooner? The problem is now, of course, I can't poop anywhere else because I need water shooting up my ass like a power washer.</p>
<p>and I still need like at least 6 squares folded in half or something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should still wipe before using the dry function. That water may be a little poopy, you don't want to just dry it on your butt. Poop - spray - wipe - blow dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I often don’t. Living in Indonesia here and I often just don’t care about having a slightly more damp ass. Especially with a bidet (as opposed to a handheld spray gun, or even small bucket that you also see here), it really only gets wet very locally. Definitely not enough to come through your pants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes a lot more than 1 or 2 though. I recently bought one and I use maybe 25% less. Not nearly as much of a decrease as I hoped</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At a hotel I stayed in they had a dryer as part of the bidet.  Never needed toilet paper.  The first couple of times I used TP just to see how well it worked.  Clean as a whistle. Fuck I love bidets!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you may be doing it wrong… as another said, I let it spray for a little while and move my booty around and then I let it drip dry a little and then I just pat dry with two squares folded over. Prior to that I would use 2-3 wet wipes. Prior to wet wipes I would use probably 36+ squares of TP to wipe and still wouldn’t feel totally clean, and there would often be dingleberries in my hairy ass.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, I’m not doing it to save TP. I use a bidet because it’s effective.</p>
<p>Another option is you can use small towels for drying your clean ass after using a bidet. I would personally prefer a couple of disposable pieces of TP to dry but that is just me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm loving your message. But just to get this out there--even &quot;flushable&quot; wipes aren't biodegradable and shouldn't be flushed. They'll often make it past your toilet only to cause problems for the general public system (or your septic)</p>
