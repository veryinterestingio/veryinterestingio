<p>Windows gets a huge amount of flak for having so much of it that is &quot;out of date&quot; and stuff like ending up with 30 different versions of what seems to be the same c++ runtime installed, but it has a massive amount of backwards compatibility (you can run programs made 30 years ago, in some cases, without any changes) and the biggest competitor, Mac os, doesn't even come close in comparison.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And then there are lunatics running (stripped down) .NET Core applications on Windows 3.11 and DOS for the fun of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know it's less about the language that it's written in and more about how the operating system functions and what interface it provides to the hardware resources. If the game happens to use features/parts of the interface that are still essentially the same, it'll still run fine. If it uses features that are outdated but compatibility has been maintained because they were commonly-used, it'll probably be fine as well. If it uses features that have been removed or re-written to have a different interface, then it won't be able to do what it needs to do and will likely crash.</p></div>		</li>
