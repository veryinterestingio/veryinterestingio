			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like for that case, isn't it that there are so many birds outside, ones close by (say, 10 or 11) will eventually enter your house by some 0.01% chance? But then, the ones that enter your house will only exit by that same 0.01% chance. It's not like it's <em>common</em> for birds to come into a house, no?</p>
<p>So it's a 0.01% chance, per bird nearby your door, over the weeks/months/years, to get into your house. Then it's another 0.01% chance to get out.</p>
<p>That was just my thinking, numbers are random and it may be and probably is bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at it like a bird-density point of view. If there are 0 birds inside your house, the bird-density is 0. And since things tend to go from high density to low density, a bird (or a fly for that matter) will eventually fly into your house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, exactly! I didn't want to make it sound too much like osmosis since that's a different mechanism, but now that I'm thinking about it again it's actually a pretty good way to put it.</p>
<p>But yeah, my point was that I don't think this is that good of a comparison, since at least from the title it sounds like the duvet cover is &quot;swallowing&quot; most of the clothes and not just a bit of htem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the explanation. But do people not just zip up their duvet cover before the wash/dry cycle? That way no clothing or other sheets can go inside</p></div>		</li>
