			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually not strictly true. There’s a concept being studied more now that there is a training of innate immune responses. Basically, some vaccines do prime cells in your bone marrow to react to pathogens nonspecifically for a limited period of time (like weeks to months). BCG and MMR are both vaccines that potentially do this. So the answer can be yes in some cases.
(My lab studies this in animals)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree.  There is quite a bit of evidence that a vaccine can provide some protection against other pathogens (not all, but more than just the one specifically targeted).  There is also some concern that it can cause greater susceptibility.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not directly related, but Wim Hof paricipated in and trained extra candidates for a study to show everyone can get control over their innate immune response. They had less fever and inflammation markers, and were passed sickness much faster than the untrained control group.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are still expanding on this concept but what my lab looks at is the stem cells that turn into suppressor cells. Basically, the vaccine can go into your bone marrow and the stem cells there “see” it. They become activated so that they will make more of themselves and then mature into immune cells that can react faster. There is a paper on the TB vaccine (BCG) that shows this in macrophages and other cells. </p>
<p>My lab looks at cells that respond to inflammation indiscriminately which helps fight sepsis regardless of the pathogen. You can send a nonpathogenic fungus into the bone marrow, wait two weeks then give the animal an inflammatory infection that would kill it in a matter of two or three days but instead, they live. The innate cells respond so quickly because they are pre-activated and waiting in the bone marrow and near the original area the injection was given. We can see the effects out to 256 days, if I remember correctly. </p>
<p>In (super) short: It’s like the memory effect you would see in T or B cells but it’s stem cell precursors to innate cells. But not specific and not permanent.</p>
<p>I don’t know that anyone has looked at complement. Complement is a whole different beast that I avoid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact, the main reason you need to get a flu shot every year isn't because last year's wore off, it's because the flu virus has mutated again. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have always known this. But now you have me thinking. If we have to get a &quot;new&quot; shot every year for flu mutations....</p>
<p>1) What makes the flu vaccine so special that companies can change it and bring it to market without going through the typical trials that are conducted for other vaccines. </p>
<p>2) I have heard that they make an educated guess of the most &quot;popular&quot; strain by observing the other half of the hemisphere. I am guessing here, but that leaves a 6 month window to test and make a new vaccine? How is it done so fast?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are really good questions</p>
<p>1). Vaccine manufacturer's demonstrate that the process used to make annual flu vaccines is safe. As for efficacy, manufacturer's must show that the viral antigen is same as the  current year cocktail of strains (tri or quad valent) using the SRID assay. This assay demonstrates viral specificity and amount and manufacturer's must prove that the vaccine antigen amount reaches a certain threshold amount that they had previously shown in clinical trials to produce antibodies in humans. </p>
<p>2). 6-8 months sounds about right. This is a big topic in research. Flu vaccines are typically made in embryo chicken eggs to attenuate the virus but this is tedious, time consuming and uses a lot of eggs (roughly one egg per vaccine dose). Suspension mammalian cells can reduce the lead time significantly and mRNA vaccine reduce it even further. As you can imagine, the first company with a season vaccine ready gets a larger portion of the market share. Short lead times are also critical in cases of a possible flu pandemic</p></div>		</li>
