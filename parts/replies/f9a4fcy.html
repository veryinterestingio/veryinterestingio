			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true! The end result is the same for <em>all</em> cases of oblate ellipsoids (spheroids) where the axes are equal along the azimuth plane.</p>
<p>Here is the proof.</p>
<p>Start with the equation for gravitational force.</p>
<p>F<em><em>g</em></em> = GM<em><em>1</em></em>M<em><em>2</em></em> / r^2</p>
<p>In this case, M<em><em>1</em></em> is your mass, G is the gravitational constant, M<em><em>2</em></em> is the mass of the earth, and r is distance from the centre of mass.</p>
<p>If we assume your mass doesn't change, then GM<em><em>1</em></em> is a constant, and we can say that the gravitational force is proportional to the earth's mass divided by your distance from the centre of mass.</p>
<p>F<em><em>g</em></em> ∝ M<em><em>2</em></em> / r^2</p>
<p>The mass of the earth is the product of the volume and the density of the earth. In this case we're assuming the earth is <em>not</em> a sphere, but an ellipsoid. Volume for an ellipsoid is found by the following:</p>
<p>V = 4/3 *(pi*a*b*c)</p>
<p>where a, b, and c are the ellipsoid axis. When a = b = c, this simplifies to the sphere. In our case, we are assuming we're at the equator, and both axis along the azimuth plane are roughly equal, but larger than the zenith axis:</p>
<p>a ≅ b &gt; c</p>
<p>Since we assume the density is evenly distributed (which it isn't, but due to symmetry the centre of mass is equivalently calculated as if it were), the mass is proportional to the volume, which is proportional to a* b * c.</p>
<p>M<em><em>2</em></em> ∝ abc</p>
<p>But since we're at the equator, r = a ≅ b; r^2 ≅ a* b</p>
<p>Combining this;</p>
<p>F<em><em>equator</em></em> ∝ (r^2 * c) / r^2</p>
<p>F<em><em>equator</em></em> ∝ c</p>
<p>So, the force at the equator is proportional to how oblate the ellipsoid is.</p>
<p>If we want to compare this to the force at the pole, r = c. Therefore:</p>
<p>F<em><em>pole</em></em> ∝ abc/c^2</p>
<p>F<em><em>pole</em></em> ∝ ab/c</p>
<p>Comparing the ratio of the force at the equator versus the force at the poles;</p>
<p>F<em><em>equator</em></em> / F<em><em>pole</em></em> = c / (ab / c)</p>
<p>F<em><em>equator</em></em> / F<em><em>pole</em></em> = c^2 / ab</p>
<p>We can say this is equal now rather than proportional because both forces use the same constants.</p>
<p>Since we made the assumption that both a and b are greater than c, then a*b &gt; c^2, therefore c^2 / ab &lt; 1.</p>
<p>So;</p>
<p>F<em><em>equator</em></em> / F<em><em>pole</em></em> = c^2 / ab &lt; 1</p>
<p>F<em><em>equator</em></em> &lt; F<em><em>pole</em></em></p>
<p>The difference in mass is not a factor! It's purely due to the oblate ellipsoidal shape.</p>
<p>It's interesting because as c approaches the value of a and b, then the force at the equator becomes equal (not less than) the force at the pole. This is equivalent to the earth becoming more like a sphere. c becomes greater than a and b, the sign flips such that the force at the equator becomes greater than the force at the pole. This intuitively makes sense because the ellipsoid is now more oblate along the azimuth plane once c becomes larger than a and b.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there's more mass under you at the equator (due to the aforementioned bulge) then you should weigh a little bit more than at the poles, no? When combine with the centripidal force would there be a net increase in weight, or the reverse?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as the tides. It's high tide when the moon is opposite of where your are.</p>
<p>If it helps, think of it that when the moon is overhead, it's pulling the water towards it more than it's pulling the Earth towards it, so there's a bulge. When the moon is opposite, it's pulling the Earth away from you more than it's pulling the water away, so there's also a bulge.</p>
<p>That's a little bit of an oversimplification, because in reality the tidal forces don't cause the tides directly - more like the tidal forces cause a pressure difference on the water all around the surface, which then forces the water up.

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>While it does cause a wave, that doesn't mean the wave is in the gravitational field. The opposite side is not feeling a reduction of pull--only the one side.</del></p>
<p>Edit: I think I see now. I was only thinking in terms of the sum of the vectors at the point of the observer instantaneously, in which case the sum of the vector pointing to the moon would add constructively to the vector pointing to the center of the planet. I wasn't considering the acceleration of the planet away from the observer due to the gradient of its influence being stronger on the planet than on the observer. Neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, because the Earth <em>is not</em> a perfect sphere, and does not have uniform consistency, you weigh all sorts of thing around anywhere.</p>
<p>Fun fact, you can take a small weight with you and measure the weight of something on sea level, and on a mountain. You can see a difference. </p>
