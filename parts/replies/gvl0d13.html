			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you got me wondering whether the moon has an atmosphere.  I mean it obviously doesn't to the degree earth (or even mars) does, but if you measured pressure or particle concentrations near the surface would it be quite a bit higher than say some point halfway between earth &amp; moon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The technical term for what the moon has is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere" target="_blank">exosphere</a>.</p>
<p>There are molecules zipping around the moon, and concentration of molecules decreases as you leave the moon's surface. However, molecular concentration is so low even at the surface that the molecules don't really behave like a gas. They are much more like freely orbiting ions than like a fluid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Moon has what's called a surface boundary exosphere. Molecules ejected from the surface follow ballistic trajectories and hit the surface again. In my view this isn't a &quot;real&quot; atmosphere because it's not capable of behaving as a gas. However it is still around 10,000 times as dense as the solar wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It weighs even less! 4 pounds on earth, 1.5 pounds on Mars.</p>
<p>It doesn't get &quot;blown around&quot; because the Mars atmosphere is less than 1% as dense as Earth's. So a given wind speed would blow against you with &gt;100x less force than the &quot;wind&quot; you're imagining from Earth.</p>
<p>I wasn't joking saying that erosion on Mars is SLOW. Wind would only be able to pick up very fine dust, and push it around much more gently than windblown dust on Earth.</p>
<p>The dust storm in The Martian is pure Hollywood, the author explained he made it up because he needed a reason for 5 astronauts to leave one on the planet. You'd barely even feel a wind on Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I couldn't stop thinking about this since I'd seen pics of those Martian &quot;dust devils&quot; years ago. Just leaving something lightweight with a lot of drag on Mars made me queasy. But that makes sense, if the atmosphere is like 1/100th the density here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The atmospheric density is something I feel you really should edit into your top comment. A lot of people don't get that the Martian atmosphere is so thin that those months long dust storms would feel like a light breeze at their worst. The lower gravity also means it takes less energy to kick up dust than here on Earth, as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>theoretically yes, if you affect it with unthinkable amounts of heat or kinetic energy. practically i don't see how though, except for a huge meteor (or exoplanet?) impact, or it being torn apart by a big source of gravitational force like another big planet in close proximity, a star, or a black hole.</p>
<p>but i'm always open to learn new perspectives.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So I play this board game called Terraforming Mars and huh, we can kind of crash asteroids in sizes similar to Phobos on the planet. Would crashing both of Mars's moons be enough?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually, yeah. First thing that comes to mind is altering the orbit of asteroids in the belt, sending them flying wherever we need to. Theoretically, we’d eventually figure out how to send asteroids that are abundant with resources into orbit around Earth for easy access. I suppose the same logic would apply to hurling asteroids at Mars.</p>
<p>Or maybe we’ll have super nukes. Whichever comes first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Encase the entire planet in a megastructure with one way mirrors, mirror side facing the planet.  Shoot energy randomly out of every mirror at regular intervals.  Eventually the surface becomes super heated, with the heat energy going deeper and deeper.  Repeat until Mars is one big burning ball.  Once in big burning ball phase, throw iron at the ball, which slowly sinks into the core.  Then dismantle the megastructure.  The new planet will cool with a denser core, increasing gravity, and creating a magnetic field.    </p>
<p>Speed up its orbit equivalent to its new density (so it doesn't crash into the sun or other planets.)  Let it cool for a few million years, and viola, new habitable planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving it close to a big planet might be the&quot;easiest&quot; way.  The tides flex the moon and that heats it up. IIRC some of Jupiter or Saturn's moons are geologically active with that as their heat source.</p></div>		</li>
