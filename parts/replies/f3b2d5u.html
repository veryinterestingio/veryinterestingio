			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is yes. You are talking about what I call therapeutic uses of editing where you would like to express the editing reagents in a specific somatic (non-germ) tissue i.e. the pancreas. this can be done with a tissue-specific promoter that only turns on in the pancreas.  These somatic-cell therapies are perhaps less controversial than germ-line editing where the edit is carried to the next generation. This tends to be where there are discussions related to human editing. It is actually somewhat ironic that germ-line editing is the objective of plant and animal breeders looking to use editing to introduce useful traits into agricultural breeding programs, because if it is not inherited by the next generation then it does not help with genetic improvement. </p>
<p>there is also some interesting, somewhat controversial work being carried out to grow human organs in, for example, pigs. If the genetic pathway that results in pancreas can be knocked out in the pig, then complementing that  with human cells can mean the only cells that can grow in that development niche are human cells.
