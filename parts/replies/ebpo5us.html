			<div class="markdown"><p>And it sounds like those tendon cells continue on into the rough patches of bone, it's just that bone has the calcium to make it hard (thanks mr skeltal), I think in some places like the front of the calf, some muscles are only connected to the tissue that surrounds bone (shin splints are this outer bone tissue having micro fractures), but most places it connects much stronger and sort of becomes part of the bone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tendon just sort of merges with the bone - individual filaments spread after the insertion point, imagine tree trunk splitting into roots. It's incredibly strong connection - the muscle will tear in half before the tendon rips from the bone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The wrapper goes all the way around the candy ? but the sides where the extra wrapping paper &quot;bunches up&quot; is what we call tendons, even though the wrapper/tissue goes around the entire muscle (the actual candy)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for explaining. So the commenter is referring to the twisted nature of the wrapper? The tendons form a sheet and wrap the muscle cells just like the wax paper of this candy would do?</p></div>		</li>
