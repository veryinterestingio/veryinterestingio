			<div class="markdown"><p>For an analogy, imagine the liver as a garbage disposal plant. You're the employee who has to sort the garbage for appropriate disposal. There's a conveyor belt with all kinds of garbage on it. You can use <em>tools</em> to sort and dispose of garbage that has a certain property without ever knowing what that garbage was. You can use a magnet to sort all metallic stuff. You can use a fan to sort all the lightest garbage. You can use a laser to burn all the flammable stuff.</p>
<p>Now you can realistically use all of these tools at the same time to dispose of garbage.</p>
<p>The way molecules interact and what they do is determined by some parts of their composition called functional groups. A molecule like ethanol  (the alcohol in beverages) has one -OH group on it , which makes it part of the alcohol family. </p>
<p>The liver has <em>enzymes</em> which are molecules that &quot;break down&quot; and modify other molecules.  These enzymes react with very precise functional groups. Any<em> molecule that has an alcohol group -OH  can react with the enzyme </em>alcohol dehydrogenase* to be modified into something else. The something else can react with another enzyme, etc,etc...</p>
<p>Well your liver is the garbage plant and the tools are the enzymes. They use properties of the molecules without knowing what the molecules are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why the treat to methanol poisoning you have to drink a lot of ethanol (the alcohol we usually drink) or better yet fomepizole (less side effects). The problem is that when dehydrogenase (actually a chain of two dehydrogenase, alcohol to make it into formaldehyde, and then aldehyde which turns that into very toxic formate) touches methanol it decomposes them into very poisonous chemicals, making it worse, since the liver can't recognize it. But the other two chemicals will distract the liver first and have it process them more, while the methanol is handled by the kidneys, peed out as raw alcohol. Not good for the kidneys, but survivable. </p>
<p>If the body had the ability to choose the strategy for each chemical we wouldn't have the problem. But it's because we choose a broad strategy that does the right thing with 99% of the chemicals but it's really bad 1% of the time, that methanol is so poisonous (otherwise it's that not much more poisonous that ethanol).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you believe all the self-proclaimed 'detox' experts who have taken over the internet in the past 15 years, the liver is completely incapable of doing what it's supposed to do and we need to drink green milkshakes and avoid everything we enjoy in order to have a healthy liver.</p></div>		</li>
