			<div class="markdown"><p>Altered synovial fluid production, despite its important properties, is not usually treated in isolation. The underlying cause is what is treated. There is no alternative treatments/injections for low synovial fluid. Repeated HA injections do not correct synovial fluid quantity, and other injectables do not either.</p>
<p>Synovial fluid quantity is not concerning if it has no repercussion in a patient's quality of life. Indeed, people don't go around saying they suffer from decreased or increased synovial fluid! </p>
<p>But one suffers from pain, stiffness, weakness, locking, etc., And that is what can (and is) treated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Synovectomy is sometimes done for inflammatory arthritis and not typically for osteoarthritis which is what laypeople mean by &quot;arthritis&quot;.</p>
<p>Inflammatory arthritis are autoimmune and can affect younger patients, often affect multiple joints, affect other organ systems and respond to systemic anti-inflammatory treatments or some form of immune suppression.</p>
<p>Osteoarthritis is typically more &quot;mechanical&quot; in symptoms, are often explained as &quot;wear and tear&quot; of a joint, affect older patients, and is a more localized illness.</p>
<p>Note that hyaluronic acid injections are not done for insufficient synovial fluid, but rather to reduce symptoms of mild to moderate osteoarthritis. Also, to my knowledge, impaired synovial fluid production is not really treated or managed currently.</p></div>		</li>
