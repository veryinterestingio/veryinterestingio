			<div class="markdown"><p>I cant ever fully relax in a hammock. Constantly aware of how well I am balancing it and so forth. Perhaps even whilst you feel relaxed, your brain knows  that 1 foul move will send you to the ground. With that said, I am able to doze off while on a raft in a pool, so...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you sleep on a boat?
My personal best nights are on a hammock or on a boat. Sometimes I get lucky with a hammock on a boat and I've never slept deeper. Something about the day and the sound of the surf. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first night at n a hammock was like that. By the end of the season I slept better in my hammock than in my bed. It just takes time for your body to realize it's not in danger. </p></div>		</li>

Last time I tried it was three days of a light doze for an hour at best.</p></div>		</li>
