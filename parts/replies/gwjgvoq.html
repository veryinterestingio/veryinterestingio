			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a follow up question, but I think you just answered that too. I was also wondering why we tend to get sick at night. I've vary rarely &quot;gotten sick&quot; during the day, but have almost always gone to sleep feeling fine and then woken up feeling miserably sick. I'm supposing I  already had whatever made me sick during the day but my cortisol levels were keeping it at bay.</p></div>		</li>
