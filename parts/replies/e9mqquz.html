			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a Boy Scout camp that my kids go to about 45 minutes away in Texas. They have a rule that if you want a camp fire, you have to bring in your own wood to burn, probably because they don’t want an endless stream of scouts picking the forest clean.</p>
<p>As a result the area is just overloaded with fuel. It’s insane. Downed trees and logs just in piles as if land based beavers were at work. It infuriates me every time I see it, and still they are importing wood for camp fires. At this point it would probably take ten-twenty years of scouts scavenging to clean up all the mess.</p>
<p>A few years back a wildfire made it almost to the camp before being stopped.  My guess is that the land near by looked similar, but I can’t know for sure.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Would that even be a bad thing? </p>
<p>Does underbrush serve any other useful ecological purpose that would be prevented by scouts harvesting it all for firewood? </p>
<p>It sounds like if scouts don’t gather it gradually, it’s just gonna burn all at once in a big fire anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's certainly what I expect.</p>
<p>The best explanation I got from them was that they want to serve as a model for when Scouts are in other forests so that they are respectful of the land don't clear it out as well.  They seem to think that if the Scouts are let off the chain they will start cutting down live trees for wood.  This does not hold up to very much inspection since </p>
<p>1) every time I am with Scouts in other areas they uniformly scavenge for firewood </p>
<p>2) There is nothing wrong with clearing away dead fallen wood </p>
<p>3) Even children know that it is easier and better to take fallen wood than trying to cut down green wood.  The few spazzes that want to mess with saplings need to be spoken to anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dead wood is a natural part of the forest ecosystem too. It provides shelter and cover for animals, good rich loam for seedlings, and its simple presence can help stop erosion compared to bare ground. </p>
<p>However, fire is also a natural part of the ecosystem in California, and if we're not going to let fires burn, more dead wood will build up than would be natural, and then you get a real wildfire burning up everything all at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Underbrush is extremely important and there is an entire ecosystem based on e.g decomposing wood. All the way from fungi to birds.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn't mean everything has to be left in the forest floor and without frequent natural fires to keep the supply down (which is often the case nowadays) you have to figure out a sensible middle ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yosemite in California is a prime of example of this taken to an extreme. The natives main food source was acorns from live oak <del>dogwood trees</del> (I think my tour guide mixed the two up...), and they would routinely burn the larger pines so they didn't overshadow. After our ancestors pushed out the natives they decided to let the pines grow, which led to the recent fire that shut the park down for a while.</p>
<p>Edit: Mixed up trees.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all forests are pine forests.</p>
<p>The areas around e.g. Sonoma, Paradise, Thousand Oaks, Malibu are all chaparral, containing scrub oak, manzanita, sagebrush, poison oak(!), bay, etc...</p>
<p>When folks think of &quot;forest fires&quot; they tend to think of crown fires spreading amongst the tall pine trees.  But that's not what's burning here.</p>
<p>The implicit assumption is that we &quot;just need to allow more logging.&quot;  But nobody wants to log chaparral.  And the chaparral that's burning most destructively around new suburban areas isn't forest that anyone wants to cut for timber.</p>
<p>So while I don't disagree that the pine forests in the Sierras have a species, density, age, and fire suppression problem, it's an oversimplification to think of the huge wildfires we're having as being *limited* to those types of forests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think he meant NGOs.</p>
<p>Around South Lake Tahoe, there's the City of South Lake Tahoe, El Dorado County, and TRPA - the Tahoe Regional Protection Agency.</p>
<p>Large trees are called &quot;heritage trees&quot; and you need a permit to cut them.  You still do.  However, before the Angora Burn it was a lot harder to get such a permit.  Now, everyone talks about &quot;Defensible Space&quot; and folks are encouraged to clear for fire safety.  Before the Angora burn, preserving wildlife habitat and the aesthetic of the forest were the priority.</p>
<p>Now, it's very easy to have CalFire come out to your property, do a defensible space evaluation, and mark any trees that are questionable for fire safety for cutting.</p></div>		</li>
