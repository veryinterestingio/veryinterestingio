			<div class="markdown"><p>They both miss out the fact that ‘music’ is not a random theoretical exercise. There are a limited number of harmonic sequences that actually sound good and work. </p>
<p>You can randomly generate sequences of tones for as long as you want, you can also layer tones to build simple and complex chords, you can arrange those in any order you like but only certain sequences actually work musically. </p>
<p>They’ve all missed out the fact that music is not a single linear tone sequence, rather, a sequence of several tone sequences at once. The only limit on the number of tones at once is the limit of human hearing, 20Hz to 20,000Hz, all of them at once is white noise. But 7 of them at once is a complex chord. </p>
<p>So, applying this fixation on one single tone, needs to be to the power of every possible combination of tones at once. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody is going to have an interesting response if you factor in subjective taste in music.. the mathematican already said it was possible, so a smaller finite number would also be possible.  Theres no way to determine what number of good songs there is, that question doesn't even make sense, so the engineer won't be able to filter his answer either.</p>
<p>and I'm not sure why you think the other response isn't factoring in chords or complex notes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes,  but of those 2x10^90 combinations, approximately 2x10^90 are really crappy songs.</p>
<p>And, I doubt someone would listen to two songs with 299 identical notes and one different one, and declare them different songs.</p>
<p>It's be interesting for someone to see how many truly unique songs have been published by the music industry. And how many unique beat patterns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. The point is more to illustrate how many combinations of music there are even within an absurdly limited sample.</p>
<p>For a shorter sample - in western music there are 12 notes and 144 chords. Within a single octave it would take approx 10^15 years to play four bars of all combinations of those available notes at 4/4 pace trying out 1 trillion combinations per second on a single instrument. Again - this is an extremely limited example that very much intentionally restricts the length and scope of what might be played far beyond that of typical music.</p>
<p>You can certainly argue a lot of music sounds the same - because a lot of it is, music follows trends, and includes a lot of covers and samples too. The sameness of music is due very much to the pandering to the fashion of the day rather than a limitation on the actual variety available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to limit the math even more, because even in that example, the vast majority is just meaningless noise that, very likely, nobody will ever consider music.  So I wanted to impose further restrictions to find a good baseline while limiting redundancies.  Also for fun.</p>
<p>The restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>8 note long melodies.  This often cited as a 'copyrightable' melody - though that is not the case. (there's no magic number of notes) Still, I'll use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 notes.  Major Pentatonic scale.  Any sequence of these notes will result in something recognizable as music. Key is irrelevant (a melody in G transposed to C# is still the same melody)</p>
</li>
<li>3 rhythmic durations.  (ie., dotted quarter, quarter, eight note)  Covers a wide range of possible melodies and doesn't create anything <em>too</em> absurd - while nearly eliminating redundant rhythms in the math.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result:</p>
<p>Over 2.5 billion melodies arise from these limited conditions, and a good portion of them are actually musical.  Some are repeated ( G-A-G-A and C-D-C-D are the same melody after all) but most are unique.  2.5 billion 8-note-long melodies with fairly simple rhythms on a limited single-octave pentatonic scale.  Most music does not adhere to these limitations, so the number can only grow exponentially from there, though with a lower percentage of &quot;successful&quot; combinations as more complexities are added.  Regardless, adding complexity only serves to increase the absolute number of potential melodies, though it becomes harder and harder to define what a &quot;good&quot; melody is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd argue a lot more of it has to do with the very limited amount of possible music that anyone would enjoy listening to. Like the person above said, nearly 100% of <em>theoretically possible</em> songs would be terrible and no one would enjoy it, not even people who are fans of fringe extreme music genres like grindcore or whatever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Identical notes/melody can sound totally different depending on the harmony of the piece (the underlying chords).. lets say a four-bar melody going C A E A F# A D F# (eighth note each) can sound like two totally different worlds of music depending on the context of the harmony - I could come up with soooo many combinations of chords to nicely match this melody, and every one would give it a brand new feeling.</p>
<p>Thats the beauty of music- a singular note doesn’t mean/make you feel anything without its underlying harmony. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real reason why it’s infinite is rhythm. Rhythm is the golden key to music no matter what we can always sub divide and create smaller and unique rhythms to infinity. It’s mathematics. </p>
<p>Even with only 1 pitch music will still be infinite as long as we can use rhythm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Op asked at least two questions, one was will <em>we</em> ever run out of <em>music</em>. I think /u/ApplesauceHorse covers this. We aren't running out of music.</p>
<p>Op also asked though if there are finite permutations of noise/sound (paraphrasing). Given reasonable limitations of song length, frequency range and amplitude, yes there are a finite number of &quot;songs&quot;, could we listen to them all? No, but that wasn't the second question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That subjectivity can be quantified in some way.  Googling around, there is a source claiming that the iTunes library has about 148 years of recorded music.  That's more than a lifetime, so it's certain that <em>you</em> won't run out of music.  Since everything is new for a baby and we're constantly turning over, I'd argue that's sufficient to say that we have more than enough music for everybody to experience novelty on a daily basis.  Whether or not they like it is still subjective of course.</p></div>		</li>
