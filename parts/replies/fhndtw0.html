			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Billiards&quot; in its loosest usage refers to any game you play on a &quot;pool table&quot;, smacking balls with a cue stick. However, in its strictest usage it refers to carom billiards, which is <em>very</em> different from pool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sort of.  At it's root, billiards refers to any game played on a table with a cue stick and balls.  In other words, pool is an example of billiards.  The term pool came from people betting money on billiard games; as in a betting pool.  </p>
<p>These days, pretty much every game that uses a table with pockets and a set of numbered balls is called pool.  Snooker is a game played on a table with pockets using un-numbered, colored balls, and billiards refers to the game called carom billiards, which is played on a table without pockets.</p></div>		</li>
