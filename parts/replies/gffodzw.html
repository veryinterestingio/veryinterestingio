<p>some thought Pfizer hadn’t fully proven safety in the 16 and 17 year olds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this is because Pfizer's trial only (originally, as /u/iayork pointed out) included people 18 and older. Two years most likely won't make a lot of difference in terms of safety, but they haven't actually tested it yet. If I had a 16-year old kid I'd still want them to be vaccinated, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, they’re not likely to be in the high-priority groups at first, and by the time the vaccine is widely available some time next summer or fall, Pfizer should have more safety data for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why they were completely fine with the 18+ mark. If 16/17 YOs won't be getting it at first, then why not wait to recommend it for use in them once the data is in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>En masse, no. But it could be argued that 16 year olds with pre existing conditions belong in the same vaccine tier as 20 year olds with pre existing conditions, some of whom belong in an earlier tier. Although they are legally minors which affects clinical trial enrollment and consent, the immune system is mature and the virus considers them adults. Pfizer may have thought the safety data was strong enough to push the borderline group up and justify grouping them with young adults, not children.</p></div>		</li>
