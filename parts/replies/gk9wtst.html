			<div class="markdown"><p>The equation was decided when Bitcoin was proposed:</p>
<p>The network sets a difficulty level so that blocks are mined every ~10 minutes on average. That difficulty level is a number. The lower the number, the harder it is to find a solution. Why lower number for higher difficulty? Well...</p>
<p>The equation is a cryptographic hash function: SHA256. That sounds super complicated, but it's really not. A hash function is just a way to turn a string of data into a relatively small number. In the case of SHA256, no matter how big the input the output is always exactly 256 bits long. Cryptographic means there's no way to predict the output of a hash function, and any change to the input results in a completely different number being output.</p>
<p>The problem you have to solve to mine a block of bitcoin is simple in concept, but a lot of work: find a string of characters that outputs a number smaller than the current network difficulty level. That's it. Since the hash function is cryptographic, the only way to solve it is brute force: try different combinations until one works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm totally freestyling here, but as simply a I understand it, it's in the protocol, and the difficulty varies over time. Pretend it's like trying to figure out if a number is prime, or finding a key that unlocks a block. If you find a prime number / solve the key, congrats you get a prize</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the reason behind that is that if the equation wasn't meaningless then it would expose a vector of attack on the whole network. I don't understand all the details though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well since Bitcoin is open source, programmers from all over the world can contribute to the code. Then once they learn how it works they develop their own cool software. Also, Bitcoin is currency that you can send anywhere in the world AND it has the same value everywhere! </p>
<p>Random fact I found: <a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/" target="_blank">“536,916,338 bitcoins were moved in 2020. The exchange rate on 31 December 2020 was $29,013.39/BTC.”</a></p></div>		</li>
