			<div class="markdown"><p>The tuning system is called &quot;equal temperment&quot; and is used for tuning pianos. The idea is to make it equally bad at all keys instead of perfect for 1 key and unplayable for all others. If you listen closely while playing (mainly electric keyboard) pianos you can hear &quot;beats&quot; in the sound where it's slightly out of tune. A band or orchestra can hear those beats and automatically alter the pitch slightly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't it depend on the context (which key you're in) though?</p>
<p>Say you went up to a professional violinist and asked them to play a single note, Ab, with no context. Then ask them to play a G# with no context. Would they play different notes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>12-TET (aka equal temperament) is not perfect for any interval except an octave.  It's pretty good for fourths and fifths, but is imperfect for those, too.  You're correct that it isn't equally bad for all intervals, though.</p>
<p>12-TET sets each half step to be a ratio of 2^(1/12):1.  That means that a fourth is 2^(5/12):1, or 1.3348:1 (As opposed to 1.333...:1 which would be perfect).  A fifth is 2^(7/12):1, or 1.4983:1 (as opposed to 1.5:1 for perfect).  By comparison, a major third is 2^(4/12) = 1.2599:1 compared to the expected 1.25:1 or 1.265625:1 (i.e. 81:64), depending on whether you follow Pythagorean or 5-limit tuning.  The fourth and fifth were wrong by about 2 parts per thousand, while the third is wrong by about 5 times as much.</p>
<p>Since 2^(1/12) is irrational no interval can be a ratio of intervals except an octave--2^(12/12):1, which is just 2:1.  </p>
<p>The way that equal temperament is &quot;equally bad for everything&quot; is when it comes to different keys.  A tuning like Just Intonation would make perfect thirds, fourths, and fifths in one key, but then another key would have imperfect thirds, fourths, and fifths. This is why Baroque/Classical/Romantic composers were so keen on specifying different keys, as opposed to just doing everything in C major/A minor to avoid dealing with so many flats and sharps--a piece in E# would have a very different sound from one in Bb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right! I found a <a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/scales.html" target="_blank">chart</a> and major 5ths are only 0.44Hz away from the just tuning. Major 3rds are 2.6Hz away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting, but doesn't actually answer the OP.  In 'just intonation' (vs 'equal temperament' described by you) basically every note shifts slightly depending on the key you're in (G in C major is different from G in G major, for instance).  So, D# is different from Eb, but also, D# is different from D# depending on what key you're in.</p>
<p>For an ELI5 of why we use 'even temperament': all notes in a key are defined as their frequency ratio to the root note: a fifth (eg. C to G in C major) vibrates 1.5 times faster than root, an octave vibrates twice as fast).  Because of how math works, there's no way to have consistent fractions defined across every key.   But because of how physics and frequencies work, defining scales in this way sounds 'right' to our ears. So we have to either tune for each key (possible when singing, playing trombone) or just take the average and be a little off to our ears (piano, guitar).</p>
<p>That said, this context is useful to understand why a musician would want to know at a glance what key they're in (so they know to pitch up/down to be better in tune).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, a 'pure' perfect fifth has a ratio of 3:2 and an octave has a ratio of 2:1, and it's impossible to create 12 even steps within an octave using only those intervals (which is why you end up with wolf notes in pythagorean tuning). But the fifth you hear in even temperament  is not a pure perfect fifth, and it absolutely is possible to divide an octave into 12 even steps - just not in a way that would give you a pure perfect fifth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I've seen &quot;just vs equal&quot; temperament used to justify the difference between D# and Eb, but this doesn't really make sense, since as you point out, even &quot;G&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;G&quot; in just temperament (depending on the tonic), so it doesn't strike me as having anything to do with sharps vs flats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There is a famous modern microtonal piece that uses literally every single one of these perfect intervalls, which leads to like 60 different tones per octave, some seperated by only a few millimeters of string.</p></div>		</li>
