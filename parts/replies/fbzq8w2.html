			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in robotics. First time on Reddit, I've ever seen someone explains &quot;dies&quot;. People don't understand the importance of dies in their lives and how much of our world is built using dies. A Diesetter at my company makes 90k</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, I'm a bit slow. Would you mind explaining a number of things, since I have so many questions? What exactly is a 'die'? What is a wafer? How does one make 'dies' for a living? I too, would like to make 90k/year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The die is what the cpu is &quot;printed&quot; on. The wafer is a sheet of silicon containing multiple dies. By improving the design, you can set more dies per single wafer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CPUs are essentially printed on a very smooth sheet of silicon, the &quot;wafer&quot;, called that because it is round and has a wafer-like pattern when it's finished, just google an image. They're not <em>literally</em> printed, but superficially the process is similar. Once you have this large sheet of silicon with multiple CPU circuits printed on it ready, you cut it (or &quot;dice&quot; it, the word &quot;die&quot; means a result of &quot;dicing&quot; something) into small parts that are individual CPU &quot;dies&quot;, just like you would print a bunch of business cards and then cut them from a large single sheet of paper. They're not CPUs yet, they still need to be packaged, that is put into a protective casing and have all the external wires from pins or pads connected to the wires on the die.</p></div>		</li>
