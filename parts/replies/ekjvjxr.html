			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. Spores pass through the stomach and grow in the intestines where they produce toxin. Adults typically don’t get sick because we have a lot of other microbes in there that make it inhospitable. Young infants don’t have a fully developed microbiome so it’s like.. free game. Lots of space and nutrients. </p>
<p>Others have made odd claims so I’ll expand. Infants are treated with immunoglobulin (antibodies) produced from human volunteers. It’s called Baby BIG and it’s very safe. The bad news is it only mops up unbound toxin. Any toxin that has already bound at the muscle you basically have to wait for it to be done/regenerate the receptor. What that means is it can be a VERY long recovery. Frequently months on a ventilator, paralyzed. </p>
<p>Botulism can also be acquired through food, historically badly canned foods, especially low acid foods that come from the ground (beets, potatoes). In this case, the bacteria grew in the food and produced toxins and eating the toxins causes the illness. Treatment is called HBAT. It’s heptavalent botulinum antitoxin. That means it treats all seven known serotypes of toxin. </p>
<p>Type H is.. divisive. It is a combination of types A and F and can be neutralized by type A antitoxin. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonus fact:  you can also get wound botulism, where spore enter a wound, grow, and produce toxins. It’s very common in black tar heroine users in the United States. Drugs are bad, mmkay?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if you could help settle a debate.  Our family keeps an unrefrigerated squeeze bottle of 50/50 honey and maple syrup.  Does the additional water from the syrup mean we are risking botulism?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably depends on the content of the bottle but a quick google search shows that Maple syrup is still pretty low in water content</p>
<p>32.4 g
per 100 g</p>
<p>Where honey is
17.1 g
per 100 g</p>
<p>I'm no expert so I cannot tell if that seemingly small difference would allow for botulism but if it's a 50/50 mix than it's even smaller at 24.75 g of water per 100grams of mixture.</p>
<p>I don't know if 7g/100g difference will allow for botulism to grow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maple syrup doesn't have much water in it. Pop syurp concentrate (bag in box) is stored at room temperature as well.  </p>
<p>As long as no one is watering it down I would presume you would be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Refrigeration won’t matter for spore content. They probably can’t grow in honey OR syrup and reasonably healthy adults should be fine eating spores if they’re there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does not, botulinum would not sprout in the stomach but instead in the intestines where the acid has been neutralized by the gallbladder</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small point but the gallbladder doesn't neutralize acid. It just secretes bile, which aids in fat digestion. The Brunner's glands in the duodenum do more to raise the pH.</p></div>		</li>
