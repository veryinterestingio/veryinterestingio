			<div class="markdown"><p>LPT: if you don't have the correct bit to open something, sometimes you can achieve success by melting the end of a hard plastic pen. One of those clear plastic ones that hardly flex, specifically. Melt it until it is gooey, and then press it into the hole, then wait till it rehardens. Sometimes this results in a usable makeshift bit. Obviously use this method at your own risk, and at the risk of your electronics. I opened various game controllers and portable game systems this way back in the day though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Basically only useful when working with electronics as the screws aren't torqued down hard and the threadlock isn't too skookum.</p>
<p>If the fastener isn't too funky you can try breaking off the security knob or just modifying a screwdriver to be &quot;good enough&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope 😃 probably only viable if the screws aren't over torqued.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Use caution, of course, getting melted plastic on your hand would be seriously unpleasant, and plastic vapor is best left outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idiot-proofing's a bit legit, though.  If someone can't get their hands on a (more common) hex/security bit for the case, they probably don't have any business messing with the internals.  I didn't do IT for too long, but long enough to wish retail/big-box laptops were a bit harder to open for know-it-alls...no, that's the monitor wire, not &quot;assembly tape.&quot;  I'm very proud of you for counting the pins, but it's not enough for the RAM to simply fit in the slot.  Yes, now you're going to need a replacement part [yes, I could probably repair it, for thrice the cost in labor].)</p>
<p>[If you're reading this thread, you probably aren't the idiot who snipped his laptop lcd ribbon that had backed out of its connector while looking for the &quot;<em>wire</em> wire&quot; that connected the mobo to the screen, then came in with the thing 2/3 apart, made lucky-me take a look right away, then spent 20 minutes heatedly trying to convince me to just &quot;thread 'em back together&quot; when I tried to tell him I needed to order a part that was like $25 after shipping that wouldn't be in for a few business days (or double that for overnight, which just annoyed him more).  Yeah, sure, I'm going to spend for-ever x-actoing a ribbon apart to roll the dice on a jerry-rigged splice you're just going to bring back in two weeks when it wiggles a tiny bit out of place again.  I was bottom-tier in an indy shop, wasn't getting paid any manner of commission (aside from a couple nice, clicky, Model M keyboards they let me have as a parting gift), and I had a pile of other machines to do routine image/dusting/components/ram/antivirus/whatever on.  Sorry, Mac, go google the procedure yourself if you don't like it; it isn't rocket science.  Spend three hours doing it your way, and smile with pride each time you have to percussive-maintenance your StinkPad into usability again.]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't stand it when people think they know how to fix something and then come to me all confused about how they broke it. Just accept that you don't know how, and either hire someone who does, or take a class/read a book. Seems like you deal with the same thing I do lmao</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YES. They just raised the cost of the phone, make scratches look worse, make the phone slide out of your hand easier, and prevent wireless charging. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only quit using mine because the power button kept getting stuck and making the phone go into a reboot loops. I had the same problem with my Galaxy S2. The screen was super easy to scratch though and I had to use a protective sticker on it. My new moto4 seems like it has the nigh unstratchable glass that the S2 had.</p></div>		</li>
