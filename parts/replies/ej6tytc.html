			<div class="markdown"><p>We grew up with dialup until over halfway through my teens. I remember becoming so familiar with my ISPs' handshakes that I could approximate my ping, connection stability, and overall speed by hearing anything &quot;off&quot; about it (and therefore choose whether or not to use an alternate connection number). I was never trained to know what any of the sounds meant, but you certainly do get a feel for it.</p></div>		</li>
