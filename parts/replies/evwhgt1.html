<p>Will an implanted lens be perfect or will it be a whole new spin on the wheel of ocular suck? (Oh please oh please)</p>
<p>Comparatively speaking, how lengthy, easy and safe is the procedure normally?  </p>
<p>What's the odds that an implanted lens will need a re-do?</p>
<p>Can it get Bluetooth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically a plastic lens. They fold it up like a burrito and squirt it through a tiny incision after they diced up and sucked out your old lens. </p>
<p>Lens don't typically bend much unless you have a multifocal but those have various degrees of success. </p>
<p>Surgery is safe and routine.</p>
<p>You may need a redo if it becomes dislodged etc or it gets cloudy.</p>
<p>Electronics is not really possible yet because one it's tiny as shit, and to fit it into your eye it has to fold up like a burrito.</p></div>		</li>
