<p>Also you could cheat with pointing Zapper to the source of light like lamp and you'd always hit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That trick worked for some games, but my understanding was that Duck Hunt wasn't one of them - that was the reason for the screen going all black for a frame before showing the target box. If the gun was still detecting light during the black frame, it wouldn't register the hit on the following frame(s).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1/60th of a second. Early-gen consoles didn't output a proper signal composed of interlaced odd and even fields, instead they just pumped out repeated odd (or even) fields, for essentially a 240p image at 60 or 50 Hz. That's why scanlines were so noticeable on those old games, because half of each frame's fields were missing.</p></div>		</li>
