			<div class="markdown"><p>new dentist here. didnt have to do a gold crown in school (most people dont want them because of aesthetics), but we were taught gold is the &quot;gold standard&quot;. i get so excited when i see older patients with them because i know they are the best. you remove less tooth structure (less trauma to the tooth), and they last a lonnngg time!</p></div>		</li>
