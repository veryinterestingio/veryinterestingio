			<div class="markdown"><p>In principle it can also get time from GPS, because GPS doesn't just tell you where you are, it tells you <em>when</em> you are. Getting the current time extremely precisely is a common use-case for GPS: <a href="https://www.gps.gov/applications/timing/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.gps.gov/applications/timing/" target="_blank">https://www.gps.gov/applications/timing/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to derail this, but I had a phone that would spontaneously skip about 5 or 6 hours. It was just suddenly the wrong time. Didn't matter if I had GPS on or not. The only way to fix it was to turn it on airplane mode and then back onto the network, even though it got the wrong time while I was on the network. How and why might this happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Occasionally there will be cell towers that broadcast the wrong time. It happened to me and another friend who also worked in IT support whenever we were in a very specific place. It sucked. You're probably forcing the phone to switch cell towers to update time. </p></div>		</li>
