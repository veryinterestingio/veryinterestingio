<p>It contains a thorough discussion of the questions you ask. Yes, I do think that there are multiple levels, or rather different meanings to the folk-psychological term of &quot;consciousness&quot;. We distinguish at least two, and suggest that none of them are impossible to implement in machines. Here is a short excerpt from the paper:</p>
<p>&quot; We suggest that it is useful to distinguish two (...) essential dimensions of conscious computation. We label them using the terms global availability (C1) and self-monitoring (C2). </p>
<p>· <strong>C1: Global availability.</strong> This corresponds to the transitive meaning of consciousness (as in “The driver is conscious <em>of</em> the light”). It refers to the relationship between a cognitive system and a specific object of thought, such as a mental representation of “the light”. This object appears to be selected for further processing, including verbal and non-verbal report. Information which is conscious in this sense becomes globally available to the organism: we can recall it, act upon it, speak about it, etc. This sense is synonymous with “having the information in mind” : among the vast repertoire of thoughts that can become conscious at a given time, only that which is globally available constitutes the content of C1-consciousness.</p>
<p>· <strong>C2: Self-monitoring.</strong> Another meaning of consciousness is reflexive. It refers to a self-referential relationship in which the cognitive system is able to monitor its own processing and obtain information about itself. Human beings know a lot about themselves, including such diverse information as the layout and position of their body, whether they know or perceive something, or whether they just made an error. This sense of consciousness corresponds to what is commonly called introspection, or what psychologists call “meta-cognition” -- the ability to conceive and make use of internal representations of one’s own knowledge and abilities.</p>
<p>We propose that C1 and C2 constitute orthogonal dimensions of conscious computations.</p></div>		</li>
