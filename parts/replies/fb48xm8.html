			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens with firearms and politicians all the time. I remember when everyone was posting pictures of their destroyed guns as part of a firearms campaign. One politician woman posted a video of her taking an angle grinder to her barrel and cut it down. This made the rifle a short barreled rifle, which is a class of firearm that an owner must pay extra taxes on, go through a 6-12 month background check process, and cannot move the firearm across state lines without notifying the correct federal agency. Penalties for these manufacturing violations are 10 years in prison and then $10k or $100k (don't remember).
She didn't even get looked at, while other citizens doing similar stuff get taken to court or confiscated, even if they didn't know the law either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possessing anything harmful or illegal can technically do no harm. But one can also argue your intentions, and what if that thing got in the wrong hands. Like if you buy liquor but it sits in your fridge, it did no harm but it can if it falls in the hands of a minor. Where you can then be charged with buying alcohol for a minor. Prosecutors typically seek to find a motive or intent associated. For example one can own a set of lock picks in their home, but if you're arrested in the street with lock picks they can tie it to a motive and even if you plead the fifth. They can &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; so to say, and tie you to attempted illegal activity. Like you can carry a hunting bow, destrung and or broken down or packed away, or you can draw an arrow on a strung bow in the public street and get arrested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically what we're saying is &quot;we understand there are two sets of laws, one for the 'desirable' and 'upper' sets of society, and the actual law for everyone else.</p></div>		</li>
