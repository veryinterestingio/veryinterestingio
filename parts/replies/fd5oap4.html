			<div class="markdown"><p>Frozen wasabi wont be tom closeto what the taste should be.</p>
<p>Wasabi must be fresh..once u prepare it, I have heard that in a few minutes it already looses some of its flavor and the kick.</p>
<p>That is why there are literally no wasabi paste, or products that can be stored, as is haening with the dyed horseradish. The reason is that the taste doesnt last</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the wasabi is paste like and smooth, chances are it's commercially available horseradish dyed green.</p>
<p>Real wasabi is very expensive and must be grounded fresh and consumed within 15 minutes, otherwise it loses its flavor and becomes no good. (Some grounded wasabi is available in tubes, I guess they have added stabilisers but still they're expensive.)</p>
<p>Fresh wasabi is grounded on shark skin grater, and a good fresh wasabi should look a bit lumpy, and tastes fresh.</p></div>		</li>
