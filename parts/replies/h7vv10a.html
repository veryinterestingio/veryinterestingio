			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, all the gas stations near me do the opposite. Credit gets a $1.00 basic approval, and then the money comes out later. Debit means I get $100 taken out and then a day later it drops to the actual amount.</p>
<p>I used to always use credit when I was poor because sometimes I needed to get gas a day or two before my paycheck and it was nice to only get a $1 hit to my account. If I only had $25 in my account and needed gas and food a day before I got paid, I could buy $100 of gas on the $1 amount, get dinner, then in two days when my account had money the credit gas transaction would finally post when I could afford it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I was in the same situation - cash poor - at the time.  I had about $140 in my bank account at the time.  I took my son to school, stopped for gas and then was going to go get some food to tide us over.  I had to budget to the PENNY in that situation....Imagine my surprise when I get to the grocery store, and my card gets declined...even though I *know* I had $100 on there.  I called the bank...they told me that the gas station had put a credit hold on it, and &quot;next time run it as debit&quot;. And &quot;don't worry, you'll get it back....&quot;.   So we had to wait a few days for groceries.  Yeah. Fun times.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried that once recently because I've done it before and it always did a dollar then pulled the rest out later. Well this last time the pump stopped on the exact cent that was in my bank account dropping me to $0 immediately. I thought it was some sort of witchcraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a banking customer support call center and it was the opposite problem my customers encountered. The debit card purchases were putting $125 on hold and yes the transaction should ideally be processed for the correct amount immediately but sometimes it would take the gas station hours to process it for the correct amount. </p>
<p>I never encountered a similar problem with a credit card personally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called pre-authorization and should be done in times when at the time of paying the exact amount you will be paying is not known. For instance in Europe if you go to selfservice gas pump you first choose how much gas you need, amount gets pre-authorized to assure you have enough funds to pay for it, then you are allowed to get the gas you are pre-authorized for. After you are done the exact amount of money gets charged. If someone is using pre-authorization for transaction when the price is already known I would say it's not a best practice.</p></div>		</li>
