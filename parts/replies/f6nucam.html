<p>Isn't <em>every</em> use of the phone (or, really, any modern electronics) relying on the circuitry not to fail?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but this is a digital switch (so a relatively sensitive circuit) that has the largest current in the phone running through it. It's also the first circuit to be hit if your cheap Chinese charger running without a surge protector happens to go kamikaze, while the rest of the phone is powered directly from the battery, normally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except for the radios, your entire phone is little more than a complex collection of digital switches (transistors). Even the radios contain a lot of digital circuitry.</p>
<p>That said, you're correct that the points of contact to the outside world, including the charging port, are potential entry points for lethal currents. That's why well designed electronics have protection circuits on those entry points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's generally how the controllers work.  They can also profile the battery based on charging history and chemistry as the battery degrades over time.  It's still not completely accurate, but it's usually pretty close.  Battery voltage can be used to estimate charge levels, but it's far less accurate and non-linear.  It's more useful for warning levels than percentage of charge.  Your phone would be using a coulomb counter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So to be clear, if you took the battery out and plugged it into USB power those phones would power up and work?</p>
<p>I know that wasn't the case with some of my older phones that had removable batteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of the charging circuit.... the wall power is connected to the component which charges the battery, and doesn't power the phone directly. They could switch to direct power with additional circuitry, but that costs money and takes up space, without much benefit.</p></div>		</li>
