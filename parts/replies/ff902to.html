			<div class="markdown"><p>When storing information in your computer, it's like packing objects. You need to chose the size of the boxes beforehand.</p>
<p>So if the user suddenly says &quot;now, the object you need to pack are twice as big&quot;, you will need bigger boxes to pack them.</p>
<p>Well, more precisely, the easiest solution is to use bigger boxes. Hence starting the packing from the start.</p>
<p>You could also use &quot;boxes that change size when needed&quot;, but those boxes are more slow to use, and each time you're searching objects inside it, you're losing some time.</p>
<p>You could also try to be very clever and you have organised your objects in such a way that you only need to switch one or two boxes for bigger boxes and keep all the other old boxes.</p>
<p>There is no &quot;that kind of game is a pizza and that kind of game is a soup&quot;. It depends on how the developers decided to organise their objects in their boxes.</p>
<p>(And I'm not even talking about all the complexity that come from the &quot;cache&quot;. The cache is someone which is paid to go search in boxes what you need. But he is clever and when you start asking often for the same object, it makes a copy of it and put it in his desk, so it will be much faster the next time you ask for it. And the cache is something so central for programs to run fast that you cannot not use it. But it means everytime you're trying to do something clever with your boxes, you have to make sure it is compatible with the way the cache works.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want a non-analogy answer (that isn't quite ELI5) the graphics frameworks that most games use, OpenGL or DirectX, need to have certain things declared before the window they are displayed in is created. If you want to change these things once the window is already created, you need to destroy the window and then create it again. Some developers go to the extra trouble to implement this (which is why the screen will go black momentarily when you change some settings), but others opt to instead force  the user to restart and create the new window that way. It is easy to have oversights employing the first method (you need to recreate the window in the middle of gameplay which is obviously more difficult for a programmer to implement), so it's a 'safer' to just make them restart the program from scratch and go through the entire standard setup process again from the beginning with the new settings they selected.</p>
<p>This is also why some games (e.g. Skyrim) have a separate window that comes up where you can select display settings before  you begin the actual game window.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One reason can simply be at what point in the process the code reads from the settings.</p>
<p>Let's say you had a menu in a program like Excel, every tab has File=&gt;New, File=&gt;Save As, all those generic ones. If this stuff never changes, we can do it once on startup and reuse the menu over and over again. Beautiful. It's like a pizza that never changes, no customer can make any changes, we can just build it.</p>
<p>Now, let's say the next menu list is &quot;Actions&quot;, and what menu items are inside &quot;Actions&quot; changes. If you're drawing a chart, &quot;Actions&quot; is about adding and manipulating data points. If you're on a tab changing margins of your page, &quot;Actions&quot; is full of menu options like &quot;Set Page Layout&quot;. This complicates it a bit, because now the menu is different depending on what page you're on. You can't create it once on startup and reuse over and over, we're going to have to do it differently (say, every time you change tabs we reload the menu, or upon creation, we create all the menu's and swap between them when you change tabs).</p>
<p>That &quot;Actions&quot; scenario is what user settings do to the code. On launch a game will see its screen resolution is 1080x720, render for that, and its good to go. Players change the screen resolution, and now we need to handle that change. Maybe all it takes is telling the rendering code &quot;Re-render&quot; and that's it, or maybe we have to rebuild all menu items because there's logic in menu building saying fancy things like &quot;If we have less than 800px of width split something into more sub-menu items&quot;. Changing whether shadows are on or not could be as simple as &quot;Re-render&quot;, or it can be as complicated as &quot;Reload all the sprites for the entire game cause we made a lot of assumptions about what graphics to save loading time when we thought shadows were off&quot;. Maybe changing a username is just changing what text gets rendered, or maybe the game created a .png image for your name that now has to be rebuilt and rewired, which a hard reset is the only way to do because it wasnt well designed.</p>
<p>Really, the reason it might be built like a soup or pizza comes down to how often we think things will change, and how much effort was put in in the early stages of development to prepare for changes. It's best when everything is dynamic, loading as needed, automatically updating when you change terms. But sometimes you built something assuming it will never change (i.e. screen resolutions we can usually rely on will not change mid-session), and then in the future players/managers request features/settings be put in that seem obvious to a user (&quot;Of course I can change my screen resolution, shadows, anti-aliasing, which graphics card I'm using, whether I'm fullscreen or borderless, EVERYTHING can be changed mid fight!&quot;) but wasn't obvious to the developers months earlier (&quot;Players set up their preferences once, and maybe tweak it between games. No one would be tweaking the settings mid fight lol&quot;), and you run into that Pizza &quot;What do you mean you're making it a large? It was a medium!&quot; scenario</p></div>		</li>
