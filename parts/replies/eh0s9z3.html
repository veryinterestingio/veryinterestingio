			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard the resonance argument before, but as far as I know the long-wavelength (&quot;red&quot;) cones don't have a second peak. No second peak is visible in <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cones_SMJ2_E.svg" target="_blank">this diagram</a> which is a plot of experimental data.</p>
<p>I have seen peaks in <a href="https://midimagic.sgc-hosting.com/eyespect.jpg" target="_blank">similar diagrams</a>, but that one looks hand drawn and I think it's probably a mistake.</p>
<p>Many people get confused because they think the cones detect RGB, and violet has red in it, so there must be a second peak. In reality there's a lot of complicated processing between the cone outputs and the RYGB primaries. Primary blue is pretty much exactly the hue of a blue sky. I don't see what evolutionary benefit there would be to seeing the sky as a primary color, but it probably isn't coincidence that we do. If that's what sets the &quot;blue point,&quot; then as a side effect the end of the spectrum will continue past that point toward red.</p></div>		</li>
