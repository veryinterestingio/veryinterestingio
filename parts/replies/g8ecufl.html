			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate that squeaky clean feeling. And I find that using soap like Irish Spring always gives me this. Instead, I‚Äôve been using Dove body soap when I clean my body and it‚Äôs been the best thing ever. Super smooth and no grippy/squeaky feeling. Try it out!</p></div>		</li>

<p>DO NOT use the softness of Dove soap for self pleasure. You will molt like a lizzard after a few days of painful tenderness.</p>
<p>Also, yes, I did üòë</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mom loves Irish spring and won‚Äôt use anything else. I can see the appeal. In actuality, I used to love Irish spring and hate dove bc I felt that whenever I used dove, it felt like forever for the water to wash away that slippery feeling. But now it‚Äôs so worth it. Esp during the humid months (I live in the northeast)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real solution to this problem is to get a water softener. Some areas (like my area) have ‚Äúhard water‚Äù, which just means it has lots of dissolved minerals. Minerals cause soap to create scum, which causes the squeaky feeling. Different soaps have different levels of softening agents, which can change how squeaky or smooth they feel. But let me tell you - once I got a water softener for my house, every shower and every soap feels extra smooth and silky. And I no longer get scum building up on my shower door. Highly recommended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer.  My well water is 500ppm dissolved calcium. Waaaay hard.  Without a softener dishes don‚Äôt get clean, glasses have a film on them and whites in the laundry get grayish over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something that always confuses me. Where I live in Texas, the water I guess is fairly &quot;hard&quot;. But I'm used to it. When I go home for the holidays, my parents have a water softener. When I shower, I feel like it takes way longer because the soap never &quot;comes off&quot;. I never feel like I'm fully clean, because it feels like I never got the soap off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I purchased a water purifier/softener from this company that taught me this year about this grippy feeling. The chemicals from the hard water is causing the soap to strip the body of it's natural oils. That is why you are getting this grippy feeling. All the oils been stripped. Now we've gotten the whole house a water solution and no more feeling with any soap used. Also, it requires less soap or detergents to be used because the water bonds better with the chemicals in the cleaning items.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely depends on skin type. Many prefer the gripy feeling and have no skin troubles so why would they not continue using cheaper bar soap</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! 100% right. Skin is super resilient on the whole. If you‚Äôre not having problems there really is nothing to worry about. The soap is diluted and contacts skin for a short time. If you like the grippy feel and don‚Äôt feel tight or itchy, your skin is taking care of itself and rebalancing naturally.</p></div>		</li>
