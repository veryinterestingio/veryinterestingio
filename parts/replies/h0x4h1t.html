			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. One of the biggest independent news stations in my area broadcasted to channel 3, so we always had to use 4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in the late 90s/early 00s, so maybe my experience doesn't apply here, but I remember it playing on 3 anyways. WB was on channel 3 in my area, but I could hook the PS1 up to the back of the tv with the component cables and if I pressed power it would change to the game instead of WB. I was young so I might be misremembering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, my area had channels on 3 and 4, and the NES would just play over channel 4 when I'd turn it on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes perfect sense.  Grew up in Cleveland and Channel 3 was our NBC station.  That's why to play NES we had to set it to Channel 4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the device &quot;emits&quot; its signal into a cable, not an antenna, a co-channel signal is not really a problem. If your cables weren't well shielded etc. the over-the-air signal might interfere with the device's signal in your TV set, giving you a less-than-ideal picture.</p>
<p>Because older TV sets had poor tuning selectivity, most areas were not assigned adjacent channels, specially in the low-VHF range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’d be sharing the frequency with the tv station and neither would be clear. </p>
<p>It wasn’t that you were being illegal by transmitting over station 3 or 4, it’s just that those stations were the most commonly unused ones.</p></div>		</li>
