			<div class="markdown"><p>TL, DR: Trauma can cause your brain to shake, causing inflammation, which can restrict blood flow in the small space your skull has for your brain. Decreased blood flow means less oxygen and your brain can't function as normal, leading to loss of consciousness. If you black out as a result of injury to the head, it is likely a very serious injury, unlike what TV/movies might suggest.</p>
<p>Good post, btw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s close and a good explanation. However, it’s not the swelling that cases a loss in consciousness immediately after head trauma. The swelling actually takes a little while to kick in. Like when you whack a finger or toe, it takes a while to swell up. Same thing in the brain. The loss of consciousness (as opposed to the post traumatic amnesia, which you did an excellent job of distinguishing) is usually from shearing of the axons somewhere in the brain. The forces applied to the mobile brain within the fixed skull cause those long axons to shear, usually in the corona radiata but occasionally in the reticular activating system or corpus callosum which causes the loss in consciousness. </p>
<p>And I just realized I did not explain this like I’m 5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, there are things that can be done to protect the soft core inside the box. Think all the things we've done to make high speed car crashes survivable, or it we want to talk brains, the way a woodpecker's skull is put together to protect them from giving themselves concussions every time they beat their face against a tree (tight skull so no room to slosh, wrap around shock absorber tongue, spongy bone; nature is weird). But yeah somehow they never mention airbags, seatbelts and crumple zones in the iron man movies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In engineering, they say the more moving parts, the more chances you have at breaking down/bugs in the system. </p>
<p>In biology you can reference football players getting concussions even while wearing a helmet. </p>
<p>In car crashes, there are so many things that can go wrong even with the safety features. Traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, paralysis, back injuries, burns, internal injuries, fractures and broken bones, disfigured face, scars, limb loss and amputation, neck and whiplash, compartment syndrome, blacking out, getting crushed/trapped inside the vehicle, losing any one of your senses. </p>

<p>About the woodpecker, they sustain brain damage every time they peck wood. It’s just that they’ve done it so much, that they’ve adapted to it by a protein buildup that would normally signify brain damage in people.</p>
<p>“The distinction is clear. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.”</p>

<p>It’s the sudden increase/decrease in acceleration and changes in pressure that causes blackouts in jet fighter pilots. The speeds will prevent proper blood flow. There is a special suit created, called the G-suit, that can fix circulation during sharp increases/decreases in speed.</p>
