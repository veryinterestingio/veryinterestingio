Python on the other hand is very slow, interpreted but very easy to learn. It's impossible to make a language that fullfills all the needs because usually making a language that is easy to work with comes with drawbacks. So generally different applications call for different languages.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>In addition, making a program nominally &quot;harder&quot; to work with will slow adoption but can often reduce error rates. For example, Golang requires explicit casting of data types. This makes the compiler faster and reduces bugs (because people definitely intended to truncate their int64 to an int32), but makes typing it harder. Declarative db schemas slow down engineers spinning up and iterating on a database, but gives later engineers who come onto the project clear visibility into the database. </p>
<p>Companies optimizing for speed of execution (of their engineers) often prize languages that have flexibility until the point at which that flexibility becomes a liability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So itâ€™s (general) scale of speed to ease.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning that some languages are created for a specific task or operation.
So while they can be relatively easy to use and are fast, they are restricted in their functionality</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any programming language that is &quot;Turing complete&quot; is &quot;universal&quot; in the sense that such a language can compute any computable function.  It follows that any such Turing complete language is equally as powerful as any other language. Most programming languages are Turing complete, so we already have plenty of &quot;universal&quot; languages in the sense of computability.</p>
<p>In practice, most programming languages are not designed to be universal, they're designed to be effective tools for specific tasks. For example, the C programming language was designed to write operating systems, and it has been very successful in that domain and in similar low-level systems tasks.  In contrast, there are plenty of business-oriented programming languages for writing standard business software, such as Java or C#.</p>
<p>One of the key things a programming language does is constrain the kinds of things programmers can do, in order to coerce them into writing effective code. You don't want to give the programmer the ability to do anything: you want to make it easy to do the &quot;right&quot; thing and hard to the &quot;wrong&quot; thing, where right and wrong are defined by the use cases your programming language intends to support.</p></div>		</li>
