<p>Also, no, devices that use rotary encoders do not track the position of the &quot;wheel&quot; (or disc, knob, marble, trackball, etc.). They can't, and they don't care. All the software cares about is which direction it's turning and how fast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's very false.</p>
<p>You can get two types of rotary encoders, ones that report &quot;it moved this way or that way&quot; and ones that report current absolute position.</p>
<p>See here for how the absolute position versions work: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder#/media/File:Encoder_disc_(3-Bit_binary).svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder#/media/File:Encoder_disc_(3-Bit_binary).svg</a></p></div>		</li>
