<p>If all bats scream louder than any sound coming back, wouldn't they be unable to see anything (everything is wall).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im definitely no expert but I’d like to weigh in on this. Perhaps since bat echolocation relies on the sounds and timings. Wouldn’t the best analogy be: People in a  loud restaurant all talking, some louder than others. Since we are all used to the loud commotion of being in a loud restaurant we can still talk and hear others, usually as long as they remain close to us. </p>
<p>Piggybacking off of what u/Seaworthiness-Any said, since the bats have evolved to adapt this extra noise when in groups; I’m sure they understand what’s going on and won’t get confused when in large groups?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That still leaves the question, if a bat a foot over screeches and the bat next to it hears it come back, how does the bat next to it not get confused?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we wanna use light, then we'd compare it to trying to see the reflective light in the room reaching the eye, and someone else pointing a flashlight right into my eye. In that case the flashlight would drown out the room light. </p>
<p>If the same applies to bats then there is some interference</p></div>		</li>

<p>But light is doing the same thing, isn't it? It's bouncing off of the objects that we see. If it were (instead of flashlights) a bunch of people walking around with strobe lights, it still wouldn't get worse with more strobes (assuming we were used to navigating via strobe light in the first place).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't quite fit.  With echolocation, I make a sound, and then the echo lets me know if food or an obstacle is in front of me.  Any other sound/echo is useless to me, and would perhaps give me false/bad information.  </p>
<p>With flashlights, your light is good to help you see.  Any other flashlight around just adds more useful and non-conflicting information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure about that? Echolocation uses sound waves at a specific frequency to bounce off objects in order to see what that object is, other sound at the same frequency would not be useless at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't just hear stuff bouncing off things and know their distance. This is because you don't know if something is loud or very close. </p>
<p>You need to know when the wave starts in order to know how long it takes to return, or the difference in volumes from start to finish. </p>
<p>I'm a nutshell, the returned information, the echo, is useless unless you can compare it to the initial source.</p></div>		</li>
