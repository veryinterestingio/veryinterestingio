			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to point out - it would still be our brains causing the movement, just the non-conscious parts.</p>
<p>But I have seen support for the idea that our conscious minds are creating narratives for actions that they have no control over. Very interesting to think about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most people have trouble picturing what the latter even means, but science sure points in that direction (i.e. your brain claimed you decided to run because of that danger that scared you, when your brain reacted to some stimulus immediately and filled in the reason later).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense and is FASCINATING. Humans really have ascribed so much importance to the idea of choice and experience, but ignoring the millions of years of activity which led to that moment. Right now, what weâ€™re doing is the culmination of all evolution before us</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People fail to realize that we have two brains.  A thinkin brain and a doin brain.</p>
<p>Now the doin brain keeps your heart pumpin and yer belly digestin while yer thinkin brain does all the computin, and fer the most part theys gets along just fine.</p>
<p>But the doin brain dont quite trust the thinkin brain, so when a car comes outa nowhere or yer wife drops a glass n'ya grab it, thats the doin brain.   Now some even says ya can shut off the thinkin brain all together, and just let the doin brain go on autopilot, n'ya can, truckers do it all the time.</p>
<p>Best is easiest to just let the doin brain do and the thinkin brain dont.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What gets really interesting is when you study damaged brains.</p>
<p>One might think when the emotional part gets damaged and all that's left of the conscious brain is the deliberative part, you get Spock. What really happens is the person gets stuck and can't &quot;decide&quot; anything. </p>
<p>(Nothing can be fully quantified, so the deliberative part relies on the emotional part jumping in to tilt the conclusion in the direction of whatever your underlying bias is.)</p></div>		</li>
