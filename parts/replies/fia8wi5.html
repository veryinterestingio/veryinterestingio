			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if you can say anything about the exact paths the photons travelled, just that they arrived with similar final vectors. The extremely distant star will appear in a certain location, but that doesn't mean the light originated there. Gravitational lensing prevents truly straight paths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it is probably safe to assume traveling through the depths of space outside of significant influence of gravity they would still be subjected to the same forces expanding the universe, so the essence and validity of the question and response are both still intact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends whether OP meant meters between the parallel tracks or parsecs.  We don't operate in perfect euclidean space.  And to me, &quot;eventually&quot; in the physics context means as it approaches infinity.  A tiny infinitesimal nudge will have an effect given a large amount of time.  There is curvature to be measured, even if it comes from dark matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;So if the expansion of space over those billions of years has pushed them apart, it hasn't pushed them apart by much.&quot; is that taken into consideration by astronomers right now? like when they calculate the size of distant galaxies, even a small shift could have big consequences, maybe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number you're asking for is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations#Density_parameter" target="_blank">density parameter</a>, the mass-energy of the universe in terms of the critical mass-energy needed for a perfectly flat universe. Planck 2015 measured it as O_k = 0.000 +/- 0.005 (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01589" target="_blank">this paper</a> for their analysis).</p>
<p>Within measurable error with our best devices the universe is flat.  </p>
