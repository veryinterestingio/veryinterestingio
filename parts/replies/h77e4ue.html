<p>Don't even need to spend $1 million on some random art..... just have Junior spend 2 days in the garage with a chainsaw, 3 cans of paint, and a dildo..... boom, art. Go and collect $10 million.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly while it's fun to shit on the rich this usually has a lot less to do with money laundering than the fact that most people had some interest in art,  but worried they would eventually need money to survive so they abandoned the idea,  if your family is rich you can say fuck it im going to be an artist and if it takes decades and my failed projects cost thousands of dollars of learning experiences that's fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. With the added spice of, if your family is rich, you might not know if your art is really good or someone is buying access.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that just describes a sneaky way to pay someone not money laundering. As I understand it, money laundering is taking dirty money, performing some transactions and receiving that amount of money back. How that's accomplished is the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because art and real estate are both worth basically whatever someone will pay for it. So both are great for money laundering.</p>
<p>Need to launder or move a million dollars? Sell a painting for a million dollars. Rich guy &quot;buys&quot; the painting, but really you just give him the painting and the cash. In return, you get legal, taxable money with a paper trail. He gets the cash plus a fee. Now he has the painting and a over a million bucks in cash that doesn't exist in government records. Lather rinse repeat. That's one way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What it if buy a painting for $10m and write a check for $1m and give $9m cash. The seller claims the $1m for tax purposes and doesn't claim the cash.  </p>
<p>Later I sell the painting for $10m. Pay tax on the $9m profit and now the money is clean.  </p>
<p>If you want to launder money you would use a cash business. Like a restaurant or bar. Add in extra cash each day for fake orders. Pay the tax on it as income and then it is clean.  </p>
<p>This is not foolproof as forensic accountants can figure things out. If you charge x per seating at a restaurant on average and you can turn over y tables a day then you have an upper limit of what amount would be reasonable. If your restaurant could make $10k and day and you try to launder $100k a day you would get caught.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus inventory has to balance.</p>
<p>If your sales receipts show 100 burgers but your invoices show, for example, 70 buns, this can also trip you up.</p>
<p>This is where a service-based business might be better than goods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is does is legitimize the $11 million transaction. You have documentation of where you got the $11 million: it was payment for your painting. Mr. Burns has documentation of where his $11 million went: he bought your painting. The fact that the painting came with pounds of cocaine as a “free gift” is conveniently left off of the books. $10 million of the $11 million was originally dirty money because it was part of a transaction to purchase something illegal. Now both the cocaine buyer and seller have a legal explanation for the $10 million: payment for the painting. </p>
<p>I think you’re confused because both the buyer and seller are involved here. For a small-scale drug dealer, their customers don’t need to explain where their $20 in cash went, but the dealer needs to explain the thousands of dollars of cash they now have. So, they can launder that drug money by saying it was income from some legitimate cash-based business.</p></div>		</li>
