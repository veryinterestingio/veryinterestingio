			<div class="markdown"><p>Same in Poland. The new variant is more efficient at reproducing and infecting new people, but it will only outcompete the old if it triggers the immune system for both. If not, and that is the worst case scenario, they will not trigger the immune system towards each other and we will effectively end up with two diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even so, it's worth vaccinating against the old strains. Viruses must replicate to mutate, and they can't replicate without a host. Every human that has not been vaccinated against the old strains is a potential host and therefore a potential mutation factory.</p></div>		</li>
