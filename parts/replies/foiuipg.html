			<div class="markdown"><p>Frequency Modulated = FM. The usual radio wave, just with a tiny extra riding along, just like an old modem. (MoDem = modulator/demodulator). If your radio has the ‚Äúdemodulator‚Äù capability, great. If not, you‚Äôre none the wiser about the signal piggybacking on your song.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy fucking shit. I've been working with Modems since I was 7 years old and my dad and I broke one just to fix it, and today is the first day that I know what modem stands for and I'm sat here mind blown. I was not ready to start my Saturday like this. I had literally zero clue that modem was shorthand for something, I thought it was just a word.</p>
<p>I don't know whether I should say thank you for giving me new information or fuck you for blowing my tiny mind before the coffee has kicked in, so have an upvote and some gold.</p></div>		</li>

Old enough to have used a modem.<br />
Have taken plenty of tech-related classes where history of parts is taught.<br />
A+ certified.<br />
And until about 30 seconds ago, I had no idea that's what modem stood for.  </p>
<p>Thanks for teaching me something new today, friend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find that funny how so many people didn't know that. I mean, it's not wrong or anything. But whenever I read any article about modems back then, or reviewing at least a few if them, or some tutorial about setups, every fuckin time it had to be spelled out what it stands for.</p>
<p>It's how trekkie youtubers can't say &quot;Kirk of Enterprise&quot; but always have to go &quot;James Tiberius Kirk, USS Enterprise NCC-1701&quot; (I think) when introducing a topic, gaming channel can't say NES without spelling it out, science articles have to spell what laser means, and so on and so on.</p></div>		</li>
