			<div class="markdown"><p>That goes way beyond ELI5. Essentially, the stuff that makes up walls only interacts with a limited range of electromagnetic waves. Radio waves are too low frequency to interact and gamma and X rays are too high frequency. The exact reasons for this involve electron energy levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry misread your point. Higher energy sources light X rays and gamma rays have high penetrating power due to high energy levels of the photons themselves. Edit: a lower energy source will interact more readily with whatever atoms it is passing by as it moves through a material.</p></div>		</li>
