			<div class="markdown"><p>Corralary: It's very easy to stick your hand into a 350 or 400 degree oven for a few seconds (as long as you don't touch the sides or the racks). You don't need to wear an oven mitt to stick something <em>into</em> an oven. Stick your hand into boiling (212 degree) water for a few seconds -- even though it's significantly colder -- and you're going to have a bad day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same principal, if you want to cool down a bottle really fast, wrap it in wet paper towel and place it in the freezer. The water will freeze and cool the bottle faster because itâ€™s in direct contact.</p>
<p>I do this with beer or white wine and it works like a charm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that this trick would be hindered by the fact that when the water freezes, it gives up its latent heat of fusion, heating up the surroundings including your bottle. I suppose that's just a small bump on the way to cooling your drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trick here is the amount of water being frozen is minimal, just a thin layer, so the latent heat of fusion is aswell. As you said, the heat released while being frozen is neglected by the improvement in heat conduction!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Latent heat is only enough to maintain temperature during a phase change. It doesn't increase or decrease the temperature. So you have a slightly prolonged duration of 0 degrees while it freezes which is still colder than the beverage. If anything the ice becomes an insulating layer but you aren't trying to freeze the drink so thats probably a benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting: that doesn't explain why the wet paper towel <em>itself</em> cools more rapidly than the bottle would.  Each one is still interacting with the air.</p>
<p>The answer there is evaporative cooling.</p></div>		</li>
