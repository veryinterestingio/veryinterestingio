			<div class="markdown"><p>And that is often why certain animals become ridiculously venomous/poisonous.  It becomes an evolutionary arms race between poison potency of the prey and poison tolerance of the predator.  First generation of poisonous critter is only mildly poisonous, but still only the most tolerant predators can eat them.  This leaves only the most poisonous critters alive to reproduce, resulting on the next generation of critter to be more poisonous.  This then puts evolutionary pressure on future predator generations to have greater tolerance.</p>
<p>The end result is tiny critters with enough poison to kill dozens of humans, but the same dose would only be a mild deterrent to their regular prey species.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This seems off ... they would be a random distribution of levels of poisonous-ness no? eaten is eaten, regardless of how deadly you are to your prey.  </p>
<p>Unless you're not competing VS predator but other prey that can be distinguished as less deadly by a predator.</p></div>		</li>

Edit: Due to their toxicity, poison dart frogs have only one natural predator -- the Leimadophis epinephelus, a species of snake that has developed a resistance to their venom</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example of a animal that has no predators is the Lionfish in the Caribbean due to them being an invasive species. They are poisonous and nothing in the area preys on them. Since nothing eats them they are not only out competing but over populating the area. Granted humans now prey on them but we are not enough sadly.</p></div>		</li>
