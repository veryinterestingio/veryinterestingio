			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not a historian and this is a complete off the top of my head theory but if people who had much worse teeth to the point that they had trouble eating they may have been weaker due their inability to consume enough calories without problems or pain leading to earlier death from malnutrition, disease, attacks from animals or other people, etc. Children with such problems would probably pass away early on when their adult teeth came in and therefore might not get as intense of a burial as a person who managed to live into adulthood and be seen as more important to a group. This would also account for a lot of the skulls being found with perfect teeth being adults whereas I have definitely seen many skull fossils of children in museums where you can see their teeth are misaligned or they have teeth growing in which don't look like they could fit in their mouth. </p>
<p>Probably none of this is true, just my semi-drunken theory based on anecdotal evidence but I would love to learn more about this topic as I had never thought about it before</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert on the subject, but I don't believe that's how evolution works; my understanding is that the process of evolution requires a certain trait to lead to a higher survival rate, which is why its thrives while inferior traits die off. Even if longer jaws were no longer necessary, I don't see how they would be actively harmful, so why would they be bred out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If theres nothing to maintain a trait, it can &quot;drift&quot; in a population. I.e. if a population of humans lived underground with no light, being blind wouldn't help, but their vision would eventually stop working as issues with eyesight crop up and aren't bred out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will mention that a smaller jaw also allowed for a larger cranium and brain development, since it freed up space on the head. Having a larger brain was <em>definitely</em> evolutionary advantageous, and the trade-off was a smaller jaw. And since we started cooking food and using tools and eating things that required less strong jaws, it wasn’t a big deal. If you compare skull shape along human evolution, especially compared to other modern primates, you’ll see the change in jaw-cranium ratio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what came first? The small jaw or the big brain? Were people with both big brains and big jaws dying out? It seems to me that we started cooking only maybe 10,000 years ago. Our brains haven't changed in this time. Why have our jaws?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In those times when food was tough, it may have been very important for your survival to have a big strong jaw with good teeth. We have no such needs anymore, so smaller and weaker (and cheaper) jaws can prosper.</p></div>		</li>
