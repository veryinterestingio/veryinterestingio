			<div class="markdown"><p>I was struck by the fact that many of the hospital epidemiologists are prevented from speaking on-the-record about superbugs. PR departments are anxious that we'll freak everyone out. I think it's a mistake to simply hope this story goes away. We need experts to explain what we're doing to keep people safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a couple of follow ups:</p>

<p>You'd be speaking as a representative for wherever you work, that's pretty understandable hesitation from the standpoint of the institution. Should hospital epidemiologists be speaking on AR beyond their hospital network? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do you think WHO and CDC are not conveying AR initiatives well?</p>
<p>CDC has the info readily available:  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/solutions-initiative/index.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/solutions-initiative/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/solutions-initiative/index.html</a></a> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There's even interactive surveillance data visualizations...  <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/narmsnow/" target="_blank"><a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/narmsnow/" target="_blank">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/narmsnow/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WHO and CDC are doing great work. I've been struck by the silence from individual hospitals. NYT and Chicago Trib have both written about the climate of &quot;secrecy&quot; surrounding Candida auris. Why?
We're going to encounter more superbugs in the years ahead--WHO says they could be a bigger killer than heart disease &amp; cancer by 2050--we've got to do better than &quot;no comment.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
