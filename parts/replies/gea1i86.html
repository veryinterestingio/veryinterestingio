			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that the protein sequence determines the structure of the protein uniquely is Anfinsen's Dogma. There are a ton of counterpoints to it these days, as you and others mention. Intrinsically disordered proteins are likely other examples, where they form transient structures depending on their environment to serve multiple roles.</p></div>		</li>

Explains the boom in Alz and CJD cases. Your second theory explains sporadic alz and cjd pretty well, and explains why prions are not protease sensitive and immune to practically everything. Correct me if i’m wrong, but prions misfold other unfolded PrP because they fold into the variant that is more energetically stable. PrPSc is more stable than PrPc (which again, explains their indestructibility). I think that proteins misfold all the time, and this misfolding is amplified in the presence of nanoplastics, but they are less stable, thus not a prion, and either destroy themselves or get broken down by proteases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All protein folding is a balance of thermodynamic and kinetic events. Many proteins become trapped in a local thermodynamic minimum that is stable enough to keep them in that state but is not the maximally energetically stable form. Consider proteins like those in egg whites that “denature” under heat. In that case they are given enough energy to escape the local minimum and find a more globally energetically stable form which didn’t occur when they were forming because of kinetic effects that directed them to the “natural” form.</p>
<p>The unique thing about prions is that they lower the energy barrier for their own folding transition and that is what makes them <em>catalysts</em> for the misfolding of other proteins.</p>
<p>It is hugely unlikely that CJD is a result of micro plastics altering protein tertiary structure. Besides issues of the blood brain barrier, the incidence of CJD has dramatically <em>dropped</em> while the contamination of micro plastics has increased dramatically. Even though the evidence supports neither conclusion, it would be <em>more</em> valid to postulate that micro plastics effects on tertiary structures must actually be stabilizing proteins in their natural form and prevent them from misfolding. That is crazy, but still more valid than to erroneously claim that the “effects” they have on structure might be causing them to misfold more often which goes directly against the observed trend in CJD cases.</p></div>		</li>
