			<div class="markdown"><p>Fiber optic backbones for state DOT's alone can get up to 144 fiber count. I assume that fiber lines crossing the Atlantic have much more of a fiber count than that. Plus I thought the industry was moving away from multimode to single mode fiber optic cables because they have higher bandwidth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subsea cables will often be very few pairs.  For example, SMW5 which goes from Singapore to Marseille uses 3 pairs for half of its length and 4 for the other half (source: <a href="https://www.submarinenetworks.com/systems/asia-europe-africa/smw5" target="_blank">https://www.submarinenetworks.com/systems/asia-europe-africa/smw5</a>)</p>
<p>Each extra pair adds a lot to the cost of a cable because every pair will require more power for the amplifiers, and there can be hundreds of amplifiers required for a long route.  On land you can just grab power from the nearest utility, under the sea you have to carry it alongside the fibre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transatlantic cables typically have less strands than terrestrial cables. Typical figures are around 4-8 strands of fiber on present cable systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I miss using small count cables. It’s probably been over a year since I’ve seen anything smaller than a 1728 strand. Most recently it’s been all 3456 and there’s y’all about a 6912 strand cable someone is going to make. Data centers are wild when it comes to fiber counts.</p></div>		</li>
