			<div class="markdown"><p>The show was created specifically to address a deficiency in that area. The reason it was set in a city with a diverse cast was because it's target demographic was inner-city children with less access to preschool and less early development resources. Basically kids who didn't get enough personal attention from positive role models could at least have some on TV. Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell covers a lot of how they created the show and did careful studies of children's responses to different ways of engaging them on screen before any episode made it to air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the first study quoted showed conclusively that for children 12-18 months old watching Baby Einstein induced <strong>zero</strong> advantage over not watching the show. So at least for toddlers, and at least for that particular show, it is indeed <strong>worthless</strong>.</p></div>		</li>
