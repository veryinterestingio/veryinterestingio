			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't make sense, since the planets gradually formed.</p>
<p>In other words, Earth was at some point, a collection of rocks and dust.  And then it was a denser collection of rocks and dust and gradually it became a solid collection of rocks and dust, and gradually, the core melted from pressure and gradually, the crust cooled and gradually, the rough oblique spheroid shape formed...</p>
<p>And at the same time, all the planets were gradually doing similar things.</p>
<p>So there <strong>is no event</strong> where  &quot;BANG&quot; and then the Earth is formed and then later &quot;BANG&quot; and Mars is formed... etc</p></div>		</li>
