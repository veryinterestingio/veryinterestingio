			<div class="markdown"><p>Ll1) Bacteria that cause tooth decay are normal residents of the mouth and cause tooth decay only when we consume excess sugars. However, their main function is to keep in check the development of more harmful microorganisms in the mouth. If we eliminate the tooth decay causing microorganisms, other microorganisms will start growing rapidly in the mouth (which couldn't grow earlier because of competition for resources) which cause many harmful diseases. An example is candidiasis - overgrowth of candida fungus in mouth.</p>
<p>2) Antigens are certain markers present on cell surfaces that act as identifications. Every cell has one/more antigen(s).
Vaccines either supply the body with antibodies or cause the body to form antibodies. Antibodies search for cells with antigens that are not native to the body and then destroy those foreign cells.
The problem is, bacteria causing tooth decay have antigens that are very similar to the antigens present in our heart cells, and antibodies against these bacteria also start destroying our heart cells. This is known as cross - reactivity of antibodies.</p>
<p>However, researches and trials are underway to overcome these obstacles and some trials have shown promises too. But we will have to wait till then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vaccines create antibodies in your body. The kind of antibodies that are created cannot travel from the blood into your saliva and therefore cannot affect the bacteria on your teeth. </p>
<p>Interestingly, dental decay is a contagious disease. You are not born with the bacteria that causes decay. You acquire it at some later time in most cases from saliva exchange with caregivers by sharing foods/drinks or kisses.</p></div>		</li>
