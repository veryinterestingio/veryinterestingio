			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s what’s always freaky about strangling to me. You gotta sit there for minutes after they’re unconscious, just choking a lifeless body</p>
<p>Also I don’t think being shot in the heart causes any sort of instant death. If you’ve ever been hunting, even getting a perfect shot through the heart, the animal still reacts and runs for a short distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals, especially those that we hunt, are built different. They evolved to survive being hunted a lot more than we did. Many wild animals are made to be able to run and fight for a long time while lacking oxygen, their muscles are made that way (think of it like they store oxygen). So while being strangled by another animal and bleeding a lot, they can still kick and run. They evolved that way because more of those with those traits would survive. For humans, we were always more of a social species so much this trait never had a need to become prevalent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure this is true. Humans and our ancestors were on the menu for a lot longer than we were on top of the food chain. Humans are also the best distance runners on the planet so our muscles are plenty good at working on low oxygen and for extended periods of time. There’s no real reason that our bodies would just switch off in relation to pain - that’s the opposite of how we function. Great pain triggers adrenaline and natural pain killers, plus a ton of extra strength, to allow us to escape the predator or fight off the attacker. Consciousness shouldn’t really shut off except for a massive drop in blood pressure, which you would get in a decapitation but even then there’s evidence that consciousness persists for a few seconds after even that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have any sources for this? Evolution that significant would take far longer than how long modern humans have been around, and what you said implies that this trait wasn’t prevalent in their ancestors or genetic relatives that aren’t hunted. Also, there are far greater evolutionary pressures than humans, I would be surprised if humans have been able to make such a sizeable impact in such a relatively short time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are recorded instances of people being shot in the heart with a shotgun and continuing to fight for a long enough to kill their attacker before they died. So, heart shots are not instant death. Only a direct disruption of the brain would be instant death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think 'recieving a lot of pain at once' is any reliable way to cause unconsciousness. I carry a Taser for work which causes immense pain and it won't knock anyone out (head injury from an unsupported fall might do). I've attended a few stabbings, none of which agave led to unconsciousness until blood loss forced it on them, and have colleagues who can reliably attest that a stabbing is usually more painful than a gunshot.</p>
<p>Immediate retraction from painful stimuli is a safety response; dropping to the ground defenceless isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny phrasing, &quot;attended&quot; a few stabbings.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you coming to Saturday's stabbing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, right, I forgot that was scheduled! But yeah, I can move some things around. I'll definitely attend. Wouldn't want to miss that!&quot;</p>
<p>(Assuming you mean attended in a medical sense, but still made me laugh)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe &quot;a lot of pain&quot; was the wrong phrase here. the top comment describes it best, the reflex to get unconscious is &quot;triggered on a number of different indications of serious traumatic damage&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it. Several people in first responder positions have said &quot;instant death&quot; is almost never instant. It's minutes to hours of hard work holding things together, and manually forcing valves to pump because that's their job.<br />
Thank you first responders.</p></div>		</li>
