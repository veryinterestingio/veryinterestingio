			<div class="markdown"><p>Photography had a huge impact on the philosophy of painting as well and it was a factor in the development of abstraction as art. Why approach photorealism when this new medium does it effortlessly. Leading to some artists to create paintings that were more emotive, rather than a representation of reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right- as photography moved from being a very expensive and rare niche into something mainstream, the art world was questioning they very nature of art and getting into more abstract and non-objective stuff. </p>
<p>Then after decades of people looking at canvases splashed with paint in seemingly random ways and saying “this isn’t art, my kid could do this” there started to be a big trend towards photo realism and hyper detailed art. </p>
<p>I am no historian so my timeline is not very precise, but that’s sort of how I perceive things when I walk around MoMA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a system thought to have been used by some of the Dutch painters for landscapes where they’d set up a mirror touching the canvas and copy the reflection closest to the mirror, then move it and repeat.  They could get near photographic images that way.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of realistic nature paintings produced over 100 years ago. Especially European paintings from the mid to late 1800s when the &quot;national romance&quot; period was in full bloom. One famous painting that come to mind is the Norwegian &quot;Brudeferden i Hardanger&quot;: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an artist, can confirm. It's much faster to learn to see the 3-d in 2-d because we already have a final picture in front of us of how it would look in all its perfection. My early learning too was just copying people's pictures to get a hang of it.</p>
<p>We've learned to &quot;see in pixels&quot;, kinda. It's flat, it's accurate, it's efficient.</p></div>		</li>
