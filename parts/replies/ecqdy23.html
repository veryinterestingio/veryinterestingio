			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt even the most gluttonous people actually eat them out of profitability. Buffet items tend to be cheaper in general, but also ordered and then prepared in bulk. Plus the limited (if any) expensive foods they offer on the buffet are generally not replenished often so people are forced to eat the less expensive items. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember watching a YouTube video &quot;beard meets food&quot; is the name of the channel but in one of his videos he goes to a buffet to see how much he can eat (hes a competitive eater) and if he can make them lose money. He interviews the manager and the manager said that someone would have to eat mostly meat and have eaten over 10 plates of it to really break even. Apparently that's why they put all the carbohydrates at the front so you will fill your plate on that and get full faster. (I would link it but I'm on mobile right now and cant find it) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I saw some people trying to &quot;beat the buffet&quot; but even after a full team of athletes (I think it was an American Football Team) had eaten as much as they possibly could, the restaurant was still making money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, though: if the buffet is charging per person (like they invariably do) a full team of athletes is no more likely to &quot;beat&quot; the buffet than the average person on the team. Even if the most gluttonous player managed to out eat the restaurant, the loss would probably be far outweighed by the profit from the rest of the team.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always feel like I need to beat the buffet, so I'll identify the most expensive item, and just eat that. Like when I went to a buffet in Las Vegas and just ate like 5 pounds of king crab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very few being able to eat past the point of profitability is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility.</p>
<p>Let's suppose you are very thirsty. You drink one glass of water and you're partially satisfied, you drink another and then you're satisfied, and you drink another and now the water has lost its utility and is unsatisfying.</p>
<p>A buffet is no different if you consider food and drink as units of commodity and there is a point where marginal utility becomes negative. There is a point where marginal utility and units of commodity intersect and a successful buffet should measure this point for each unit of commodity because this determines average cost.</p></div>		</li>
