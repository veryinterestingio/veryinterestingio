			<div class="markdown"><p>No, injecting yourself with epinephrine when you don’t medically need it could result in death. And as far as I’m aware, the only time it’s medically necessary is with anaphylactic shock, or during CPR with no heart activity at all (sometimes it jump starts the heart and it starts again).</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>That's not how an epi-pen would work just so you know. The feelings you are describing from an adrenaline rush would be caused by a complex mix of hormones and neurotransmitters circulating in the brain as it forms it flight-or-fight response.</p>
<p>Specifically, this response originates in the central nervous system in the amygdala. This triggers a neuronal response in the hypothalamus which causes downstream release of many hormones that cover the stress response in the body, and also releases adrenaline directly from the locus coeruleus into the brain.</p>
<p>Thus, even though this eventually does result in an increase in adrenaline in the blood it also causes many other hormones to be released in a targeted manner that all interact to give that &quot;adrenaline rush&quot; feeling. There's a lot more to it than simply releasing adrenaline into the bloodstream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, as the other commenter said, using an epi-pen would be dangerous when not in anaphylactic shock or when medically necessary. Without the other hormones that are normally released in the stress response to keep things in check, your body might react negatively and get high blood pressure, cardiac issues or trouble breathing. Also, an epi-pen releases much more adrenaline in the blood than the body typically does during the stress response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The evidence shows that exogenous use of adrenaline (so giving yourself a booster shot with an epi-pen for instance) does not increase athletic performance and may cause worse outcomes in terms of performance. This is because it acts on all of the andrenic receptors in the nervous system, some of which have opposing effects in terms of endurance or muscle utilization of energy. </p>
