			<div class="markdown"><p>This. An interesting side note: Older electronics (think tubes) and appliances use much higher voltages. These higher voltages could 'punch through' (that's the actual technical term) the oxide layer to make contact. Connectors are made to slide against one another ('wipe' is the actual technical term) to try to help scrape through the oxide. With the advent of transistors and integrated circuits, the voltages needed to operate dropped a lot - down to 5V (or &lt;3.3V today). These low voltages can't 'punch through' the oxide, and thus the need for oxide-free metals like gold. That's why you see old tube pins and connector are often tin or solder coated, and newer connectors are gold or some other low-oxide alloy. Plugs/outlets in your house are high voltage, so no gold required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i gotta question that a bit. years ago, i did a little work on restoring some industrial machines which included replacing the electromechanical starters and contactors. the new contacts were a silver alloy and the way it was explained to me was elemental silver will indeed oxidize into a non-conductive layer, but this silver alloy oxidized product was almost as conductive as the silver itself. of course, these days there aren't many contactors left in industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as long as it works, theres applications for it. if the voltage is higher than the silver oxide breakdown voltage than it will work fine. </p>
<p>but not every application. silver is known to whisker in some conditions, usually involving humidity and made much worse by any extra sulfur. its actually metallic hair coming out of your part. you generally don't want that. those break off and cause short circuits and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Gold is really really nice material for a number of reasons. there isn't really a process of gold whiskering, for instance, because theres no chemical process happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I know the other guys answered, but I actually have first hand experience with this. My coworker and I took over a product design last year. When we sent the units to our initial customer, they were dead. When we looked at the units, it was actually our protective &quot;kill&quot; switches that had failed and were permanently off. </p>
<p>Originally, this switch was designed to be a hard kill switch on the high voltage AC line. Sometime during development they moved the switch over to just run a check on the microprocessor. </p>
<p>The 3.3V/ a couple miliamps signal could not &quot;punch through the oxide. This compounded with the fact that we were already running the switch at its minimum rated voltage. So the oxide put us out of range and the switch did not detect a signal. We replaced them with gold contacts and everything was fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In safety applications contactors and relays still play a big role, since switching higher power appliances like motor brakes or big valves for hydraulics cannot be managed with plc outputs directly anymore. Another plus side is a good diagnostic capability since you can always see the state of a contactor by monitoring an additonal contact. You need a forced contact for this to ensure electrical fuseing by a short circuit is also detected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Silver tarnishes, gold doesn't. You can find gold coins buried in awful conditions for hundreds if not thousands of years, and after brushing the dirt off they look as good as they day they were minted.</p>
<p>Interesting thing about silver tarnishing: it's only been a significant problem in the last few hundred years (since the industrial revolution). Silver tarnish is silver sulphide formed by reacting with sulphur in the air. Prior to modern industry, there was extremely little sulphur in the air and silver tarnished much more slowly, if at all. So it used to be considered as similar to gold in that respect, but now tarnishes quite quickly, as anyone with a drawer full of silver cutlery can attest to.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>if you keep the silver well kept now, it won't tarnish. I have a 1985 Engelhard that is as shiny as when it was minted. Just in a coin capsule, nothing else fancy. Using desiccants work too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this as an engineer at a circuit board manufacturer:</p>
<p>Generally you'll see circuit boards with gold pads/traces, but in actuality it's copper with gold put on top, essentially. Generally the primary surface finishes we see are ENIG (electroless nickel/immersion gold) which is where copper is applied with nickel, which then has gold on top. This gold generally forms a sort of amalgam when soldered, creating better solderability. Generally, most gold finishes you might see are actually incredibly thin, somewhere around the scale of 2-4 micro inches. That's why reclaiming gold isn't always feasible economically when dealing with this finish. </p>
<p>We do see many other types, such as 'hard' (electrolytic) nickel/gold (used for thicker gold finishes where you've got tabs/fingers that experience a lot of mechanical abrasion from sliding into contactors repeatedly, or sometimes we see Tin-lead (unless of course for ROHS exceptions), and very rarely do we see something like silver desired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty common surprisingly in the field. Granted, it's probably a holdover from when PCBs were primarily made in the U.S. Plus our whole system uses inches, whether in the larger scale (panels are 18x24), as a plating measurement (ASF, amps per square foot), or in the smaller scales such as a mil (a shorthand, improper way of speaking in thousands of an inch), and micro inch for reference of final finish plating.</p></div>		</li>
