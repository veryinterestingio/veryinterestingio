			<div class="markdown"><p>But can quantized energy levels exist during this 10^-10 seconds?  Or is it just that quick because they are electrically attracted to each other and collide?</p>
<p>And side question about Muonium:  I think the half life of a muon is around a microsecond(?).  If this is the case, I assume that an anti-muon and electron would NOT annihilate until the muon decayed into a positron (and probably something like an anti-neutrino).  Is this the case?</p>
<p>Edit: Wikipedia:  Yes, they have energy levels.  Half life is 142 ns, so, not quite as fast as 10^-10.
Re-edit: Well, there are different forms, some of which are around 0.1 ns!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right I know that but an electron and an anti-electron (positron) together forms the positronium not an anti-hydrogen (which is stable far longer in the right conditions)</p></div>		</li>
