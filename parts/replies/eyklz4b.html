			<div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia says movement on electrons is on the scale of mm per hour in DC.</p>
<p>Mind blown, this just feels so not right.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not that stupid i do understand that electrons &quot;push&quot; one another which is why electricity propagates much faster than movement of individual electrons.</p>
<p>Its just the extremely low speed that surprises me. Especially given the existance of sparks etc, such feel extremely fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. But it makes it feel more &quot;right&quot; when you realize that given that speed, there will be on the order of 2 × 10^19 electrons passing through a copper cable any given point, <em>per second</em>.</p>
<p>EDIT: Damn this gives a good perspective on how small electrons are...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluid in a hydraulic control line may not move very fast either but the energy that is propagated through the hydraulic control line is propagated much faster.</p>
<p>That's a good analogy of the difference between drift velocity in DC of mm per hour and propagation velocity of electricity which depends on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_factor" target="_blank">velocity factor</a> of the conductor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the easiest comparison to understand IMO, conductors are just like pipes always full of water: you don't have to wait for water to get from the source to your home whenever you open the tap and it doesn't have to travel fast either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An analogy can be made for water waves, the waves travel faster than the individual water molecule. Electricity as wave travels way faster than the electrons it moves. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im really not sure. This came up when i was trying to figure out how you still get shocked when wearing rubber boots and not touching a ground. </p>
<p>Upon more research I see a site on overvoltage protection refer to the space between conductors as a dialectric so it certainly seems that there is at least one circumstance where that is the case.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is there is no arcing in a vacuum. There are no electrons in a vacuum to conduct the charge so in some ways it's a perfect insulator.
The long answer is there maybe similar phenomenon where electricty can flow through a vacuum. </p>
<p>You might also think of a vacuum as a perfect conductor since there is zero resistance. This is how TVs work.. no not your fancy flat screen but cathode ray TVs. You need an electron gun that fires electrons through a vacuum and use electromagnets to control where the beam hits. Although one analysis is that it's not a vacuum the introduction of electrons by the electron gun is itself the conductor. But I think this requires special materials and an electron gun, I don't think a high voltage across two wire itself can act as an electron gun but I might be wrong. </p>
<p>Bonus answer: in a strong enough electric field the vacuum itself can break down and virtual electrons and positrons come into play. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_limit" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_limit</a></p></div>		</li>
