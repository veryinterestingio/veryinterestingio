			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder why so people see the word union and instantly assume strike.</p>
<p>There is a historic relationship between the two, but anyone who assumes 'union' = 'demand more wages or strike' has been brainwashed by the US management propaganda machine. It's sad to see from this side of the world how badly US workers are treated, and they appear to happily suck it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there is more government support in both directions, such as certain critical employment roles where staff aren't allowed to strike, but they are still able to organise and join unions. This balances things out because the staff can still feel supported by a 3rd party organisation I guess. But even in the other non-critical industries there are rarely strikes here, even though we have quite a few union organisations.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how it all works tbh as I've never joined one, so I'm not the right person to go into detail about it. But I know unions are around and I could join one, other people know about them, the corporations know, but things just seem to balance out anyway. I think the reason for that is that our government appears to be more interested in setting reasonable employment laws, worker rights, and things like that, and possibly it doesn't leave our employees feeling so much cornered with nowhere to turn to. But let's just say in the US it seems to be '<strong>different</strong>'.</p>
<p>I've worked for one company for more than two decades but my job has always been to visit other huge companies and be based in their offices for a few months at a time, so I have a lot of experience of integrating into different working environments and getting to know the workers before I move on. They generally talk openly about unions, laws, working conditions, etc with no fear.</p>
<p>The impression we get about the US is from stories along these lines - &quot;If a group of people are seen in conversation then management will try to find out if there is union talk and even go so far as to redeploy the people into different roles to prevent them from interacting with each other.&quot; I mean it might be just one or two extreme edge cases that make it out as stories, pushed out by the media. But if that <em>is</em> common practice in the US then it's honestly scary to read about.</p></div>		</li>
