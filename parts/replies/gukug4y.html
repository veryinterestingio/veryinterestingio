			<div class="markdown"><p>Alternatively, I wanna know why I can suppress the desire to pee for an hour or more, but the second I get near a toilet I can't shut the door and unbutton my trousers quickly enough. Sometimes I'm fairly sure I've actually started to pee whilst I'm whipping the ding dong out.. it's as if my bladder goes, &quot;oh, there's a place to relieve myself nearby? I'm starting whether you like it or not!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your autonomic nervous system is basically like &quot;Hey, we always pee over here! There's a toilet nearby, I'm sure of it! Open up the internal urethral sphincter! Eliminate all bladder contents ASAP!&quot;</p>
<p>And then your external urethral sphincter, which is skeletal muscle that you can actually control yourself, is suddenly holding the entire volume of your bladder back all on its own. And if you're like me and delivered a giant baby, that muscle has had a hard life and is very tired and just doesn't feel like doing its job anymore.</p>
<p>Kegel exercises will help, even for guys. Also, I've read that denying the urge can retrain your body to not suddenly decide that you need to pee <em>right this moment</em> because there's a toilet <em>right there.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to go to a club that was about an hour's walk from my home. One time I stopped to wee in an alley because I was drunk and had another 20 minutes to get home so I thought it'd be fine, but from then on EVERY time I walked past that alley I got a desperate urge to go. It got so bad that it started happening in the daytime when I couldn't do it and had to just start walking faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. And since itâ€™s mostly a mental thing, you can usually train your body to stop doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my head that process goes like: </p>
<p>Feel the urge to shit</p>
<p>go outside and stare at the door</p>
<p>go inside and walk up to the toilet</p>
<p>unbutton your trousers and fight the instinct to relax</p>
<p>button them back up</p>
<p>go back outside and repeat until you nearly shit yourself.</p></div>		</li>
