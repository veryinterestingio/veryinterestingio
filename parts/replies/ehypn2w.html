<p>After many steps, coconut oil is made into sodium lauryl sulfate, which is treated with carcinogenic ethylene oxide, which makes 1,4 Dioxane. 1,4-Dioxane is EPA established to have a high connection to cancer. It is created as a byproduct, and not removed, in tear-free shampoo made with coconut oil.</p>
<p>It’s also not legally required to list this on the bottle. Because it’s a byproduct and not an ingredient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a shampoo that contains coconut oil and SLS will create this byproduct? Or just coconut oil? Because when I think of soap-free shampoos I'm thinking of SLS free ones - there's nothing bad about them is there? </p></div>		</li>
