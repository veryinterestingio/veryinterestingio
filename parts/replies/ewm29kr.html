			<div class="markdown"><p>We used to think the great white was a direct descendant of megalodon. Recent discoveries thanks to better technologies suggest the great white is closer related to  mako sharks and the megalodon is simply the end point of a line of mega shark species.</p>
<p>It's kind of like humans and chimpanzees. At some point we had a common ancestor and there was a fork in the evolutionary road. On direction eventually resulted in the chimpansee. The other in homo sapiens.</p>
<p>Great whites and megalodon's have a common ancestor rather than the great white being descendent from the megalodon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Around the time North and South America finally connected, nutrition in the oceans (algae, krill etc.) suddenly took a nose dive.</p>
<p>With the basis of the food chain shrinking considerably, the giant filter feeders megalodon hunted disappeared as well. Once that happened, megalodon and smaller sharks like the great white were competing for the same prey.</p>
<p>In that situation, megalodon's size is a disadvantage. It needs much more food than it's competition while hunting the same prey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the pilocene era, new predators such as the ancestors of the Great White and killer whale emerged this saw an increase of competition between the apex predators of the sea. Along with this there was a sharp decline in the amount of smaller mammalian marine life so competition grew fierce and resulted in the more efficient predators basically starving the megalodon into extinction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can a predator out hunt another predator to extinction? Unless the Great Whites and other predators caused the populations of the prey species to collapse the relative success of a great white or other predator shouldn't have had an effect on the megalodon populations. Predator competition is usually over territory or which animal is able to retain possession of a kill (think hyena/lion interactions or even better how Hyena and Lions will steal the kills of cheetahs which is putting considerable pressure on their populations currently) and I don't see great whites able to deny a megalodon access to a kill, though it is possible that killer whales could have (or even hunted the megs themselves) and that could have played a role, though that still wouldn't have been out hunting the megs. To be honest given its size I think a bigger issue would have been how successful the megalodon would have been hunting smaller marine life in general, it feels like a predator specialized in hunting whales would have had a much harder time with the smaller and faster prey such as seals, meaning more work for less calories regardless of competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Megalodon teeth and great white teeth are actually not similar at all. It’s been disproven that they were ever related. The Megalodon is part of the Otodus lineage. Megalodon had a worldwide distribution and its main food source was whales. Some fossil vertebrae have also been found along side an associated partial dentition. This has allowed scientists to compare tooth size to vertebra ratio with modern day sharks. The largest found teeth measured around the 7 1/4” mark and a shark that size would’ve been 60-70 feet in length. There is actually a brand new life size scale Megalodon shark in the reopened History of Natural Science Museum in DC. Scientists theorize that the Megalodon was actually a lighter brown color, which is different than that of the blue-gray great white sharks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No expert, but I've got a fossilized meg tooth and I googled  what a great white tooth looks like.  Some of the GW teeth i'm seeing tend to hook towards the back of the mouth where my meg tooth is entirely straight down and symmetrical with a hook towards the center of the mouth.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The middle area of the meg tooth also looks way thicker in relation to the other parts of it compared to the GW.  So I'd assume they were significantly stronger in terms of not breaking when they hit bone.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The GW tooth looks way more geared towards pulling down or backwards (more likely down because it's a shark) after biting, but the Meg one literally just looks like it more naturally tears away while biting down because it pulls more towards the mouth.  They're definitely different in a lot of aspects (and i'd assume function) but I unfortunately lack the knowledge or vocabulary to explain it better than this...sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For starters, the root shapes are quite different. Megalodon roots tend to be more robust in general, whereas great white tooth roots tend to be flatter. There is an anatomical feature on Megalodon teeth found between the lingual side root and enamel, the bourlette (or chevron as some call it). This feature is not usually found on great white teeth. The serrations also differ. Megalodon serrations are finer and are pretty regular in size. Great white shark teeth often have irregularly sized serrations that are larger compared to overall tooth size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s due to their enormous size as well as the fossil record. A creature with that much mass would need to consume large amounts of calorie dense food to thrive. Whales were and are still some of the largest creatures in sea. Anything smaller would’ve been harder for adult Megalodon to catch and would not be sustainable for them in small quantities. We know that megs fed on them because it’s not uncommon to find fossilized whale bone with predation marks in them.</p></div>		</li>
