			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Water is one of the only (or possibly THE only) substance that is more dense as a liquid and less dense as a solid. So it takes up more space as ice than it does when as liquid water - which is also what allows frozen ice to float (on lakes, ponds) on the surface and not sink to the bottom. All or most other substances behave in the opposite way. As they move from gas to liquid to solid they become more tightly packed bonds, and expand as they go from solid to liquid to gas. I find this really interesting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably the most familiar substance, but certainly not the only substance. Silicon and germanium also expand upon freezing, for example. The only true requirement for a higher-temperature phase is that it has a higher entropy, not that it's denser or less dense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but <em>in general</em>, having more entropy results in lower density. Of course this is not always the case, as observed in water (and apparently silicon and germanium).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's the fact that the surface of the ice doesn't freeze all at once. The patch of water that freezes last becomes the site of the potential ice spike. Water expands up through the hole as it freezes, the outer surface freezes first and the inner water keeps getting forced higher.</p></div>		</li>
