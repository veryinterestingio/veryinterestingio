			<div class="markdown"><p>True. The 95% efficacy rate often mentioned for the two mRNA vaccines is against any symptomatic disease, though. Including mild illness, but not asymptotic infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes thank you. This is why masks are gonna be around for 2021.</p>
<p>The idea is to get the community spread down and reduce the rapid evolution of the virus.</p>
<p>If this was a hemorrhagic virus you would see mask compliance like never before in the US</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear though, all of the vaccines are 100% effective at preventing hospitalization or death. The efficacy numbers that are typically being compared refer to efficacy against contracting the virus at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kinda true, but isn't something people really should be saying.  All of the vaccines are very effective at preventing hospitalization or death, and <em>in trials</em> that number was 100% effective, but those trials' conclusions, while statistically valid for comparatively common events like <em>getting COVID</em>, are not as strong for much more uncommon events like <em>requiring COVID hospitalization</em>.</p>
<p>So, yes, all three are very, very effective at preventing serious disease, but with 300 million people getting the vaccine, <em>some</em> people will get the vaccine and then get serious COVID requiring hospitalization.  It will just be a very small number.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No matter how many times this is said, it is not true. The clinical trials did not have sufficient sample sizes for conclusions about mortality or severe cases.</p>
<p>Data from Israel and UK is showing that even vaccinated individuals are still becoming hospitalised or dying of COVID, albeit at 80-90% reduced risk compared to the unvaccinated population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What the number means differs between the vaccines; they may  each have different ways of measuring efficiency during trials.</p>
<p>For example, you'll get different numbers whether you test everyone in the trial for COVID infections through a PCR test regularly compared to just testing those that report symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Efficacy is the word I believe you are seeking, rather than efficiency.</p>
<p>efficacy: the ability to produce a desired or intended result.
&quot;there is little information on the efficacy of this treatment&quot;</p>
<p>efficient: (especially of a system or machine) achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense.
&quot;fluorescent lamps are efficient at converting electricity into light&quot;</p></div>		</li>
