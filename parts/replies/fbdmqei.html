			<div class="markdown"><p>This is modern monetary theory correct?</p>
<p>The government spends money into existence to stimulate growth and taxes/issues debt (bonds) to remove money from existence to prevent inflation.</p>
<p>The private sector always seems to grow in its capacity to produce, there's population growth which provides more labor and innovation to create more and more efficient uses (goods and services) for resources. A good example of this is a computer that cost very little in resources and labor but opens the door to endless industries all profiting off that one simple use of relatively few resources.</p>
<p>So in theory the government could spend money into existence forever as long as we keep inventing more and more efficient ways to use resources and labor to create goods and services that people can buy. Unless we use up all the resources or run out of new things to make it goes on for infinity. </p>
<p>All the government has to do is react to the market and either inject or remove money at the right time or else the bubble will burst and everything will reset. Does that sound right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s right. Technology and resource cultivation increases the amount of fiscal space available.</p>
<p>But what matters is not the total amount of money per se— it’s the amount of spending. The government could print money into a hole in the ground, and while this would increase the national debt, there would be no effect on inflation.</p>
<p>In an inflationary episode, the important thing to reduce is consumer spending. You could tax tons of money away from rich people, but if their spending isn’t what’s causing inflation, it won’t matter.</p>
<p>I think some MMTers miss this, and there are a few other things MMT gets wrong, like the idea that taxes drive currency’s value. I prefer Consumer Monetary Theory by Alex Howlett.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Modern Monetary Theory issuing money = spending without having any credit and there is a single actor who can do this. In a democracy it's the state so public spending = issuing money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the major problem with this theory is that there is no way for a government to react fast enough in an inflationary episode to reduce consumer spending. The only thing they can do (or at least in the US I think) is increase interest rates so spending is less attractive.</p>
<p>I also don't think there is a way to make just system where the government can immediately enact an &quot;emergency&quot; tax without that system being abused. You would have to consolidate the power to tax and a consolidated power like that is susceptible to abuse. In the US whoever was put in charge of that would just reduce taxes on their friends trigger an emergency and make everyone else pay for it.</p>
<p>So I don't know that a government could ever operate in that way in reality. Unless you can think of a way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MMT is a relatively new term- before it came in to common use, it was just, &quot;knowing how money works, where it comes from, and how governments use it&quot;.</p>
<p>The idea that governments should deficit spend money to minimise unemployment and that this does not increase inflation is a part of MMT and I wasn't aware of that in advance, but it does make sense. The quantitative easing used after the last financial crash has struggled to put inflation where it needs to be because a lot of the money being &quot;printed&quot; is being removed from circulation- it goes into the pockets of the super-rich, people who have so much money that they can't spend it fast enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MMT is a 25+ years old term and its description is not trivial, otherwise we wouldn't have austerity, liberism, &quot;how do we pay for it&quot; etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think u/derekvangorder addressed this later on in the comment thread when he said it does no good for the government to just print money and throw it in the ground or in this case into to some wealthy person's investment account or worse over seas bank account. Money has to be distributed to places or people who will spend it.</p></div>		</li>
