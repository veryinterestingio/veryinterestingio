			<div class="markdown"><p>Statistics are fascinating. You came make them say just about anything you want.  &quot;Customers that switched to [Insurance Company Name] and saved, save an average of $ XXX&quot; is NOT saying the average saving for people who switched is $XXX. It is averaging the amount of savings for those customers whose rate didn't stay the same or go up. So by adding 2 words, &quot;and saved&quot; overall average savings of like $5 across their customer base can become $500 savings and not be legally incorrect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Small print, on the next page says you are only guaranteed 10Mbps, with 60Mbps average. But you CAN get 100Mbps sometimes...</p>
<p>Obviously stretching the statistics on this, but general idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also found most people don't know the difference between bits and bytes. ISPs advertise with bits (small b) because you end up with a bigger number which sounds faster but most speed testing sites and the files you download are measured in bytes ( big B). Like gigabit speeds will only give you 125 megabytes download per second. I know people who ring and complain when they're getting 100mBps download on their gigabit broadband and they won't listen when I tell them that's pretty close to the max and is probably well within what the speed can drop too before it's a problem</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that is kinda a mischaracterization of statistics in my mind, along the same lines of &quot;All of accounting is bullshit because some people cook their books&quot;, don't get me wrong there IS a bunch of bullshit percentages used to advertise products, services and opinions, but that's why good statistics always include information on the dataset and its preparation, its processing and how the authors came to their conclusion. So you could read up on it, trace their steps and see if any shenanigans with the data took place. If you can't do that I would take it with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, you're closer to a monkey than to your half-brother. Is your brother a monkey by any chance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, so the answer to the question you posed is: if you look at all of human and monkey DNA, their entire genomes, you'll find that 98% is identical. That 2% is what makes a monkey a monkey and a human a human. </p>
<p>23andme however only uses the bits of DNA that can vary from person to person, which is only a tiny amount. Something like 99.9% of human DNA is completely identical, whether that is your brother or some person on the other side of the globe. That means genetic variation within the human species is 0.01% of our entire genome or less.</p>
<p>What 23andme means by 'you share 25% of your DNA with your brother' is 'of the tiny bit of DNA that can vary from person to person and that we measured, you share 25% with your brother'. That means your full genome is 99.925% identical to your brother's, rather than the expected 99.9% if you were unrelated.</p>
<p>I may have gotten some terminology, stats or math wrong, but the general idea remains the same.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Identical at which level of granularity? What are we measuring/comparing here?</p>
<p>They both use the same amino acids, so if we’d go by that we’d share a 100% DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question but not what I was addressing. I was only explaining the seemingly illogical difference between those two percentages. However you define 'DNA similarity', it must be higher between humans than between a monkey and a human.</p></div>		</li>
