			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you not aware of what those mean?</p>
<p>Muscles waking up as in becoming active from a period of inactivity.</p>
<p>Recalibrate as connecting with the rest of your body.</p>
<p>Limits as in the amount you can stretch before overextension?</p>
<p>I used the test example to fit within the ELI5 shtick.</p>
<p>Returning to a normal state is.... returning to a normal state? I’m not sure how you didn’t understand that.</p></div>		</li>
