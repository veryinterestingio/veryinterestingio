			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was growing up we lived off a main street in our town. When I was an early teen we got hit with a HUGE week-long snow storm  and one night my dad wanted to go for a walk so I went with him. Other than that night I've never in my life seen that main road not have ANY cars on it, it was just so silent and peaceful just the two of us going for a walk. I don't know if he ever even remembered that night but it's always been my favorite memory with him.</p></div>		</li>
