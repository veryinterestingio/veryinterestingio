			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct 100% rarely are train engines equipped with motors that take fuel and turn it directly to physical motion. It’s way more efficient to produce local DC power and put it through a VFD so that it acts like a positrac transmission.
In short diesel fuel gets converted to torque
Torque gets converted to electrical potential
Electric potential is fed through a VFD to extract exactly the amount of power needed to move the load the power is given to electric motors which turn the wheels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a main line locomotive, there will be 6 axles and a traction motor for each axle. When the train starts up, the traction motors will be in a  series configuration to increase the overall resistance and reduce the current requirements. As the train picks up speed, the traction motors will be put through several series-parallel configurations. </p>
<p>The magnetic field generated by the traction motors in the cab is incredible. I worked designing locomotive control systems in the 80s and had a CRT based oscilloscope in the cab doing some measurements. As we started moving forward, the oscilloscope display turned almost 90 degrees from the magnetic field. </p>
<p>Locomotives are way bigger than you think when you get up close to them. They also spit oil out all over the fucking place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can’t you just call the vfd a “traction motor” :-/    That’s what the BoL says.  I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The VFD isn't a type of motor - it's a box full of huge semiconductors that electronically regulates the power applied to the motor.</p></div>		</li>
