			<div class="markdown"><p>A key piece of understanding in this whole thread is why electricity vs any other form of energy? Storage. Battery and generator are useful for this, but so is a waterwheel, ox drawn wheel, or windmill since continuous or on demand use is possible. Mechanical potential storage is also relatively easy pre-bronze age via coiled rope, spring, or really anything you can put in tension. Conversion to useful work is the outcome we care about, so my first question would be what do we need the energy for as opposed to original posters question of how do I recreate electricity. Just my 2 cents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodestone" target="_blank">Lodestone</a> has been known about for thousands of years. If you understand the physical processes behind electromagnetism you should be able to use lodestone and some crude copper wire to generate an electric current. You could then use that to purify copper (and various other metals for that matter) via electroplating, and then use that wire to create stronger permanent magnets out of iron. You can bootstrap up to an early 1900's level of electrical technology from there.</p>
<p>Rare earth magnets (necessary for high efficiency systems or stronger magnetic fields) would require a lot more levels of technology though.</p></div>		</li>
