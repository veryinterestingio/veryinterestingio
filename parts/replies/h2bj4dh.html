			<div class="markdown"><p>And the air also reflects sunlight. On earth there is still light in shadows even if not reflected of any surface due to scattering in the air.</p>
<p>On the moon, where there is no air, a shadow can be completely black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also that's why shadows are 'darker' the closer they are to the surface they're casting a shadow on. The edges of the shadow seem sharper too; when the object is further away, the edges of the shadow seem blurrier</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>same reason the sky is blue. blue light gets refracted different then all the other colors. as light passes through the air some of the blue light separates from everything else meaning that is what we see when we look up. red also gets refracted differently which is why the moon looks red during a lunar eclipse. but that is more difficult to explain in detail than the blue so i am going to leave it at that in case i say something wrong. if someone with more knowledge wants to come in and explain the physics behind that please do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not that blue is special, it’s just that the bluer the light in general the more it’s refracted when compared to wavelengths of light that are redder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you could see quite a bit by starlight.</p>
<p>If you ever get the chance to go somewhere without light pollution on a starry night you'll be amazed how much you can see!</p></div>		</li>
