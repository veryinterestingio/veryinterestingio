But that's really hard and for observational purposes that your reference point is quite random and moves a bit doesn't really matter. So astronomers often stick to this
But if you want to know more there is also a coordinate system which is based on the galactical plane and center of it. This is useful to understand the dynamics of the milky way and where we are regarding to that. If one can go even further the best thing we have as a rest frame is the microwave background. From the dipole momentum one can get the relative velocity to that which you can see as our overall velocity in the universe. But when it comes to the reference point, the most general option we have is the center of the obeserval universe and that's where we are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Momentum&quot; seems like an odd choice of words, but of the microwave background itself. We expect that its spectrum should be isotropic (the same in every direction), but when we measure it we find that it is redshifted in one direction and blueshifted in the opposite direction. Interpreting those as Doppler shifts allows us to determine the Milky Way's velocity with respect to the so-called comoving frame, in which the CMB would appear isotropic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also probably worth mentioning that for now we have very little practical need for a universal reference.  Solar system navigation is likely all we'll be doing for quite some time and unless we develop some sort of super FTL tech at some point near galactic navigation is all we'll ever do.  Which is not to say that humans wouldn't travel farther than the near galactic, but once they do they won't be coming back to Earth.  Hell, they won't be <em>talking</em> to earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I realize this is off topic to an extent, but this is the same kind of logic that I end up coming back to when people talk about why aren't we seeing aliens everywhere if they existed. </p>
<p>It's like... well without meaningful FTL aliens probably die out eons before they ever make a meaningful spread into even a fraction of a percent of what we can see in the universe right now. </p>
<p>Why ever would we think that they'd be &quot;everywhere?&quot; I just don't see the value in spreading out like that when you'd essentially fall apart as a cohesive group without a way to FTL travel/communicate. Not to say they couldn't, but I find it dubious that any given race would successfully spread beyond an infinitesimal region. Even if they spread to three dozen stars, that's such a small part of the sky in a very specific chronological window, that unless it was relatively nearby we might never even notice it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they make no allowances for local curvature. We are nowhere near having precise enough measurements for that to be an issue though.</p></div>		</li>
