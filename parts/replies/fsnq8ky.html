<p>Oddly, though, we've had an outbreak of both fruit flies and house flies this year and the fruit flies were easy enough to catch with vinegar, but the house flies didn't give a damn about honey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm I wonder then if the type of soap affects it? Iâ€™ve always used Dawn dish soap for the best bubbles. You can also use a piece of paper to make a funnel with a small hole, just big enough for them to crawl through. Tape the funnel onto a jar or cup with some fruit (the riper the better) they are able to get into the funnel but not smart enough to get back out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, the actual point of the soap is to remove surface tension of the water, that way they sink as soon as they touch it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bubbles don't matter.  The soap breaks up the surface tension of the vinegar.  Fruit flies are so tiny they can sit right on it otherwise.  </p>
<p>It is, however, possiby that a scented dishsoap could make the vinegar not smell as appealing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! I live in a poorly insulated old house in New Orleans. And while I have yet to devise a method to <em>completely</em> rid of them I do have a method that will help if you suddenly have like 30 of them flying around your kitchen.</p>
<p>Take any cup and fill it with a small amount of ACV/wine/fruit juice, then fill that cup with water and a drop of dish soap almost all the way to the top of the cup. Then cover the cup in saran wrap and poke some holes in it. The flies will become attracted to the mixture and then get trapped beneath the saran wrap and drown. If you find them congregating on the cup and not going inside, I spray them with a liquid cleaner like 409 or windex and they become unable to fly and die.</p>
<p>This method won't stop fruit flies from entering your kitchen but it DEFINITELY helps when you have a sudden influx because maybe you let a banana sit out one day too long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We make traps with 20oz soda bottles.  Cut off the top part a couple inches down from the neck, so that you have basically a funnel shape and a cup shape.  Flip the funnel shape around so that the mouth/neck of the bottles is pointed back down into the rest of the bottle.  Put tape around the seam where it was cut to attach the funnel to the cup.  Next, pour in some warm water and some apple cider vinegar.  The ACV attracts the fruit flies, the warm water helps the smell dissipate faster.  They get into the bottle trap easily to get at the ACV, but then they generally can't figure out how to get out and will drown.  Make a few at a time and set them around areas that are problematic.  To really make sure you clear them out, skip a week of buying bananas at the same time you set out the traps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also avoid smells by putting some plastic wrap over top, and poking a hole into it that faces inward, or make a little cone out of a small bit of paper and stick it through the hole. This will trap the fruit flies until they hit the soapy wine vinegar thing instead of piling up around the edge of the glass.</p>
<p>Visualization:</p>
<pre><code>  \     / &lt;- paper funnel
,--\   /-,
|***\ /**| &lt;- tons of fruit flies trapped
|    v   |
|        |
|~~~~~~~~| &lt;- soap + wine/vinegar/etc
|________|</code></pre>
<p>A similar thing works for flies, you can put something they will seek and just punch a screwdriver through the hole of a lid on some glass jar (so that part of the lid bends inwards where you make the hole), and they will never escape.</p>
<p>The small hole also prevents you from smelling random wafts of vinegar too, but fruit flies will find it.</p>
<p>edit: Turns out I'm not the first person to do this. There's a great picture and guide here, and it looks exactly like how I also do it, funny enough. <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Fruit-Fly-Annihilator/" target="_blank">https://www.instructables.com/id/Fruit-Fly-Annihilator/</a></p></div>		</li>
