			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. I’m a speech therapist and this is what we learned in grad school voice class.</p>
<p>My only complaint - you put your post in quotes, so it looks like you quoted it, but you didn’t mention a source. It’s always a good idea to cite your source so others can look it up after you :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC there are people who received a voice box transplant and their voice is not nearly the same as the donor's since much of what makes a person's voice what it is is in the speech part of the brain. Is that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So let’s do an experiment. I take your voice box. Is my voice going to be the same as yours? NO. Your voice box is just 1 part of the vocal tract. It interacts with the throat, mouth, and teeth, and skull. All of those things reverberate and change the voice. All of your parts are different than all of my parts - in shape, size, length, weight. There’s no way they will be exactly the same. So even if the voice box was transplanted, the voice would still be different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe that the speech part of the brain is to credit for how a person voice sounds, since the brain is primarily, by a huge majority, electrical signaling. However, speech patterns (stuttering, slurring, Donald Trumping, etc.) would be due to how the brain commands the muscles and filaments that produce our voice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought differences in voice also has a lot to do with the formant.  I guess all those things contribute to ones formant, but I was wondering if you heard this is your studies.  The formant is the cluster of harmonics that form in the upper frequency range.  different frequencies cluster there resulting in the the formant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll be honest - i never fully understood formants. And they really don’t come up much in doing functional therapy with people. It’s more of a speech science thing, so I never did much with them because I mostly did language and swallow therapy. You might know and understand a lot more than me!</p>
<p>My understanding is that formants are patterns that distinguishes one sound from another in our speech production. For example, there is a pattern of formant highs/lows that makes an /i/ sound, and that is different than what makes an /u/ sound (those vowels might be a bad example, so forgive me if I’m off base).  And the difference in formants is how one sound is distinguished from another. Now what I’m not sure of is whether your formants and my formants are <em>exactly</em> the same in terms of frequency, or if they just follow a consistent pattern of highs/lows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excess fat around the face and neck can probably cause enough structural changes to make your voice sound different.</p>
<p>Could also be psychological; a lot of aspects of your voice are controlled by your brain. If you become more confident, you tend to speak in a lower register and with a different inflection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You see this in opera singers every now and then: bigger belly means gravity is pushing down on your diaphragm more, which makes it more natural to breathe from your diaphragm and give yourself proper support. Skinny people can do it, but they have to learn, whereas heavier singers typically do it without needing to think about it. Losing a lot of weight all at once can ruin their voices if they're not careful. </p>
<p>Not sure if this is what happened to you though, especially if you're just talking about your speaking voice. Are people saying your voice sounds &quot;smaller&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>right! the vocal cords (which are pretty much the same across different people) act as the sound source, while the skull and mouth act as the resonator.</p></div>		</li>
