			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the strike is well-publicized by way of Union members (and not just people who worked at that particular location, but members of the Union as a whole) picketing at the gates (being physically present at the gates to company property, displaying signs) and holding press conferences to air grievances. The idea is that even with outside workers brought in to keep the company running, customers, vendors &amp; members of the general public sympathetic to the Union would voluntarily choose not to &quot;cross the picket line&quot; or otherwise business with the company during the strike.</p></div>		</li>
