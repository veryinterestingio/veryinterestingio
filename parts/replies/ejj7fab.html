			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel embarrassed to ask this, but I haven’t heard the term raciaized before. I have definitely used “person of color” and it makes sense that it should go because we don’t say “person of white”, but could you give a few examples of how it could be used in a sentence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no substantial political reason to distinguish people (i.e establish classes of people) unless you're intending to establish unidirectional relations between classes of people.</p>
<p>That said once the cat's out of the bag you can't try to backtrack and &quot;not see race&quot;. Race has been made real, and any attempt to rectify injustice will need to acknowledge it and use the concept. For better or worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is correcting injustice not a substantial political reason to differentiate people? I think I'm just not understanding what you're saying. I also understood the language issue here to apply to all speech, not just political.</p>
<p>For example, if I wanted to advocate for a group of people, I might say &quot;black americans have been disproportionately affected by policies such as the 100:1 crack:cocaine laws&quot;. I'm not establishing any classes there, just pointing out facts about discriminatory policies. </p></div>		</li>
