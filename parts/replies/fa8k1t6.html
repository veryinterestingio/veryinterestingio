			<div class="markdown"><p>Do spacecraft heatsinks look like traditional heatsinks we use on Earth, with fins oriented in the same direction? My gut feeling is that in space the only relevant design parameter is how much surface area is exposed to space, and that surface area exposed to parts of the spacecraft or other fins of the heat sink isn't actually helping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly right. Only radiator area to space matters, and parallel fins like an air-cooled CPU heatsink would mostly just heat each other/bounce radiation among themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can, sure. Orientation matters in the sense that it has to be optimized for the function of the spacecraft over its lifetime. For example if it uses solar panels to generate electricity, you don't also want the thermal radiators to face the sun (see the image of the ISS another commenter posted here).</p>
<p>Sometimes existing panels are used secondarily to radiate heat. In those cases the orientation more likely depends on the primary purpose of the panel. </p>
<p>Also, remember that certain materials are better IR emitters than others. This allows designers to have more leeway in how radiator panels are oriented relative to other parts of the spacecraft.</p></div>		</li>
