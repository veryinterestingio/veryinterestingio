			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact; you are literally washing away bacteria and germs. Soap doesn’t kill them; just clings to the oils on your skin that has the bacteria/germs and then gets washed away with water.</p>
<p>Thus why anti-bacterial soap isn’t as necessary especially when it can lead to surviving bacteria which can become more resistant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting. I always use antibacterial handsoap because I thought that regular soap was basically for cleaning the dirt off, but left the bacteria on your skin still there. In the same way that putting a raw chicken on your kitchen counter and then wiping up the &quot;juices&quot; with kithcen roll would basically make it look clean but all the bacteria is still there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's always *some* bacteria left on the surface you're trying to clean if you're just using soap or detergent. &quot;Lab-safe&quot; ways to sterilize would be bleach on anything besides metal, and flame until glowing on any reusable metal instrument. High pressure steam, as in an autoclave, is commonly used in medicine, but those machines start at around $3k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This uses some close language, but isn't quite correct. The dirts and oils are typically non-polar. Polar compounds tend to easily be rinsed off by just water. The long carbon tails on the surfactant molecule are what bind to the dirt and oil, and it's the polar end (which has both partially positive and negative sections) that is soluble in water, so it takes the dirt and oil away with it when rinsed off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things water won't wash off are non polar like oils and grease. Like dissolves like and the nonpolar dirt and oil is attracted to the nonpolar end of the molecule, allowing the soap to carry it away</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the actual act of attraction is called the hydrophobic effect, its the action of the nom-polar molecules to congregate in order to increase entropy.  Since water takes on a highly ordered form when surrounding hydrophobic groups.  So more and more hydrophobic groups will band together to form a sort of 'ball', this is called the micelle effect if I recall correctly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The soap chains are much smaller than the dirt though.</p></div>		</li>
