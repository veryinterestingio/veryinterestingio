			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The combined capacitance is C = (1/C<em><em>1</em></em> + 1/C<em><em>2</em></em>)^(-1), so if you assume C<em><em>1</em></em> = C<em><em>2</em></em>, you just get C = C<em><em>1</em></em>/2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I just realised I think OPs question was actually &quot;why doesn't a stack of capacitors behave like a single capacitor with the plates <em>where the ends of the stack physically are</em>&quot;, which is a different thing entirely and all the responses about movement of charge on the intermediate conductors makes sense now - I was just thinking about a dielectric with a stack of arbitrarily thin isolated conductors in it.</p></div>		</li>
