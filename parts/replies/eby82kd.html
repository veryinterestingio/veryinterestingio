			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever taken a college level general chemistry course, you've probably run into what he's describing, without realizing it. When you're talking about how you get CO poisoning, you have to understand what happens with <strong><em>chemical equations at equilibrium</em></strong> and their &quot;Keq&quot;. He's basically describing (and showing you with the formulas but leaving out the numbers) how the products side of the reaction between Hb and CO is stronger than the products side of the reaction of Hb and oxygen. What that means is that CO will bond just as readily with Hb as Oxygen will, BUT CO WILL STAY bonded because it's a &quot;products heavy&quot; reaction where it doesn't want to reverse and become CO + Hb as the initial reactants again. So what exactly does this mean in terms of effects on real life?</p>
<p>The reason you get CO poisoning (and why to treat it you are given high concentration O2 as quickly as possible) is because CO has forced its way into bonding with Hb before Oxygen can and you're trying to force CO out of the position bonding to Hb by pushing so much oxygen into your lungs and bloodstream. If you didn't do this, your blood would not be able to pick up the oxygen you need to survive and you would die from CO poisoning. If you do get treatment quickly, there is nowhere for the CO to bond, and it gets filtered back out. CO2 doesn't react in the same way because it's already a &quot;stable&quot; molecule (in terms of the octet rule) and doesn't want to bond with anything else, and is therefore much easier to filter out of your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The explanation including the octet rule makes much more sense to explain the affinity of CO and it’s ability to actively compete for binding sites on hemoglobin. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So because of the greater affinity of CO, it then exhibits competitive inhibition of oxygen binding to hemoglobin active sites. Is it solely based on the selectivity of the hemoglobin receptors that happens to coincidentally be compatible with CO that causes the reaction it does? </p>
<p>Edit: nvm, guy below answered my question</p></div>		</li>
