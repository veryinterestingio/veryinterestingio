			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note about sodium: one of the ways your body regulates high sodium is to suck the water out of your cells. If you ever have a stroke, one of the ways we'll keep your brain from swelling is to give you hypertonic saline (3%, or a 23.4% “bullet” bolus if you’re herniating) to keep cerebral edema down! The body is a strange and fascinating place...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When watching shows like Star Trek, I feel like the ships are written and operated as if they're closer to living creatures than machines. If my car's low on oil, no amount of gasoline or blinker fluid is going to do anything about it. But in Star Trek, if the engines are failing, it's a simple process to re-route power from the weapons and life support to get the ship moving. Just like the weird things a body does when in distress!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Star Trek ships are more like large naval vessels, in that there are many redundant systems. Cars don't normally have that kind of fault tolerance. They generally have 1 engine, 1 transmission, 1 battery, 1 fuel tank, etc.. If that one thing fails, there isn't another to replace it.</p>
<p>Electric cars sort of do that kind of thing for you, but it would generally be computer controlled. It might route more power to one motor vs another based on conditions. If a battery module fails, it may bypass it to continue on your way at reduced capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. So ... if I have a soft tissue injury that wants to swell (say a bruise, or a twisted ankle), would ingesting salt reduce the swelling?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes, but in the case of a soft tissue injury the benefits do not outweigh the risks. Swelling reduction is pretty minimal but thanks to Monro-Kellie you need all the space you can get. With a twisted ankle or something if you are a ton of salt you <em>might</em> reduce swelling a little but you’d be causing a whole pile of issues on the back end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im surprised you don’t have more upvotes, I was thinking the same thing, it depends on if it’s water or fat soluble. </p>
<p>We had some horrible cases of vitamin d poisoning in my country some years ago, a company made d vitamin drops for babies and the dose was extremely off. I follow the mother of one of the children who was hit the hardest and I don’t remember it completely but I think that she will have to much vitamin d in her body until she turns 13... she was an infant when she got the drops, she has so many serious health issues, her kidneys are fucked and her brain has suffered damage as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body stores iron and doesn’t get rid of it much, so if you take too much iron the concentration in your body will just increase unlike vitamins Bs and C which your body will just excrete in urine if you take too much.</p></div>		</li>
