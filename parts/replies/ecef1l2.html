			<div class="markdown"><p>You have gotten your answer, I would just like to add some stuff to it. It’s very hard to recall and state basically any list of stuff that is numerous. You not only have to actually recall all items on the list, you also need your working memory to monitor what you have already stated and keep track of what’s missing on your list. For most of us, the working memory has a capacity to store somewhere around 5-9 items. After that, the task becomes greatly more difficult. That’s one of the reasons it’s harder to store longer lists in your more long term memory. There are many everyday examples of this. Think about going grocery shopping. Most of us won’t write a list if we’re buying around 4-5 items. But if we need to make sure to get 10 different things or more, most of us rely heavily on making a list or using some sort of memory strategy.  </p>
<p>Imagine if someone asked you to make a list of basically anything with more than ten items. It takes some work to get everything in there and make sure you didn’t miss anything. And it gets harder the longer the list is. As an example, lets say someone asked you to write a list of colors. If it’s just the primary colors, the task is relatively easy. If it’s just different shades and names of red or blue or whatever, the task is also not that difficult. But let’s say you had to make a list of all words that can be used to describe some shade of any color. You could easily forget to state for example ”cobalt” or ”ruby” even if you would have listed them when asked to name all shades of blue/red. </p>
<p>Let’s take another example. You are asked to name all your high school class mates. You are all in the same room and you can systematically go through every one of them one by one. They all stand still. The load on your working memory is small. You just need to monitor your system of going through them all one by one. You could probably name most of them. Now let’s say they started moving around in the room. The working memory load increases. You have to monitor which ones you already named and who you might have missed. You would porbably miss a few. Now let’s say you are faced with the same task but with no aid whatsoever, alone in a room and no class list or photos to help. You might only be able to name a few. This is partly because you didn’t have a promt to help and partly because of the working memory issue. </p>
<p>Another important thing here is storing long term memory. Some things are stored for a little time, some for a bit longer and others for a very long time. This depends on your brain’s process of consolidation, which partly is determined by how important the memory is. Let’s go back to the shopping list. You are with a friend. They are on the phone with their dad asking them to get a few things from the store for them. Your friend asks you to remember a few things on the list until they have written them down. You will remember for a few minutes until they have written it down but your brain will then discard the information since it’s not important any more. If it was you going to the store and you didn’t have a pen or paper you would hold on to the information until you had been to the store, and then discard it. The memories we store depends partly on what we deem important to remember. If I told you today that in a year I will ask you what books you have read during the year, chances are you would remember more than if no one told you that before hand (depending on your motivation to be able to complete the task when the time comes of course). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So much of this seems relatable to my ADHD. I wonder how ADHD impacts recall vs recognition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chances are it’s related. I would have to know more about you specifically to give a detailed answer, but generally speaking adhd has to do with problems in the area of executive functions. Working memory is one of these functions. So you might not have the same working memory capacity as someone without adhd. But as I said, hard to say without knowing more about you. There’s always a huge span of individual differences when it comes to these diagnoses, so it’s different for everyone. </p></div>		</li>
