			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't it? It seems obvious to me that, if men hitting their testicles on the top tube were a problem that is not compensated for by the benefits of having one, nobody would ride bicycles with top tubes. So that means either men don't really hit their testicles on the top tube (this one is the actual explanation), or that the performance differences are so significant that men are willing to tolerate hitting their testicles on the top tube to have lighter bicycles.</p></div>		</li>
