			<div class="markdown"><p>crystallography was done as early as the 1910s. Instead of processing data using a computer everyone just measured manually as well as doing all the calculations by hand. All you need is an xray laser and a film, then it's just measuring distances and lots of maths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to be pedantic, but an x-ray source, not a laser. Most diffraction measurements are done with a crt bombarding a copper plate to emit cu K alpha radiation. </p>
<p>Current methods (since the 70â€™s) to measure bond lengths directly require EXAFS experiments, which require broadband x-rays from your local neighborhood synchrotron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For macromolecules nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) can also be used in addition to x-ray crystallography. NMR structure determination adds some interesting information that crystallography isn't particularly good at teasing out. X-ray crystallography of proteins, for example, forces the protein into a conformation that isn't necessarily biologically relevant because the molecules aren't packed into large crystal structures inside the cell. NMR allows the proteins to be in solution and allows them to &quot;breathe&quot; and the resulting data set can show you how the protein moves and wiggles around when in solution. Protein molecules are very &quot;bendy&quot; and conformational changes are a big part of what make them function so NMR is very informative in terms of showing you what the range of possible conformational geometries of a certain protein is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are you on about? It's not 'as far away as possible' unless you have some shaky definition of what is 'possible'. Instead covalent bond lengths tend to sit at the minima of the bond energy curve, where attractive and repulsive forces effectively cancel. </p>
