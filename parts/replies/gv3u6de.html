			<div class="markdown"><p>Might be worth amending here that having studied rotorcraft dynamics,
I can attest that it's a relatively <em>complex</em> matter of mathematics.  </p>
<p>The martian atmosphere is so thin that damping blade flapping becomes extremely difficult (on Earth, it's often trivial because of the thick air), which increases the difficulty of the already hard problem of managing rotor vibrations.  </p>
<p>The vibrational dynamics and aeroelasticity of rotor blades already makes for a complex set of multivariate differential equations, and having the flapping motion be underdamped in addition to all the usual problems made the design of Ingenuity's rotor system that much more different and difficult than that of an Earthbound helicopter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I realize NASA scientists would rather work out the math in advance before devoting insane amounts of money to manufacture things, but wouldn't it be relatively simple to just try out a few different rotor designs in a large low-pressure chamber and see what works?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They most certainly did do testing on earth using scale models in a pressure chamber. However, that is only part of the puzzle - I would imagine a lot of this was done using simulations on a PC. </p>
<p>Also don't forget your only testing part of the equation in your example. Gravity is another big part - we can simulate increased gravity using rotation. Reduced gravity can be done in drop chambers.</p>
<p>My guess is they did extensive testing in simulation and using real world modeling where possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even for earth aircraft, computer simulation rules the day -- you can simulate a propeller, get precise information about what every part of it is doing, and then make fine adjustments and try again.  This is far faster (order of minutes for a low-resolution quick test) than building a model and trying it for real.</p>
<p>That said, JPL has some <em>very</em> large vacuum chambers.  <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-mars-2020-heads-into-the-test-chamber" target="_blank">They actually tested the <em>entire rover</em>, to make sure that the pressure drop of going into space wouldn't break anything weird</a>.  E:link failure fix't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. A colleague of mine did Mars rotor simulation tests in a vacuum chamber and had to include temperature sensors so that things didn't overheat. Given that the aircraft is relatively small, lightweight, and low power with presumably very efficient electronics and motors, heat dissipation has been minimized as an issue for Ingenuity. Otherwise you might see noticeable heat sinks incorporated into the design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly the answer I've been looking for.  In broad strokes, what did they do differently from a ln earthbound rotor craft?  Change the pitch of the rotors?  Make them bigger?  Smaller?  Change the speed?  More/less blades?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They used the minimum number of blades, but incorporated a number of newer/unusual technologies in the design.  </p>
<p>First, since the blade flapping is an issue (very little damping from the atmosphere), the rotors are &quot;hingeless.&quot; This means that the blades are fixed at the root and can only rotate, not flap up and down or lead and lag forward and backward like on most full scale helicopters. This increases the forces on the hub and rotor shaft drastically, but allows for a second, very important technology:  </p>
<p>Ingenuity has counter-rotating coaxial rotors with <em>very little separation.</em> This is very different from coaxial helicopters like the Kamov &quot;Black Shark&quot; and &quot;Alligator&quot; attack helicopters.  </p>
<p>Generally, when you put blades above and below each other, the flapping (that thing the martian atmosphere doesn't mitigate well) of the blades ends up making them smash into each other. On the Kamovs, that meant spreading the rotors far apart. However, that greatly reduces the efficiency benefit of stacking two rotors.  </p>
<p>If you stack the blades very close together, assuming they don't touch, you get a much more efficient rotor, closer to the theoretical maximum of coaxial rotors. Great for performance. The Sikorsky X2, SB-1 and S-97 helicopters all do this like the Mars helicopter does, though for different reasons.  </p>
<p>If you have the rotors close together, as we mentioned, they can slap into each other and really ruin your day. This happens due to cyclical motion - the blades pointing up and down different amounts around their rotational cycle to tilt the helicopter one way or another. This cyclically induced flapping can be eliminated at the root of the blade, but the tips can still bend, so the Ingenuity has very <em>stiff</em> blades compared to other helicopters. Fortunately, this is relatively easy to do at small scale, so the blades just look relatively normal when made out of carbon fiber.  </p>
<p>The other way - aside from using carbon fiber - to make the blades bend less is to <em>increase the blade area</em> for a given aircraft weight. This means less stress on the blades and also reduces the amount of lift that each unit area of the blades has to squeeze out of the very thin air.  </p>
<p>Finally, those very large blades look a lot like propellers rather than typical helicopters. That's because helicopter blades look &quot;normal&quot; as a compromise between hovering and forward flight performance. Ingenuity flies slowly, so the blades are designed to maximize hover efficiency.  </p>
<p>So, blades that are locked in place, two rotors very close together that are very stiff, very large, and shaped more like propellers as compared to a more traditional helicopter design, all to lift a very, very light aircraft (because there just ain't enough air to lift heavy stuff).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To your point, Ingenuity has less mass then a 2 Liter soda and has a wingspan of 1.2m (\~7ft). Additionally the rotors spin at 2400rpm which is 10x faster than the rotor on an Apache attack helicopter. <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter" target="_blank">https://www.americanscientist.org/article/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to that rotors and props are limited by the wing tip speed not exceeding the speed of sound (shorter rotor span can spin faster). In a thin atmosphere and at cold temperatures, speed of sound is much slower. This is non trivial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another important factor is keeping the blade tips slower than the speed of sound, or indeed below transonic speeds (0.8 to 1.2 times the speed of sound). Because of its cold CO2 atmosphere, the speed of sound on Mars is generally significantly lower than for Earth, at least at a given altitude.</p>
<p>Atmospheric density doesn't effect the speed of sound. The speed of sound in a gas is sqrt(gamma * RT / M) where gamma is the adiabatic index, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in Kelvins (or Rankine if you must) and M is the mean molar mass. Now gamma happens to be about the same for CO2 and diatomic gases like O2 and N2 that make up the atmospheres of Earth and Mars. Dry air on Earth has a mean molar mass of \~29 g/mol, while Mars's CO2 dominated atmosphere (with a little N2) is a little under 44 g/mol. Temperatures on Mars are generally colder than Earth, and they vary a lot with time and altitude on both planets. But for normal ranges of near-surface conditions the temperature has about the same or slightly greater effect on the different speeds of sound as molar mass.</p>
<p>For example, Mars's mean surface temperature is 210 K and Earth's is 288 K.</p>
<p>sqrt(210/288 * 29/44) = 0.69</p>
<p>0.69 * 340 m/s on Earth = 235 m/s on Mars</p>
<p>But again that varies a lot with time of day and altitude, especially in the thin air on Mars where the air at 10m can be much cooler than the immediate surface.</p>
<p>For ingenuity with a blade span of 1.2m and rotation of up to 2500 rpm, the blades are moving at 1.2*pi*2500/60 m/s, or \~160 m/s, well below 0.8 times the speed of sound on Mars, especially during the relative warmth of daytime.</p></div>		</li>
