			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC he gave The Guardian most of the intitial leaks and they reached out to the US State Department to redact any potentially compromising information for US agents in the field. The White House refused to cooperate and asked them instead just to not publish it at all. The Guardian editors then chose to publish the leaks without redactions because they felt it was too newsworthy not to publish.</p>
<p>There's no concrete evidence that the leaks led to any harm coming to US operatives but due to the clandestine nature of US intelligence there's no way to confirm or deny that the leaks caused any immediate damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if the USG confirmed certain elements of the statement from snowden to be particularly sensitive, it would have compromised intelligence even more than it already had been. WH had no choice but to ask for complete concealment of info, and to accept the fact that what was out there was out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, possibly.......if you assume that the information in question would be used by the people who had it yes. But it seems relatively unlikely the reporters at the guardian would deliberately endanger Americans or others which America had a desire to protect. It is much more likely that by revealing that certain information was highly sensitive to the reporters it would never have been obtained by anybody with a desire to use it for harm. If it's just on the internet uncensored, the taliban/isis/isil has it. Can they use it? Do they know to use it? No idea, but they have it and they'd use it if they got the chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also an easily digestible piece from John Oliver where he interviews Snowden about how exactly different programs were used to spy on the American people.  Look up Last Week Tonight: Government Surveillance on YouTube.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was just thinking about that interview.</p>
<p>(Leave it to a 'comedy news show' to get to the heart of the matter... (And I gotta agree with John; he should've used dick pics as the example. ðŸ˜…))</p></div>		</li>
