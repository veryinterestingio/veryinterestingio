			<div class="markdown"><p>This is always what's been in science fiction books I've read. White holes or worm holes don't appear naturally. But using an &quot;exotic matter&quot; you can create and maintain them. Still not sure if it's possible but I think it still leaves the door a bit open to their existence</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with exotic matter is that it is not something that has been observed, and there is no reason to believe it should exist. It is just a hypothetical type of matter that has a  property that stabilizes wormholes (or do something else that has not been observed in real matter).</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is kinda just going deeper into a &quot;what if&quot; rabbit hole, no? </p>
<p>&quot;For worm holes to exist we need white holes, which don't exist&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, yes. but we could make them exist by using exotic matter... Which also doesn't exist.&quot;</p>
<p>Like, sure, you can create anything new if you only had a non-existing ingredient that contained the properties necessary for creating the new thing. Of course, investigating deeper into the non-existing things you might eventually reach something that can be created using existing measures, so I'm not saying it's entirely pointless. But what I am saying is that it's not enough to prove any sort of a possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can absolutely <em>theorise</em> a sustainable wormhole, but we can't yet know if any theories leading to wormholes are accurate models of reality.</p>
<p>Many theories of physics are convenient solutions to groups of math equations. We have no idea whether or not these solutions actually match reality - we need to run experiments to see if the implications of the theories correspond to reality. For example, the &quot;negative-mass&quot; solutions allowing wormholes rely on something which is <em>mathematically</em> possible but which has not been observed. It is not yet proven to be impossible, but it is nowhere near proven to be possible.</p></div>		</li>
