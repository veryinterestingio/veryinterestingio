			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog hates her food, she’ll only eat it when she’s really hungry but she’ll eat wet food like it’s a bag of treats but when she has too much wet food in her diet, she gets sick, I’m so confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When my dog got picky about her food, I started adding water to the dry stuff. She never turns it down now, ahh I've been doing it for years. </p>
<p>She's still a little picky. Too little water or too much and she'll stare at me for making such a egregious mistake.</p>
<p>Edit: I don't do things like broth unless she's feeling sick. Oil if she's constipated. If I give it to her even as an occasional treat, she gets stubborn and refuses to eat her plain food. So water it is</p></div>		</li>
