<p>Edit: TIL there was a reimagining / sequel of sorts in 2018. Thanks for triggering my memories to do a search, Reddit!  </p>
<p>Edit 2: I realised that there is a better word that using remaining / sequel but it was past 1am and my brain robots needed to go to sleep and reboot the system</p></div>		</li>

<p>Side note: I had to leave the reddit app to google the show and confirm that I was thinking of the same show....and then I realized I made the reddit robot go back to bed and panicked that this post would be gone! But, for those wondering, the reddit robot has a notebook so everything was fine!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While true, these are the terms used, the robot itself isn't killed or terminated, you could it's forced into an 'off' or a 'sleep' state, which fits better with the analogy. You don't delete the source of the orphaned thread (yes, we terminate orphans in software).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got a bunch of people that can work a 'baccer patch, but you've only got so many tools. A bigger outfit has enough tools for maybe one or two workers to use the tools at the same time, but not smaller ones. Sometimes if you have multiple people out there suckerin', only one of them can work and the other forgets what they're doing. It's nicer to have a worker that knows how to keep working around other workers.</p>
