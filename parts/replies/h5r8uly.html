			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent question! Let me start with some background. What we are decoding here are the cortical activity patterns related to attempting to speak. The reason why we can decode these are because those patterns are different when a person (Pancho, in this case!) is attempting to say different words, like &quot;hello&quot; versus &quot;hungry&quot; (this means, those neural activity patterns are &quot;discriminable&quot;). </p>
<p>At the moment, most of our knowledge of speech motor neuroscience is in people who can or could speak at some point, and we can see that there is still speech-related activity in their motor cortex. In these cases, if someone has lost the ability to speak, it seems likely that their motor cortex has not been severely damaged.  In principle, as long as someone is &quot;cognitively intact&quot; (they are able to understand and formulate language in their head), then they may still have discriminable cortical activity patterns that would allow us to differentiate between different words (it doesn't necessarily matter where these patterns are located in the brain) when they are trying to say them. </p>
<p>I want to clarify that I'm talking about intentional attempts to speak, and not the &quot;inner speech&quot; or &quot;inner thoughts&quot; that people experience. Damage to the motor cortex is another interesting part of your question! If there are discriminable patterns in other areas of the brain (there is some research on purely imagined speech that implicates other areas of the brain like the superior temporal gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus), then it seems like it could be possible. Certainly, this could be investigated with non-invasive methods like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (perhaps this has been done, in which case I'd love if someone would link me to those studies!). -JRL</p></div>		</li>
