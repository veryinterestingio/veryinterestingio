			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a municipal water district back in the day and I can confirm this.  I personally had to haul a bromine based product to the top of a water tower and pour it in.  The water tower was out of service for 6 months while a new plant was being built.  Instead of draining it completely the decision was made to leave some volume of water in the tank for justincase...   pressure was never an issue since the operating water plant had 4 high pressure forwarding pumps that kept the line pressure above 25 psi even at peak demand.  It was consistently above 30 psi...</p></div>		</li>
