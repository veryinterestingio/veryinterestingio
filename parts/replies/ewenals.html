			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a Physician and I do not recommend the use of antacids for this type of treatment.  There’s a reason your body feels nauseous when you haven’t eaten, and it’s not because of an overproduction of acid. In fact, the use of antacids reduce your ability to extract nutrients from the foods you consume and lead to deficiencies down the road. I see it everyday. </p>
<p>Instead, consider that your body may be unable to regulate blood sugar during periods of extended fasting (not eating). Everyone’s tolerance to this is different; some people can go a long time without food, others only a couple of hours. </p>
<p>Try this experiment: increase the protein and fat content of your last meal and see if you can go a longer time without feeling nauseous. If so, then you know it’s a blood sugar issue, as fat and protein delay the influx and emptying of carbs into / out of your bloodstream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah my blood sugar is fine. Trust me my doctor didn’t just jump to this. I appreciable the feedback but I’ll trust the physician that I’ve been working with and who has seen my test results. It’s something we’re working on long term. I do appreciate the concern tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's a different thing than what op means, no? At least, a <em>lot</em> of people suffer from reflux disease, albeit in varying degrees, but the 'so hungry I'm nauseous' should not come from overproduction of stomach acid. At least, not if it's only sometimes - if you have this regularly, you should indeed have it checked out. If it's just every now and then where you're just super super hungry, I think it has more to do with your stomach cramping up and hormonal signaling as described above.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got prescribed omeprazole for two years and it didn’t help my crippling nausea. Eventually had my gallbladder out after barfing my brains out for 8 hours straight and a trip to the ER. So yeah, it could be something else. Talk to your doctor OP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if your stomach was producing more acid in preparation for a meal it thought it should be getting soon and then you put no food in your stomach, that would mean theres too much acid in your stomach leading to the reflux symptoms though, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just commenting to say what op described is not &quot;reflux&quot;. Reflux is when the acid comes out of the stomach and up the esophagus. OP is describing his stomach cramping and excess hormones. You're medicine may combat that OP has as well though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Naturally, yes, but there's also a very delicate (and highly specialized) feedback system in your stomach lining that should prevent overproduction. Then again, I might be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a PGY-1, I agree. What the OP means probably isn't that. I asked this to my attending once and the answer was probably along the line of fluctuating blood sugar level.</p>
<p>For example, once you eat sugary snacks, you will feel full for a while but will be followed by intense craving due to rapid spike and fall in blood sugar.   </p>
<p>However, compared to food with low glycemic index, which is broken down more slowly, your blood sugar level changes less intensely, and you feel full for a while longer.</p>
<p>In the case of starvation, once your body starts pulling your energy reserve from glycogen, I would imagine that your blood sugar level would be pretty constant so you would not feel hungry anymore.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Or at least, that is what I understand.</p></div>		</li>
