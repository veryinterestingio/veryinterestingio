			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an important option missing, the CMB rest frame:</p>
<p>The cosmological standard model assumes matter is distributed across spacetime in a way that allows slicing into flat homogeneous spatial hyperplanes. Motion relative to this frame can be measured by looking at the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. Planck measured that velocity as ~370km/s (when averaging out Earth's orbital motion around the sun).</p>
<p>So in 6 months, we move about 5.8 billion km - corresponding to 5.4 light-hours - relative to that frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a neat frame of reference. Reading up on it, I get the impression that it's also an arbitrary choice. Is that right, or am I missing something? It looks like you're just intentionally Doppler shifting the sky so that it's color becomes homogeneous on average. Is there any meaning to the CMB color distribution, or is it just the product of a bunch of random quantum events?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not arbitrary insofar that it is adapted to the matter distribution.</p>
<p>The 'color distribution' of the CMB is rather significant: Until gravitational wave detection matures, it's the furthest we can go as far as direct investigation of the early universe is concerned. The fluctuations are due to things like baryon acoustic oscillations, from which clever people have derived all kinds of things (photon to baryon number density, spatial flatness, ...)</p>
<p>What's known as the current 'crisis in cosmology' is the disagreement of the values of the Hubble parameter as derived from comological modelling with CMB measurements as one major input, and more direct atronomical observations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which can be determined more accurately -- the barycenter of our galaxy or the barycenter of the Andromeda galaxy?  The fact that we can see the entire Andromeda galaxy might make it easier to analyze.</p></div>		</li>
