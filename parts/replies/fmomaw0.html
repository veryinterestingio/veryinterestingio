			<div class="markdown"><p>We currently “mine” for water in subsurface groundwater aquifers. That’s different than what the original commenter mentioned. We can’t mine into the mantle because of depth/heat/pressure. Most of what we understand about the mantle is from geophysical data or rare occasions in which rocks from the mantle are exposed at the surface, there’s still a lot of mystery. Petrology ain’t my thing so anyone else feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, most human problems connected with water that you might hear about are problems of accessibility, not availability. We have more water than we could possibly use up, both for drinking and using in industry. It's just that the amount of water that is accessible to us FOR FREE is miniscule.</p>
<p>And it is &quot;free&quot;: it's clean, it's right here, and it literally flows into your hands. If you abuse these tiny, long accumulated sources of clean fresh water, pollute, or exhaust them, no problem — the planet still has like 99% of its water available for you. But now it will cost you dearly in processing: desalination, condensing, even some kind of synthesis. Water will become costly like expensive mined resources, like metals or oil byproducts. It'll become like aluminum or carbon fiber, only you need to consume dozens of kilograms of it (not only in food, but used for making other products) per day. Say goodbye to easy prosperity and low prices on everything. The food will become especially expensive and will again eat up most of our income.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On a geologic timescale, i.e. hundreds of millions of years, it could and probably will be transported.</p></div>		</li>
