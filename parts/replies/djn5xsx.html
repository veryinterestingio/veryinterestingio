			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true actually. Scleractinian corals in the relatively modern form first show up in the fossil records during the early Mesozoic era which means they survived the end Cretaceous mass extinction event caused by a comet/asteroid impact. That would have radically changed temperatures overnight pretty much. The actual explanation is likely that there were small pockets of coral habitats that remained in a state that corals could continue to survive in, and the global populations regrew from those pocket populations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That eruption caused roughly five years of global cooling (though the strongest effects were only a year or two) before temperatures returned to normal. This was not enough time to either kill the coral outright due to temperature, or cause any glaciation that would damage the coral via reduced sea levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The planet recovered fast enough to not have a massive effect. On the scale of events through earths history Krakatoa was pretty minor. Things went back to normal in a few years. Where as climate change has been going on for a century at this point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC coral and other plankton can handle slight temperature drops but not rising temps.  It has to do with warmer temps killing their sperm (just like in humans).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite on the corals. What you think of as &quot;coral&quot; is two separate organisms, the coral polyp and the endosymbiotic dinoflagellate colony living in their tissues that gives them their colors and allows them to photosynthesize basically. This is what allows corals to live in nutrient-poor waters, they make their own from the sun essentially. In warmer waters, the balance of that symbiosis is broken and the dinoflagellates, called zooxanthellae, either leave or are expelled from the coral tissues. This is a bleaching event, and corals generally do not survive it. So with the corals specifically, it's not the sperm not working anymore, it's that the temperature change causes a breakdown in the endosymbiont system that allows the corals to exist where they do. Without the zooxanthellae, they generally starve to death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some may have.</p>
<p>But those events are called &quot;mass extinction events&quot; for a reason.  It could be that 90% of the corals <em>were</em> killed off during those events.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible that &quot;life will go on&quot; even if human-driven climate change kills off the majority of the current corals.  Some species - those with the highest tolerances for warmer waters -
may survive and adapt, and then new coral species will develop to take advantage of niches left when the others die out.</p>
<p>But really, the problem isn't &quot;Will sea life / coral life manage to somehow find a way even in the face of climate change?&quot; but whether or not we should take some responsibility for the climate change we are introducing.  Even if the ecosystem can potentially handle it, we're still causing the extinctions of many thousands of species.</p>
<p>If you could prevent an asteroid impact that would kill off 90% of land animals, wouldn't you choose to prevent that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think man interfering in coral habitats, over fishing and plucking certain specimens for home and business use probably has more of an outcome of  their well being than ocean temp changes.  Source: have a coral tank and have had some failed ones over the years.  Some species seem far more resilient to my abuses, which seem to be more these days since having the younger kid with another on the way ???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering that 2 out of the 3 orders of coral are extinct, Rugosa and Tabulate, and their die off is related to mass extinction events i think that you have your answer. These types of coral were the primary reef builders of the past just like todays corals</p>

<p>Both died out in the end Permian mass extinction. Modern corals are almost exclusively Scleractinia  </p></div>		</li>
