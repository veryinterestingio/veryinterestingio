			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that most particle physicists (well, they mostly use relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, so the relevant practical experts are probably atomic physicists and condensed matter physicists who are much more likely to use non-relativistic QM every day) just haven't thought about this much. They learned some interpretation as an undergraduate (and it was probably taught poorly by someone who also hadn't thought about the question much). And that most likely just stayed with them through grad school (where we're too busy learning practical calculation tools to worry about interpretation). And because these questions don't matter when it comes to how you actually do calculations, mostly they never think deeply about it again.</p>
<p>The people you actually want to ask and listen to are the philosophers of physics who work on foundations of quantum mechanics. Because they've actually thought about these questions at a professional level, and not (mostly) as a student.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everybody loves the quotes from famous physicists claiming that no one could understand QM. I think, if they were alive today, they would take those quotes back. Those quotes were made during a time when active physicists had all done most of their learning and training before QM was a developed branch of physics.
Intuitively understanding QM isn't so impossible, it just requires a paradigm shift in which you no longer think of matter in terms of little billiard balls. Your brain can understand interacting waves and probabilities from intuition-informing personal experiences too. Unfortunately, by the time QM is introduced, the budding physicist is already well-versed in the science of billiard balls.
Go out and find a surfer who has never studied physics. I bet they'd understand QM intuitively better than any sophomore physicist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Any one who is not shocked by quantum theory doesn't understand it.&quot; ‚Äî Bohr</p>
<p>I don't think any of them would take it back. Feynman lived a long life (d. 1988). So did Bohr (d. 1962). I don't think our understanding of quantum mechanics has gotten materially better since they were alive. It is true that physicists spend less time contemplating the physical meaning of many of these things ‚Äî there is a trend away from philosophical takes on quantum mechanics and worrying about its ultimate meaning. But this is just about avoiding the questions, not answering them.</p>
<p>If you tell people Schr√∂dinger's cat today, they say, got it, the cat is both alive and dead. That's just a repetition of a statement, though. They don't really understand it ‚Äî they just know it's something you can say and be correct. What people like Bohr, Feynman, and others were trying to indicate is that actually making material, physical sense out of this stuff is hard. It's not gotten easier over time; if anything, the advances since these people have only emphasized how different the quantum world is from the macroscopic one our brains are used to interacting with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cat is an allegory, made up to illustrate the perceived absurdity of QM. But if you understand QM, the cat superposition is only absurd because the probability of any such a macro-QM system existing is infinitesimally low. But once acclimated to wave models of matter and probability models of interaction, superpositions of possibilities are not difficult to understand. In fact, they are the only things that exist. The paradigm shift that makes truly understanding and thinking in terms of QM intuitive is simply readjusting your understanding of your perceptions of the macroscopic world. So that your understanding of the baseball thrown from your hand is just an approximation of what is really going on.
I'm not sure what advances you think make that more difficult. If anything, to me, the advances cement the new paradigm more and more as the base reality our macro-world is built upon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wholeheartedly agree with you.  I tend to debug/spot problems with race conditions in programs earlier than a lot of people and I find there are plenty who just don't &quot;get&quot; indeterminsm and even when you explain why something could behave in a way that might only fail occasionally or sometimes they just memorize the way to avoid the problem (&quot;ok, it's alive and dead&quot;) but don't truly grasp the situation and fumble again the next time something that doesn't look similar enough to invoke their memory comes along.</p>
<p>Not saying I even remotely understand quantum anything but I can appreciate that I also don't really understand the cat thing and I'm doing no better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It‚Äôs not really that hard. At some level <em>all</em> material sense is a question of what things you simply accept as true.</p>
<p>The material world of our everyday senses doesn‚Äôt make any more inherent sense than the world of QM does, we‚Äôre just much more familiar with the rules and accept them as basic facts.</p>
<p>Edit: Essentially, intuition isn‚Äôt based on a fundamental understanding of the logic of the system and exactly why it behaves the way it does versus behaving some other way. An intuitive understanding of something is based on familiarity with it and the patterns it follows.</p>
<p>As long as something has a system of rules and patterns of behavior, you can get an intuitive understanding of how those patterns operate. This is entirely achievable with QM and most of the frustrations that physicists had with it were wrestling with trying to understand it using an intuition that wasn‚Äôt built for dealing with it.</p>
<p>You also seem to be following a weird timeline as far as QM‚Äôs development. Leading scientists, including Einstein, were trying to reconcile QM‚Äôs results with a classical understanding of physics for pretty much their whole lives.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think that movement really suffered it‚Äôs full death blow until Bell‚Äôs theorem was published, and that was a few years after Bohr had already died.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There still isn't a commonly accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics which isn't addled with all kinds of issues ranging from the measurement problem, counterfactual definiteness, non-locality, non-determinism and others. It's very telling that the quote &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; is so often used, because although it works, it means giving up on understanding.</p>
<p>The core issue of quantum mechanics is not the wavelike nature of particles, that would be counterintuitive at first, but fine after a while. The heart of the matter can probably be summed up with entanglement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wave nature is just the start of understanding. Interpreting QM is the art of translating QM into the particle billiard ball paradigm, so there are no interpretations that work completely because the billiard ball model is not real. Locality, determinism, and measurement problems are all artifacts of trying to fit a particle model to a wave system. Entanglement is just superposition. I don't know what counterfactual definiteness is, but I'm interested. &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; is just an instructor's declaration that they aren't teaching paradigm shift and that intuitive understanding isn't required to do the work. Quantum mechanics itself, works with no problem. Understanding it without interpretation is the issue at hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, good stuff! I'm not writing a thesis on this stuff, but let's see if I can partially answer in brief. Whether or not reality is deterministic is a matter for philosophy. It cannot be determined by QM. The classic example is the entangled particles. The question is: did measuring one change the other, or were they the way they end up being measured from the start? We don't know, and quantum mechanics doesn't try to tell you: all you have from QM is probability. And you can intuitively understand that you can't know too.
I'm not too sure what you mean by locality, realism, and preserves. But I can tell you that, strictly speaking, nothing is localized to a point according to QM. So location is a description of the probability of something being (interacting with another localized particle) in a certain volume of space. QM deals with that which is real, if that's what you mean by realism. Though there are some solutions to QM equations that don't seem to reflect possible situations that are still studied.
Measurement can mean many things, but usually involves particles of a probable range of characteristics interacting (or not) with other particles of unknown characteristics to produce other particles (or change initial particles) with characteristics in such a way that they interact with equipment and ultimately us so that we can observe their probable range of characteristics and deduce information about that which we are measuring. Your question is broad, so the answer could range from a simple definition to unknowable philosophy, but I don't see any difficulty with respect to QM that doesn't exist with respect to any thing else.
I suspect the troubles you're driving at boil down to things that can't be known. In classical physics there are no such things. In QM, and reality, there are. That doesn't mean it isn't understood, it just means some things can't be known. An intuitive grasp of that idea is also achievable. </p>
<p>For my part, I do not have intuition with respect to the math of QM. I have to sweat that out like everyone else. But I have no more trouble intuiting QM interactions and realities than I do Newtonian physics.</p></div>		</li>
