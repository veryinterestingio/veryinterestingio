<p>While you're waking up you still have melatonin in your body, so caffeine will block those effects and help wake up faster. This is especially true for people with increased sleep debt, who have accumulated <em>more</em> melatonin, and also especially true for people who wake up before dawn, since light triggers the destruction of melatonin. Without the light of dawn, there's a lot of melatonin floating around so you need the caffeine to block it so you can wake up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition caffeine withdrawal takes about 24 hours to kick in.  if a person drinks coffee every morning with an addiction (which is very common) then they are experiencing withdrawal in the mornings.  Part of this is feeling tired and drowsy because they have additional receptors to make up the for constant caffeine and need the caffeine in the morning to feel normal.  When a person says they need caffeine to wake up in the morning, they are really saying they are an addict in withdrawal every morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I get that your brain will grow more receptors in response to too many of them being blocked by caffeine, but how long does it take for your brain to prune excess receptors if you stop drinking caffeine. Essentially how long does someone need to suffer the withdraw effects before they can return to normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12906366/" target="_blank">Caffeine increases Melatonin levels in healthy human test subjects.</a> So no, Melatonin counteraction has nothing to do with it. Caffeine causes increased release of the stress hormones Cortisol &amp; Epinephrine/Adrenaline as well as Dopamine and Norepinephrine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking here on an already good explanation. Caffeine binds multiple types of adenosine receptors in the brain, one of which, as mentioned inhibits the build up of adenosine. Adenosine usually builds up over time and causes drowsiness, thus decreasing adenosine is one way caffeine us from feeling tired. Caffeine also binds three additional adenosine receptors, one of which causes release of acetylcholine and monoamine groups. The monoamine neurotransmitter group is composed of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. This is partially responsible for the stimulant effect of caffeine. </p>
<p>So in short, caffeine not only prevents drowsiness (through inhibition of a sleep neurotransmitter) it also promotes wakefulness through its stimulant properties. </p>
<p>OP is correct caffeine does not wake you up, this is a complex interplay between multiple hormones (one of which is cortisol), but it does prevent drowsiness and promote wakefulness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How do these two differ? Caffeine causes Histamine release in the tuberomammillary nucleus, essentially switching the brain into a go-mode. And that's ignoring its effect on Dopamine receptor availability, Adrenaline, Cortisol and other neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>If directly counteracting what makes you sleepy isn't waking you up, then what is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take your point. The pathways (waking from sleep and gernal wakefulness) certainly have overlap from a neurotransmitter/hormonal perspective but I essentialy break it down to a light switch-like situation: one is switching the light from fully off to on (powering up the circuit) while the other is keeping the light on (maintaining the circuit). Waking from sleep is a measure of cortisol fluctuation, melatonin/light levels as well as adenosine and some of the other neurotransmitters mentioned previously. </p>
<p>Waking involves the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain (the internal clock) as well as the hypothalamus while the tuberomammillary nucleus as you mentioned controls arousal.  As far as I'm aware caffeine doesn't directly act on the SCN or hypothalamus (perhaps it may indirectly). </p>
<p>In any event I guess the question would best be: if you were able to give a person who was asleep a dose of caffeine would it wake them from sleep?</p></div>		</li>
