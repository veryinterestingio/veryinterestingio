			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histoplasmosis" target="_blank">histoplasmosis</a>- a lung infection you can get from breathing dust contaminated with bird droppings. Doesn't have much effect on lots of people but can turn nasty. If you've spent a lot of time with a particular type of bird, that's probably the one that caused it. </p>
<p>I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumed_ocular_histoplasmosis_syndrome" target="_blank">presumed ocular histoplasmosis</a> and I'm pretty sure I got it from chickens, because when I was a kid it was my job to sweep out the dirty soil and straw from the chook houses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't an infection. It was a piece of poop that probably got created into a cyst by the body. It was a small physical mass they thought might be cancer.</p>
<p>He had cancer before and only an irritation not a sickness. They did x-ray and saw a mass there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He lives in downtown Chicago and has a park in front of his building with a ton of pigeons.</p>
<p>I am sure they analyzed it after removing it to make the call but definitely a lot of pigeon droppings by his house.</p></div>		</li>
