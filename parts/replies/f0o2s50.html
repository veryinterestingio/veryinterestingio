			<div class="markdown"><p>I love playing around with my vision. With repeating pattern you can cross/uncross your eyes and then focus to the right depth (so it isn't blurry). The pattern will appear to be floating either closer to you (if you cross) or farther away (if you uncross). Basically the &quot;hidden image&quot; effect, but without the hidden image (just some repeating pattern, like tile or carpet or wall paper).</p></div>		</li>
