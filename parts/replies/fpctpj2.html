<p>the ADHD person experiences the world as UNDERSTIMULATING.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Im in my 40s and never looked at it this way. But that is very much how it feels.  The hyperactivity comes from the constant seeking of that stimulation. To throw in another analogy, it’s like the world is a library full of great books. I’ll excitedly pick one up, decide it’s too long, toss it on the floor &amp; grab another.  It’s too slow, so I’ll throw it and grab another. Boring...toss. Too heavy...toss. Found a good one that’s perfect...but...there are sooo many more...toss.  Not only am I seeking that stimulation, I’m also distracted by all the other potentially more stimulating option.</p>
<p>Unmedicated, there’s not a book in the building for me.  Over medicated, the building will burn down while I’m memorizing the encyclopedia section on animal husbandry. Incorrectly medicated, I’m on the floor in the toddler section yelling at everyone to come see how many words a actually start with “A”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t even read because I day dream too hard about irrelevant things. I will get fixated on a word such as “ice” in the sentence “he took a drink from his ice cold glass.” Suddenly I am daydreaming of polar bears due to some weird connection between ice&gt;ice caps&gt;polar bears. Next thing you know, I’ve mindlessly “read” ten paragraphs and retained nothing.</p></div>		</li>

If I have to read it and don't want to, I'm off in la-la land usually wondering the origins of ice then polar then eskimo then their tons of words for snow then I've missed everything...</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have thought about this quite extensively. I think the reason why we play games so much is because it's something that satisfies the dopamine levels in our brains and I don't just mean because we are rewarded with lights and sounds and short term feelings of accomplishment either.</p>
<p>This may sound a little confusing because i have never actually put it into words so I'm going to try to not confuse myself with this but I think I know why we cannot pull ourselves off of games.</p>
<p>Things are easier to focus on when they're inside of a box in front of you. It's kind of like blinders on a horse that allow them to look forward without getting distracted by all of the pedestrians and other cars. You may have background noises, thoughts, and visuals running constantly in the back of your mind but all of those distractions are not inside of that box.</p>
<p>Inside of a game, whether it is a video game or a board game, there are boundaries and limitations unlike life which is overwhelming at times. In a game you have only a few tasks at most to accomplish and all of those tasks are within that Box. While we are gaming we are thinking in the way a neurotypical brain thanks. Think of video games as putting on mind cancelling headphones.</p>
<p>Now this may sound like a good theory but you may ask where does the addiction come from? Why do we play for hours and hours on end while we ignore reality?</p>
<p>The reason this is is because all brains thrive on dopamine. If we do not have it then we are going to find it the same way any addiction works. The problem is that our brains do not get the dopamine it needs while the rest of the world see no problems when it comes to this. When we are not gaming, our minds make all those bizarre and intrusive thoughts. That is your brain trying to receive more dopamine. Video games is self medication for those with ADHD. You dont realize it but you are treating it. Self treatment is a survival mechanism. Without dopamine we cannot survive. It is the thing that gives human individuals the will to live.</p>
<p>While you are in a game or any other hyper focus session you might not even notice those background thoughts are even running. It's because they arent. Yoir brain is satisfied. Do you jump on your phone during loading screens? That's because your &quot;box&quot; isnt there yet.</p>

<p>Thats explained by the naure of dopamine and its receptors.Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is responsible for short term satisfaction. Which means not videogames are what causes the dopamin rush but the fast rewards. Same goes for social media and smartphones, which are even mora addicting and, as far as social media goes, dont even have a benefit like firing our more long term neurotransmitter, which you do get when doing more complex tasks with bigger goals like videogames or other hobbies like that. Those long term neutotransmitter have a much bigger impact on wether we feel content with our lives or not. While these hobbies also have fast rewards in their early stages, we with ADHD, as we have a dopamine deficiency, lose interest as soon as time between rewards increses. Thats why we get obsessed with a new hobbies for a couple of weeks but then lose interest as fast as we got it, to pursue the next hobby that gives our brain the dopamine it so desperately craves.</p>
<p>Now the receptors can &quot;overheat&quot;. That happens when we overstimulate them by giving them too much dopamine in a too short amount of time ie. only browsing reddit/tinder/twitter all day. Paired with the lack of long term neurotransmitter, lack of feeling of accomplishment we can enter a depressive phase, which basically renders us incapable of doing anything.But this isnt all bad, since lying in bed all day and not being able to motivate ourselves to do anything gives our Dopamine receptors time to &quot;cool down&quot; to be able to receive dopamine again and make us feel good. Problem is: the depressive phase feels horrible. Its basically withdrawal.</p>
<p>So how do we act in order to balance this in a healthy way? We limit our intake of fast dopamine sources. Or not partake in any high dopamine activities for a while, before our brain gets to addicted. What this means is: when we start a new hobby, dont let yourself get consumed by it. Make a timer or smt to stop yourself at some point. Make timeplans and try to stick to them. Use alarm clocks to help you with that. And most important of all:</p>
<p>Embrace boredom.</p>
<p>By embracing boredom, meditating, napping, listening to the sourroundings and not thinking about anything we give our dopamine receptors a much needed break without suffering the symptoms of a withdrawal.</p>

I remember being unmedicated and playing video games on a small tv while watching netflix on a bigger one and listening to music all at the same time. Finding the appropriate meds is tricky but now I dont have much trouble listening to a podcast from start to finish or playing guitar for an hour or two at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way my neuropsych prof explained it for us laymen is that even though it's called an attention deficit disorder, it is better understood as and executive function disorder. The part of the brain that allows us to focus attention, engage in planning, emotion regulation etc. (the prefrontal cortex) has lower than average activity. Those suffering from this disorder can in fact engage in hyper-attention, but they just can't control what that attention is drawn to. </p>
<p>Stimulants allow those suffering to re-engage those executive processes that the rest of us take for granted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is a more nuanced explanation. The way it was taught to me by a supervisor is that it’s a “sorting disorder.” Rather than choosing what to attend to, ADHD people try to eat the whole elephant at once. Thanks for the addition!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am ADHD, mild case, and symptoms have lessened as an adult. The strangest thing for me is I can plan, and regulate internally for anyone else or external thing that doesn’t involve myself. I can plan your wedding down to the minute, with detailed plans in my head or structured in a plan document, with all sorts of fail-safes and alternative paths but I can’t organize my clean or dirty clothing in my bedroom well, and when I try and fail it kills me. I can whiteboard out a process for you to do it a sustainable way meeting your needs but ask me to follow it and I am good for like 2 days.</p>
<p>It makes no sense and it embarrasses me that I  “know” yet struggle to “do” with consistency.</p>

<p>That's because your job fulfills your love of hyper focus and gives you that little dopamine hit that is so important to get you to do rewarding tasks. </p>
<p>You know you will not get that from doing mundane chores so they become disproportionately difficult. </p>
<p>I am the same, by the way. I love planning, and making spreadsheets and diagrams and doing the prep. When it comes to doing the actual task that you're planning for, that's when I struggle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, as both someone with ADHD and someone who went to college for psychology, this is bang on. Coincidentally, if you can work effective coping strategies and/or medication to utilize the hyperfocus state productively, it can be a massive advantage-but it potentially takes a long time to get to that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I have some idea. Caffeine is a stimulant, right? People complain of caffeine crashes all the time. I imagine it’s like that.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine binds to adenosine which is a chemical that builds up during the day and makes you tired. While caffeine binds to adenosine, you are still building up adenosine at the same time. Often the &quot;crash&quot; can be related to the caffeine wearing off and then you have the freeing up of the adenosine the caffeine was bound to in addition to the adenosine that has been building up. Other stimulants work differently, this is just for caffeine.</p></div>		</li>
