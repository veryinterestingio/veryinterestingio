			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is correct. Water exists in 3 compartments in the body: in the blood vessels as part of plasma, in the cells as part of cytoplasm, and in the interstitial (“in-between”) spaces of connective tissue and other cells. Compression over time pushes this fluid out causing the indentation. Take the compression away and it comes back.</p>
<p>To the other poster’s point about heart failure - one of the key characteristics of heart failure is volume overload: too much water in the body. Complicated and tangential to this question. But suffice to say, their limbs get big and swollen with this “third spacing”, or interstitial fluid collection, and you can very easily indent their skin. If you go to the doctor and they press on your shins, that’s what we’re looking for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Renal failure leads to a similar sign for a different reason. </p>
<p>We're looking for 3rd spacing/fluid overload. The cause of it can be varied</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not certain but I thought it had to do with some aspect of blood pressure, as in one of the symptoms of heart failure is such indentations being more severe regardless of the actual strength of the constriction.</p>
<p>Not certain but I'd say that would be the route for inquiring minds to follow, I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When this symptom is more severe it's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema" target="_blank">edema</a>, and it can be caused by heart problems, among other many things.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you would classify it that way in the type of cases OP is talking about though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Preeclampsia, a complication of pregnancy, is one of those other things. Not all my shoes fit when I had it, and the ones that did had to be unlaced a bit first. My feet were basically giant sausages. I didn't even have cankles. It went from calf to hey that's maybe a foot probably. </p>
<p>Kidney issues can also cause it.</p>
<p>Basically, people shouldn't ignore it if it's a recurring issue and you weren't sitting on your affected leg for five hours playing video games. Edema, unlike fat, will hold a depression if you press a finger into it with a little bit of force.</p></div>		</li>
