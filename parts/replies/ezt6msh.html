<p>Instead of using complicated code to display estimates, all you would need to do is display actual progress. That isn't as nice for humans, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also isn’t always possible, depending on the process. I’ve written one progress bar that cheats at 99% because some of the steps (mongo database queries for example) don’t give me any insight into how far along they are, so I have to guess. If I underestimate the time, it has to hang out around 99% for a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, the &quot;99%&quot; is only nice for humans.</p>
<p>If accuracy is the goal and a process isn't complete yet, then don't show that progress complete yet.</p>
<p>Think of progress more like a list of tasks and then check marks to denote completion. It won't give you an idea of how long the process will take, or where you are in time for the process, but it will be accurate.</p>
<p>The estimate piece is really only to give humans piece of mind, aka the computer isn't locked up, its still doing something, or humans don't get impatient waiting for a process they think should be quicker but isn't.</p></div>		</li>
