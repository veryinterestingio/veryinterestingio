			<div class="markdown"><p>I had permanent teeth removed as a kid because my jaw was too small. I guess nowadays they don't handle that the same way but that's how they did back in my day. Get off my lawn. But I've had dentists comment on the fact that my tongue is always injured and my cheeks are always injured from me biting them both probably because I had my teeth removed and so my mouth is all messed up and in a weird shape and blah blah blah</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>60% of us have an underdeveloped jaw that can make our tongue sit incorrectly in our mouths</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this why people occasionally say &quot;your tongue is not comfortable in your mouth&quot; ? (Along other awareness calls, like &quot;you now breathe manually&quot; or &quot;you now are aware of your blinking&quot;)</p>
<p>Because everyone seems upset when told it, but my tongue fit well and I'm not bothered at all, so maybe I'm from the 40%</p></div>		</li>
