			<div class="markdown"><p>What motivates us to do chores that are necessary for life? A hunter gatherer knows hunger and prepares for winter. A modern citizen usually has everything within arms reach, the daily rutine seemingly does not involve tasks directly related to survival, neither in the short nor long term. I guess Im asking if there are other &quot;survival&quot; hormones than dopamine normally being produced in the body, but not much in a modern citizen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Need food. Chores get food. </p>
<p>Remember that this current dopamine excess is pretty recent. For most of human history dopamine was quite difficult to get. Even if you were extremely rich and never had to do anything yourself, you'd still find it quite hard to get dopamine because there just wasn't that much to do. Besides sex, anyway, which many religions restricted (and people took religion pretty seriously back then).</p>
<p>It's also not <em>just</em> about dopamine. It's also about the avoidance of suffering. Your brain only pursues dopamine if it's not experiencing suffering, which means those who are experiencing it are likely to search for a way to avoid it first, meaning get food, safety and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep this is the truth. I had a realization earlier today, and may spend more time getting into it later in a post somewhere, but I strongly believe that if we normalized <em>everyone</em> spending time alone in the remote wilderness for ~1-3 weeks in a minimalist, survival experience, society would probably improve greatly. People would discover really quickly whether their beliefs are truly righteous or not.</p></div>		</li>
