The probability at any sort of cosmic scale is 1 in such an unimaginably large number that all of the interactions between all the particles in the universe since the beginning of the universe doesn't even come close, so in a practical sense it's zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's another one of those thought experiments that has been slightly twisted in the public interpretation. The original idea was purely to illustrate the concept of infinity, by saying that if you left the chimps for an infinite amount of time, it's very likely one of them would eventually type Shakespeare. The human mind can sort of get a feel for how unlikely this is, based on real experience of bashing at a keyboard and looking at the resulting gibberish.</p>
<p>Of course an infinite amount of time does not exist, so the experiment is impossible, but it doesn't invalidate the thought process. </p>
<p>Whether one or the other is more likely is going to take some number-crunching. Let me get back to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're telling me... there is a chance? </p>
<p>In all seriousness, does it change anything that there are just A LOT of electrons around? About as many as the probability is tiny? And then there is time as well. A tiny probability times a great many objects that exist for a great many moments?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but think about it this way, the chance is so low that it would take trillions of years before you'd find an electron randomly on the wrong side of the room. The universe hasn't even been around for trillions of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A probability where the exponent has an exponent which has an exponent.</p>
<p>So like, let's say you express a probability between 0 and 1. The probability of finding an electron from an atom might be expressed as 91.518 * 10^-1000^1000^172.</p>
<p>Very few things have a probability of 0 in the universe given the uncountable infinity of numbers between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Edit: So maybe there's some sort of rendering bug since this used to work but that number -1000 is supposed to have its own exponent of 1000 which also has an exponent of 172.</p></div>		</li>
