			<div class="markdown"><p>All correct apart from the white LED junction, which doesn't exist (white LED packages, including those in RGBW chips, can either be a mix of different LED colours mixed carefully or a specific frequency LED with a phosphor wrapped round it that absorbs that singe wavelength and emits whitish light). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  They coat an LED in the spectrum close to blue with phosphor,  as these will produce the most light. They do produce much warmer led's for this purpose now,  ex. car headlamp LED'S are in the 4500-5000k range,  but older tech led's are cheaper to produce,  so there are a lot of the blue-ish led's on the market. A lot of 6500k aftermarket led bulbs for cars and flashlights. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s because they <em>are</em> blue. </p>
<p>Blue light has more energy per photon than red light. </p>
<p>Phosphorescence is the phenomenon used here to convert the narrow spectrum LED light to a broad spectrum white. In phosphorescence a photon is absorbed and then re-emitted. </p>
<p>That phenomenon <em>cannot</em> add energy - where would it come from, but it can lose energy - this allows lower energy photons to be emitted than what was absorbed by the phosphorescent material. But never the other way around. </p>
<p>Basically it can convert a blue photon to a lower energy green or yellow or red photon - but it cannot convert a lower energy red photon to any higher energy colour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely not.  TV screens, and monitors are either LCD's which filter light on the RGB wavelengths or AMOLED but not traditional LED's.  About 10 years ago the LCD panels were switched from being backlit from CFL's to LED's for some reason the industry decided to call the new panels LED's even though the panels hadn't changed but the way there were lit up had.</p>
