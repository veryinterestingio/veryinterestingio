			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the complete and correct answer. More time indoors = more time to be around sick people. It's just more opportunity for crowding is all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not the complete answer. It is a combination of several factors, as others have said:</p>
<p>Winter makes it easier for pathogens to spread because:</p>
<ul>
<li>More time indoors in close proximity to people.</li>
<li>Windows closed more, further enclosing air inside.</li>
<li>Dry heated rooms causing your nose to not filter as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summer makes it harder for pathogens to spread because:</p>
<ul>
<li>More time outdoors</li>
<li>Windows open more (when you are indoors, the ventilation is better)</li>
<li>More sunlight hours and more direct sunlight (UV can kill pathogens)</li>
<li>Heat makes pathogens survive less time on surfaces</li>
<li>Humidity makes your nose filter work better</li>
<li><del>Lower air pressure makes droplets fall to the floor faster?</del> (e: apparently air pressure is the same in summer and winter, thanks /u/was14atyme)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering most adults spend 40+ hours per week at their typically indoor workplaces regardless of season, does that just mean that all office buildings (and schools) should install lots of humidifiers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I wish I was a microbiologist, I'm curious as to the optimum humidity level for most diseases. I also wonder how many diseases thrive in say, humid tropic biomes than colder northern or drier desert biomes. </p>
<p>On the humidifier idea, too much humidity encourages mold growth as well as causing woodwork to swell where as too little humidity can be a fire hazard and can cause health issues in humans. Still an interest idea to look into</p></div>		</li>

<p>to answer in ELI5 style:
in winter people spend more time inside of buildings due to the cold weather. </p>

<p>You clearly haven't visited southern Texas. People spend way more time indoors in the summer than in the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, Thailand’s flu season is during its rainy months when temperatures are still in the high 20s/low 30s. I’d say people spend less time indoors during those months (minus avoiding rain showers) than during April and May when temperatures can reach high 30s.</p>
<p>So I’m a bit confused.</p></div>		</li>
