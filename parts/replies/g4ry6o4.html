			<div class="markdown"><p>The irony here is that people with darker skin actually have higher incidence rates of skin cancer because they think that their darker skin makes them less susceptible to it, so they spend more time in the sun and wear less sunscreen. I guess they think that if they never burn, there's no risk of getting cancer, when really ANY exposure to the sun can result in cancerous cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, technically the actual incidence rates for Caucasians are higher, although finding actual recent numbers on the issue is proving difficult... what I meant by my comment was the incidence rates of serious or life threatening skin cancers.</p>
<p>People of color are less likely to get skin cancer (overall) but when they do get it, there is a much higher chance of it being serious or life threatening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I tell my friends to wear sunscreen, but they always cut me off saying they're brown, they tan, and they won't get any cancer. Wish they realize less risk is still risky.</p></div>		</li>
