			<div class="markdown"><p>My teeth were majorly screwed before braces. I even had the herst appliance to fix my jaw alignment.
Never wore my retainer and my tops are great. My lowers have 1 jacked up tooth but they certainly didnt go back to their original position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's not 100% teeth will become crooked again without wearing a retainer, just higher chance. I had braces for four years. I also never wore my retainer. I have two slightly crooked teeth now, one top and one bottom. Still way better than before I had braces when I had a giant gap between my front two top teeth that I could whistle through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My orthodontist told me I could stop wearing my retainer after like 3-4 years</p>
<p>didn't find out until last year (about 10 years after I stopped wearing a retainer) that it was recommended you wear it every night</p>
<p>although it is pretty unlikely my teeth would go back to how it was before - I had an overbite, an underbite, and a crossbite - and it changed the shape of my mouth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to purposely yawn really wide to pop them out and go to the nurse with them hanging out of my mouth. She obviously couldn't do anything for me so it was an instant ticket to being sent home early.</p>
<p>My teeth were perfectly straight, it was just my jaw that needed help. Unfortunately they put braces on regardless and now my bottom front teeth are crooked. I didn't think I needed to wear my retainer because my teeth were straight before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After a week of having it I had my mom take me back to the ortho to remove them. I was in so much pain that I didn't want to eat or talk. I was also very prone to canker sores and had gotten them in the areas it kept rubbing making it immensely worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They <em>can</em> move back, but it's not guaranteed. I haven't worn my retainer in like 15 years and my teeth haven't shifted. And mine were bad enough it took 6 years of braces to fix.</p></div>		</li>
