			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this &quot;visualization&quot; of its size, from Wikipedia</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is so large that the observable universe is far too small to contain an ordinary digital representation of Graham's number, assuming that each digit occupies one Planck volume, possibly the smallest measurable space. But even the number of digits in this digital representation of Graham's number would itself be a number so large that its digital representation cannot be represented in the observable universe. Nor even can the number of digits of that numberâ€”and so forth, for a number of times far exceeding the total number of Planck volumes in the observable universe.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how I first heard of it.  A million has seven digits, a billion has ten and so forth.  The number of digits in Graham's Number is so uncountably huge that the number of digits in <em>that</em> number is also uncountable, and the number of digits <em>in the number of digits of the number of digits</em> ... and so on, to the point that the number of times you have to say &quot;the number of digits in&quot; is uncountable before the universe itself burns out and goes quiet forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would have to be for its actual use, as it is a specific number after all. As I said I don't know the details on the problem it was used to answer, but I see some others have described it.</p>
<p>I believe that Graham's number is the largest number ever actually used in a proof, which is the source of its fame. But you can come up with bigger ones. G<em>65 is immeasurably bigger than Graham's number for sure. So is G</em>(1000000000). Or G_(G_64). you can go all day with this, lol.</p></div>		</li>
