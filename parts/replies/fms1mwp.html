			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great post, but some RNA viruses do actually have ways to correct mistakes made during replication. Betacoronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 encode a protein with exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity which performs proofreading much like the exonuclease domain of many DNA polymerases. It's one of the reasons they have relatively lower mutation rates compared to other ssRNA viruses.</p></div>		</li>

Now since there aren't even enough test for humans we can hardly expect all domestic pets to be tested. But I feel like the virus will be here for a while longer. I've set my hopes on a vaccine asap.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How did infections like measles and polio come to be in the first place? If they were hypothetically eradicated, could they show up again the same way they did initially?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just evolution. There are close relatives of measles virus that infect other groups of mammals (there is one that infects canine, one that infects felines, another that infects ruminants...), and they all evolve from a common ancestor that's probably already eradicated by now. But they have all become pretty specialized and the human niche is already occupied by measles, so it's unlikely if measles is eradicated, one of its extant relatives can jump into human to replace measles. It's pretty hard for something to evolve twice. But not entirely impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually raises a question I've been wondering about. How much niche competition happens in viruses?</p>
<p>Presumably there's some competition for resources if two viruses are in the same host but with the wide variety of ways they infect different cells, does that make it less common for them to compete for the same cells?</p>
<p>Do they have mechanisms to attack each other or otherwise &quot;claim their territory&quot;, so to speak?</p></div>		</li>

<p>unlikely? the earth has had like 5 mass extinction and I am pretty sure the &quot;eyes&quot; function and morphology stayed the same. also proto algae and stuff.
And Virus are much simpler life forms, I am pretty sure they could do it dozen times given the time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In those cases when they were &quot;hypothetically eradicated&quot; transmissions basically got to the point where it was so low the virus was likely to die out at some point due to lack of hosts to infect, either by isolation or by immunity. </p>
<p>However, every single time a virus replicates itself, it's possible it could mutate and allow it to be slightly different than before. Even if it's mostly the same, if the body's antibodies (from vaccine or prior infection) don't recognize that specific version of the virus, then it will be like a brand new infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although viruses are far less complex I think that would be like asking “could the dinosaurs show up again?” Once it’s gone, it’s gone.</p>
<p>I don’t know a whole lot about the viral life (?) cycle but I suppose eradicated viruses could only re-emerge through evolution from a common ancestor, although the odds of repeat evolution creating essentially the same virus (in this case measles or polio) are probably totally astronomical.</p>
<p>But disclaimer, science was always my worst school subject. :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read about outbreaks of an old virus being triggered by laboratory accidents. That is, a virus was eliminated in the wild, but was kept preserved in a laboratory for research purposes, and then escaped from there and re-infected the human population.</p>
<p>This is the likely cause for the <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/ops/hsc-scen-3_pandemic-1977.htm" target="_blank">1977 Russian flu pandemic</a>. After the Spanish flu, the 1957 flu pandemic was the deadliest outbreak of the 20th century, and that exact flu strain reappeared in 1977 after having disappeared long ago. This is unlikely to happen by chance, given how rapidly &amp; chaotically flu strains mutate, and was instead blamed on a laboratory accident in the USSR or PRC that released a preserved 1957 virus back onto the population.</p></div>		</li>
