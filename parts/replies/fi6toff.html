			<div class="markdown"><p>To me, removing the comma in the second example (2a-&gt;2b) doesn't really add clarity in the same way that adding it in the first does (1b-&gt;1a). The clear version of 2a would be something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This comment is dedicated to my mother, to Ayn Rand, and to Joseph Stalin.</p>

<p>This comment is dedicated to Ayn Rand, Joseph Stalin, and my mother.
This comment is dedicated to Ayn Rand, Joseph Stalin and my mother.</p>
<p>Clarity neither requires nor prohibits the Oxford comma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if reordering doesn’t add clarity? Like if you’re emphasizing that Ayn Rand is your mother:</p>
<p>1a) My mother, Ayn Rand, Joseph Stalin, and I went to the park.</p>
<p>You can’t really reorder it because yourself is always suppose to go last. You could write it like this:</p>
<p>1b) Myself, Joseph Stalin, and my mother, Ayn Rand, went to the park.</p>
<p>But that would be seen as grammatically incorrect to use myself to most people. In this case, I don’t think it’s necessary to put a comma between “Ayn Rand” and “my mother”, because it isn’t being used as an Oxford comma, but rather as a parenthesis.</p>
<p>1c) My mother Ayn Rand, Joseph Stalin, and I went to the park.</p>
<p>In this case, I didn’t have to reorder it. I just had to remove an unnecessary comma that wasn’t being used as an Oxford comma. Whenever I describe someone or something in this way, I almost never use a comma, but that’s probably because I always use the Oxford comma. I guess what I’m dying to say is if you always use an Oxford comma, there doesn’t have to be ambiguity. You don’t have to reorder a sentence. There’s ways around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find in the second example that the oxford comma neither elucidates nor makes it less clear. </p>
<p>Also what I've read in this thread, a lot of the use of oxford comma would be solved simply by using a synonym for &quot;and&quot;, such as 'as well as' etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Example 2a can be interpreted as 3 people...
my mother
Ayn Rand
Joseph Stalin</p>
<p>...or as 2 people...
my mother, who is Ayn Rand
Joseph Stalin</p>
<p>Consider the following:
EX 2c:  My mother, Ayn Rand, went to the zoo.
Ex 2d:  My mother, Ayn Rand, and Joseph Stalin went to the zoo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example 2, imo the sentence should just be written differently. 2a isn't using an oxford comma. It's using commas in place of parentheses. Removing it is grammatically incorrect. </p>
<p>2c) My mother, ayn rand, went to the zoo. (Correct)</p>
<p>2d) My mother, ayn rand went to the zoo. (Incorrect).</p>
<p>Rewrite the sentence:</p>
<p>2e) this book is dedicated to Joseph Stalin and my mother, Ayn Rand. (Here there is no comma because there are only 2 items in the list)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree and believe that is the beauty of the rules.  Example 2a shiuld only be interpreted as 3 people because it is a list separated by commas.  Using the rules, if you wanted two people you would write...  my mother Ayn Rand, and Joseph Stalin.
Making the comma use &quot;optional&quot; is what introduces the ambiguity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a church for a while as the front desk person.  We were hiring a new minister and I put together a job ad that said they would work on &quot;Monday, Wednesday and Sunday&quot;</p>
<p>One of the board members went to mat over adding a comma.  I said it wasn't necessary.</p>
<p>He countered &quot;The comma adds clarity and as <religion> we should always strive to be as clear a possible&quot;</p>
<p>The pastor found out and called up the board member and ripped him a new one, saying that if he ever heard this board member trying to use religion to trump a grammatical debate again he wouldn't be on the board any longer.</p>
<p>I defend that nobody was confused by my original statement and that I will always remember this story every time an oxford comma gets brought up.</p></div>		</li>
