			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the pain from wisdom tooth removals is from inflammation, at least early on. You're better off to do 800mg of ibuprofen, which is an anti-inflammatory. I barely even touched the hydrocodone they prescribed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ate edibles to survive the pain for a few days. Holy fuck did vicodin suck. I was like 19 and had only ever smoked weed and I found myself having brown outs (or maybe I've blocked some of it out?) on the afternoon after my wisdom tooth surgery. I came to at one point laying on the couch with my arms and legs held away from my body like a plague victim. Foaming at the mouth. Just like, twitching but it felt like I was vibrating. Never took another pill of it.</p></div>		</li>
