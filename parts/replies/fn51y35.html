			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, sailing is easy, relatively speaking, on still waters and calm winds. Get out to sea for several weeks if not months at a time and you're bound to run into bad weather. That's when it gets real challenging to keep a bunch of planks up right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, this answer is perfect. So much of human history is much easier to understand if you can discount all the discoveries and advancements we have had since. On a similar note, I'm really glad that we don't have a way of recording smells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The currents in the North Atlantic Ocean make a clockwise circuit around the edges of the ocean.  The winds do the same thing, with the strongest winds (the Trade Winds) crossing the ocean headed west in the south and in the north returning east to Europe.  Sailing ships generally followed this circuit, so the crossings themselves were hastened by the Trade Winds, and a great deal of the voyages consisted of following the milder winds along the coasts south from Europe to northwest Africa and north from northeast South America to New England or Canada.  But not <em>right</em> by the coast.  If a storm came up, you didn't want to be any place where rocks near the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, we still follow these winds for transatlantic travel.  Planes fly along the jet stream when traveling from North America to Europe and gain a huge speed boost and fuel savings from the tail wind provided by Jet Stream.</p>
<p>Just a few months ago a new subsonic transatlantic record was set with peak ground speed of about 850mph, but the aircraft was still moving at 85% the speed of sound within the air around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was really bad idea to sail west on the northern atlantic back in those days because of the trade winds. You would go south to cross west and north to cross east. And most sailors still do</p></div>		</li>
