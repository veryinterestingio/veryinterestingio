			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a family shoelace meme (in the original sense of the word) that has been passed down from my grandfather. In the RAF in WW2 he was taught to lace his boots so that the laces went straight across, so if they needed to cut the boot off they could just go straight up through a column of single laces.</p>
<p>He taught it to his son, who taught it to me, and now I do it for my kids' shoes. Of course it will probably die with them as their kids will have power laces or spray on shoes or they'll just be jacked into the Uniweb or whatever but still...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dropped sword in foot like a dumb ass. Is true.  Laces can be done up so that the boot can come off faster with less agitation to the foot inside oddly enough it came in handy for me about a week after I changed the lacing on my boots.
Ok so here is the story I was playing dungeons and dragons with some friends and I was messing around with a replica of the sword Sting(from lord of the rings) I was doing the basic dumb teenager thing of not spinning but like rotating the sword in my hand to look cool when I lost control. It slipped out of my hand and gravity like the bitch it is decided to slam that sword straight through the soft part of my boot and into the top of my foot nicking an artery. Next thing I know there is blood squirting up and out of my boot like a squirt gun and I’m on the floor trying to apply pressure and get the boot off thankfully the laces allowed me to get them off pretty quick.<br />
This has been story time of a dumbass, enjoy my stupidity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Velcro is loud.  The US Army removed velcro from their uniforms around 2010 since the opening of flaps gave positions away.</p>
<p>Edit: To the 1,000 replies saying they still have velcro:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not true at all.</p>
<p>Army uniforms still have Velcro, they replaced cargo pants pocket retainers with buttons over Velcro around 2012/2013ish. The noise wasn’t a issue, they just wore out super fast and the pocket wouldn’t stay closed when full of random shit.</p>
<p>Velcro is still used on a ton of military shit like pouches, body armor, helmets, etc.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My US Army training included none of that shit whatsoever. No Med Kit? Use a belt for tourniquet. We ain’t Medics so not making any fancy splints with laces, just maybe sticks and 100mph tape or you guessed it, your squad mate’s belts. And this ain’t the cub scouts so there ain’t no campfires and marshmallow roasting to ruin light discipline and give up your unit’s position to the enemy.  You don’t get fire no matter how cold it is. </p>
<p>And you keep your laces on your boots because they protect your feet. Without your feet you are useless as a soldier. </p></div>		</li>

One day I was putting on my boots and wrapped my hand around the stove pipe for leverage.  Ended up burning my hand pretty bad, but on the bright side was sent back to Okinawa three weeks early.  1stSgt was not pleased with my fieldstache whenever I checked back in.  Hard to believe this was over ten years ago.  </p></div>		</li>
