			<div class="markdown"><p>This really doesn't answer the question. You repeat that there is a pain response and why it's there, but not where it arises</p>
<p>The iris size changes in response to the bright light, but I believe the photoreceptors adjusting their gain (on the time scale of tens of seconds) is a bigger effect - it can adjust over several orders of magnitude (they have to send an output signal that varies across two orders of magnitude to send information to the brain about an input the can vary across many more orders of magnitude)</p>
<p>I don't know if the downstream visual processing parts of the brain play a role in calculating what's too bright, but the photoreceptors definitely play a role in telling the brain that light is too bright. The actual pain you feel will arise from the brain itself, not the retina (pain is a response to perceived stimulus, and a stimulus isn't perceived until the signal representing it reaches the brain)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the pupil can only adjust light level by a limited amount (10x, maybe?). The retina can adjust across many orders of magnitude</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, when a person is in intense emotional distress the same parts of the brain light up under scans as light up when they experiencing physical pain. So when you're hurting emotionally that's not a metaphor according to your brain, emotional and physical pain are all just pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much the problem with opiates. the dream opiate is one which relieves physical pain only. There are opiates which do that, but they usually have extreme side effects such as intense hallucinations and dysphoria, as the kappa opioid receptor still appears to relieve physical pain, but so far all drugs have the extreme side effects that are far worse than morphine's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physical therapist here: Pain is always real, and it is always a construct of your brain. As the OP said, it’s your brain’s way of telling you <strong><em>DANGER</em></strong>. </p>
<p>What this means is that even without physical stimulus, a person who says they’re in pain, is in pain. The brain doesn’t care that nothing is “causing” the pain, it is responding to something that it believes is a threat. </p>
<p>What makes this so cool is that this opens up whole new avenues to dealing with chronic pain. Because they’ve been in pain for so long, the brain has started to associate different movements, or movement in general with pain. As a result, you start anticipating pain before the movement even starts, which reinforces the danger, and illicits the pain response. One of the ways we’ve started treating chronic pain is by working in ranges of motion under that threshold of pain. The brain starts associating movement with not having pain (or better yet, feeling good), and it relaxes its guard. We see less compensatory motions, less muscle guarding, and better movement patterns. The pain free range improves too! The key is not to overdo things, and to stay <em>under</em> (not bringing it up to) that range of pain!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the subject of toe stubbing. We all know the feeling when we hit ourselves in a way which will <em>really</em> hurt just about a second from now. You say it's because the signal needs to travel up the spine. But when that happens, the &quot;touch&quot; feeling of you stubbing your toe actually feels instant, as opposed to the &quot;pain&quot; feeling, which needs a second to travel. How come the touch feeling propagates faster than the pain? Don't they need to travel along the same nerves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain and temperature go through slower and different nerves than touch. </p>
<p>When you stub your toe you also have a spinal reflex to pull away without input from your brain. To save time. </p>
<p>Same goes for when you touch something hot and pull away. </p></div>		</li>
