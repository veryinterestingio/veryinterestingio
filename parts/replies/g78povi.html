			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're mildly lactose intolerant (like I was), you can actually change your gut flora by regularly consuming lactose. Over a long period of time, the presence of undigested lactose in the large intestine places a selective pressure on the bacteria that live there to utilize this new and abundant food source, and over time, they can actually evolve to digest lactose more efficiently, which can sometimes relieve the symptoms of lactose intolerance.</p>
<p>Source: discovered this while doing research for my MS thesis on colon cancer, and only realized in retrospect that I apparently beat my colon into submission by constantly drinking milk for years, despite its gaseous pleas for me to stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Results may vary. I drank milk daily for years with no issues and all throughout high school. Then one day in college, it flipped like a switch, and I could no longer consume milk or ice cream after that. </p>
<p>Before that day, most of my daily diet contained some sort of dairy. Milk, cheese, yoghurt, ice cream. So my gut flora certainly had a lot of choices to pick from.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I can still handle cheese just fine, even if it's a lot of cheese. It's straight-up milk, greek yoghurt, buttermilk pancakes or ice cream that I can't handle except in the smallest quantities (e.g a teaspoon).</p>
<p>Not a microbiologist nor an expert, and I certainly have less expertise than a MS student who's done their research. Just offering my two cents of experience, because I'm not sure your method is viable for everyone. Otherwise, people who consume dairy regularly yet gradually become lactose intolerant over time wouldn't have that happen to them, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple different types of lactose intolerance, and different outcomes, as shown in this thread.<br />
I personally experienced sudden onset intolerance in my mid-20’s while on an antibiotics regimen.  My doctor was less than helpful when I mentioned that it had happened, so I didn’t realize that it was a possible side effect of the medication.<br />
It was only some years later that I learned it could happen that way, so after some dietary experimentation I seem to have cured it by eating yogurt.  No more having to carry around lactaid pills whenever I might go out to eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience is similar to Yukimor's, in that it doesn't align with op.</p>
<p>I've been lactose intolerant for as long as I can remember, but only really figured it out when I was in my 20s. Growing up, I ate a bowl or two of cereal nearly every morning and ice cream was my favorite snack. I was sick daily, but I just thought that was normal.</p>
<p>My lactose intolerance has only gotten more severe as I've gotten older.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I think most people discover they're lactose intolerant around their early 20s and I'm not sure why. I also grew up eating a lot of dairy and had cereal with milk almost every day growing up. Then around 19 I had cheesecake for my birthday and couldn't handle it. </p>
<p>I can handle some brands of yogurt, a bit of cheese, and ice cream (for some reason), but I switched most of my dairy out for plant milk alternatives. It's been years since I've tried anything new with dairy because I don't think the risk is worth it. I've given up on dairy for a number of reasons and don't really miss it but I still have lactase tablets just in case. </p>
<p>With regards to OP, a cousin of mine developed lactose intolerance but continued with dairy to &quot;train&quot; her body and she says it works. It could work for you but I wouldn't want to put my body through that. I guess some people really love dairy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do the same thing when I was younger and dumber. I didn’t know how to listen to my body and would self diagnose incorrectly.</p>
<p>For example I would eat spicy foods and the next day my ass would be on fire. I tried attributing it to IBS for a while before realizing I was just eating shitty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well your ass being on fire is because of  capsaicin. the stuff that makes peppers spicy. it's an oil, and isn't always broken down completely by your gut. so when it comes out.....well, it burns. just like it does when it's in your mouth. not because you were eating shitty. spicy food is good for you!</p></div>		</li>

It's understandable people don't know about protein allergies, but comments like yours help to educate the masses. You'd be amazed how many foods in the grocery store contain modified milk ingredients!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have a dairy allergy and really appreciated them explaining the difference. I've had to become a professional at explaining the difference at least, though I don't know enough about the biology behind intolerance to answer this ELI5. I just know the biology behind how the allergy works. It can definitely be hard dealing with the allergy, but I've managed to survive so far. I'm one of the luckier ones since I am able to manage it well without the hospital and don't have to worry about cross contamination for packaged good most of the time (though it's still a major issue at restaurants). Unfortunately it might be getting worse though, since I've noticed my reactions have gotten faster and my last one landed me in urgent care 1.5 hours after I took Benadryl for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, you can't actually provide a short explanation on this thread. It has to be a certain length or it gets rejected. So detailed is kind of a mandatory component of the comments by default xD but it is very kind of them to take the time to share their knowledge and sources with us. Helps to make the world a better place.</p></div>		</li>
