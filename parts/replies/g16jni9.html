			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and let's just burn up all that trash and pollute our atmosphere instead of our oceans, that'll fix the problem! Along with an enormous release of dioxin so we can reduce the human population via cancer at the same time! /s</p>
<p>In all seriousness, incinerators are a health hazard. Yes, the more advanced ones do a decent job at trapping noxious gasses and smoke, but they aren't perfect.  They pollute the air and these green companies working so hard to clean up pollution aren't going to be willing to just change its form and contribute to the global warming situation. Also, the ash byproduct is highly toxic and dangerous to the environment and requires additional treatment.</p>
<p>Now, for recycling. You should go look up the energy consumption required by our &quot;recycling&quot; programs.  It's also not cost effective whatsoever. We don't have the technology to automate the separation of different types of plastic,  and because each plastic can only be recycled with its same type,  that means we have to do it manually.  Then you also have to consider additives that can also render it unrecycleable. So think of all of the millions of different types of plastic out there that can't be recycled together. The ocean isn't just polluted with a billion coke bottles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not only that, but that mass of garbage is a hazard to navigation so boats can't really get near.</p>

<p>Hardly. While it's a huge problem, you could take a boat through it and not even notice it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of you first paragraph is true except for the first sentence. It is no hazard to navigation and there is nothing to &quot;break up&quot;. There is about one water bottle's worth of plastic in each Olympic swimming pool's worth of water.</p></div>		</li>
