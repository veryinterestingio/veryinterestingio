			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect this could be done with any animal that has mostly consistent brightness in their natural appearance - eg, the opossum, while having its darker (dark ish?) face, had most of its body the same brightness as... Well, itself. So you can darken the image quite a lot and still be able to see it well. I'm guessing it would also need to not have much patterning?</p>
<p>Please note, this is all conjecture. I could be 100% wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took some introductory neuroscience in college, and one thing I remember is that the brain doesn't handle images like a computer handles an image file. Instead it has several different ways to sense separate aspects of what you're seeing. And it's really good at detecting edges and movement. Kind of like the image you're seeing is built on an interpretation of already recognized patterns, such as where discontinuities are.</p>
<p>I think the contrast/color is not at important as the shapes. Nor do I think the opposum is important, other than it's smoothness. I think if the color does anything, it enhances an existing effect.</p></div>		</li>
