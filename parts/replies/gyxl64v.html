<p>This contraction of the spleen creates an oxygen boost by ejecting oxygenated red blood cells into circulation and has been found to provide up to a 9% increase in oxygen, thereby prolonging dive time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thereâ€™s much more oxygen storage in the lungs than the blood, especially if you replace the nitrogen with pure oxygen and take a deep breath. 6 litres or so compared to about 1 in the blood. Rough oxygen consumption is 250ml/min so with 7 litres of reserve you could last potentially about 28 minutes on a single breath before expiring.</p></div>		</li>
