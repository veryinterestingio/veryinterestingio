			<div class="markdown"><p>edit: <strong>My comment was pedantic.</strong></p>
<p>Almost all of your examples are type III (immune complex-mediated) hypersensitivity reactions but OP was more specifically asking about type II (antibody-mediated).</p>
<p>I think a <del>much better</del> example would be Guillain-Barre syndrome after a influenza or Campylobacter infection. Rheumatic fever is another <del>better</del> example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just reread the question, and you’re totally right. OP didn’t specify that the antibodies bind or are directed against host antigens.</p>
<p>Today I’m gonna admit I was wrong on the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol i also creamed myself at the thought of getting to explain guillain barre syndrome in the wild. it's so widely taught for such a rare disease, maybe because its just a perfect/simple example of type 2 hypersensitivity reactions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's certainly rare in the general population, but it's actually a really common diagnosis in inpatient neurology. Guillain-Barre and other related autoimmune polyneuropathies (e.g. CIDP) are in the top five most common diagnoses on our unit! There's perpetually a couple people on the unit who have it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to counter this, for those living in fear of our immune system now, there is a process called thymic education, that is very good at making sure our immune system does not recognize self.  There is a lot that goes in to this, but it basically is selecting for stuff that can recognize presented proteins, but weeding out those that recognize our body's own proteins.  </p>
<p>This is not a perfect system.  We have areas, like in our eyes and testes, that are so well protected that we give it the name immune priviledge.  Some times, people get those areas hurt and damaged (exposing it to the immune system), and some of those people develop immune responses that results in more damage the other healthy tissue because our body does not see that as self.  It isn't perfect, but it is what we have.</p></div>		</li>
