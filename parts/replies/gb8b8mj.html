			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting is that it's pretty hard to kill someone unless you injure them in a few areas. </p>
<p>Someone stabs you 10 times in the chest, but one of them severs the  aorta, that's almost certainly the one that killed you. The other 9 might have been fatal over longer terms, but that was a more immediate issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes. people dont die from flesh wounds. they die of organ failure or th e lack of blood. you need a couple of things: breathing, brain activity and blood pressure. the heart has to beat as well. if all that is a given, then people dont just die from wounds.</p>
<p>I was burned and immideately put in a coma. the first thing they did was to make sure that my whole system stayed stable - that is not that easy when the skin gets so tight that all the fluids are leaking out by the hour.</p>
<p>there is massive swelling, you got a tube in your throat so it cant swell shut. the burned skin is incised, so it doesnt tear uncontrollably.</p>
<p>in the 3rd day or so the swelling is over. you should have been stripped of your dead skin by now. only then the treatment as such begins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The burned skin is incised so it doesn't cause compartment syndrome. Skin is tough. Really, really tough. Even damaged it is resistant to tearing. However, one of the responses to injury to tissue is swelling. Severe burns cause lots of damage and so you get lots of swelling. </p>
<p>Because the skin won't tear as more and more fluid is squeezing into the area, eventually the pressure from all that fluid collapses the veins and arteries supplying the area, shutting off the supply. No more supply, no more fresh blood. No more blood, tissue begins to die and become necrotic. That tissue is dead and unrecoverable by that point, and will potentially poison the rest of your body with an influx of intra-cellular potassium once the swelling goes down, and that will fuck up your heart and kill you. </p>
<p>The skin gets cut so that the tissue has room to swell and expand without cutting off the blood supply and causing compartment syndrome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something crazy about hearts. It’s an actual medical practice to physically reach into the chest cavity and pump the heart itself if a defibrillator/CPR isn’t working. I think it’s called a pulmonary massage and it’s a sort of “last resort” type of technique</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s fascinating to know how easy and how difficult it is to kill a human at the same time.</p>
<p>You’d have to stab them several times in relatively specific areas, maybe break some specific bones.</p>
<p>Or give some of them a peanut</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But like how much time after death does a wound have to occur to be differentiable from a live wound? If somebody is impaled in the heart and dies, then their head is cut off, how much time would have to pass between the two events before you could tell which came first? Let's assume they're upside down so blood still flows out without a heartbeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert but I know one of the main differences is there is no bleeding after death. The blood pressure in the vessels would drop pretty quickly once the heart stops beating so actually not a lot of time would pass before things will look different.</p></div>		</li>
