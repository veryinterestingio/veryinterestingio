<p>Compare that to a ZWave bulb I have... I think the factory reset for that basically boils down to &quot;With the fixture on, unscrew, and screw in the bulb a few times&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought that meant I needed to call them, register my device, etc.</p>
<p>Nope, turns out I literally had to plug the devices into the wall, connect one to my cable, and then connect them together using the only cord that would fit to connect them. Then I logged in, followed basic instructions, and <em>ta da!</em>, I'm connected.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That means they also need to be able to understand the USB communications protocol, and potentially keep up with its 5 gb/s speed.</p>
<p>... Meanwhile memory in Apollo computers was wired by hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the poster meant outdated in the sense that we’re so far past that point now that even basic electronics have more computing power. It’d be akin to someone in 1900 saying the first cars could go faster than horse-drawn carriages. That was true then and it’s true now but we don’t say it in 2020 because it’s just a universal truth now.</p></div>		</li>
