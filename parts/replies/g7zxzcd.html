			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't need to point it at the box, it's probably Bluetooth or something like it. </p>
<p>There's still a rainbow of Bluetooth varieties that range from &quot;Shit&quot; to &quot;Change the channel from 2 houses away&quot; though.  It would seem Altice has gone with the &quot;Shit&quot; variety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a Harmony remote.  It was intended to be used from the phone app (Shitty), but came with a fairly simple remote, that communicates to the base via RF.  The main unit is an IR blaster, and has a plug-in IR blaster on a cord to place in a different location.</p>
<p>Works fucking fantastic.  RF means it doesn't have to be pointing anywhere near the tv to work.  I love the thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I have is probably closer to the Harmony Companion.  It's much cheaper ($150 vs $400 for elite)</p>
<p>I'd highly recommend it.  The remote is fantastic, and very programmable.   I switched to this from the harmony touch, which I hated.  A touchscreen doesn't make sense for me for a tv remote.  I don't want to have to look at it to use it.</p>
<p>I'm sure the Elite is great, as long as most of what you do with it can be mapped to a physical button, which looks to be the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true at all. TV remotes using IR has nothing to do with being ‚Äúcheap‚Äù the hardware costs pennies either way. IR is good because there‚Äôs no network or connection actions required, so as soon as you hit that button the receiver can read it. </p>
<p>Bluetooth is getting good enough that the automatic connection and latency are so low it‚Äôs not noticeable, therefore it‚Äôs a good alternative due to the increased range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. When you're talking large scale production, using a 10 cent IR bulb vs a 25 cent bluetooth unit (just making up numbers) can mean a difference of millions of dollars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure a lot of remotes use RF which is also extremely cheap (think of a cheap gate opener). They also don't require line of sight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uses a lot more power though, which raises the costs on the electrical components. We‚Äôre talking fractions of pennies per unit difference, definitely the main reason they still use IR is the instant connectivity</p></div>		</li>
