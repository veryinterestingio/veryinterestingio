<p>The last digit of the code is a check digit, so that leaves use with only one trillion unique barcodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A company might use scores of their allotment of codes on one product model during its lifecycle and I don't believe a UPC can be reused once it has been registered.  </p>
<p>I was in supply chain management and often a model would have variants to make them exclusive for a retailer.  This strategy keeps retailers from having to compete on end user price or to price match against each other.  A lot of the models created never got picked up by retailers too.  On average, only 40% of the models proposed ever went into production, but all proposed were registered with UPC's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the barcode standard; there are more than one. If you're talking the UPC-A standard, they're 12 digits long, the first digit is a type identifier, the last is a check digit, and the remaining 10 digits are manufacturer code and product identifier, 5 digits each^*</p>
<p>But a lot of barcodes are <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes/databar" target="_blank">DataBar</a>, which has variants that can be 74 digits long</p>
<hr />
<p>^(^* some large manufacturers buy a <em>range</em> of manufacturer codes such that they own all the codes that start with a specific three or four digits, then use the last digit or two of the manufacturer code as they please. This complies with spec, and only matters to scanning side if they need to report by manufacturer.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was looking for. Everyone is talking about the method in which barcodes are categorised and maintained. </p>
<p>But the crude answer is, there's a literal fuckton of combinations possible when using 12 (or 13 in Europe) digits to identify a product. 10 trillion. Theres literally never going to be 10 trillion unique products for sale in the world, never mind a local geographic area. You'll never even use half of those combinations, not even close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course not, but seeing as loads of different companies don't check up on each other (Why would a Norwegian grocery store know what kind of barcodes an American hospital uses to categorize their medicine, for instance), it's very possible, and likely, that some do overlap. Not that it matters, since they never cross over</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anything atleast vaguley hinting at being legit uses a UPC code. Which are regulated and managed by a single company and thus prevented from overlap.</p>
<p>Absolutely there are renegade barcodes, which could overlap. But you won't encounter them often.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>If we're talking barcodes in general, of course it is. If we're talking UPC-A barcodes for products, it's very unlikely since the first 5 digits of a UPC-A are a manufacturer code you have to buy from a central resource.</p>
<p>If there's a conflict, someone is either breaking rules or the same manufacturer is reusing product IDs (not unheard of for rebranding).</p></div>		</li>
