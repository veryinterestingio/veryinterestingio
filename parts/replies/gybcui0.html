			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add that <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2016/3/16/how-many-decimals-of-pi-do-we-really-need/" target="_blank">NASA uses Pi to 15 digits</a>. Using that to calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius the distance of Voyager 1 - 12.5 billion miles - would result in a value that's off by 1.5 inches.</p>
<p>Given that, a smartphone calculator that goes to 9 or 10 digits will be more than enough for any application that you would use a smartphone calculator for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's cool to learn! I read in a calculus book that said if you were to create a circle the size of the observable universe and calculate the circumference of that circle down to the size of a proton, the number of digits of pi you'd need would only be 41. That's crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each digit gives you 10 times more accuracy than the previous. A proton is roughly 10\^(-15) m. The observable universe is roughly 10\^27 m. So you would need roughly  (27--15)=42. Which is pretty close to the 41 given I only used the order of magnitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article talks about that too</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The radius of the universe is about 46 billion light years. Now let me ask a different question: How many digits of pi would we need to calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of 46 billion light years to an accuracy equal to the diameter of a hydrogen atom (the simplest atom)? The answer is that you would need 39 or 40 decimal places.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would amend the article: At JSC, in astronaut training simulation, we used more than 15 digits - 21 IIRC. I worked on the simulation software for 30 years (basically, the shuttle program), and had to deal with this many times.</p>
<p>Why so many digits? Because we never used it just once.  Simulation involves massively looping, using the output of each previous frame as input to the next frame. Calculation errors build up. Sometimes the simulation, with crew in the simulator, would run for several days. Yes days.</p>
<p>One place where something like this might make  a difference would be simulating star positions for celestial navigation. Another is simulating TDRS satellite positions which are used for shuttle-ground communications.</p>
<p>Wherever we could prevent round-off error from accumulating (IIRC, the built-in libs used &quot;school math&quot; rounding rather than banker's rounding or anything more sophisticated) we could prevent long sim calculations from eventually rolling a divide by zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You weren't using double precision floating point then (standard ieee FP64). That maxes out at 15.65 &quot;digits&quot; of precision. x87 extended precision floating point was 80-bit and allows 18.96 digits. Quadruple precision (FP128) allows 33.72, but afaik that hardware hasn't been particularly common until recently (last 10-12 years). I'd be interested to know what hardware you ran it on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my computer science class, there was a geek who proudly memorized the first 50 digits of pi and publicly said it was his password, sure that no one else could type it out on the public consoles in the timeout period given for password entry.  (There was no internet access for that class)  Then he found out that like everything, the password field was limited and only the first 12 digits mattered.  He was lucky that no one was very mean.  We all knew how to remap keyboard strokes at that point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is an extremely shitty PW implementation. 12 chars are within the brute force range. That being said, using a publicly known constant as your PW is beyond stupid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s inaccurate to say it’s within the brute force range cause <strong>any</strong> password is, it’s just a question of how long. And unless you’re on a super beefy computer it’s going to take a damn long time. Even if it was limited to A-Z(capital or not) and 0-10 that would still be 1034716802229536025600 possible combinations.</p>
<p>Assuming the hashing and general overhead took 0.01 seconds per password that’s still 328,106,545,608.0467 years approximately. This isn’t a real world case per se, because the general overhead depends (and depends if there is a timeout and if said time out can be bypassed).</p></div>		</li>
