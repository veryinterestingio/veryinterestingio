			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I can remember where I saw it.  But there is a video that has to people, one a lower brain that makes snap decisions(guess) based on history.  They are usually right but is completely incapable of dealing with new situations. </p>
<p>And a upper brain that is smart and resonable but takes way to long to come to decisions in most cases, and spends most of it's time making sure lower brain doesn't kill him.</p>
<p>It's hilarious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>P: Come.</p>
<p><em>door whooshes open and close</em></p>
<p>P: Yes, number one. Report?</p>
<p>R: We’ve identified the vessel, Captain. It’s a Federation supply tugboat. No threat to the Enterprise.</p>
<p>P: Life signs?</p>
<p>R: Only one. Human. She’s hailed us and asked to come on board.</p>
<p>P: <em>stands up, faces window to think</em> Well unfortunately, the circumstances require all starships to keep our distance from any life-form until they’ve discovered a solution for this crisis.</p>
<p>R: Understood, Captain. ... Perhaps, I could beam down there?</p>
<p>P: <em>turns around and raises one eyebrow</em></p>
<p>R: ...It’s been a long crisis, sir.</p>
<p>P: <em>shakes head</em> Absolutely not. I cannot risk you coming back here and infecting the entire ship.</p>
<p>R: Very good, sir.</p>
<p>P: Anything else?</p>
<p>R: We’ve picked up reports of a nearby smuggling ship trying to sell toilet paper at astounding prices.</p>
<p>P: Report them at once to Starfleet headquarters.  Thank you, number one. That’ll be all. <em>goes back to reading book</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Goon is also why you keep messing up your form if your attention wanders while lifting weights. <em>If you really want to lift that barbell, Boss, Goon will take care of it easy, add a little swinging momentum, get some helper muscles involved, knock it right out for you with half the effort. Don't worry about a thing, Boss.</em> Goon privately thinks Boss is an idiot for always doing it the absolutely hardest way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, mine don't work either. I literally think something is wrong with me. I specifically know this about myself, so when I'm in a noisy area trying to hear someone, I'd deliberately try to pay attention harder.. to no avail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this.  My dad does as well.</p>
<p>I have really good hearing, but lots of noises seem to come into my brain at the same volume.  </p>
<p>Like, the heater kicks on and suddenly it's harder to hear the TV, even though the heater is in the hall around the corner.</p>
<p>I can hear the cat meow from across the house, but someone can be right next to me and I won't completely understand what they have said if I am not paying attention to them.</p>
<p>Also, song lyrics are often hard for me to make out.  </p>
<p>My wife can hear it perfectly, but unless I can read the lyrics while the song is on or watch  a video where I can see them singing I have trouble making them out.</p></div>		</li>
