<p>Just East of the Rocky mountains is desert and arid land, harder to live in so it isn't as heavily populated.</p>

<p>No, no it's not. I live there. It's known as the 'Great Plains', and is mostly fertile, arable land. There are small pockets of arid, dry land called Badlands in most of those states, the biggest in SD, but most of it is wheat, corn, and yellow grasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curiously, most east of the Rockies is not desert but arid grasslands, Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, Alberta. Only the southern end is desert. Originally, the west was anything past the Appalachians and for reasons unknown the west (Rockies, west coast) didn't become the far west, but just the west. The originally settled west became the middle west.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going off the map linked below and my own time in Colorado (though I've not been south of Colorado springs). The map shows
most of eastern Colorado as arid <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_the_United_States" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_the_United_States</a></p>
<p>I think it's quite curious that western Colorado, Utah, Nevada is desert despite being on the windward side of the Rockies with respect to the prevailing winds.</p></div>		</li>
