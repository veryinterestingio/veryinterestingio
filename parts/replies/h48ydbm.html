<p>Maybe you're referring to how according to Quantum Mechanics, electrons don't exist as point charges, but as a waveform that if you like reflects the probability distributions for the electron, and on <em>that</em> basis, yes an electron <em>could</em> exist anywhere, although the highest probability is within the &quot;bond&quot;.</p>
<p>But <em>delocalised</em> refers to a completely different concept in Organic Chemistry -  it's where the electrons are no longer associated with a single atom or bond - e.g. Benzene where the  Ï€ electrons are delocalised. The 2 electrons in the 3 centre bond in B2H6 are not delocalised - the bond orbital stretches across 3 atoms, but it's still a single bond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, your comment about &quot;a completely different concept in Organic Chemistry&quot; is exactly what I mean when I said that bonding and orbitals are taught very superficially. Orbitals are not real - they are produced by independent particle models (IPMs), which are very crude approximations of the actual electronic wavefunction. I mean, they assume that electrons are not avoiding each other in their motion. Given the fact that electrons all have the same charge, that is a quite simplistic point of view, is it not? Nevertheless, chemists (including me, when I am interpreting my research results at times) put so much value in orbitals because they just make sense with the established knowledge before quantum mechanics was discovered.</p>
<p>In addition, one can always pick a different representation for orbitals. One can use planewaves, for example, where the electrons are always going to be delocalized all over the space. Or one can localize the orbitals using methods like natural bond orbitals, so that they can have a picture that is more familiar to chemistry. This really adds to the arbitrariness of orbital pictures.</p>
<p>Additionally, orbital pictures can sometimes (I might be underestimating here) be unreliable. Take the example of Mg2. MO theory would say that its bond order is zero, which means that it should not exist. However, this molecule does exist due to dispersion interaction and there is a significant volume of research  on it, both experimental and theoretical.</p>
<p>After rambling so much, my point is that chemistry is built on physical principles and so far the best description that we have for it is quantum mechanics (well, plus relativity, which I am not very familiar with in terms of chemistry). Quantum mechanics says that electrons in molecules are delocalized, so we will have to deal with it whether we like it or not. To me, the fact that organic chemistry says &quot;otherwise&quot; points to its inadequacy in describing physical phenomena properly. In any case, as I said, one can always pick a representation that suits their need, so orbitals can still be used to interpret some chemical phenomena. I just will not put too much trust in their meaning, since they are not real and arbitrary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding delocalisation - just NO.  QM does NOT say that electrons are <em>delocalised -</em> as I previously stated the term means something quite specific and it is incorrect to use it in this way.</p>
<p>Side note - you write like QM and orbitals are two different theories - but orbitals are the product of QM and describe the region within an atom that encloses where the electron is likely to be 90% of the time. </p>
<p>I'd write a bit more, but I'm watching the football :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The molecular orbitals tend to be spread all over the molecule, particularly the lower energy ones. The HOMO and LUMO are sometimes close to what we understand as a bond, but not always, as the <a href="https://www.chemtube3d.com/orbitalsacrolein/" target="_blank">pi molecular orbitals of acrolein show</a>.</p>
<p>The hybrid orbital model does have localized &quot;orbitals&quot; (by design), and AFAIK gives the same resulting electron density as molecular orbital theory, so that behaves as you describe. But building the behavior into the model is kind of cheating.</p></div>		</li>
