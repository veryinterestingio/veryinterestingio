<p>This is not correct, sorry. Cooling in this context refers to the expansion of the universe. The mass-energy of the universe is constant, so as the universe expands this results in less mass-energy per volume. This is interpreted and commonly referred to as &quot;cooling&quot; but it has nothing to do with traditional radiative or convective heat transfer.</p>
<p>The Cosmic Microwave Background did not come around until much later during an epoch known as [recombination]( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology</a>) ). The origin of the CMB are those photons that were present at the moment of recombination. These could not have been the photons that had anything to do with anything radiated prior to recombination because photons emitted prior to recombination would quickly strike and be absorbed by charged particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beryllium doesn't even make the top 10.  Hydrogen is 73.9%, helium is 24%, oxygen 1.04%, and it drops from there. Sulfur is #10, at 0.044%. Even on Earth, beryllium is only 0.05 parts per million, and think in the whole universe it's about 0.03 parts per million.</p>
