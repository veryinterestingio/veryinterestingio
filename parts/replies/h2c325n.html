			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean WEIRD is a culture (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Representative Democracy). A very small, very wealthy culture. Also undergrads eager to sign up for studies are overwhelmingly white and nerdy. And bogie too, can't forget that. The point is I am mostly agreeing with you that this group is not representative of humanity and doesn't give a cross section of anything. I'd love to see the same study done on WEIRDos and then on completely different people, but the scientific community had to be dragged kicking and screaming into doing the same study twice on WEIRDos to check replicability. Can you imagine if you said &quot;now fund four of them.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
