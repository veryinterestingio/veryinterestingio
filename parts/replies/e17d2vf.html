<p>When you say &quot;close&quot; how close are we talking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't usually measure the distance of objects or units using the Parallax method that are farther that 100 parsecs. The farther away an object is, the smaller the Parallax angle (measured in arcseconds), which would give a less accurate value.
Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that the word &quot;parsec&quot; comes from the parallax method - it's the distance from Earth where the parallax angle of a star over a year will be one arcsecond.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know definitively, but we were probably able to determine the approximate distance to the nebula via a 'standard candle' (in this case most likely a type of star called a cephied variable). Once you have the actual distance, all you need is to do is measure their apparent size in the sky and you can use geometry to calculate their actual length.</p></div>		</li>
