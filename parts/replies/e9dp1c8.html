Most Reddit users will agree that the Chinese model is an unfair one, but will almost never support Trump's attempts to change it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea of calling bullshit on Chinese policies is a good one. The problem is that Trump is playing &quot;Go Fish&quot; while the Chinese government is playing Chess. To conduct an actual trade war with China and be successful the US would need to spend years preparing for it and sign very calculated economic deals with Canada, Central/South America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Malaysia, Australia, and Africa, etc...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, his words and demeanor on other topics suggest he is an impulsive, proud, and cruel man willing to lie to get his way. This, surprisingly enough, makes it difficult to persuade people that his plans on this particular topic are well informed, carefully analyzed, and thoughtfully communicated. I’m not a trade expert (though I’m aware of the national security issues of China’s IP acquisition, since that’s closer to my business) but I’m willing to be persuaded by people who are. But I’m pretty sure that ain’t Trump, and he’s got himself to blame on that. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That accusation is completely nuts. What do you make of any uber competitors such as Lyft?</p>
<p>In China, Uber simply lost the competition. They did not innovate quickly enough to adjust to the local environment changes, including local transportation code. Now you are just looking for excuses for incompetence? With that spirit how can Uber compete with any other local competitors such as the new one in India?</p></div>		</li>
