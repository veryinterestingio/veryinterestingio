			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta. One could come here from Kepler and on earth think the gravity is really low and could jump extra high for a while till his muscles atrophy a bit due to not being worked as much. Though he would possibly have a lot of health problems from living in a high gravity environment for so long. So not really a super man</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then yeah, but that would take probably 10,000 years or more of people living there to evolve enough the be genetically adapted. And probably some rigorous eugenics programs too.</p></div>		</li>
