			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason scientist speak so outlandish is due to science itself. In science you need to be precise to the matter of being obnoxious. Because small difference in science words have very precicse meaning. Often the same words as in plain speak are used but with a very narrow meaning so that leads to confusion too. That's why we see the rise of science you tubers. They aren't restricted to the precicse language of science cause they are basically filmmaker not scientists even though most often they are that too.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but using this well crafted Eli5 response, could you craft a material to purposefully interact with a specific wavelength for an express purpose? That would require a deeper understanding than the analogy provides and the use of specific technical language. </p>
<p>Also, I'd imagine that a lot of specialized jargon isn't in a thesaurus because it was created to identify a very specific phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard this so many times but never from anyone who actually had a cheap pair that didn't block UV. I've had a couple cheap pairs tested at an optometrist and they were fine.</p>
<p>I believe it's just so easy/cheap to make the plastic UV opaque that they all are, and this scare is kind of like razor blades in Halloween candy.</p>
<p>Edit: I can't find the original source for it but here's <a href="https://www.besthealthmag.ca/article/are-cheap-sunglasses-safe/" target="_blank">an article</a> that discusses it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Most sunglasses do provide enough UV protection</strong>, says Stephen Dain, director of the optics and radiometry laboratory at Australia‚Äôs University of New South Wales. ‚ÄòWe test about 2,000 pairs a year, and failure to meet standards is less than one percent.‚Äô   </p>
<p>[...]  </p>
<p><strong>Sunglasses with hefty price tags aren‚Äôt necessarily better than the $20 variety</strong>. ‚ÄòUV protection costs only pennies so you can get it at any price,‚Äô says Chou. ‚ÄòBut inexpensive lenses may have marginal optical quality. This won‚Äôt do any damage, but the distortion can cause headaches or dizziness that can leave you feeling miserable.‚Äô </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So as I thought, it's so damn cheap to make them block UV that even the unbranded Chinese manufacturers can. And if they were too cheap to do that then they probably cheaped out on the lenses in every other way too and they'll be so awful that you won't want to use them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah so think about lying in the sun as it shines through a window, like your car. Have you ever gotten a sunburn?</p>
<p>All glass is UV opaque with the exception of the lower-energy UV wavelengths that are really near the visible spectrum. (~75% of UVA light will be transmitted).</p>
<p>These UVA can cause damage but are not nearly as bad as having no glass at all because it's the higher energy UVB light that gives you a sunburn, and those are blocked very effectively by glass.</p>
<p>It also stands to reason that something that blocks visible light will likely have the same effect on UV light (ie the darker the shade, the more protection).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhh? It's literally the exact same mechanic and analogy fits perfectly. </p>
<p>Radiation is just photons. Visible light is just radiation. Visible light is just photons. Same thing, different wavelengths. </p>
<p>Glass is transparent to visible light, concrete walls aren't. </p>
<p>Flesh is transparent to xrays, bones aren't.</p></div>		</li>
