			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, so one answer given in this thread is that it is air, and the other is that it is refraction of light bouncing off of multiple surfaces. Or are they the same thing (i.e., air refracts and scatters light?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not going to get light scattering from air in any appreciable amount, but I would imagine air is definately in between the surfaces. Also, you take any color of plastic and the bending point will be white. That is becuae you are seeing all visible wavelengths. The only way I can imagine that to be possible is due to light scattering. Light scatters on all materials but the probability of a photon to be scattered is angle dependent (surface or plane in a crystal). </p>
<p>If you take blue plastic and pulverize it you will get blueish white powder. White from random scattering on small particles/surfaces and some blue from the absorption of the dye in the plastic.</p>
<p>Edit. I didnt read the other answer. They are talking about refractive index.  Yes refractive index absolutely matters and will always be a factor. Also, crazing forms microscopic surfaces noted in the second reference of top comment.</p></div>		</li>
