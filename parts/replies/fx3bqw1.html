			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think any of us would, that is more the arena of a behavioural scientist. If we were to hazard a (semi-educated?) guess though it would be grooming behaviour. We firmly believe video games do not cause violence and in all honesty the majority of violence we see within society is not premeditated (think pub fights). The case of Breck Brednar comes to mind though and we actually wrote a chapter on it that was not included within the final collection due to the word constraint. His murderer utilised the gaming platform to groom him, much like a sexual offender would, which gave him the opportunity to commit murder. At the same time though, moving away from violence and at wider criminal activity it is dependant where the gamer in question is from… getting stoned and playing Fifa in Colorado is not a criminal act but it is in the United Kingdom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding your last little bit there, it may be the truth, but I do not see how it relates. Maybe it is just the example used here. My impression of your work so far (full disclosure have not yet read the book) is that it is based on both the moral and practical aspects of generally accepted forms of leisure and how they relate to criminality through this new &quot;deviant&quot; framework. Is this correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially.</p>
<p>Criminality is socially constructed. The point of that example is what we see as criminal can change dependant on where we are. The framework seeks to look more at 'harm' than what we would usually look at i.e. crime. </p>
<p>Aside from that slight tweek, dead on!</p></div>		</li>
