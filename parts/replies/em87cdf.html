<p>This isnt a resource problem, its an <em>allocation</em> problem.</p>
<p>We have the people. Its a matter of accepting that we should let them do the work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love when the fundamental basis of a problem is “we don’t have money”</p>
<p>Imagine explaining that to an alien visitor. “We would love to make our planet less shitty and we’ve got plenty of resources but no one is willing to exchange meaningless worthless paper (money) in order to do it”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The homeless in my area pick up the beer cans on my and my neighbors front lawns on Saturday and Sunday mornings. It’s a symbiotic relationship; our lawn is cleaned and they return the cans for money.</p>
<p>Hopefully more people will discover simple, mutually beneficial arrangements to clean up trash.</p>
<p>Edit: We live in a college neighborhood adjacent to campus. Every house around me does this, and has been doing it for years. It’s not litter in our own front yards, and if they didn’t want to do it, we’d clean up ourselves (like we do during the week). Usually, by around 7 am the morning after, the “can fairies” as they are locally called have already cleaned most yards. The yards are cleaned so early because of the competition, they can make good money from returns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, with the wealth and resources humanity has at its disposal, everything is an allocation problem.  A lot of post-scarcity society philosophy delves into this very concept - that we really could provide for everyone if we stopped caring about beating them.</p>
<p>Which is to say, we could conquer our evolutionary urges and become utopian if it weren't for that pesky human nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion it's a societal problem as well. If the society would shift away from such a high focus on money and make it more egalitarian, it could focus on concrete goals instead of focusing in profiting monetarily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Society's focus on money is just the way the focus on concrete goals manifests. Money exists as a system intended to provide accounting and reward activities that benefit society. If you produce a useful widget, other people who value your work will provide you with money. If you produce something useless, other people will not value it, and you will not get money. Since you have less money, you will not be able to access scarce resources (like gold) to make your gold turd statues. Meanwhile the guy who makes gold bird statues can.</p>
<p>It's hard to decide ahead of time whether bird statues or turd statues are more useful to society, so instead of having someone allocate gold to the appropriate artists, we let society decide with their purchases (representing how much they're willing to give up to have access to the statue).</p>
<p>The money system we have is certainly flawed, but it is an attempt to accurately handle how someone is contributing to society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some other societies actually are better with trash disposal. I believe the Nordic countries are especially efficient for example. </p>
<p>It was in the news somewhat recently that Sweden has gotten so good at recycling that they ran out of stuff to recycle and so it actually became profitable for them to import other countries trash to recycle for them. </p>
<p>I think the only way that can work is if a majority of people agree that that’s where a portion of their taxes should go to.</p></div>		</li>
