			<div class="markdown"><p>Gah. 8 hours between 28 hour shifts seems ridiculous - in my area for non-medical professions which need long stretches on duty and cover nights as well the standard approach is that you work 24 hours every 4 days (averages out to something close to ordinary 8x5 workweek); or you work 12 hour shifts and then get 24 hours free. </p>
<p>Ignoring the total weekly hours, getting an 8 hour break between shifts doesn't even leave you enough time for commute to home, dinner, 8 hours of sleep, breakfast and commute back to work; and you need more than 8 hours of sleep after a 28 hour shift.  12 hour breaks between long shifts should be the legal minimum..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually worse than the old “work 24 hours, off 24 hours” model many places had before. What was supposed to help residents made it way harder because they were working 16 hours, off 8 hours for an entire month (minus the 4 required off days per month). It’s insanity. </p>
<p>Edit: to be clear, this was talking about a rule set up in 2012 that applied to first year residents (aka interns). I don’t know if it has changed at all since, but it sucked. </p>
<p>After residency, there aren’t any nationally enforced rules on hours worked as far as I know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And let's be honest. Those are the rules, but it's not uncommon that people go over their hours for various reasons from simply not being able to step away from a patient to an attending that pressures them into working unsafe amounts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the 8 hr rule between shifts is just for regular work days.  After working a 24-hr call shift, residents have to have at least 14 hrs off. </p></div>		</li>

<p>However it has also been shown that frequent handoffs between docs can also lead to errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is a reason for running two twelve hour shifts instead of three eight hour shifts. Nobody functions well when they've been working for 20+ hours straight.</p>
<p>It's also a good reason to improve handoff procedures.</p></div>		</li>
