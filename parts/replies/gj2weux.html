			<div class="markdown"><p>Increasingly it’s thought that part of the reason why large cats go for the stomach first when they kill an animal is to get at the partially digested stomach contents.  They can’t process that food raw, but if another animal has done some of the hard work breaking it down then the cats can digest that.</p>
<p>A really interesting outcome of this is the discovery that large cats are actually pretty important for long distance seed dispersal, and even small cats can be important for seed dispersal as well.</p>

<p>Dogs have had a very long history of living alongside humans however, so I think they just adapted to be able to eat whatever scraps we had available for them</p></div>		</li>

<p>Please don't just assume that it's produced in China when you hear about a recall - that's blatant disregard for the fact that dangerous food can come from anywhere. This recall which has over 70 dead pets to its name is for Sportmix, produced by Midwestern Pet Foods, produced in their facility in Oklahoma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe part of the issue is that high protein in raw food vs dry dog food can realistically mean 2 very different things. In raw meat, it has a ton of water in the meat, so the actual total amount of protein in a meal gets diluted. When you look at dry dog food, everything is concentrated, so it's easy to off balance the amount of protein, especially when a company wants to emphasize the amount of protein in the diet.</p>
<p>To take it to the extreme, you could just feed pure rawhide, as they're pretty much pure protein, but for many reasons that would be stupid.</p></div>		</li>
