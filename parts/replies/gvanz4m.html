			<div class="markdown"><p>The crux of the difference is that there's other restaurants for you. The fly is given no guarantees that it will </p>

<li>
<p>Survive long enough to find another food source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That food source will not have a similar &quot;bouncer&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>That the other food source is even as good as this one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Change the hypothetical to be &quot;I haven't eaten in 2 days, and this is the only restaurant open today&quot;, and I think you'd be a bit more persistent to go in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add that we actually are a very persistent species. It's how we managed to hunt quick prey back in hunter gatherer days. They were made for quick bursts of speed, while we were made for distance. They could run and run as much as they wanted but we'd always be right behind. Eventually they slow down enough from exhaustion to be caught. Tracking and persistence was all that was necessary. Not exactly a direct parallel to flies but I thought it was worth noting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also humans need quite a few restaurant meals to breed.</p>
<p>Flies don't need very many meals before they're pushing out some baby flies.</p>
<p>So they don't need to success as many times in row to breed. But if a human scores 100 restaurant meals and then gets killed while at it, well that's still an orphan kid that has no dad now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, you would think that the person pushing you away has a reason and would then leave. A fly is a simple organism with a simple brain. It doesn't think &quot;Why is this person swatting me away?&quot; it just thinks it's something that happened and then tries to get the meal again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically, they have short memories, but as they get hungrier their memory gets worse and worse (and it is in fact the memory, not that they are choosing to ignore. They literally stop producing the thing needed to store memories).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also consider that not many animals actually try and squish a fly anyway. I'd assume just monkeys / apes </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Risk getting squished </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this part here you might be wrong. There's no evolutionary disadvantage at all to flying around large animals - until very very recently</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would make sense, but flies are not able to do that cognition. They just react based on external stimulus. There is no trade-off decision making process happening. It's just a stimulus that is repeatedly ignited and interrupted.</p></div>		</li>
