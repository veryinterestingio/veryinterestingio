			<div class="markdown"><p>We spit into a tube. It is awkward, but also probably not as bad as having a swab stuffed up your nose. </p>
<p>If you visit /r/UIUC you’ll find many threads where our students share tips on how to collect spit faster, along with their speedrun times. It’s weird but also funny; I love that the students are just rolling with it. </p>
<p>The week they doubled the amount of saliva needed was a rough one for all of us. Especially because they doubled the time you have to avoid eating and drinking anything beforehand at the same time (from 30 mins to 60). But again, I would rarther stand in a tent and awkwardly spit into a tube while avoiding making eye contact with anyone than try the nasal swab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't disagree more. The swab is over in seconds. It's not even that bad. Filling up the conical tube with spit and waiting an hour  prior is way more annoying. </p>
<p>I've done 16 swabs and 5 tubes for our clinical guys. I have to get tested monthly as well. Even did 6 in a row on myself one day because clinicals needed more a few more during a validation study. </p>
<p>Plus, spit has all kinds of issues with accuracy and sensitivity unless you extract, but that's problematic atm with shortages of extraction kits and the extra time to get a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a video of a few saliva covid test, not sure if it's the same as the article but basically rub q tip all around gums for like 30 seconds if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>There's another one that goes to the back of the throat which has known to be more effective than nasal for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took one last week for my uni. They give you a plastic tube with a black line near the top. You spit into it until your saliva reaches the line, and then you pour this blue liquid they provide into it. Give it a good mix for about 10 seconds, and they collect it for testing. Testing takes about 3 days.</p></div>		</li>
