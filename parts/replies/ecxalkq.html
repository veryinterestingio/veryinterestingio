			<div class="markdown"><p>More like coffee sounds like the hot water it is ;)</p>
<p>Try pooring water from your electric kettle into a glass, first cold and the second time just after boiling it. You can hear the difference. In fact, you can blindfold someone and ask them to say which one was boiling and which one was cold without ever telling them about this phenomenon, they'll likely be right. Years of hearing hot and cold water sticks in your brain without you ever thinking about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! I just watched a video about the Yanny Laurel thing and how the age of our ears can effect which we hear because younger/healthier ears can pick up higher frequencies. All I hear in that clip is &quot;Laurel&quot; with a weird tinging noise in the background.</p>
<p>I'm guessing hot water gives off a higher frequency and after years of abusing my ears with loud metal and punk music, both with ear buds and at concerts, my ears are not the greatest. </p></div>		</li>
