			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that windshear associated with microbursts, being a coherent flow pattern, is not turbulence. That's a big part of what makes it so dangerous. But it is certainly a serious hazard associated with unexpected movement of the air mass surrounding the plane, so in that sense it could be grouped with atmospheric turbulence. And of course there is substantial turbulence in the transition region at the edge of the microburst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microbursts occur during thunderstorms and are very sudden and extreme. They are a heavy downburst of air. Turbulence is more general and is essentially just pockets of air thrown into irregular motions. Turbulence is common and wide spread, where as microburst are rare and isolated events. </p>
<p>All that said, turbulence is often more severe during thunderstorms, and other moderate to severe weather occurrences. But in that case, it’s not solely the turbulence that would be what brings a plans down. </p>
<p>And yeah, microbursts and planes don’t mix well....</p></div>		</li>
