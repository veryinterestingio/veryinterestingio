			<div class="markdown"><p>One interesting thing is that now you can get either type. Many heavy truck manufacturers produce various kinds of automatically actuated manual transmission.   </p>
<p>An example is Scania's Opticruse transmissions that started as a manual with optional automatic except that you still needed to use the clutch to stop. Now they do them as a 2 pedal automatic but mechanically it's still basically a manual gearbox.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The data is showing they are more efficient in short haul applications but not necessarily long haul applications (at least when speaking with the companies I used to work with). The experienced drivers prefer the manuals but the fleet mechanics prefer the automatics because they don't have to replace a clutch anytime some kid straight out of trucking school thinks he knows exactly what he's doing. The automatics really shine in general day cab use and things like dump trucks, cement mixers, refuse, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just cost that drives the difference these days, as there is no physical connection between the engine and the automatic transmission (its hydraulically coupled) there is power loss (&amp; more heat) between the engine and transmission, with a manual clutch the engine is directly connected to the transmission so much less power loss. its also lighter. </p>
<p>I guess that could be described by &quot;cost&quot; but that feels a little handwavy for my liking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are &quot;lock up torque converters&quot; that have a clutch to lock them and avoid that loss, but they only engage at certain times. So, it does help close some of the inefficiency gap between auto and manual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Power loss is a good argument for fuel economy and when driving in tall gears, but when it comes to racing, the speed at which automatics can shift vs manuals, it becomes a no-brainer: manual shifting just can't compete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most race cars hydraulically activated dual clutch gearboxes.  Simplified, there's a clutch for even gears and a clutch for odd gears on a sequential gearbox. With the flick of a lever, the car automatically engages the next gear via the separate clutch, and only once it has engaged does it disengage the previous gear.</p>
<p>The benefits to this are two, you never lose power to the ground, even during a shift, and since the driver still controls the timing of the shift there is no chance of upsetting the car in a turn, as an automatic trans is likely to do.</p></div>		</li>
