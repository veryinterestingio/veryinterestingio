			<div class="markdown"><p>I always guessed it was because the clouds were just light enough that they sat on top of a specific pressure layer and couldn't sink below it. Guess I was partly right. Invisible clouds sounds like a neat concept</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Key point: clouds don't stay up because of low density. </p>
<p>Know how dust can float around your house, or pollen can float around outside? When mass is small enough, very weak air currents are enough to overcome gravity, causing particles to stay suspended in the air. </p>
<p>Cloud droplets are super tiny. If droplets get too big, they can't stay suspended and they fall down (precipitation).</p></div>		</li>
