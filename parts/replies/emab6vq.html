<p>Surprising i havent seen this mentioned.  Large animals require massive amounts of food and/or massive amounts of territory especially to support large populations.  Current megafauna like elephants don't need more oxygen but they eat a lot of food and can be extremely destructive in getting it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else that is rarely mentioned is that we look at our current animal diversity and then compare it against the whole diversity that has ever existed. That's why we end up thinking &quot;there used to be larger animals in the past&quot;, we're comparing a thin slice of the cake against the rest of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are some instances where they were bigger, but if you take &quot;the dinosaurs&quot; as your reference point, you're looking at a group that existed for hundreds of millions of years, it's kinda unfair to make that comparison. The same goes for insects or fish, those groups have existed for millions of years.</p>
<p>Another reason that skews our perception is that bigger animals are more likely to end up being fossilised. Take a mouse, average size for a mammal living in our times. Now take an elephant, quite big for a terrestrial mammal. A mouse can be devoured whole by lots of predators, even if they have to chew it, they can easily break its bones, leaving nothing behind. On the other hand, when a predator successfully hunts an elephant, it'll have a hard time trying to eat or break its bones. The remains from little organisms rarely remain intact whilst the remains of a larger animal are more likely to be preserved.</p>
<p>The fossil record is naturally skewed towards bigger animals, that's why it always looks like the past was brimming with giant beasts. Yes, there were giant beasts, but the fossil record isn't comprehensively showing the whole picture, little animals aren't that well represented on it.</p>
<p>A few things that /u/Kahzooth mentioned are right, but it's important to keep in mind that we have a skewed perception of the past's diversity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the massive animals tend to go extinct and the smaller and more environmentally adaptive species tend to survive and be the dominant lifeforms for the next age.</p>

<p>also, it's a quantity issue; you just have more of the smaller organisms than the amount of the giant ones.</p>
<p>ie. More chance of mutation</p></div>		</li>

<p>As far as I understand mutations in any other cell would have no effect on evolution (outside of the survival of the individual).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's partly correct. If 80% of your population is destroyed it will be easier to recover if that population is 100,000 rather than 10,000 and if you have finite resources (e.g. you live on an island) you can have a larger population if you are smaller in size. This is true for large species (i.e. they evolve to be smaller on islands) ( <a href="https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/information/fibromyalgia-and-chronic-fatigue/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/information/fibromyalgia-and-chronic-fatigue/" target="_blank">https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/information/fibromyalgia-and-chronic-fatigue/</a></a> ) but small species can actually get bigger ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster%27s_rule" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster%27s\_rule" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster%27s\_rule</a></a> )</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'd also be careful with the mutation claims. Yes, with a larger population you have more mutations but also a larger population that doesn't have that mutation - and that will still be having offspring etc. For mutations that are not under natural selection, population size actually cancels out (e.g. bigger population = more mutations but whether a mutation &quot;fixes&quot; (meaning that everybody in the pop has that mutation) is based on its initial frequency so bigger population = less chance of a certain mutation fixing) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(population_genetics)" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation\_(population\_genetics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation\_(population\_genetics</a>)</a> ). Mutations undergoing selective pressures are more complicated and to be honest a can't remember as much about them but there are lots of factors to include - like how dangerous your environment is (can't pass on that great gene if there is a 90% chance you will die from a cat eating you anyway)</p></div>		</li>
