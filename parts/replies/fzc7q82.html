			<div class="markdown"><p>OP said &quot;even on the hottest nights.&quot;  Unless I misunderstood, your comment concludes that we use a blanket to keep warm.  But what if you're already too warm?  None of this applies, right?  Why do I still want a thin blanket when I'm too hot?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No explanation needed for why blankets keep us warm, insulation is a pretty basic concept.</p>
<p>Why do our stupid brains insist on blankets covering us, <em>regardless of temperature</em>? Some nights I get hot enough to stick my entire legs and arms fully out and pull the sheets halfway down my chest, but even the most comically skimpy coverage of my midriff helps me sleep like a baby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive always assumed its a comfort/security thing. Like how little kids think the blanket keeps them safe from the &quot;monster&quot;. Our brain says &quot;were under cover and are therefore less vulnerable to predators&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you’re so used to it you relate having a cover to sleep so much that you need it. Like other habits before bed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They said this applies to any temperature below your body temp of 95°F. Which is pretty damn hot.</p>
<p>Also their example was about one spot being subject to a draft which drains the body. I assume this sends a bunch of &quot;uncomfortable&quot; signals. The act of being covered makes sure you body stays even</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arizona summer nights actually get this hot though. It is about 98°F tonight where I'm from and I'm sure I've seen it get to 105 at night before. As a kid I would usually switch from a blanket to a sheet during these times, but would still have some kind of covering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation cooling is also important, especially in winter when the walls are cold. You are shining an invisible light and so are the walls and ceiling. If you are hotter than the wall more of this invisible light is leaving you than is hitting you from the glowing walls. A blanket will warm up to almost your skin temperature putting your shining skin in equilibrium with the shining blanket. Those foil space blankets reflect your shine back at you.</p>
<p>This is why even if u set the thermostat to keep the air temperature the same in the winter, walking around naked can feel a lot colder. Bc the walls are sucking that heat out of you :)</p></div>		</li>
