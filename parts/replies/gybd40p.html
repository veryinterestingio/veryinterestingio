			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. The light doesn't do the etching. It activates or deactivates the litho layer. After that, the etching process will take place and it will only etch on the parts that are activated (or deactivated depending on the current process step)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok the silicon wafer basically a super clean and flat disc of silicon is coated with a photo sensitive polymer.. and when a specific light hits it.. that particular area of polymer become soluble. (Imagine light breaking long chains of polymer.. there are some photosensitive polymer that so insoluble after being exposed to light.. which is soluble normally.. imagine light giving it enough energy to form long chains which is less soluble)</p>
<p>Now you got a projector sort of thing that can focus the light on small pattern.. and that pattern now changed something physically... Now you can etch the silicon disk.. the polymer coating will prevent the etching chemicals from digging the silicon wafer in few areas and the exposed silicon will get etched...
Then its a matter of requirements.. if you wanna coat copper or whatever... The process is just specific for that thing.. there can be process like sputtering (spraying ions so hard that it gets embedded into silicon. Changing its conductivity)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>uh photons?  There's nothing special about the light.  The silicon wafers sit in a bath of photo-reactive chemicals. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's not really the full picture. The light used is incredibly sophisticated and difficult to achieve and is a major roadblock to further miniaturization. Resolution is limited to the smallest size you can write with, light in this case. Excimer lasers allow you to write down to about 50 nm. Using immersion changes the NA of your optics and allows you to write below this.</p></div>		</li>
