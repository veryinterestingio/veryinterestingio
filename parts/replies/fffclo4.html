			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm finding it hard to wrap my head around something. Let's take your example further. </p>
<p>So the guy in the car traveling at 0.5 c appears to be experiencing time slowly from the perspective of the observer. So when the guy in the car stops his car, his watch should be lagging behind, right?</p>
<p>But this isn't making sense to me. Because the stationary man actually is just traveling at 0.5 c relative to the guy in the car. And if you take the guy in the car to be the observer, then it should appear to him that stationary man is experiencing time more slowly.  Which would be paradoxical. What am I missing here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;true&quot; answer to that is complicated, but there is a suitable &quot;approximate&quot; answer: acceleration.</p>
<p>Only <em>inertial</em> frames of reference - frames that are not accelerating - are &quot;equal&quot; in the important sense. While both the person in the car and the person outside the car are traveling at constant velocity, it is true that each sees the other as &quot;the slow one&quot;.</p>
<p>When you say &quot;the guy in the car stops his car&quot;, you've introduced an acceleration period. That man's frame of reference is no longer inertial. This breaks the symmetry (for the duration of the acceleration).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean this might not be an eli5 but can you explain this further? Because it's my understanding that acceleration is also relative, so where does the asymmetry arise from?</p></div>		</li>
