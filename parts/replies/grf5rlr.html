<p>If the voltage got up too high, EG the power lines got struck by lightning, then the insulation in the device could break down and you could get an arc inside it and it would act briefly like a short circuit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wires in your wall are thick enough that they let electricity flow through them with little resistance. Power lost due to purely resistive parts of the circuit can be expressed as power = (current <em> current) </em> resistance.</p>
<p>If the resistance of the hair drier is much higher than the wires in the wall, the hair drier will get much hotter than the wires. The wires in your house DO get warmer though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the reason why you can't just put a bigger amp circuit breaker in because the thickness of the wires might not be thick enough to handle the new higher load, and suddenly your wires become heating elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the paradox I don't understand: the resistance in the hair dryer is high, causing it to burn a lot of heat. On the other hand, the resistance is very low, causing it to draw a lot of current. How do these reconcile?</p>
<p>Edit: as you mention, P=I²R. But since V=IR, we can also say P=V²/R, which may be more relevant since the wall has constant voltage, not current (wall voltage usually holding constant in 110-120 in the US). As such, you'd expect that the lowest resistance part of the circuit to burn the most power (i.e. the wires which are made to have very low resistance)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't they constant voltage sources though? If so, V remains constant and therefor I and R will have an inverse relationship (V = I <em> R). Heating elements should be LOW resistance. This will cause current (I) to increase and from the power equation (P = I </em> I * R), an increase in I has much more significant impact on power (heat output) since the value is squared, compared to resistance.</p>
<p>If R = 0.001, then I is insanely high and is squared for power.</p></div>		</li>
