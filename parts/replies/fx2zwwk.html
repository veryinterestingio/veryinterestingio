			<div class="markdown"><p>While we cant give a play by play of a giant squid hunt, since it happens so deep down that we haven't really observed it (yet), we have a pretty good idea. Large squid appear to make up about 80% of their diets, based on what has been found in their stomachs, and the remaining 20% is made up of fish both big and small, octopus, shrimp, some sharks and crabs. Percentages are a bit up for debate and change based on time of year and hunting grounds that theyre in,  but there's a rough idea for ya. So some prey is small, and if they aren't quick to maneuver then that'd be an easy snack. In addition, adult males tend to hunt alone, but females, young males, and obviously babies stay together and have complex social structures- so they can hunt cooperatively. </p>
<p>Now down to the squid hunt- while some of their prey can hear the ridiculously loud sounds made while a whale hunts, squid don't seem to notice it. That means the whale might be on its trail for almost a mile before it realizes its being hunted. Squid have amazing complex eyes and can see in the dark as well as anything can down there, so its likely many of them at least see them coming when they get closer.   Giant squid in particular have the largest eye in the animal kingdom- so we can assume if any light filtered down to where they're being hunted,  they see the whale. As an interesting side note, sperm whales have very bad eyesight- at least one specimen was found totally blind, but was still healthy. They aren't using their eyes to hunt. Anyway, first thing in the hunt would be finding the prey and approaching it- while they swim relatively slowly sometimes, sperm whales have been observed at speeds over 25 mph. Even more intimidating (for the squid), they can maintain that speed for about an hour. Most animals use a burst of speed at the end of a hunt, like a cheetah, but can't maintain it. High speed for long distance means you've got an advantage there. Even a squid that can move faster cant do it for longer.  Next, sperm whale heads are huge- and while they're the largest toothed whale, they arent really biting their prey to catch it. Instead, they suction up their prey. If you have a large head and mouth, if its opened quickly it essentially creates a vacuum that the water rushes to fill- taking anything in a 3 foot radius with it. Any squid caught in that is dinner. Second, the tongue is interestingly shaped to help this process- its not long; doesn't even come close to reaching the end of its jaw behind the teeth. Instead, its wide and short. This aides in the suction process- it literally retracts further into the whale, creating more &quot;negative&quot; space for the water and prey to be pulled into. An interesting method of swimming basically upside down while approaching prey, and then a quick flip and opening of the jaw appears to help too, with both suction and maneuverability, but testing that one is tricky so while it can be said that they do it, I cant really say why it works. A giant squid can attack from over 30 feet away- and we've obviously seen sperm whales with cuts from squid beaks and even more injuries from tentacles. That's either from a squid that knows its been run down and is turning to the fight part of &quot;fight or flight&quot; as a last ditch effort to save its life; or a giant squid who has been suctioned in but is so large that its still hanging on outside while the whale tries to successfully eat the thing. Super long tentacles can do a lot of damage even if the mantle is in the whale's mouth. We don't know the success rate of a hunt- some squid may outmanuever and live to see another day, or fight so fiercely that the whale doesn't see a benefit in exerting more energy to catch the troublesome prey. Obviously, its high enough that they regularly hunt giants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you're implying that the quid 'should realize a sperm whale is coming for it, because it can hear the whales echolocation'.</p>
<p>However, take note that, if you are being 'pinged' by echolocation (which can be very easily referenced to submarine warfare), you hear the sound, but cannot actually tell where it came from. Depending on experience and knowledge about the 'strength used to ping', you can possibly guess the distance the ping travelled, thus know how far away the source of the sound was (and it's fair to assume that squids may innately able to do that much).</p>
<p>This alone doesn't tell you whether the source of the ping actually knows your location (because for that, the ping needs to 'hit' you <strong>and</strong> make it back. If you assume that the echolocation sound has a theoretical maximum reach of X (before it becomes too silent/muffled by the water itself), then the range at which you can hear being pinged is X, but the range at which the source of the ping will be able to actually hear the ping reflection and deduce your location, is ~ 0.5X).</p>
<p>Nor can you tell the direction the ping came from. Submarines  (in WW2, which was the primary showcase for echolocation) have/had specific equipment (Hydrophones) used to 'listen to a very narrow direction'. Only with such a function would you be able to deduce the direction a ping has come from. Which I'm not certain whether squids are capable of.</p>
<p>So, the squid likely knows that a whale is near, it <em>may</em> know the approximate distance to the whale, but it <em>almost certainly</em> doesn't know the whale's direction. So I don't think there's much it can do to actively avoid the whale, if it doesn't know where to run.</p></div>		</li>
