<p>This is absolutely not true. The Lamniformes originated just over 100 MYA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also most Shark species tend to be around for a very long time, espically compared to land Apex predators, where a couple million years is generally the max. This might have to do with the oceans being a bit more stable than land ecosystems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know we don't really know, but given its size I think there's a safe bet in suggesting they weren't able to get enough food once the ice age got going during the Pliocene epoch. These giants weighted 60 tons (54 tonnes) and water or not that's a hell of a lot of calories for a predator to continue being that big</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What Alberius said, basically. Megalodon would've needed a shitload of food to keep going, and any disturbance would have a major effect on their population. There was a more general extinction of marine life at the same time that we stop finding Megalodon teeth in the fossil record, which may have been the event that caused its extinction, or at least a factor in it.</p>
<p>Incidentally that food requirement is why Megalodon is definitely not hiding in the deep ocean - there's barely enough to eat down there as is!</p></div>		</li>
