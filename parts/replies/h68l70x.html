			<div class="markdown"><p>In studies with laboratory animals, cannabinoids that bind to CB1 have been reported to improve dyskinesias, the involuntary movements that can develop after several years of taking levodopa therapy. Cannabinoids also have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which could point to neuroprotective activity.</p>
<p>Found this while looking for an answer myself thought I’d share it with ya!</p>
<p>Basically the main reason for medically using weed is to limit anxiety, pain, and swelling right now, but research is being done for many many other diseases/illnesses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding tremors. I would assume the following (happy to be corrected if wrong)
Antipsychotics can cause Parkinsonianism (symptoms of Parkinson’s) by blocking dopamine in the nigrostriatial pathway. In Parkinson’s there is too little dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain. </p>
<p>Cannabis can cause psychosis. Psychosis is caused by an increase in dopamine in the mesolimic pathway. </p>
<p>Thus I would assume that an increase in dopamine from cannabis can help alleviate symptoms of Parkinson’s. Nonetheless I would advise anyone with Parkinson’s to see their neurologist for management of the disease and not to use cannabis unless advised by their doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I have an experience that’s sort of related , was hospitalised for arrhythmic and fast heart rate (180bpm) after a series of seizures. Had hypokalaemia so low potassium which was exacerbating my epilepsy and putting a major strain on my heart. So I guess it depends on what type of electrolytes you’re deficient in , I think I remember they gave me a sodium drip but they didn’t really explain the details but yes I have noticed whenever my potassium levels are down I have a lower seizure threshold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The level of sodium in the blood is tightly regulated.  If your have hyponatremia on these meds, they'd probably take you off the med.  Increasing dietary salt probably would not help.</p></div>		</li>
