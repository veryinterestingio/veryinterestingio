			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to tag onto this, my compliance officer will audit my LexisNexis searches occasionally to ensure we are only using the service for our legal needs. (I work for a law firm servicing the finance industry.)</p>
<p>When I'm training someone new on LexisNexis, I run a search on myself to show them the features.  Before I do that, I have to fill out a form and tell my compliance team the date/time I will be running the search and for what purpose.</p>
<p>It's highly regulated. Abuse is not tolerated and is grounds for termination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tagging onto this, I used to access Lexis-Nexis as part of my work as a fraud investigator. We were told repeatedly and in no uncertain terms that unauthorized use of it was grounds for termination. We were told - although I never had this done on me - that any search you had made could be accessed by a supervisor and you would, if asked, need to justify why you made that specific search. So man did we take notes of every name peripheral to every case we worked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use it for the exact same reason and we we're audited a few weeks ago by the information commission as they'd been tipped off that the system was being used by some insurers without being signed off.</p>
<p>As we were one of the first UK companies to use it (along with iovation) they were asking us how it helped in the end ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't disagree that there is room for exploitation.</p>
<p>But the penalty for exploitation is civil penalties and loss of licensure. There's a big incentive to make sure everyone plays by the rules.</p>
<p>But nothing is 100%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work as a money laundering investigator and we had a new kid working here experimenting with the application and apparently searched for Derek Jeter. The next day LN contacted us and told us that this appears unusual and wanted to inform the superiors here of his activity. It wasn't done maliciously but he learned the seriousness of this. Failure was due to a poor training manager who left him play around without guild lines or guidance. </p>
<p>The questions are annoying but I understand that this information is extremely personal and there should be a reason for every search as I wouldn't want anyone accessing my personal information. </p>
<p>Been using it for over a decade now and I've always found it to be very helpful in my work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Underwriting too but by requesting a quote you are implying permission for us to access your driving records and clue report. However some states will not allow us access California and Pennsylvania specifically. I require the insured to provide us the mvr before we can bind coverage due to this hiccup. </p></div>		</li>
