			<div class="markdown"><p>I dream in both English and American Sign Language. I also sign in my sleep.  </p>
<p>A few years ago I had oral sedation for a crown and the dentist kept trying to ask me questions and I was so out of it I respond in ASL (it was easier). Thankfully my husband was there to interpret :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Dreaming in ASL sounds awesome!</p>
<p>I'm not fluent enough to dream in ASL. But when I had my wisdom teeth out, I signed right away after waking up. The rational part of my brain told me it would be most effective - you know, better than writing lol. (luckily an assistant in the room could read the letters C-O-L-D. they did not understand dizzy. ugh. and i threw up.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loll. I had a similar experience. I went in for a surgery and when I came to i couldn't speak English for some reason. The doctors and nurses were asking questions and telling me stuff in English which i understood but my replies were all in Spanish. They were all stumped. Luckily a friend worked at the hospital and was able to translate for me.</p></div>		</li>
