			<div class="markdown"><p>You can have an infinite series with a finite sum. Add 1/2 to 1/4 to 1/8 and keep going, you'll keep adding but you'll never hit 1. This means that 1 is our limit.</p>
<p>So that's all the math he's doing.</p>
<p>In this case we're talking about 1/49 but for explaining purposes I'm gonna use 1/3. 1/3 is roughly equal to 0.3, 1/33 is roughly equal to 0.03, 1/333 is roughly 0.003. You get the point.</p>
<p>If you treat this as a series, and keep adding smaller fractions together, you get a nice repeating decimal. This becomes our limit, that's why 1/3 as a decimal is infinitely repeating 0.33333... It approaches the value of 1/3 but will never &quot;actually&quot; reach it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like of a number is less than 1 but more than 0 you can keep multiplying it and it will infinitley get smaller while never actually reaching 1 or 0.</p>
<p>Idk someone answeredy comment on a way that's really simple and makes a lot of sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real fun is knowing that a rational number in the form of 1/49 or 1/499 always results in a <em>repeating</em> decimal.  So, the sums of powers of two shifted by a number of digits will at first start overlapping to mess up the series (64/10^12 will overlap with 128/10^14 ) but at some point it will start repeating as well... even if it takes 49 digits to do it.</p>
<p>Sorrry to muddy the waters with a tangent in what is supposed to be ELI5, but I've gotten myself curious.</p>
<p>Edit -- the pattern repeats after 42 digits.  10^(42) - 1 is divisible by 49.</p>

<p>I got the digits from here:</p>

<p>I think the worst case is that you need a N-1 repeating digits to represent 1/N.  But often you stumble upon a repeat sooner.  Here (10^42 - 1) / 49 = 20408163265306122448979591836734693877551 , so you get a 42 digit repeating decimal.</p>
<p>There's probably some modulo arithmetic tricks.  Using the difference of two squares:</p>
<p>10^42 - 1 = (10^21 - 1)(10^21 + 1).</p>
<p>We know that (10^21 - 1) would be the worst case denominator for 1/22, but we already know that 1/22 is 1/2 * 1/11.  So, (10^21 + 1) is the factor which must be divisible by 49.  Not sure how to do that math.</p>
<p>Edit -- there <em>is</em> a trick with modulo arithimetic!  A*B mod 49 = ((A mod 49)(B mod 49)) mod 49.  So you can break this up into more reasonably sized numbers that will fit into excel.  10^6 mod 49 is 8.  So 10^42 mod 49 is 8^7 mod 49 = 2097152 mod 49 = 1</p></div>		</li>
