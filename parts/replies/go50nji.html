			<div class="markdown"><p>exactly— it’s an extension of that “antsy” feeling you get when you’re anxious. Your body is preparing itself to react to stressful events; blood flow increases to extremities &amp; we get a boost of adrenaline because it helps us physically get out of whatever situation is stressing us out. Or at least, that’s the evolutionary reason for it. </p>
<p>The issue is that in modern-day, stressors aren’t usually things that we’re actively trying to work through. If anything, I wish the body would chill out and help me think more clearly in response to stress, haha. It’s also why thinking about stressful things is so exhausting in general— it actually puts the body back into the same conditions that it would if the stressor was happening at that exact moment, just to a lesser extent. Fast reflexes helped our ancestors survive, and teeth grinding is just a part of that body having a ton of extra jitters and needing an outlet for them (similar to other physical manifestations of anxiety, like bouncing your leg up and down). </p>
<p>I might be missing some info, but this is my understanding of it at least! Regardless, grinding sucks. If you do it a lot in your sleep, I’d highly recommend retainers to cushion your jaw with at night</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We’re evolutionarily developed to handle stress in short bursts, but modern day has us stressed 24/7. This isn’t an advantage at all, but it hasn’t stopped us from being able to reproduce. Therefore, it isn’t a trait that’s been selected against.</p></div>		</li>
