			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy hell.  Great mini-essay.</p>
<p>One suggestion: while I agree that the lower visual range of most mammals reduces sexual pressure on fancy colours, I think you lean on the argument a little heavily.  There are plenty of mammals that are predated upon by birds and lizards and therefore have evolutionary pressure that could use the higher colour space.  Thoughts?</p></div>		</li>
