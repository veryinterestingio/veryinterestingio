			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be interested in epigenetics. Your genome is essentially a textbook of instructions for building proteins, but in these instructions  you have regulatory parts. Some parts are locked off in some organs, after all there's no need for your eye to tell cells to create all the cell transporter proteins that the kidney has. There's also no reason all the cells in your eye should have the &quot;grow and divide&quot; genes on, so that part is kept silent. </p>
<p>The DNA itself has a series of switches that are not part of the code, but instead like little tags and bookmarks that go &quot;read me!&quot; or &quot;go away&quot; to proteins like polymerase. Then there are various other enzymes that go around and turn on/off these tags, or add them, depending on the cellular stressors and needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Switches turning on and off.</p>
<p>A portion of dna will tell a cell to make a structure on the cell membrane that in effect &quot;listens&quot; to molecular signals from neighboring cells (a chemical fits into the structure, or not).</p>
<p>Based on those signals received, or not, parts of the dna will be read and followed and the cell will grow a certain way or behave a certain way or make a certain chemical. Or not.</p>
<p>If this sounds really simple, yet so much complexity... how? A computer program is much the same: little binary switches are being turned on or off, that's it. Yet from that you can play a videogame or work a spreadsheet. In much the same way the basic rules of chemistry in dna and with proteins can encode much complexity: you. Life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how does one cell that divides and multiplied into 2:4:8:16:etc decide which cells will turn on/off what?  If it all starts at the same base zygote, why do not all the daughter cells decide to become the same thing...eyes...liver...etc. what keeps all the future daughter cells from all forming into eyes and becoming some horrific entity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There a bunch of ways cells regulate expression. </p>
<p>One thing like methylation of DNA cause the cell so tightly wind the DNA so that it can not be read and copied to form the protein. </p>
<p>Another way is that cells create proteins in a form that is not active. And when your body needs those proteins, you create or release another protein to activate the first protein and cause it to function (for example, peptigen). </p>
<p>There are also genes that encode for a number of proteins, just what’s left is changes. For example, if I write out the alphabet, I can take out specific letters I can spell out different words.  </p>
<p>Cells will often turn on or off genes during development due to differing levels or different hormones (this is often done due to methylation) so that that cell lineage will never expression those genes (for example telomerase in basically everything but sex cells, or the division cycle in most nerve and muscle cells). </p>
<p>But if you are asking how do genetic instructions cause specific functions, it comes down to proteins forming very very specific shapes due to hydrophobic interactions and ionic bonding. Those shapes cause functions by fitting with other things (enzymes for example) or binding with certain substances (hemoglobin with oxygen and CO). Some act as signaling hormones. So it fits very specifically with certain cell receptors that says to do something (insulin basically does this)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome reply!</p>
<p>This is a little advanced for Reddit and doesn't change the substance of your answer, but I just think it's interesting so I want to mention it.</p>
<p>Another cool method of regulation is post-transcriptional RNA induced transcriptional silencing where small interfering RNAs stimulate the formation of heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Also, while methylation is typically associated with gene silencing via H3K9 methylation, there is no actual hard relationship between histone modifications and gene activation/inactivation. Methylation can activate and deactivate genes depending on where it is added. The modifications essentially signal for proteins to bind and modulate expression, so it depends on which protein is attracted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear what you’re saying, and I understand the logic and I believe you, but the simple part of my brain is having a hard time accepting that answer lol</p>
<p>Straight up changing the number of limbs and growing entirely new organs (wing membranes) isn’t the same as “puberty” lol</p>
<p>It’s not like organs were replaced ship of Theseus style once cell at a time into a better/different of the same organ. It’s totally different organs, right?</p>
<p>I guess what I’m asking is how big is the middle section of the Venn diagram? How many organs in both the butterfly and the caterpillar are “the same” to any degree?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I'd call it a meta organism. They are one organism.</p>
<p>Monarch butterflies are amazing. They take the craziness beyond even being a Caterpillar and butterfly. They have a 4 generation cycle where the generation born in fall lives 7 months and migrates to California while the ones born in the summer only.live for 3 to 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Same genes! Radically different lifespans based on when they are born</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s funny because from what I understand insects like that effectively read temperature and humidity data when they are growing and turn certain genes on and off based on that? At least I know many time their single life cycle that way, it makes ends to assume monarchs work similarly.</p>
<p>But that only work practically if they were more simple, not more complex. It would be like writing a flowchart I imagine, and the more complex the system is the more difficult to “code” for to the point where we only see that kind of flowchart in smaller less complex species?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a bunch of imperfect metaphors, and that would be one of them, but the reality still is what it is.</p>
<p>You could also look at it as different phenotypes of the same genotype that occur under different conditions. Some social insects have different &quot;genders&quot; assigned chemically to organisms that are generically identical. Those are development conditions that cause the same genes to express as different bodies -- though not as different as caterpillar and butterfly.</p>
<p>Imagine this not very realistic thought experiment: some millions of generations pass and some species of butterfly stops abandoning their eggs and instead starts bringing them food, then the larvae evolve to become more and more dependant on the parent. Then, one could imagine a point where the parent collects and turns a ton of food into a sort of milk/protein broth that is equivalent to the building block protein makeup inside of a crysalis except for the genetic material. Then, one could imagine the eggs being planted into this broth sack built by the parent and skipping more and more of the earlier stages of development. The caterpillar turns mostly to soup anyway before transforming, with very few organ-like structures being maintained. One could then imagine an egg developing directly into a butterfly.</p></div>		</li>
