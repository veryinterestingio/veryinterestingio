			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally. It's not an exaggeration to say that there's been huge strides forward in vaccine technology in the last year that will improve vaccine development going forward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A main reason we got vaccines so quickly was because of the work put in in the last 10 years, after SARS-COV-1.  These vaccines for SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) are the result of all that work and allowed a this vaccine to be developed in 2 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah probably. mRNA is probably going to be used to develop lots of vaccines in the future if all goes well with these ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How hard is it to set up a factory to create the vaccines after the mRNA is coded?  For example, here in Canada we're seeing how not having our own vaccine manufacturing has hurt us in procuring vaccines on the global market so we want to set up our own plant(s).</p>
<p>How hard is that?  Does it make sense for every country to do the same?  Or is the initial cost of creating the factory dictate that it makes more sense for a few countries to manufacture the vaccines for the entire world?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. The current tech is a delivery mechanism, not a specific vaccine solution. So the next time they will just have to figure out the key RNA sequence and then &quot;load&quot; it in. Development time for future vaccines will be cut down dramatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to note, other viruses (ahem, HIV) may not have particularly good vaccine targets.  We're fortunate this is a coronavirus (which has that big, obvious Spike protein that the virus needs to infect you), which had a lot of study over the years, so we were ready to just pop in a new sequence to get a vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
