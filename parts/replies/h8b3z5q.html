			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interested in this too, and the first I've heard of it.  I've contracted dengue twice, the first time in India in 1997, and again in Thailand in 2001.   The first time I had it was awful, knocked me off my feet for about a week.  The second time I felt like I was going to die, and was hospitalized for a week.  High fever, bleed from gums, waking hallucinations and my entire body just ached.  </p>
<p>I love to travel, but I'm always afraid I'm going to get bit by the wrong mosquito and end up with it a third time, and frankly I'm not sure I'd survive that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had dengue as a kid back in the 90s, and since I never left the country until that one time 3 years ago, I do think I'm immune with whatever strain is in here. Thanks for giving me two potential countries I wouldn't visit in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A vaccine merely helps the immune system to be prepared for a future infection by giving it a sample of the pathogens antigens and encouraging a reaction either by virtue of the antigens being part of a weakened live strain or by correlation with the presence of an irritating adjuvant such as an aluminum compound or more commonly now a weak bacterial toxin. If you are already infected and your immune system is active (albeit performing poorly) than a vaccine for what you are infected with will be of no use and one for a similar strain will merely distract the immune system and confuse things further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least some vaccinations can help even after infection. Rabies vaccine for example is commonly administered post exposure, so that your immune system can get ahead of the virus. Smallpox vaccine was also effective post exposure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Many available vaccines have demonstrated post-exposure effectiveness, but no published systematic reviews have synthesized these findings,” write researchers from Dartmouth and the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>
<p>“While preexposure vaccination protects uninfected individuals from infection, post-exposure vaccination serves to modify or prevent clinical disease among those who are already infected,” the authors add. “As a result, post-exposure trials must operate within a constrained timeframe: participants must be identified and treated between exposure and symptom onset. Measurable benefits may occur if the vaccine stimulates an immune response faster or larger than that provoked by the natural infection alone.</p>
