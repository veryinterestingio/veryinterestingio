			<div class="markdown"><p>Lmao. Mine too. He asked to go outside a bit before mealtime and we were playing fetch. Mealtime hit and he starts chewing the stick. Not sure if it was because mealtime or just because he likes chewing sticks...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs actually produce a bile when it’s time to eat to help absorb fats and nutrients. Sometimes they will vomit up the bile if they don’t get fed in time. If your dog ever starts dry heaving and then vomiting up a clear/yellow liquid, you know that you need to either adjust it’s diet or it’s feeding schedule. It tends to happen more often with dogs who are on a raw diet, since they are able to digest raw meat a lot faster than kibble. It can usually be prevented by providing small snacks in between meals or just allowing your dog time to get used to a consistent feeding schedule.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This will help your metabolism rythm get used to your new sleeping schedule making it easier to fall asleep/wake up with your new sleeping schedule.</p>
<p>You'll wake up more energetic after a while, and become sleepier at your new bed time :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One clarification to /u/adhdBoomeringue comment: Ghrelin levels will start to decline if you don't consume food. Hence the hunger goes away.</p>
<p>I've intermittent fasted for the last 5 years and I rarely feel hungry till 18:00. Don't want to influence you with any bro science, but intermittent fasting feels nice and its nice that the constant feeling of hunger isn't present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is some sort of communal hormone process going on, sort of like how periods tend to align.</p>
<p>Over Christmas, I stopped eating lunch completely, and often wouldn't have breakfast either. Didn't get hungry until about 6 fairly consistently.</p>
<p>By the second day back at work I was really hungry at lunchtime and going without would have been a real effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Periods only align because not all people who have them have a 'perfect' 28 day cycle. Given enough time, a group of people will have their cycles align, then unalign again within a few cycles.</p></div>		</li>
