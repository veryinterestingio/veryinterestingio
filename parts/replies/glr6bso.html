			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly somewhen at Yale once theorized that it could become a liquid when heated to above 3500C in a vacuum chamber. Sadly none of the very few facilities capable to create these conditions picked up the experiment yet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you heat wood in the absence of air, it will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructive_distillation?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">destructively distillate</a> before it melts -- basically, it breaks down into component bits (for wood, that includes charcoal, tar and other components). At least, that's what happens when you heat it with a very low amount of air; I'm guessing it would happen in a vacuum, too.</p>
<p>We did this in my high school chem class. If you put small scraps of wood in a test tube and then apply a flame to the closed end, the temperature is enough to remove most of the air, and the wood starts to break down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to look all the way down here for the only correct answer. The bonds will break before the excitation level in the molecules is achieved to make the mobile and thus “liquid”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I don't know this for sure</p>
<p>But I would think that in a vacuum, since there is no pressure you could <em>maybe</em> lower the melting point of the cellulose fibers so that wood melts without a caramelization reaction occuring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, this was what I learned back then. Wood and other matter have melting points, it is just that combustion happens at much lower temperatures. I think this better answers OP's question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood isnt a pure substance, its a bunch of different substances held together in little pockets. </p>
<p>Its weird to compare, but wood isnt like an alloy. Each of the little substances in wood have their own melting points, many of which are actually already liquid. </p>
<p>Think of a chunk of wood like a 8 story building. It doesnt make sense to say &quot;why doesnt the building melt?&quot; if it burns, because you can see the difference between the concrete, the steel, the glass, the pipes filled with water, etc. </p>
<p>In the same way it is lighlty nonsense to say &quot;I have some liquid building,&quot; it is also nonsensical to say &quot;I have some liquid wood.&quot; Its just harder to tell with wood, because woods components are really damn small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but the main thing that keeps wood from &quot;melting&quot; is cellulose fibers.
Everything else is either a wax, terpene, alkaloids, or left over cellular components. Cellulose is the major components of wood that's very difficult to melt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would just give op the idea that wood has a melting point which it does not. Simply because a melting point is a characteristic of a pure material, and wood is not. It's a combination of carbon, hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and Sulphur (I guess). And the complex structures and molecules making up wood as a whole will become liquid at some point probably, if you were able to heat it up to that point without it burning. Safest answer is: materials like wood do not undergo single phase transitions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood is 65% cellulose/hemicellulose and 25% lignin.</p>
<p>I think in specific terms what OP is asking is &quot;what is the melting point of paper?&quot; (Pure cellulose)
But this is eli5, I don't expect OP to ask &quot;what is the melting point of a solution of 65% cellulose, 25 lignin...etc&quot;</p></div>		</li>
