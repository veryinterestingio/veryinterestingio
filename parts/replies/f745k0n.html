			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The strength of magnetic force drops rapidly with distance (as distance cubed rather than squared like gravity). It’s fairly easy to get an intuition why: basically the farther away you are, the more point-like the magnet appears to you, with the poles increasingly canceling each other out from your perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is gravity unique in that it has no &quot;opposite&quot; that it both attracts and cancels out?</p>
<p>That fascinating to think of. Positive and north attract negative and south, respectively, but each of those opposite forces cancel each other when they get close. With gravity, though, mass attracts mass, and that just continually increases gravitational force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure.  Though the magnet is operating at ranges of centimeters, while the mass is operating at a range of, effectively, 6400 km.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but while the center of mass of the earth is at...um... roughly its center, you still have a whole lot of dirt and rock, or a massive table or counter-top that was directly in contact with the item before your magnet pulled it away.  </p>
<p>And yet the object didn't even seem to put up a fight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't u/bEloW_aVeRagE_PiPi have a point, though? For low concentrations of mass gravity is adequately described as proportional to G/r², and G is indeed very small. But as one approaches the conditions of a black hole it gets disproportionally harder to escape. I haven't thought this through properly, but doesn't this mean that the effective coupling strength of gravity is much higher there? That is - isn't the statement that gravity is very weak something that assumes its weak-field limit?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Add a bit more gravity and you can shatter the strong nuclear force, and bust out the quarks, or collapse into a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. But that's just describing the simple, boring <em>proportionate</em> increase in gravity. 10x more mass resulting in 10x more force. The whole point of my post was that once you have enough mass in a small enough volume the gravitational response becomes <em>disproportionally</em> large. 10x more mass but much more than 10x more force. Effectively each particle you add makes each of the other particles contribute more individually than they did before.</p>
<p>A lump of 1e10 electrons clumped into a radius of 1 m will fly apart immediately, with the gravitational attraction between those elections not mattering at all. The same is the case for 1e30 electrons. But once you reach 1e36 electrons the electric potential energy from having so much charge bunched into a relatively small volume like this reaches about 2e44 J (here I'm using the rough approximation E = kQ²/r, which ignores the details of how the electrons are distributed in the ball, but it should be good to within a factor of a few), which is equivalent to a rest mass of 2.6e27 kg. The Schwarzschild radius corresponding to this mass is 3.8 m, which is larger than the radius of the ball itself. So a 1 m ball of 1e36 electrons would <em>not</em> blow itself apart. Gravity would win and it would collapse into a black hole.</p>
<p>Notice than in all these examples there are only electrons present. No positive charges to cancel out the repulsion and reduce the total charge. By the simple proportional logic you were using repulsion would always win, no matter how many electrons we have. But once you have enough electrons in there somehow gravity manages to get the upper hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_post-Newtonian_formalism" target="_blank">To give a rough idea</a> of why this happens, it's not just the mass of the electrons themselves that source the gravity, the electromagnetic potential energy also sources gravity. Even the gravitational potential caused by these itself gravitates, and so on. This last part causes the attraction to grow nonlinearly as one approaches the Schwarzschild limit.</p></div>		</li>
