			<div class="markdown"><p>First part bang on.</p>
<p>Second part is incorrect - what you describe is herd immunity or eradication of a disease. </p>
<p>You would need a very high portion of the population to be inoculated against a disease (via vaccine) to ERADICATE a disease, but a vaccine that works will work on an individual basis. </p>
<p>For example, we now have a vaccine that can help protect women and men from a particular strain of HPV (gardasil is the tradename I think) - if you have the vaccine you are protected. You do not need others to be vaccinated in order to receive the benefit of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Herd immunity also requires that high rate of vaccination - this is to stop the virus having any kind of viable place to “live”. This also requires a large majority of a population to be vaccinated in order to work. </p>
<p>Herd immunity is less reliable as rates of vaccinations decrease, because any potential disease has more options (in unvaccinated people) in which to live and hang out. Because it can hang out somewhere (with or without symptoms) and because we are social creatures, the virus can easily be transferred to someone else who is not ABLE to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>In the case of someone who is unable to be vaccinated, like basically anyone with an immune compromised system, (like say certain cancer patients), the ONLY defence they would have against a disease like flu or whatever IS that herd immunity. </p>
<p>As for the rest, lots of sexually transmitted diseases are in the form of a virus, but lots are not. Virii are extremely (relatively) complex organisms and what we may think is one thing can in fact be multiple strains of something of the same family, so to speak.</p>
<p>Like HPV - we have a vaccine for a particular strain of HPV that tends to cause cervical cancer later in life, but there are many other strains that the vaccine does NOT protect against.</p>
<p>Edit: seeing a lot of “flu vaccines aren’t useful” or are only effective xyz% of the time...</p>
<p>That’s only true if you think that a flu vaccine should 100% prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>That’s not the goal. </p>
<p>It’s about making you LESS SICK if you do get the flu.</p>
<p>Flu used to kill people. Vaccinating primes your immune system against the flu virus, so that when you do inevitably encounter it in the wild, your immune system is already primed to fight back.</p>
<p>Or, think of it this way:</p>
<p>Vaccinating is a bullet proof vest. It’s a defence mechanism.</p>
<p>Having a bullet shot into the bullet proof vest is preferable to getting shot in the chest WITHOUT the vest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder where that 95% figure is coming from. I’m just a layman, but I would say the flu vaccine is considered useful yet its <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectivenessqa.htm#differ" target="_blank">vaccine efficiency</a> is generally <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/past-seasons-estimates.html" target="_blank">30-50%</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that’s also inaccurate because there are several vaccines that aren’t that efficacious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it a really interesting coincidence that the infections that caused the most morbidity and mortality over the course of human history just so happened to be some of the most straightforward infections to make vaccines for. It was very fortunate that smallpox, measles and polio, etc were pretty easy vaccines to develop. Those gave us a lot of false hope about our ability to vaccinate our way out of infectious diseases... HIV really shattered that idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and this is the reason we will not see a covid-19 vaccine anytime soon and if we do it's likely to have major complication.s people who are holding their breath for vaccine to end this pandemic are truly the most disillusioned of all...</p></div>		</li>
