			<div class="markdown"><p>Some also have very tiny holes called weep holes along the front “leading” edge of the wings, tail, propellor, and windshield. When the pilot needs to he can pump anti icing fluid out of these holes by turning on a switch which melts accumulated ice and prevents more from forming for a period of time. With this system a pilot can fly into what is called “known icing conditions” where other pilots have reported ice or where the weather service can predict a high likelihood of ice forming. This is called a TKS system and is better than expanding rubber boots and electric heaters but is also very expensive, and once the fluid runs low you have to get out of the ice or start looking for a place to land.</p></div>		</li>
