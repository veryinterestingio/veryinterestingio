			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I know enough to say it's been awhile since I've had a chemistry class but I'll try for the first two (I don't know the biochemistry of moisturizing but I'd love to hear about it too).
'Straightening' as I called it uses electrostatic interactions. Keratin in hair has a cysteine group that can have a slightly negative charge when interacting with water. These groups interact with positively charged amine groups in the conditioner. The conditioner coats the hair. These coated strands are lubricated by the 'fatty' chain in the conditioner (fatty chains are hydrophobic, or water fearing. This is a property of non-charged groups), leaving hair feeling smoother. Strands also repel each other as they are all now covered with 'like' positive charges.
Cleaning is more straight forward. Soap is a salt of a fatty chain. Oils are fatty hydrocarbon chains. Soap, without water is stablized in salt. When it's in water however, the chain has charged and non-charged properties. This makes the chain bend around itself.  Non-charged groups on the chain 'attracts' to non-charged groups on the oils and vice versa. The result are circular structures named micelles that can be washed away with water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They all do the same thing but the heavy/oily feeling changes depending on the product type. Leave in conditioners are lighter conditioners that you can put in your hair without it feeling greasy. The molecules are often smaller or less concentrated so they don't weigh down the hair. Masques are loaded with a lot of fatty alcohols and moisturizing agents that are meant to be washed out because they weigh your hair down. Conditioners are somewhere in between</p></div>		</li>
