			<div class="markdown"><p>While i do look at tourism as a whole, my expertise does not lie in the cruise industry specifically. How they do their planning and coordinating of efforts would be a better question for CLIA- Cruise Lines International Association. <a href="https://cruising.org/" target="_blank"><a href="https://cruising.org/" target="_blank">https://cruising.org/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been surprised to read about the number of cruse lines that were still continuing to leave port through mid-march, with plenty of passengers still willing to take their vacation.  Given how quickly diseases are known to spread on cruise ships, I would think most would have been quick to try to cancel their trip.  Do you think the decision for passengers to go forward with their vacation is garden-variety <em>escalation of commitment</em>, or do you think the choice to proceed despite the high risk (both in terms of probability and cost/impact) is unique to customers who choose to go on cruises for their vacation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good luck getting the CLIA to respond with anything other than the absolute most dishonest corporate spin / propaganda for the foreseeable future. The coronavirus epidemic is a shareholder disaster of apocalyptic proportions for them, one from which they will find it very difficult, if not impossible, to fully recover.</p>
<p>Cruise ships had an extraordinarily poor reputation for infection control even prior to this epidemic, with multiple egregious outbreaks of Norovirus and hepatitis repeatedly making headlines. The cruise industries ubiquitous “flag of convenience“ scheme, prioritizing corporate tax avoidance, systematic economic exploitation of their All-Third-World crew, and absolute indifference and accountability to environmental concerns has backfired on them in the most spectacular manner possible, exposing them for the globalist corporatist parasites that they have always been. </p>
<p>The appalling spectacle of their plague ships wandering port to port, desperately trying to find someplace, ANY PLACE, that would let them discharge their cargo of infected, will not be soon forgotten by the traveling public.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a resident of a remote Southeast Alaska town that~~ gets~~got over 1 million cruise ship visitors last year, I can say with considerable confidence that the preparation for mass casualty events consisted largely of hoping for the best and praying desperately that nothing serious happened.</p></div>		</li>
