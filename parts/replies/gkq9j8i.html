			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I understand you correctly, a bubble of steam forms at the bottom of the kettle. As this bubble rises, the steam cools and returns to a liquid state. As it converts back from a gas to a liquid, the bubble cavitates, causing the sound. Is that correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Once all the water is hot enough, the bubbles won't turn back to liquid and so will not make a sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always figured the reason why it got quiet right before was because the water was taking a deep breath before it starts to whistle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does the steam bubble collapse so rapidly?   Seems like that would be &quot;slow&quot;, by which I mean a hundred ms or so, which I picture as not being violent enough to create an pressure wave. </p>
<p>I get the explaination, it's just weird that the steam bubbles collapse with a pop instead of a smooth fading out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would water boil faster (or more quietly?) if you frequently stirred/agitated the water to mix the hot and cold water as it heats up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Faster probably, because mixing will always introduce colder water to the element and temperature gradient is the driving force behind heat transfer. </p>
<p>Quieter probably not, the bubbles will still form and will still collapse on themselves until the water is at saturation.</p></div>		</li>
