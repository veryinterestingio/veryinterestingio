			<div class="markdown"><p>More fundamentally neither first-year physics students nor OP is even correct in assuming there is <strong>any</strong> non-zero probability of such events. Quantum tunneling doesn't exist for macroscopic objects. Literally zero probability. Wave-function collapse and all that. Same as Schrodinger's cat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really a correct explanation either. The current best description relies on decoherence and it's honestly just not as simple as that.</p>
<p>The reality is that the object consists of a lot of very strongly interacting quantum fields and they are also interacting with the quantum fields of the environment. The probability of such an event occuring may be non-zero, you would really need to do the calculations to work it out but that would be ridiculously difficult to do for anything more than large molecules. </p>
<p>There is no stage at which quantum rules like tunneling stop becoming true, it's just that the results of really complicated many particle quantum systems averages out to behave mostly 'classical'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe my brain is just too concrete to get this stuff, but I hate when people talk about &quot;non-zero&quot; chances of things. They'll say things like &quot;there's a non-zero chance that you could randomly teleport to another location across the globe.&quot; I mean, maybe that's technically true, I don't even know tbh, but it's pretty stupid to act like it's an actual possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess, but the thing is there <strong>isn't</strong> any probability <strong>at all</strong> of your hand phasing through a table. Literally zero probability. Your hand is a macroscopic object and the table is a macroscopic object, so every wavefunction in that interaction collapses, and quantum phenomena don't apply.</p></div>		</li>
