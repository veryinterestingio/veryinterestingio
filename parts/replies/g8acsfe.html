			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes perfect sense, I really appreciate the explanation. </p>
<p>I get that this is probably unknowable, but what can you tell us about the very beginning of the universe? Like the most we know about the earliest part?</p>
<p>Do we know what the big bang started as? What was happening <em>before</em> or outside of it? Can we ever know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to the already great answers, the big bang is often misunderstood by people to be some single point where all matter started. this is an incorrect idea, all of space was created in the big bang, along with the stuff that fills that space. also, time is an integral part of space, so before the big bang there was no time, therefore there can be no &quot;before&quot; the big bang.   </p>
<p>the progression of events was nothing, then something, the concept obviously doesn't fit with our language. there is nothing in our universe to describe so we have no linguistic concept. in our language, thus in how our brains are wired, its assumed there is always a before, and a future. but seriously, the concept of time only started with the big bang, there was no space or time until that event occurred.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand why time and space are linked, and how the BB created space and time, but even without those frameworks in a pre-BB universe, causality must still exist, right?  And thus a &quot;before&quot;, &quot;now&quot;, and &quot;after&quot;?</p>
<p>How could anything even function without causality?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly this comment is extremely speculative and has very little basis in science. The fact is we don't know what happened even in the very early Big Bang: inflation is the generally accepted paradigm, but there's not even any real evidence of that, and what happened before inflation is almost completely unknown: our physics breaks down at this energy, time, and length scales. Something existed before inflation, we just don't know what. It's not just a linguistic problem, it's an observational problem: everything we can observe happened after the big bang, so we can't make any statement at all about what came before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to point out is that the Big Bang wasn't an explosion. There was no shockwave with particles scattering everywhere and smashing into eachother. The space between particles was expanding rather than the particles simply blasting outward through space. The frequency of collision was muuuuuuuch lower than intuition would suggest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not convincing on its own, though. Space may have been expanding, but the density and temperature during the early moments of the big bang was enormously higher than anything found in stars. The first answer gives a better explanation for why nuclei didn’t form during that time. Yours is only a more direct answer for why heavier nuclei weren’t formed during the BBNS epoch, but doesn’t address why they weren’t formed during earlier, denser and hotter times. Both are important parts of the story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if it wasn't an explosion, why use the word &quot;bang&quot;? </p>
<p>Why not call it The Big/Great Expansion?  Or First/Initial Expansion?</p>
<p>I'm not saying I don't believe what you're telling me. Just kinda odd name to describe something that didnt occur the way the name implies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Appreciate the explanation. Have a little follow up question. How do we messure the duration of the BBN?
Does it come purely from theory or is it messurable via the microwave background or something different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Purely theory, matched against the measurable composition of the early universe which we get from spectrographic data. But that can’t reach further back than the CMB because earlier than that the universe was opaque.</p>
<p>Also the particle accelerators create energies approaching what we think happened near the Big Bang, so there is some verification of theory there.</p></div>		</li>
