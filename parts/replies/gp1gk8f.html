			<div class="markdown"><p>The charge still dissipates fairly quickly on ocean scales, so very rarely an animal might get struck but otherwise it's not much more dangerous than being a land animal.<br />
EDIT: got curious about the waiting the storm out idea, a lot of cetaceans absolutely could wait out the average thunderstorm of 30 minutes, with some like the sperm whale having no issue at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This assumes that they know the storm is coming (otherwise it might happen when they need to breathe anyway) and also that they know the storm is active right now. I'm not even sure if they can tell that a thunderstorm is happening from underwater.</p></div>		</li>
