			<div class="markdown"><p>I Love this answer, it explains it well. But as the potato expands I assume that means that the cells multiply from the inside or is it more like the there are a fixed number of cells which expand?</p>
<p>Edit: fixed my stupid grammar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say the tubers are needed for storing starch, what's the purpose of this. I can understand why a human or an animal would store up nutrients but not a plant. What is the storage of starch for?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's both! Potatoes go through both cell division and cell enlargement. Closer to ripeness, it's more of a cell enlargement phase, where cells grow fat and juicy from all the starch they accumulate.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that's also what makes them so delicious. I don't even want to imagine a world where potatoes don't undergo cell enlargement from accumulation of starch :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how do starch cells get bigger?  A potato doesn't have veins/vessels inside it, right?  So what delivers stuff (water/sugar?) to the internal starch cells?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have to disagree. It's the butter, sour cream, bacon and chives (or cheese curds and gravy if you're Canadian) that makes them so delicious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting! Curious about how they accumulate starch. Is it the same process as sugar through photosynthesis?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're smarter than you might think.</p>
<p>In humans, these 2 mechanisms are called hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Hyperplasia = more cells. Hypertrophy = larger cells. These 2 mechanisms take place in response to a stressor.</p>
<p>The easiest example is the skeletal muscle. When you lift weights and bulk up, you don't get more muscle cells. Instead, your muscle cells get bigger. Hypertrophy.</p>
<p>When men's prostates grow in old age, that's a good example of hyperplasia. More cells.</p></div>		</li>
