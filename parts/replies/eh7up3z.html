			<div class="markdown"><p>Benoit Mandelbrot discovered a famous fractal, which is a shape that has an infinite perimeter- the more you zoom in, the more twists and turns you see. So the joke is that if you expand his middle initial, you get his name, which can be zoomed in again and again and again...</p>
<p>Banach Tarski is a way of creating two spheres out of one, based on the fact that a sphere has infinite points. So the joke is that you can make an anagram that is two of the original name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mandelbrot is making a point not about the actual perimeter of x, but about how the perimeter of x is dependent on the increment you use to measure it.</p>
<p>You're right that if you counted all the atoms like that you would reach a finite number, but choosing to measure using the radii of an atom is just an arbitrary choice. You can use smaller distances than that to make these calculations which would further increase the perimeter you would observe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if we want to take the analogy to that level, tides and waves would change the coastline too much for the atomic scale to matter. In pure math, we don't have to worry about that stuff which is why you can get to the fine details of the Mandelbrot Set's perimeter. In the math you can define a set such that you can't get down to that elementary level where it's just a very complex polygon. The finer you zoom into a fractal the more detail there is, and because it's self-similar you haven't gotten any closer to a some thing you can measure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But only if when using a smaller yardstick the increase in length is divergent. Otherwise it would approach an asymptote, not infinity.</p>
<p>Although it makes a good analogy, I don't think mandelbrot's answer to the coastline question is correct, because at some point the increase in length would diminish more quickly than the rate at which you reduce your yardstick. However for a fractal it is definitely correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty confident you could make a finite perimeter fractal with non-zero area. Imagine you had a triangle and your fractal uses a substitution rule on the three lines of that triangle (just like a Koch Snowflake). Can't you define the substitution rule such that the length of the total perimeter after substitution is extended by at most <code>c * 1/2^n</code> , where n is the iteration step? This is convergent, like you suggested. You could even artificially modify the Koch Snowflake to follow this rule by shrinking the added triangles (make them take up less than 1/3 at their base).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are fractals that would definitely reach an asymptote. The snowflake fractal where you take each line and cut it in thirds, bending the center into two sides of an equilateral triangle. Every iteration adds 1/3 of the total line length, so it converges to 150% of the original line length.</p></div>		</li>
