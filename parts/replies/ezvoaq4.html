			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't explain the the change in structure of the material from deformation. This just states that there are words for permanent vs. nonpermanent deformation. This doesn't even explain why one occurs of the other, for example atomic bond stretching vs dislocation movement.</p></div>		</li>
