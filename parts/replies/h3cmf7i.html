			<div class="markdown"><p>What about AM? For FM this makes sense, as the radio will pick up the 'strongest' wave it can find and pretend that's the carrier and then plays that as normal.</p>
<p>However with AM given it's all amplitude, shouldn't the low amplitude of the background noise result in AM static being equally low in amplitude? Or is there some sort of auto-gain functionality that kicks in and since the supposed carrier wave is low in amplitude the radio ends up boosting that significantly and the static ends up on normal levels again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because AM relies on the radio's ability to distinguish between a station's quietest amplitude and its loudest amplitude in order to shape the resulting audio wave, and the strength of the wave depends on the distance to the station (inverse square law), radios have to be able to scale the wave in order for you to hear far away stations just as well as nearby stations.</p>
<p>With loud, nearby stations, the background noise is such a small fraction of the wave's energy that you can't hear it, even when you listen closely when the radio broadcasts silence.  With stations farther away, the radio has to scale up the wave in order to interpret the full range of its amplitude, at which point the random background noise becomes an appreciable fraction of the waveform used to shape the sound, and the quality of the sound starts to go down until the radio can't tell the difference between changes in signal amplitude, and background noise.  Your ear might still pick out some patterns, but eventually the farthest signals can't compete at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a low amplitude AM signal is actually a medium amplitude waveform because of how AM works. so a signal trying to send &quot;silence&quot; will actually send the carrier wave at it's medium amplitude and your radio will pick that up strongly over the noise.</p></div>		</li>
