			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, this clarifies how touchscreens work but not what causes it to register touch from distance.<br />
If it would be normal way of it working then surely i should be able to  replicate this by putting my finger as close as it was when registering the touch. The thing is, i cant replicate this. It only happens sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electric field from the screen is still non-negligible slightly past the surface of the screen. Touch screens are usually calibrated to minimise this effect, but it still exists. The moisture you leave on the screen might affect this too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, i can register touch very close to screen at almost touching it. The thing i am talking about, that happens randomly, has a lot more distance between finger and screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You never actually have to touch a touchscreen to get it to work, you just have to get close enough to disrupt the field. My company is working on a touchscreen device that will be used outdoors and we have the field set pretty far away from the screen so that it will still work when people are wearing gloves. Your phone is either designed to have the field further away from the screen, or some sort of manufacturing issue caused the field to be further out than normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean this is good because due to electromagnetism being so strong at small distances, anything made of regular molecules is coated in a negative magnetic field if you look at that scale, meaning you cant *really* touch *anything* except, like, maybe antimatter if you can survive getting close enough</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever seen an <a href="http://www.capacitorguide.com/air-capacitor/" target="_blank">air gap capacitor</a>? An air gap has a dielectric strength. The point at which its insulating properties fail allowing an electrical connection through the air gap. Moving your finger close enough to the screen lowers the effective dielectric strength in the same way that air gap capacitor works.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could do that with pressure based resistive touchscreens. If you are really interested in fiddling then you can still find some old Pressure based Touchscreen phones/ Drawing Tablets on the internet. But still using a pen on pressure based screen might damage it. Use something soft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's used to work on resistance touch screens. But those required actual pressure and where far less precise than the current capacitance based screens.</p>
<p>You can still use capacitance based touch screens with gloves btw, just need to wet the gloved finger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Resistance screens aren’t less precise. If anything they are MORE precise. Ever use a capacitive stylus on an iPad or phone? Did you ever wonder why the tip has to be so big? Yet old palm pilot styluses could be tiny and made writing easy.</p>
<p>Resistance based screens went away because using them with fingers only is a worse experience and you can’t do multitouch with them which slows down typing. But they are more precise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they don't use your skin to close a current or something like that that you might be thinking about.</p>
<p>It's more like the touchscreen sensor builds up an electric field close to the surface of the touchscreen and since your skin can conduct electricity, putting your finger onto/close to the screen will modify that electric field. The sensor picks up that modification and registers it as a touch.</p>
