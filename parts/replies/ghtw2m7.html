			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is 1080p. It's just that resolution doesn't tell the full story. I could encode a video as 60 seconds of solid black 1920x1080 at 60fps. It would be super lossy (100%!) but still 1080p60.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is 1080p, but separating the color planes for 4:2:0 encoded video would be one color plane of 1080p and two color planes of 540p.</p>
<p>So.. I can see an argument that 1080p encoded video is not always &quot;real 1080p&quot;.</p>
<p>Uncompressed 4:2:0 1080p would technically look worse than uncompressed 4k video on a 1080p display while a 4:4:4 could look exactly identical to 4k assuming the same downsampling algorithm is used. </p>
<p>You are right, I'm just trying to clarify how I can see the argument against 1080p being real 1080p.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but there is no 4:4:4 video available of anything from streaming or blu-ray, unless you are getting a DCP from a cinema (those are actually 4:4:4). Even 4K Blu-ray uses 4:2:0 chroma subsampling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, in the very very early days of HDTV there was a TV station on Dish called HD NET that would broadcast uncompressed 1080p.  It was amazing beautiful.</p>
<p>Once HD caught on, they ran out of bandwidth on the spectrum and all HD channels were compressed.  HD ended up looking little better than uncompressed SD (I say this as someone working in television at the time with access to uncompressed SD studio signal).</p>
<p>Compression is a huge killer of quality and bandwidth compression is the biggest killer of 4k over the air tv.</p></div>		</li>
