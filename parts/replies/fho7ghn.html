			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm a biocultural anthropologist. While I never studied this issue, all great ape species have menstruation (link at bottom).  Reaching into my vague memories on discussing this topic, some have argued short menstruation is to strengthen pair bonding via more frequent sex.  Bonobos are used to reinforce that hypothesis; they have sex frequently, it acts as their social glue and tension reducing tool.</p>
<p>I really should learn more about this as it's clearly pretty important for our species, but it's slipped off my radar.</p>

<p>fertility period somewhere between the evolution of Australopithecus</p>

<p>Any speculation as to HOW this is known?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, archaeological physical anthropologists don't. I minored in that, got the books, and there's <em>nothing</em> on fertility cycles. Probably because we can't see that from bones or fossils. You just can't tell. Only some chronic illnesses and differences alter the bone. Not fertility cycles.</p></div>		</li>
