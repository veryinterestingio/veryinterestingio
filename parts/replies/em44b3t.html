			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds' eyes can't move around like ours can. When we move our heads, our eyes move to adjust, maintaining focus on an object. Birds can't move their eyes, so instead hold their heads still to get a better look at whatever they're looking at. </p>
<p>For our friend the pigeon, this means holding the head in one place, moving the body forward, then moving the head forward to catch up with the body, leading to that bobbing motion.</p></div>		</li>
