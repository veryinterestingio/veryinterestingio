			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all fine, but I've always wondered how they can know that the wavelength of light that they're registering is its &quot;true&quot; wavelength or if it has been subjected to the doppler effect.</p>
<p>If you see a red light bulb, how can you know whether it's moving away from you, or if it's actually emitting a red colored light? You can of course compare it to other light bulbs that has other similar characteristics, but how can you be sure? I think they do this with stars - they compare the star to our Sun, in terms of composition, size and other parameters. But when they look at the spectra, how are they able to determine that the star has the same composition as the Sun, thus it <em>should</em> shine with the same colours as it, but since it appears redder, it's moving away from us?</p>
<p>In my mind it's a chicken and egg conundrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elements have certain spectral lines when not moving. For example, if you burn lithium you'll see a colored explosion. If you put that light under a spectroscope, you'll see exactly what wavelengths are being emitted. These wavelengths are always at set distances apart. So when you point your spectroscope at the sun, you'll see the same wavelengths at set distances apart so you know the sun has lithium in it. But when you point your spectroscope at another star you see wavelengths that are at the same distance apart, but they're shifted a bit towards the red side. That means the star has lithium and is moving away from us.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This bit explains something I've wondered about <em>for years</em> without being able to find the answer. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Okay, so by taking this into account, the scientists know what the wavelength <em>should</em> be. They also know the relationship between speed and apparent red shift, so they're then able to determine the speed at which the star is moving away. </p>
<p>To figure out the distance: They know at which intensity a star with a certain composition should shine. They can then compare that intensity to the observed intensity. /u/TheFreeBooter said that &quot;estimate the distance from you to the object. This is because there is a natural law in the universe where objects are moving away from you faster the further away you are from it.&quot; We've already figured out of the speed is determined. Perhaps they're using these two values to estimate the distance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/nurdrage did a wonderful experoment on tube., burning lithium. ( Lithium is actually toxic). Thats wy you see a &quot;DO NOT OPEN&quot; on batteries.</p>
<p>Why you named right the lithium? Its not a common flammable. This is just a question, i am not presuming any malicious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're imagining a light bulb where the only thing we care about is the color. A better metaphor for spectral lines is a neon sign that says &quot;Lithium.&quot; We can read the shape even if the color got wonky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You shouldn't simplify something to the point of being completely wrong. I see you are more correct later, but your &quot;simply&quot; point probably just makes the whole thing more confusing to someone who doesn't know what you're talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is moving relative to Earth thanks to the expansion of the Universe. We can estimate distance using the Doppler shift by assuming that the object is not moving particularly fast towards or away from Earth <em>other</em> than through expansion.</p></div>		</li>
