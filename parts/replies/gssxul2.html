			<div class="markdown"><p>My tip would be use an ad blocking dns. Google it and you'll find info on it. You'd probably also have to find instructions on how to change the dns your phone uses. Iirc some phone models don't let you do so easily.</p>
<p>Once it's set up, it should block ads on browsers and other apps as well without having to install anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PiHole. I will never, ever stop praising it. For an afternoon's worth of fiddling around with settings, I have been saved thousands of hours worth of downloading/seeing/watching ads.</p>
<p>Yes, it does require a bit of tweaking--make a backup as soon as you get it stable--but man it is just the bees knees. Nothing on my network gets out and does stuff unless I specifically let it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, pihole blocks ads by dropping the DNS request that is used when the ad tries to connect to its server to load its contents. This means that as far as the ad and your browser know, the ad simply couldn’t connect and ads are blocked before they ever have a chance to load</p>
<p>Essentially: ads and browsers see it as a network connection issue rather than an extension blocking ads after they load</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There will be some adjustments and fine tuning with 'whitelists', but I think that knowing exactly what is going in and out of your network and you choosing what to send is worth the hassle.</p></div>		</li>
