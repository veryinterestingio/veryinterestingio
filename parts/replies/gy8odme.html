			<div class="markdown"><p>Capital gains are generally calculated by subtracting your cost basis (how much you paid for the asset) from the sale price. It gets a little more complicated if you are dealing with an asset that you depreciated, but that's the gist if you're dealing with stocks and bonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really related. Capital gains are relatively straightforward in principle. Lets say I buy a stock at $50. A couple years later I sell it for $100.</p>
<p>That's a $50 gain, which I now owe taxes on. It gets a more complex when you start factoring in mixed income streams and start subtracting losses which offset the profit you made on that stock deal, but that's the basic idea.</p></div>		</li>
