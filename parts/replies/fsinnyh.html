			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of poison ivy, no that would actually be an advantage. But only if our immune system develops tolerance towards urushiol- bound cells. If we are talking a widespread dampening of our immune response, then there would be a ton of negative effects, such as getting sick from infections that we normally could fight off with a strong immune system. That’s what we often see in AIDS patients or people taking immunosuppressants. </p>
<p>Steroid users (eg those getting injections for psoriasis) also see a dampening of their immune system bc of the inhibitory nature of steroids in synthesizing compounds that amplify our immune response. The impact isn’t nearly as great as full immunosuppression or immunodeficiency, but can still cause these people to get sicker than the average human.</p></div>		</li>
