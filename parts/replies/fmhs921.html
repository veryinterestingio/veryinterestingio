			<div class="markdown"><p>Friend and his wife had it, both in their 50s, they lost their sense of taste and smell as one of the last symptoms.  Started to come back after about a week also.   They still have some lingering issues after 3 weeks but sense of taste and smell has returned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. In 50s. I lost 6 pounds because food was so unappealing.  I'd be starving, staring into the fridge and walk away. Very sweet foods were ok, like lemon cookies. Savory foods without taste/smell are actually gross in texture. </p>
<p>It was more of a smell issue for me, distorted what remained of the taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be completely honest we teach our medical students to be conscious of anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) because of the decline in quality of life for older patients.  As we age (60+) our senses naturally decline. Smell especially. People in their 70’s can actually suffer from depression over this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that work? Is it because of a simple blocked nose during a cold or is the virus taking over something else we don't know about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m in week three and am sick of these lingering symptoms (mainly sinus congestion), lol.  My public health people say I can’t leave my condo until one day after I am symptom-free. Which is fair enough, but argh!</p></div>		</li>
