			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just a description of debt in general, and is not a sufficient explanation for government debt.</p>
<p>Governments aren't buying sweets - or anything consumable for that matter. They're spending on infrastructure and programs with the goal of increasing productivity and income in the long run.</p>
<p>Imagine your friend Jimmy asks if he can borrow $10 for lemons, sugar, and ice and in exchange he writes a note that promises he'll give you $11 in a week. </p>
<p>Jimmy also goes to his dad and asks for a $200 investment and help so they can build and fund a lemonade stand, again, promising his dad he'll pay him back $200 plus 2% interest every year.</p>
<p>Jimmy's effectively sold a short term bond to you, and a long term debt to his dad.</p>
<p>Jimmy goes out (and with the help of his dad) and they spend the full $210 on some lumber, nails, a chair, pitcher, mixing spoon, a bag of sugar, two bags of ice, and a sack of lemons. Jimmy hammers together a functional lemonade stand that he sets up by the end of their driveway on a hot summer day. There's maybe $30 left over.</p>
<p>Jimmy sets up shop and sells $10 of lemonade the first day before running out of lemons. He goes back out and buys $20 worth of lemons, ice, and sugar. Note he made $10 but spent $20, he's currently running a $10 deficit per day. It's perfectly likely that Jimmy will become profitable in the next few days, and even if he doesn't he's still got cash on hand to pay back his friend if necessary. His dad won't be seeing profits any time soon, but that's okay because dad has a 5 year bond.</p>
<p>His friend sees Jimmy at the store spending $20, and finds out he's running a deficit. His friend then panics, and asks &quot;Why the hell are you running a deficit?! I trusted you! We need new management up in here!&quot; His friend goes to Jimmy's mom and &quot;tattles&quot; Jimmy stole my $10 and now he's running a <em>deficit</em>! I want someone else running this show. Jimmy's sister Jenny hears all this and pipes up &quot;I know how to fix the problem! We need to cut costs and tighten our belts here!&quot;</p>
<p>Jenny gets everyone riled up, and her mom and Jimmy's friend agree that Jenny should take over and get their money back by scrapping these useless programs that only cost money. </p>
<p>Jenny promptly takes over the lemonade stand and refuses to buy any lemons. She sells $15 of lemonade in the first day, but then she runs out of lemons and her ice melts. She pays back Jimmy's friend his deserved $11, and brags that she cleared the deficit! She earned $15 and spent none (except the $11, but that was a remnant of the previous <del>left wing government</del> sibling). She's running a <em>surplus</em> now, clearly she's the best leader!</p>
<p>The old lemonade stand sits unused in the garage for about a month, it's now getting into August - the really hot season, and Jenny's thinking &quot;I bet people would really want some lemonade right now.... I betcha Sally down the street would pay top dollar for <em>the lemonade stand</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Jenny goes and knocks on Sally's (private company) door and says &quot;How would you like to take over our lemonade stand?&quot; Sally says sure, and offers $50 for the stand. Jenny sells the stand, and stomps through her front door waving the crisp $50 in the air. </p>
<p>&quot;LOOK AT THIS! Not only did I run a surplus on the stand, but I successfully privatized it, earning us $50 more. I'm running a yuge surplus. The <em>best</em> surplus this household has ever seen! On top of that, Sally's running a successful business now, she's painted the stand up nice and pretty yellow and pink, and she's even added raspberries to the menu. We've got access to some top quality lemonade right down the street, and our neighborhood is better than ever, all thanks to ME!&quot;</p>
<p>Jenny says &quot;Thank you Daddy&quot; and hands the $50 over to her dad, along with the leftover $24 from earlier. &quot;Please remember that it was <em>me</em> who ran the surplus and started clearing the debt, and not Jimmy. Make sure you choose me next time we want to run something properly.&quot;</p>
<p>Dad sighs &quot;Thank you sweetie&quot; and politely accepts the $74, knowing that he'll probably wait a long time before he sees the other $126 of his principle or the accumulated interest. But he's okay with that, because following that initial $200 investment a month ago, Jimmy learned to swing a hammer building that lemonade stand. Last week Jimmy helped his dad fix those broken boards on the deck, and he built a small flowerbox for his mother. Jenny on the other hand has some learning to do, but she's well on her way to being a successful businesswoman. </p>
<p>Because Dad let Jimmy and Jenny take on that initial &quot;debt&quot;, the family is better off overall.</p>
<p>These $200 debts occur over and over, year after year. One year Jenny will ask for piano lessons. Even though she may never be a profitable pianist, she'll learn discipline and an appreciation for the arts. One day those skills will help her in another way.</p>
<p>I find the family spending analogy (even though I ran away with it for a while) to be a really good one for government debt and spending. Much like raising a child, the government's goal is not instant profits - the goal is long term development of infrastructure, education, and the <em>eventual</em> returns it will bring to GDP and economic security.</p>
<p>It's not as simple as a downward spiral of chain borrowing, where your sweets debt eventually spirals out of control to the point where you owe $17.45 for some sweets you originally bought for $1 (that's 10% interest over 30 periods).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Downvote because your story doesn't include what happens then Dad gets a midlife crises and crushes the budget by spending the money frivolous things like hookers and jet skis. Like, what happens when the debt get's so large that servicing the debt becomes the family's single largest expenditure? <em>That</em> is unsustainable, especially if Dad refuses to cut back and instead doubles down on his hookers and jet skies.</p>
<p>I've changed my mind, Upvote!, because you did answer the Eli5 question and my concern is beyond the scope of the original question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes, another thing that happens is that Jimmy will take your $1 and Lend it to Susie who promises to pay him back 1.2. So when tomorrow comes, Susie pays back jimmy, jimmy pays back you, and is left with .1 profit to use elsewhere.</p>
<p>Or, say Susie can’t pay until the day after you want to be paid. Jimmy might borrow $1.10 from Ben who’s asking for 1.15 back. He borrows the money to pay you back. Then the next day Susie pays jimmy 1.20 of which he uses 1.15 to pay back Ben and is left with .05 leftover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not really accurate. Governments don't borrow like people do. Governments issue bonds, treasury notes and other financial assets. People don't. It's also wrong to think the government is borrowing to pay back debt, your example is describing revolving debt, which is different from most government debt.  In the same way a person might get a car loan, and later might get a mortgage, that doesn't mean the mortgage was used to pay the car loan.</p>
<p>In short, personal finance examples do a disservice to how finance actually works. Governments can borrow and lend at the same time. Governments can control inflation. There are tons of things governments do that do not apply to normal personal finance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Governments do issue bonds and sometimes use cash flow from those bonds to buy other countries bonds that pay higher interest than their own. The US owns other countries debts too</p>
<p>And yes they do issue debt to pay back other debts. The car Loan/mortgage example isn’t equivalent to what I was saying, it would be more like taking out a personal loan at lower interest to pay off high interest credit card debt. obviously governments don’t borrow like people and these examples aren’t perfect but this is ELI5 and the general principles are still there</p></div>		</li>
