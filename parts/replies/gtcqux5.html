			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a house in my town with a very rare case of mold. It was a species that was really toxic to human and once it gets in your home, there's nothing you can do and you need to burn the house down. The family lost everything. They were not granted permission to take anything from their house and were given clothes etc. </p>
<p>The government burned the house down with everything in it.</p></div>		</li>
