<p>Edit: Basically that delicious taste you get from meats and other stuff that contain amino acids, usually glutamate, hence the Monosodium Glutamate is touted as umami booster.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In some languages this is directly translated as &quot;salty&quot; so it doesn't help much...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Umami is pretty much exclusive to glutamate and its infamous cousin that got a bad rap for no reason other than probably racism: monosodium glutamate (MSG).</p>
<p>You can buy pure MSG at the grocery store as a seasoning called “Accent.” I highly recommend it. Adding it to your food is practically a cheat code.</p>
<p>It is <em>only</em> umami. Like how sugar is <em>only</em> sweet and salt is <em>only</em> salty.</p>
<p>If you buy some, pour some in your palm and eat it by itself. It’s a trip your first time. It just tastes like... umami. You’ll get it after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically savoriness or more accurately earthiness, it is so called because it was Japanese scientists who first discovered the receptors and gave it the name.</p>
<p>I tend not to like savory as a lay description because to me savoriness is more a product of saltiness than umami. Umami is like... sautéed mushrooms, soy sauce (which is also a lot of salt but separate that out), things of that nature.</p></div>		</li>
