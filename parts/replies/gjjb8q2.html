			<div class="markdown"><p>...and that's what we call a winning lottery ticket!</p>
<p>No craft beer retailer that wants to stay in business is putting 10% brews in their pick-a-six selection.  A 10% brew needs twice the grain <em>and</em> more time than an average 5% brew so it is definitely more expensive.  Not twice as expensive because of marketing, bottles, shipping, markup, etc. but definitely more and enough to eat into the store's profit margins.</p>
<p>To address OP, the boiling was probably the biggest benefit to beer.  Low-test beer has a little alcohol that might deter some pathogens, but there are plenty of spoilage microbes that are happy to work on 5% ABV beer - where do you think malt vinegar comes from?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10% can be enjoyable, but anything above that just feels like liquor -- it's usually dark and rough. Having more than a few ounces of that isn't really enoyable</p>
<p>I've never seen a 23% (Sam Adams Utopia?) but the 16s and 17s my dad gifted me once (it's the thought that counts) were... <em>rough</em></p></div>		</li>
