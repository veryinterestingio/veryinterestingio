			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason I leave it out is because it doesnt tell the full story. Some of the arguments it makes do not hold up to observation (such as where we observe certain planets in young systems). It also neglects the disc dynamics (from hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical instabilities) which change the location of hot and cold regions in the disc as well as where material clumps together. The Nebular theory is a good first approximation but neglects the important dynamics that really shape the formation of a system (so dont get me wrong it is important to learn about it and then as you find out more about what observations have been made you realize the theory needs considerable extension!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really know much beyond the basics, and it sounds like you know what you are talking about more than I do! I read your post before I added mine and I think yours gives a lot more detail which is helpful, but I thought it might be helpful to have the nebula theory up too, since that was what I read about recently. And maybe it explains just our solar system or maybe it is a very basic explanation that is like saying &quot;like dissolves like&quot; in chemistry - generally true but not all of the time and there is much more that goes into some solubility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I realise my reply to you is not actually really what I wanted to say! I kind of skimmed the website for a quick look.</p>
<p>The Nebula hypothesis relates to stars and star formation. It is still the basis for this. </p>
<p>It also then tells you that planets form from a disc of material that comes out of this nebular cloud collapse. This is still also seemingly correct. </p>
<p>What it misses is the complicated details after this as it treats things like the frost line too simply. BUT!!! its a great 1st approximation that does still hold... just it lacks details! You were definitely right to add it to this thread! I often get caught up in the stuff I think people are unaware of and forget the things they need to know 1st!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting about the solar wind thing. Are there any gas giants we know of nearer to their star than rocky planets? It makes sense to a dumdum like me that solar winds pushed gases away until there were enough gases to begin ecretion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am pretty sure that at first a lot of the planets we discovered near other stars were gas giants that were close to the star. I don't remember the details, but as someone else has pointed out, there are other factors that come into play too.</p></div>		</li>
