			<div class="markdown"><p>I happen to know Bill Shepherd, first ISS commander, and asked about what Chris Hatfield said was the grossest thing about being on the ISS.  Chris said that you had to be really careful about taking off your socks because it turns out that you don't need calluses on your feet in space.  Your feet become like babies' feet.  All that extra foot skin sloughs off, and you could potentially fill the air everyone breathes with nasty foot flakes when you take off your socks.  Bill said the ventilation and filters were great and would eventually take care of stuff floating around the cabin. </p>
<p>Bill said he went barefoot, so although his feet lost the same amount of skin, it didn't come off all at once.  He also said that going barefoot allowed him to use his toes to grip things to help do work around the station.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know it it was just me or it happens to everyone but I broke my leg in a few places a long time ago and had a cast on my leg and foot for several months, and wasn’t walking on it, and had the exact same thing. </p>
<p>Nobody warned me, and I didn’t walk on it when I went home after having the cast off, had a bath and yeah, a whole foot’s worth of skin leapt to freedom.</p>
<p>Scared the absolute shit out of me ngl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed a weird sound in my cast, I rolled over in bed and shook it a bit while pressing my toes up, and something that looked like a potato chip fell out... I very quickly realized it was the skin from the heel of my foot. Fucking grosssss</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kinda convenient then that there's a massive vacuum outside. They can just open a window :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As they use air, new air has to be sent via rocket and every kilogram (compressed air + tanks + valves and pipping) costs a ton of money, so they never intentionally vent the stuff to space.<br />
That's why when they go outside for spacewalks, they do not just vent the airlock to space. They use vacuum pumps to move the air in the airlock to tanks and save as much air as possible before opening the outer door.</p></div>		</li>
