			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically it. Even before the chemistry and physics of why water dissolves so much so well...it just comes down to math, concentrations, and fractions.</p>
<p>If you took all of the dirt on a floor, added it to a bucket of water, mixed it until it was homogeneous, and then thinly spread a tiny portion of that water on the floor, you'd end up with an ever so slightly dirty wet floor, and by extension, 95% of the original water containing 95% of the dirt in the bucket.</p>
<p>Edit: This becomes painfully apparent when you try to mop up something sticky like soda/pop/coke. Sugar is sticky at virtually all concentrations, so you mop it up, and go from 30% sugar/water on the floor to 3% sugar in the remaining water...after it dries, it's STILL sticky. No amount of using the same mop water will ever dilute that 3% off the floor, so you need to change out the cleaning water, often multiple times to truly clean it up.</p>
<p>As an aside - this is an excellent segue into why homeopathy is bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Homeopathy isn't chemistry, homeopathy is magic.  Whether you believe homeopathy works depends on whether you believe the 'vital energy' of the substance can be increased and stored in the water where the physical substance is not.</p>
<p>I don't believe homeopathy works. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This thought experiment is a beautiful illustration of great teaching. Imagining all the dirt in a water solution and only a tiny fraction of that solution being left on the floor made the explanation very clear to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but the tipping point isn't 2-5 trips like you might expect from looking at how dirty the water is, it's waaay more than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At some point the floor and the water will reach an equilibrium. Assuming the water is overall cleaner than the floor at the beginning, it will have removed some dirt from the floor by the end</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this: water is a universal solvent and sticks to itself (because of hydrogen bonding). Most things tend to dissolve in water. </p>
<p>When you mop, the dirt and such gets dissolved into the water, and it gets pushed into the mop with the pushing or dragging motions.  And since water tends to stick to itself and the mop is full of water, the debris on the floor tends to dissolve particles or have a weak attraction, and those particles get stuck to the fabric and the water in the mop.</p>
<p>At least, that's my best guess. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>
