			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, what if it’s baked in store, but made in a factory and shipped as a dough? Is that fresh baked or factory made? Or both? </p>
<p>Places like Panera get dough shipped in and frozen soups shipped in bags that they reheat.  Subway has preformed loaves they bake in store. </p>
<p>But this is vastly different than a pre-packaged cake that can sit on a shelf for a month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Walmart advertises their cookies as &quot;fresh baked in store&quot;. At first glance you would see, oh, baked in store, fresh, okay. Think about it you see fresh=recently baked=baked, not MADE</p>
<p>So yeah those fresh baked cookies were shipped in as cookie dough balls.</p>
<p>Also, the white chocolate macademia nut is fucking delicious.</p></div>		</li>
