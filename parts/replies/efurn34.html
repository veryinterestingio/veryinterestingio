			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied physics and computer science in college and wanted to pursue a PhD. My graduate institution has a rotation program where you can &quot;rotate&quot; through different labs in the department until you find one you want to stick with. I had done a lot of different types of research in undergrad but I identified a few common themes with the things I enjoyed most: I liked computational work, I liked quantum physics, and I liked researching things that have relatively near-term practical applications. After rotating through a bunch of different labs, I ended up picking one that does theoretical and computational work in nanophotonics because it checked all of those boxes and because my advisor is amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No OP, but I like retelling the story of how I majored in Aerospace. It was the first one on the application, it sounded cool, and I liked model rockets and blowing things up as a kid.</p>
<p>Wound up getting a PhD in it, although I don't work in the field anymore.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also with the ion trap thing, I guess they use electrostatics to attract just one atom [one ion], and they can also verify that it's indeed just one by measuring electrostatic field strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They know it's a single atom (ion) for a couple of reasons.   The best reason is that the ions are electrically charged and so if you had multiple ions in the trapping region they would be pushed out away from each other but still pushed in enough so that they don't leave the trap.  </p>
<p>By tuning the voltage you put on the 'end caps' (the horizontal wires that point in sideways) you can vary how far apart the ions will be.  </p>
<p>Then they have a microscope that is able to see distances that are smaller than this separation.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The quick run-down on laser cooling is you use a grid of lasers to create a potential well that traps the atom.  Obviously there's a lot more quantum mechanics and technical details in the deep explanation.</p></div>		</li>
