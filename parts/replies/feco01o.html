			<div class="markdown"><p>How can astronomers rule out redshifting due to the Doppler effect? AFAIK, light waves are subject to the Doppler effect, and if something is moving relative to the Earth at an appreciable rate wouldn't there be a frequency shift as a result?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there would be.  I'm not an astronomer, but I know they tend to use a lot of input measurements, and then use statistics to find an output value most consistent with the inputs.  So yeah, Doppler shift, Hubble distance, cosmic ladder, all could potentially come into play for a single distance determination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The redshifting of light from the Doppler effect comes from the peculiar velocity of galaxies.  It's really difficult to break the degeneracy of the peculiar velocity and the Hubble flow (the recession of galaxies due to the expansion of the universe).  This is why astronomer often have such large error bars on distances to galaxies, however the redshift becomes dominated by the Hubble flow for far away galaxies, so the percentage error in the distance measurement is often smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, because the relative movement from the expansion of the universe is much much larger than the velocities of galaxies in their local frame of reference. We observe entire clusters of galaxies being redshifted away from us by cosmic expansion, even though in some cases the galaxies on the far side of the cluster are (in their local frame of reference) moving towards the ones on the near side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, expansion redshift is an order of magnitude it two greater than  the Doppler shift?</p></div>		</li>
