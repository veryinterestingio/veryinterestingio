<p>Google, Facebook, etc. are not in the business of selling your data. They’re in the business of selling ads. That might sound weird at first, but consider the fact that their defensible moat of technology and IP is contingent upon having that data. Why would you sell your resources instead of leveraging them towards selling your product? They offer targeted advertising, which might give information about those targeted through completed purchases and account creation, but that’s only once a user has made a decision to buy the product advertised.</p>

<p>I have no idea why people still do not understand this. People think  companies like Google sell off petabytes of raw data about people to third parties. Like McDonald's or some ad firm now has all of Google's data and the execs are all sitting around reading your PMs and watching /u/MatthewKnipfer's home made porn with his personal identification attached to it as well.</p>
<p>Most people only know that they &quot;sell your data&quot; and that &quot;you are the product&quot; but they don't understand how it works and do not try to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your device sends a request for a website in a certain form factor. This is part of why desktop and mobile are such fundamentally different experiences. If you want a certain credit card intro offer, sometimes you have to use a specific device to get it. For example, American Express has featured different intro offers to the Gold and Platinum cards based on if you were on mobile or desktop. I’m not particularly certain about the discrimination within those factors (iPhone resolution vs Galaxy), but it’s certainly present in desktop vs mobile.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not all the time, but enough times for me to always buy from a desktop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the other commenter explained it pretty well. But I wanted to point out that the TOR Browser locks your resolution to like 720p or something, and when you try to change it, it alerts you. Its so that everyone with the same footprint of using a TOR Browser looks the same in terms of screen resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's clever. Screen size is one of the signals used for fingerprinting, so standardizing it when using TOR browser does make sense. I'm guessing they limit what fonts are &quot;available,&quot;  and removing as many other signals that can distinguish users from each other as well.</p></div>		</li>
