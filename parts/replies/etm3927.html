			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't increase growth itself. But as a source of moisture and protection to the hair shaft, I imagine they would extend the lifespan of the individual hair and give it the opportunity to grow out longer over time, so those oil treatments could still have a lengthening effect, if moisture is something your hair lacks otherwise</p></div>		</li>
