I got to be in the control room for that, and based on the signal detected by the GBT, we knew before NASA facilities that the lander had safely gotten through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I was also on site for the New Horizon's flyby of Pluto. We have a scale model of the solar system with flags on site, and Pluto is by the GBT. It has a black flag hung at half staff, but that night some of our summer students replaced it with a pirate flag and put it up to full staff.</p>
<p>As far as astronomical observations, I'll think on it! I think some of my first observations with the GBT when I got to steer the telescope and make the first observations ever of star forming regions that are \~70,000 light years from the Sun in the far outer reaches of the Galaxy were the most impactful for me, personally.</p></div>		</li>
