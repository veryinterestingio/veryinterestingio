			<div class="markdown"><p>(Almost) actual doctor here. The part about salt killing staph is technically correct, but the rest of the statement isn't. The thing about salt is that if you have a container of it, it will kill bacteria because of osmosis. The water will be sucked out of the cell of whatever is growng going on it, because the concentration of salt outside the cell is so high. This is also why  honey cannot spoil; since it is almost completely glucose,  water of any cell growing on it will be dried out enough to kill the organism. This would not work if the bacteria was growing on or in your body, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>There are also other things besides antibiotics that can kill staph. For example, bleach, alcohol, and fire will do the job just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Staph aureus is pretty salt resistant, heck they are absolutely amazing at developing resistance to literally everything - aggressive treatment with antibiotics is generally recommended.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;drawing fluids&quot; part helps with inflammation, pressure, and pain. </p>
<p>The gargling will lower the inflammation for those hours until the problem is taken care of.</p>
<p>Other than that, the saline also kills off microorganisms at a surface level, so if you have gunk building near your throat, it can give some relief.</p></div>		</li>
