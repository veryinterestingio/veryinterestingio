			<div class="markdown"><p>Napoleon is arguably the most brilliant military commander in history, but he’s also one of the luckiest. He seemed to catch breaks like this every time he turned around. That said, what some call luck, in Napoleon’s case is more about choosing and training subordinates that were fantastic commanders in their own right and giving those commanders ability to make their own decisions in the field. If it’s said you make your own luck, then Napoleon sure as hell made his.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Napolean's marshals were like mini Napolean's forged under a decade of constant warfare. Their foes were usually first timers until the latter half of the 15 year long war broadly speaking. Of course tactical acumen does not translate to strategic genius, which for Napolean just meant we've conquered half of Europe, but what about second half? The duality of successful conquerors that are never satisfied and fall victim to themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moreso than them being first timers, they were typically nobles/aristocrats and not in their positions based on merit but rather cosanguinous nepotism. It cannot be understated that Napoleon was primarily fighting forces led by inbred absolute morons</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know it's like a historical falsehood that he was small, but the way he's portrayed, and then imagining mini versions is hilarious. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s true.
But Desaix’s death also allowed Napoleon to claim the glory ( he was at the time only one general amongst others).</p>
<p>Later imperial propaganda also tried to diminish the role of Kellerman , and paint the initial disaster as a clever feint</p></div>		</li>
