			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  I work in the business of pollutant regulation and my state tends to have problems with ozone more than acid rain so that's how I tend to view diesel pollutants, but acid rain is definitely another thing to consider. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because SO2 comes straight from the fuel not from poor combustion like NOX. By 2010 diesel sulfur had been lowered to near zero(15ppm) so we see very little of it from cars, trucks, tractors, and trains. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>depending on how well made the vehicle is (also diesel doesn't have catalytic converters, they do have Reduction Catalyst though), in addition if there is any cheating involved(VW scandal) there very well could be some, but I was only mentioning it in passing as NOx is still a pretty potent acid rain component by itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. CO2 is not poisonous or dangerous by itself, as it's the gas used in sparkling water, and all humans exhale it by the tonnes.  So it doesn't matter where it's produced, in a city or elsewhere. But other exhaust fumes actually harm buildings and statues. So they want to keep them out of the cities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear - CO2's still very problematic from a climate change perspective. And it's directly linked to how much fuel you burn. Better mpg = less co2.</p>
<p>That said, you're right, locally it's a non-issue. In any commercial office building, it's common for CO2 to hang around 600-700ppm while it's at 400ppm in the atmosphere, just from humans exhaling.</p>
<p>It's worth noting though that NOx/VOCs become less relevant when there's few people/few cars around. It's a huge deal in dense population centers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention that diesel fuel is the biggest urban source of a type of <a href="https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/assets/documents/reports/cat11/1212141150_AQEG_Fine_Particulate_Matter_in_the_UK.pdf" target="_blank">fine particulate matter classified as PM 2.5</a>, which is the most damaging for human health due to its tiny size, and has been linked to everything from higher incidence of lung disease to heart attacks.</p>
<p>Europe’s car manufacturers and governments have caused monumental damage to the health of their people by promoting diesel engines over petrol engines.</p>
<p>Not only that, but their car companies falsified tests over the extent of diesel emissions.</p>
<p>It is an unmitigated disaster of many dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ignored them because they were paid to do so by the companies that didn't want to get forced to stop poluting. </p>
