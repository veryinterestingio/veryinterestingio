			<div class="markdown"><p>Stock for aluminum cans and ends use a significant amount of recycled metal.  First is the scrap from manufacturing (web and process scrap) which is 100% recyclable into new can or end stock. </p>
<p>With UBC (used beverage cans) the recycling will use some virgin metal to get the alloy right (partly because the end stock (5182 alloy) has a higher magnesium content  than can stock (3104 alloy).  </p>
<p>Beverage cans are the largest single use of aluminum in the country.  If it couldn't consume recycled material (both pre and post consumer), there would be mountains of unused aluminum piling up.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our process uses only alcoa guaranteed virgin stock and tri arrow 5% or less recycled content (only bright stack cupper and trimmer scrap).  Golden aluminum tried their recycled stock at our facility but all we got from it were excessive tear off rates and higher spoilage even with slower machine speeds.  Some of it is the vintage equipment we use. We just recently went to 15 out high speed cuppers.   </p>
<p>Depending on which manufacturer you worked for Ball, Rexam or CCS.  Different process yeild widely different results.  </p>
<p>Nice to meet a fellow can maker.  I'm not in the engineering end just line manufacturing process.  22 years and counting.</p></div>		</li>
