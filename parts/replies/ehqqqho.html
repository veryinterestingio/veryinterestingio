Your baby will turn out to be a wonderful person of you give it the love and attention that any mother wants to give her child. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree about needing sources because a lot of what OP said doesn't fit with what I understand about stress. That said, it's important to note that methylation, which OP touched on then never explained, doesn't change your genes, it changes the <em>expression</em> of your genes, and even then it's only specific genes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't change your DNA, but what happens is that the rule book used to interpret sections of your DNA changes. </p>
<p>Your entire genetic code encodes instructions for all processes that occur in the human body, but obviously, not all of those processes occur all at once. A skin cell will use a few instructions, and most of those other instructions in a skin cells nucleolus will be switched off. Compare that with a heart muscle cell, which has a lot of other instructions to follow. You get the picture. Now, consider that the time of your life and development will alter which instructions ae followed, think foetal development, and puberty, and menopause...</p>
<p>What matters isn't what's encoded in the DNA, but how that DNA is presented to your cells' mechanisms for translating those instructions into meaningful biological processes. This is the relatively new science of epigenetics.</p>
<p>There are a few epigenetic mechanisms, one of which is methylation of DNA. This is where methyl groups are added to certain sequences of base pairs of DNA that can act to flag up, or mask sections of DNA, altering what is visible to the cell's machinery. Another is histone acetylation. Histones are protein structures that act to roll up DNA into loops, compacting it down into a long long chain, into something that can fit into a cells nucleolus. Histones can be altered by the attachment of certain molecules, such as acetyl groups, that alter its structure and leads to whole sections of DNA being unraveled and exposed to cell machinery. Incidentally, it's thought that certain pharmaceutical drugs work this way, although it's difficult to study.</p>
<p>So, remember I mentioned DNA methylation? It's possible to map an entire genome's methylation marks, a sort of epigenome, but that which is specific to that type of cell. Your epigenome will vary from cell type to cell type, and during the course of your life. Studies have been done to look at the pattern of methylation of certain cells in different groups of people and have found that the percentage of their genome which is methylated changes according to their socioeconomic status - or as it can be interpereted, their exposure to long-term stress as differentiated to short-term stress. And the association is that there is a difference as the subjects got older, suggesting changes to the pattern of DNA methylation as you progress through your life.

<p>So if lifetime events can influence your epigenome, can events during your time in your mother's uterus? Yes.

And the events that were experienced by your parents may also have an accumulated impact on your epigenome, since their own gametes, eggs and sperm, would have their own epigenetic instructions changed over time and passed on.

<p>It's not just stress, but toxins and foods that can change your epigenome. The temperature and sunlight exposure has been found to alter the epigenome of some species, so these factors could also affect humans.

<p>The world of epigenetics is something I delved into academically for a short time. I'm not an epigeneticist or anything else clever. I'm just an emergency physician who found this stuff just mind-blowingly incredible. It's really changed my views of how biology and society works (or doesn't work), and these are potential mechanisms by which social and psychological problems, and social policies can be written into our very nature. Nurture is nature, or nurture as nature perhaps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetic expression is an active process my friend. Gene transcription is constant, our cells are little protein factories. We react to signals in our environment that can activate certain transcription enhancement factors that produce more/less of protein complexes required by the cell. Stressors can activate these transcription enhancement factors, which can have “long” lasting changes to the chromatid structure. (Acetylation makes it more lose if I remember correctly, and methylation makes it more loose) </p>
<p>Certain antidepressants actually work by literally by slowly methlyating(opening up) your DNA structure so that it can be more readily transcribed(and hence a “normal” amount of the proteins that eventuate into what we perceive in consciousness as “the good feels”</p>
<p>Anyways, those processes take several weeks generally. </p>
<p>But the point being is that our DNA/genetic expression is constantly being changed in response to stimuli in our environment. Epigenetics yo. </p></div>		</li>
