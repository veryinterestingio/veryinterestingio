<p>You can get a 2019 MacBook pro for 1300 which is about what you can get a iPhone XR for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get a high end phone for that price. Samsung and Apple aren't the only phone manufacturers.  </p>
<p>OnePlus.<br />
Xiaomi.<br />
Huawei.<br />
Google.<br />
OPPO.  </p>
<p>A lot of these put out phones that are arguably better than a new iPhone at a significantly lower price.  </p>
<p>The only reason iPhone and the high end Galaxy series are so expensive is because people are stupid enough to pay those prices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also get a proportionally decent phone for 200-300</p>
<p>Comparing price ranges has to be within the same quality</p>
<p>Price ranges of phones and laptops overlap but are not the same</p>
<p>By that logic - a bicycle is in the same price range as a car since there are many good bicycles that cost as much or more than a car</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly suggest looking outside the apple ecosystem if you are in search for flagship smartphones that doesn't cost you above 1000 bucks. One+ phones start at 600 and offer the smoothest Android experience. Not to even mention the Pixel series. Android's laggy subpar days are long gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I canâ€™t speak from experience because I use iPhone, but my buddy who swears up and down he hates Apple(lol) always has a fairly recent Samsung phone and occasionally moans about problems or crashes. Not all the time but it does come up.
Main thing he grumps about from time to time is smoothness..</p></div>		</li>
