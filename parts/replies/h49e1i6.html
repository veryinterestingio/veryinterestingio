			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember Windows 3.1 (on an old 486/26 - a massive 26 megahertz!) - but at that point you had to go to DOS whenever you wanted to run a CPU intensive program. For my elementary school self - that was mostly games like Commander Keen and the original Duke Nukem. (I sort of got Warcraft 1 to work on it - but not well.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't a CPU issue. You needed to drop to DOS to get hardware access (to do graphics etc.), and free up RAM used by Windows.</p>
<p>Windows 95 had DirectX, so you could do everything in Windows, and often with better performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right - RAM not CPU. I should have remembered that.</p>
<p>The entire hard drive of that machine was about 200mb - so I'm guessing that the RAM wasn't so hot. :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandparents had a Win3.11 pc until like 2004. Played the shit out of it, especially Duke Nukem 3D. My grandpa plays it to this day every once in a while, although with godmode lol. Great memories!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I installed Win95 so many times that to this day I still remember the product key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the &quot;Start&quot; button, the task bar was also new. You could easily see and switch between open programs (on windows 3.1 you had to use alt-tab keys).
Also you could drop files and create folders directly on the desktop (background), which 3.1 didn't allow. Combined with the invention of &quot;shortcuts&quot;, this was amazing: You could now have your favorite files and (shortcuts to) programs right next to each other directly on the desktop, and you could organize them in folders. On windows 3.1 this was strictly separated: files were only accessible through the file manager and desktop icons could never be files, as they were reserved for programs and other functions (like the control panel).
Also, windows 3.1 had multitasking, but when a program crashed, it very often crashed the whole system along with it, requiring a reset. That could still happen with windows 95, but less often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny how iOS sort of regressed back to the Win 3.1 concept of files only being accessible in a dedicated file manager app and desktop icons being programs only...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Another innovation was the tray on the task bar. But soon, most programs came with their own tray icon, leading to a big cluttered tray area, occupying half your task bar. So Microsoft had to make the tray collapsible in later windows versions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is false. It would just minimize to your “desktop.”  (<a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/EJKMnhFxopuvSWaB7" target="_blank">https://images.app.goo.gl/EJKMnhFxopuvSWaB7</a>) The problem was that most of your open windows blocked your desktop so it made it harder to switch.</p></div>		</li>
