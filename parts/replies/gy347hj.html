			<div class="markdown"><p>for bacteria, depending on your viewpoint on the matter, causing diarrhea can be seen as a hostile/invasive method for clearing up valuable real estate in your gut that is normally occupied but your own microbiota. there’s a constant competition happening in your gut! </p>
<p>an interesting perspective is that if you ingest invading microbes, the ones that arrive early and cause diarrhea can be interpreted as behaving altruistically by creating space for any following microbes at the cost of their own viability (they get flushed).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right — also found in evolutionary biology. A constitutive trait is the same at all times, an expression of an organism's fundamental <em>constitution</em>. The opposite is a <em>facultative</em> trait, which can be changed as needed.</p></div>		</li>
