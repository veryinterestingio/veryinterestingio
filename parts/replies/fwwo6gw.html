			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you.  I've always wondered this too.  Not enough to actually Google it, but enough that I was interested in reading this thread when I saw it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This I think is the real benefit of these types of subreddits and questions (particularly in other subreddits that specifically geared towards questions). It's not about asking the question for yourself but for sharing the answer you will get with other people too, and more importantly I think is sharing questions with people who haven't even thought about them yet.</p>
<p>Too often people get angry at others for not googling things themselves, but really even if it would be simple for them to do that, what's happening is they're sharing that question with every other person reading, and that answer. Questions are one of the most important parts about online forums and people get angry at them far too often. anyway that tangented a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but, my vision is awful, and goggles underwater makes my vision almost as clear as glasses. Why donâ€™t my vision issues occur to the same degree under water?</p></div>		</li>
