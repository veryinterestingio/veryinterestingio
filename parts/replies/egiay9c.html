			<div class="markdown"><p>Herpesviruses <em>do not</em> integrate in the hosts DNA. They form something called an episome, which is a small ring of DNA(think like a plasmid in bacteria) that remains in the nucleus and replicates with the cell. It does not connect to the host DNA. Same with papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses. Actual integration is pretty rare in humans, like retroviruses. Nonetheless, there are examples of even RNA virus sequences found in genomes from ancient infections, however such an event is incredibly rare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s also why Hep B doesn’t have a cure whole Hep C (a positive sense RNA virus that doesn’t integrate) does</p>
<p>Herpes just remains active in the ganglia of nerves and reactivates when the patient gets stressed or loses immunocopetence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the rare cases that pathogenic DNA integrates into a host, it won't always insert the code to reproduce itself. </p>
<p>There's a species of bacteria in some soil that infects damaged plants that feeds off the growth factors that the plant releases to heal the damage, so it inserts a plasmid into the plant's cells that inserts an always-active gene into the plant's DNA that causes it to overproduce those growth factors to feed the bacteria. This leads to tumors in the plant and eventually death of the plant.</p>
<p>The system the bacteria uses to insert DNA into the host cell has been heavily studied, and scientists have found ways to hijack that mechanism to do things they want (IIRC the first time they managed it was inserting DNA to produce a protein that would make the host tobacco plant cell resistant to wildfire blight, and once they produced a cell with the resistance they produced a plant from that cell culture and produce a plant with resistance to that blight. The same process is used nowadays for many different kinds of products, using the tobacco plants as hosts to produce other needed products. I believe the serum treatment produced during the previous West African Ebola outbreak was produced using this technique in tobacco plants)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means it actually connects to your DNA, and joins the genome. It could cause cancer (T-Lymphotrophic virus) if it interferes with tumor suppressor genes, although most viruses that do this use proteins to deactivate the tumor suppressor <em>protein</em>. It has the (insanely small) chance to cause evolutionarily significant events, like how the protein that deactivates the immune system locally around a fetus in mammals originated from an ancient retrovirus infection, giving rise to mammals. We know this because of the tell-tale “long terminal repeats” around the gene which only (to my knowledge) retroviruses do.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if there’s really a way to clear episomes(not integrated) and minichromosomes(rarely integrated), but if a way was discovered, it would almost certainly be <em>much</em> harder to clear an actually integrated provirus.</p>
<p>Most of the time, it really isn’t much different than latency in other forms. Just a different mean to the same end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's means the viruses DNA actually becomes part of your chromosomes (for the cell they infect)... this is why those types of viruses can result in cancer. If they get inserted into one of your chromosomes next to an area that encodes genes/proteins involved in the cell cycle (generally speaking - it's much more complex than im putting it) then that can cause the normal checks and balances of the cell cycle be out of whack.</p>
<p>Other viruses dont become part of the chromosomes, but their DNA still hangs out in the cell indefinitely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rare for an individual person, but common enough that ~8% of our entire genome is derived from retroviruses, and for the ~36 million people infected with HIV. </p>
<p>And that’s before we even start talking about all the active retroelements encoded in our genome which are busy jumping from place to place integrating in odd spots and causing all sorts of somatic mutations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I don’t understand about quick death viruses is what’s the point?  Why kill the host? That will also kill the virus. Seems counter intuitive to everything else designed by nature so there must be something the virus is trying to accomplish that’s not just to kill you.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've already got a bunch of really great answers specific to viruses, but I wanted to add a point about evolution and reasons in general. </p>
<p>Evolution isn't guided, there is no plan or design. A particular trait/gene/etc only has be successful enough to not kill the organism before it can breed/spred, which is a pretty low bar. It doesn't matter how much better it could be, as long as it doesn't prevent reproduction completely. There are an enormous number of features of life are objectively bad (human knees suck; female hyenas have a pseudo-penis that kills 18% of mothers &amp; 70% of firstborn; Goliath birdeating spiders shatter when they fall out of trees; black plants would work better; viruses that kill their hosts at all; etc), but as long as they don't prevent reproduction it doesn't matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, there's really no &quot;point&quot;. It just happens. Ebola exists in nature and is sometimes transmitted to humans, and there'll be a human epidemic. The epidemic will quickly run out of people to infect and that virus lineage will go extinct (at least, that's what happens in the absence of modern transportation means). Which means that indeed infecting humans is a dead-end, but that doesn't mean the transfer to humans won't happen again; there is no memory whatsoever of past failures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because humans aren't the original 'target' of the virus. The bats/civets/whatever else that Ebola naturally occurs in don't have the same reaction to it as humans, Ebola just triggers a particular nasty cascade effect in the human immune system where the immune system basically kills the host itself. There's some theories that the spanish flu was as deadly as it was in the 1920's because it caused this same sort of cytokine cascade effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stress is a response to environmental factors. Back in the day this would only be due to a lion chasing you. Today it is due to work/home life etc. Stress leads to increased cortisol a glucocorticoid which increases blood sugar however is also immuno-suppressant that decreases inflammatory responses and proliferation of T-cells of the immune system. When stressors are always present and you constantly feel under attack, that fight-or-flight reaction stays turned on. The long-term activation of the stress-response system and the subsequent overexposure to cortisol and other stress hormones can disrupt almost all your body's processes. This puts you at increased risk of numerous health problems.</p>
<p>Edit: To give an example, during the time I was writing my thesis, I had influenza A which lead to pneumonia as well as had two ear infections in a time of 2-3 months. I Also lost 8kgs.</p></div>		</li>
