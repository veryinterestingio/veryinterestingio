			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you should still be careful, especially with metal, it’s 12 volts but a car battery can provide a lot of current.  For instance a ring, accidentally complete a circuit through it while working on your car and you could lose your finger.</p></div>		</li>

The electricity will short through the ring, still not touching your body, but in the process the ring can heat up to near red-hot, and just imagine trying to remove that from your finger.</p></div>		</li>
