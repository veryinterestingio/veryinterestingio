			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like when you read &quot;destroys libido&quot; you heard &quot;only wants sex once a week now&quot; when I said it destroys libido I meant it makes getting an erection scientifically impossible because you've been chemically castrated. And all these side effects presented themselves in small controlled trials and don't account for the additional possibilities of rare cases where a person's specific physiology or conditions cause worst case scenarios. Female birth control didn't have any severe life changing side-effects while still in trial, only now that everyone uses it can we observe that very rarely ocps can be dangerous. Viagra sometimes causes heart attacks but because it's pretty uncommon, it stays legal. If everyone who took it had a stroke, it wouldn't be.</p></div>		</li>
