There might be a few &quot;rogue&quot; stars here and there which had been ejected from galaxies. But if you're not right next to any galaxy, the sky will be entirely black, except for a few small faint cloudy patches where you can see &quot;nearby&quot; galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This made me think what I love &amp; hate about physics/astrophysics. I mean, we started with a singularity that blew out... our brains would imagine there is an edge, expanding super-fast, but an edge. And if we located the star we can see furthest from us, certainly if we could teleport there, and turn around, we'd see vast darkness, a vast nothing.<br />
But that's not how it is.<br />
Reminded me of high school physics. We had an exchange teacher from Hungary, really smart guy, and exactly how you'd picture a late-80s Hungarian physics teacher - brown tie and polyester suit, a little bit of a gut and bushy mustache... but he'd calculate the sin of a number in his head faster than we could on a calculator.<br />
And I remember going to him after class, when we were studying relativity... we'd gone over a story of perspective between 2 people traveling side-by-side at the speed of light and vs. an outside observer. And I could not get my mind around it, it was non-sensical.<br />
&quot;Einstein didn't understand it, either. But that's what the math says it has to be.&quot;<br />
And that was probably the best lesson I learned to understand the higher maths.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or is &quot;what was before the big bang&quot; a nonsense enough question that it's not worth imagingin?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not nor has it ever been what the idea of the Big Bang is. It's not a &quot;big&quot; &quot;bang&quot; in space from a central point. That's just a common public misconception. As far as we know the universe was always infinite and full and it remains that way today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would be the evidence pointing in the direction of the universe being unbounded? Doesn't that contradict big-bang-like theories?</p>
<p>It &quot;appearing homogeneous&quot; doesn't really say anything about it. The observable universe might appear homogeneous simply because we don't have access to boundary regions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The universe looks the same everywhere we can check. There is no preferred place or direction. A sudden boundary somewhere we can't check but a completely uniform universe elsewhere would be extremely odd and no one found any model that could lead to this.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>No, quite the opposite. A universe that looks the same everywhere (on large scales) is a key feature of the Big Bang.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just that we haven't found one. The universe could have an edge, it could loop around, it could go on forever, but as far as we can see it just keeps going.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Not really, the universe isn't expanding out from 1 point, it's just expanding. If the universe was 2d and round, it would be like the surface of a balloon, no edge or center.</p></div>		</li>
