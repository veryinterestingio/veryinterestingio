			<div class="markdown"><p>Its complete up to how comfortable the actor is with nudity. lena headey for example, used a body double for her walk of shame scene on game of thrones and they only shot her face from the shoulders up.</p>
<p>Edit: i stand corrected. It wasnt maisie i was thinking of lena headey. But my point still stands. Its totally upto the actor how much they want to show.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is accurate when it comes to straight nudity, but not accurate when it comes to sex scenes. Some actors don't mind being seen nude and some will use body doubles.</p>
<p>When it comes to sex scenes, patches and socks are used because otherwise you're basically rubbing your naked genitals against your coworker's naked genitals. People tend to not really want that to happen. It has nothing to do with whether they're comfortable being filmed in the nude or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe in the US they actually have a rating system for content that contains nudity. Movies and TV can get away with single X content, which allows for long shots of flaccid dicks, along with boobs and bush shots. XX content is pretty much porn without any extreme closeups of penetration/genitals, anal sex or “money shots”, and XXX allows the other things that XX can’t.</p>
