			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda but also not really? Most of the bacteria that can infect humans will die in a solution with that high a concentration of salt. There are of course bacteria that can survive that, but by and large they're evolved to attack sea life and either can't survive in the relative low salinity of the human body or are no match for our human immune system. Using sterile saltwater would be &quot;safer&quot; and if course Alcohol would be the best option, but if you are in a situation where it's seawater or nothing, Seawater is probably your best option.</p></div>		</li>

A couple days later a black abscess formed on his knee and eventually a small snail erupted out of the abscess. The kid kept the snail and named him Turbo.</p></div>		</li>
