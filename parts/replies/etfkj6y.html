			<div class="markdown"><p>Ummmm..Farmer here, I am most likely incredibly wrong, but didn’t Cassini find signs of very small, micro-moons kinda scattered throughout the rings? </p>
<p>Like I said, I’m pretty dang sure I’m completely wrong here, or at least mis-remembering what I saw on whatever space related documentary I saw it on. But maybe somebody can educate me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are essentially correct.  I'm not sure how micro-moon is defined as a term, but Cassini did find multi-kilometer sized chunks in Saturn's rings.</p>
<p><a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/science/rings/" target="_blank">https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/science/rings/</a></p>
<p>We are finding a lot of evidence in the last 5-10 years that there are a lot more planetoids out there than we ever thought.  Including in our own system.  </p>
<p>Let me ask a question.  How many moons do you think there are in the solar system?</p>
<p>Now go ask google.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can find a &quot;moon&quot; in pretty much any proximity to a planet, the question is size. A rock up to the size of a large island can be held together primarily by virtue of being, well, a giant rock. They're pretty sturdy, and difference in gravity between one side and another isn't enough to pull it apart.</p>
<p>The <em>really</em> large ones, like our moon, are not held together like that. They are held together by their own gravity. This is actually why they (and planets in general) are spherical, they're so massive even rock acts liquid and forms spheres the same way water does in zero-g.</p>
<p>This means when a moon that big gets close to something even bigger, the tidal forces can break up the gravity holding it together.</p>
<p>So there are mountain-sized &quot;moons&quot; mixed in with Saturn's rings, but they aren't big enough for most people to consider them to be real moons, and the only way they'll get big enough to be considered is if someone went out there with a welding torch and started bolting them together, because Saturn's gravity <em>will</em> still pull any incidental rocks or dust off the surface.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example the Roche limit of the Earth and Moon is between 9000-18000 km (depending on assumptions made) but the Roche limit of the Earth and an average comet is 18000-35000 km.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(Slightly educated guess)</p>
<p>It could theoretically have an effect on the Roche limit due to the deformation caused by the rotation causing a slight increase in tidal forces, but I doubt that it would be noticeable under normal circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't actually know the answer to that, I assumed that it existed outside of the Roche limit or something and the rings outside of it were made up of stuff the outer moons shed during asteroid impacts, with no real explanation for why they didn't form a moon of their own.  But since you asked I dug around a bit and found <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Saturns-moon-Pan-and-Jupiters-moon-Metis-exist-despite-lying-within-the-Roche-limit-of-their-respective-primaries" target="_blank">this on quora</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Why do Saturn's moon Pan and Jupiter's moon Metis exist despite lying within the Roche limit of their respective primaries?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main distinguisher when it comes to Roche radius is that rings tend to lie within the radius and moons outside. This is because bodies disintegrate inside the radius due to the overwhelming gravity, which is reduced in magnitude outside the radius, where the gravity of a relatively large body attracts dust and other particles to form a larger body of its own. Our own Moon sits a comfortable 20 times away from the Earth's Roche radius.</p>
<p>Mars's Phobos, Jupiter's Metis, Saturn's Pan (and other undiscovered, small moons in the inner ring systems, including Bleriot, probably), Uranus's Cordelia, and Neptune's Naiad are notable exceptions to this. Pan, Cordelia, and Naiad might break up eventually in a few years.</p>
<p>Pan and Metis are held together by tensile forces. Tensile strength of a body is the maximum stress it can withstand before being pulled apart by stretching. Had their core been weaker, they would have disintegrated. The tidal forces affecting the bodies is why both the satellites are irregularly shaped. It is presumed that the primary's tidal forces can actually lift an object off the satellites' surface.  Naturally, since the satellites are so close to their respective planets, there is massive tidal deceleration at play. This means that the satellites are gradually spiraling towards the primaries, owing to the decay of their orbits. The tidal forces are constantly tugging at the satellites. Pan's surface (as we've discovered from Cassini) consists of a large amount of porous material that it has accreted. The  particles are weakly bound by their self-gravity, and had there been no other satellites,  would eventually shear out  forming large clumps before  they disintegrate and the particles join other clumps. (Thanks to valuable input from Mark Lewis).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tldr:  Pan is made of some strong stuff, but it will probably be ripped apart eventually.</p></div>		</li>
