			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely read this as them spraying/injecting an extra layer of fibers throughout the product. Someone should figure out how to do this and copyright it because I feel like people would pay to extend the life of their favorite clothing!!! (Pretty sure that’s the wrong meaning but still.....)</p></div>		</li>
