			<div class="markdown"><p>Not simply benefits, but requires. They've evolved, like many Western tree species, to actually wait until a fire passes through before germinating. This trait allows the trees to successfully grow bigger and faster because the fire removes the understory vegetation that would shade out the sapling.</p>

<p>The relevant bit as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serotinous trees are found across North America. The most iconic tree species in the United States, the giant sequoia, or Sequoia gigantea, produces a cone that can contain up to 200 seeds and takes nearly two years to mature. After maturation, they remain in a dormant state, sealed in the cone, until released by fire.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the tallest sequoias are taller than a tree can rightfully grow. There are physical limits to how high you can pull moisture from the roots via capillary action and the suction caused by evaporation from the leaves. So sequoias can only reach their max heights in areas where fog or clouds routinely water the upper reaches of the tree.</p></div>		</li>
