			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Living things mostly consist of water and very dense tissues like bone. I can explain easiest with a human diver since we can both easily picture those.</p>
<p>When a human scuba diver descends, the pressure doesn't bother us too much. We're mostly made of water so we don't compress any more than the surrounding water does under pressure. So a whale's prey animal would have to be very deep to crush to death.</p>
<p>Gas, on the other hand, does compress very well. That means any open spaces in our body are more troublesome. For example your lungs and sinuses. At the surface, your lungs can contain about 6 litres of air. At a depth of 10 metres, your lungs can contain double that amount of air. </p>
<p>That's also why divers breathe pressurized gas. At 10 metres depth, your chest has to push all that water aside to breathe in. Simply put, you don't have the muscle power to do that so your pressurised air cannister forces the air into your lungs.</p>
<p>Gas doesn't just sit in your body cavities though. It also dissolves into your blood and tissues. And here's the real danger with pressure at depth. If you can fit 6 litres of air in your lungs at depth and 12 litres at 10 metres down.</p>
<p>Imagine what happens when you go back up with 12 litres of air still in your lungs. With much more dissolved gas in your tissues than you can handle at surface pressure.</p>
<p>You can't easily kill an animal with pressure by taking it down into the depths. But take any living thing up out of the depths faster than they can adjust and the consequences can be catastrophic.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!  That was well written and you made it understandable while actually going into a bit of detail. </p>
<p>Also, now I'm really sorry for the blobfish.  I've always laughed at how stupid it looks and now I learn I've been laughing at some poor creature that has been mutilated :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe any animal on a breath hold (not breathing compressed air) could suffer from nitrogen narcossis, decompression sickness or oxygen toxicity.  High partial pressures of gasses are required for these conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct.  The reason you get those things is that the gasses are consumed at pressure and expand as the pressure decreases.</p>
<p>That is how humans can freedive far deeper than you could dive on plain air, without I'll effect.  In fact the free diving record is so deep you'd need an exotic gas mix if using scuba diving.</p></div>		</li>

They must do an amazing job of oxegenating their blood. I wonder how long they can remain submerged on the one breath?</p></div>		</li>
