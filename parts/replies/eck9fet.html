			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. I forgot to add that these numbers are from when on TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy). I had my test convert to estrogen too easily (obesity does this). After a few months estrogen was something like 450. So to avoid problems I purchased Arimidex (all black market and with one exception - high quality, correctly dosed). Soon found out 1mg of Arimidex every other day really drives down estrogen. And with it my libido. Even when I took Arimidex every 5th day - zero libido.
What I learnt was this test high + slightly elevated estrogen = supercharged libido. But the time frame is small because after several weeks estrogen increases. But here is another aspect I didn't mention - high estrogen lead to a noticeable increase in erectile dysfunction.
High Test and very low estrogen will leave you fully functional but no libido.
My story involves 3 years of trying stuff out. I will leave you with this - In my experience there are four main hormones strongly tied to mens libido.
They are test, estrogen, progesterone and prolactin.
Everybody has different needs for their libido. Many people find progesterone kills their sex drive. I had a good experience though.</p></div>		</li>
