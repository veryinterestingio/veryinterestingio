			<div class="markdown"><p>Warming up is huge too.  Bench an empty bar or do body weight squats before jumping to a working load.</p>
<p>I tweaked my back and neck by always jumping straight into pullups, which I could barely eke out.  Starting with lighter lat pull downs is a better idea until you're stronger/warmed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Work out routine? </p>
<p>Yo, I only advocate stretching and moderate physical activity.</p>
<p>You got goals and wanna body sculpt or trim the fat or get huge or get lean that's on you and will come with it's own costs. You wanna lift that heavy thing or fit into those pants? Listen to this guy or other knowledgeable folks so you don't hurt your self.</p>
<p>All I'm saying is this: Be like a cat. There's fat cats and skinny cats, tough and soft, big and small, and all colors but every cat stretches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tennis <em>every single day</em> is 100% overkill. Injury is bound to happen with that routine. </p>
<p>Even NFL players take 24-48 hour rest periods in the regular season while focusing on smaller drills. </p>
<p>The only time I've seen daily routines are from ultra runners whose &quot;light workout&quot; includes a half marathon. These are weird people and we don't speak to them lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider alternating your tennis days with yoga, for your flexibility. Lots of steady repetitive movements and stretching, using different motions than you're used to every day.</p></div>		</li>
