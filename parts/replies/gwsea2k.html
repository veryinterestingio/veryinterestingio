			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for asking this question. I live in central La, on the Mississippi River. I’ve often wondered about the chemical run-off from farmland and industry meandering down south to us, destroying so much of what can be seen...and not seen. Photos of the River spilling into the gulf looks so sad. It’s just...dead. And it stinks down there, too. Louisiana...the hind end of the United States...where no one cares what gets destroyed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nitrate and phosphate enrichment tends to promote the growth of plants or algae (basically anything that photosynthesizes), so adding these nutrients to coral reefs promotes rapid growth of macroalgae. This is usually harmful for coral reefs, because macroalgae competes for space on the reef with corals, and can overgrow and even poison corals near them. This can lead to coral cover loss and a &quot;takeover&quot; of the reef by algae. </p>
<p>Corals also have symbiotic relationships with single-celled algae that live in their tissues and photosynthesize to provide them with food and energy. With nutrient enrichment, this symbiosis destabilizes, with the single-celled algae growing out of control within the coral host and harming instead of helping them. This usually leads to coral &quot;bleaching&quot;, where corals expel their symbionts - this is harmful for corals because then they lose their main source of nutrition. </p>
<p>Finally, agricultural runoffs can cause algal blooms, which then deprive the area of oxygen (eutrophication). Oxygen depletion hurts corals, fish, and any other animals living there! </p>
<p>In summary, agricultural runoff and N/P enrichment are generally harmful to reefs and ocean ecosystems. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you see in terms of the ratio of large polyp stony corals/soft corals compared to SPS corals with the higher nitrates and dirty water. Has there been much of an increase?</p></div>		</li>
