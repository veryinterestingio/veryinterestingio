			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, selection is better at purging negative (low fitness) traits when they are dominant since they can't &quot;hide&quot; in a carrier.</p>
<p>Also, as an aside about evolutionary terminology. I am not making a moral judgment by saying negative. Dwarfism generally has lower fitness than the alternative because of the associated health problems, and the fact that two heterozygous individuals (one copy of each allele, i.e. version of the gene) would have 1/4 of their children die. If you want to turn that into some sort of moral failing of people with dwarfism, you can take your naturalistic fallacy and go fuck yourself with a red hot poker.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not expressed often because very few people have it.</p>

<p>This is a circular argument: the rationale is the same as the original statement.</p>
<p>It's not expressed often because it's self-limiting.</p></div>		</li>
