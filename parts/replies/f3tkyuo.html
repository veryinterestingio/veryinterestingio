			<div class="markdown"><p>Songbirds, parrots and hummingbirds are the 3 categories of birds that learn their songs, but birds that do not belong to these categories (like chickens and pigeons, for example) don't learn their sounds. The birds that do learn have dedicated brain circuits for song learning, which can be very different from each other because song learning evolved independently in songbirds, parrots and hummingbirds. We need to have a very good understanding of their song circuits to be able to 'incept' memories, and right now we understand songbirds (zebra finches specifically) much more than other types, so we probably couldn't do this experiment in other birds right now, but there is no reason that it wouldn't be possible in hummingbirds and parrots!</p></div>		</li>
