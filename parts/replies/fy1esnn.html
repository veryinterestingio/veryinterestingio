			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we currently do a poor job at teaching digital literacy and critical thinking overall in the US. One problem is that many of our digital literacy curricula are now very outdated. Cues and heuristics that were helpful in distinguishing reputable and disreputable websites 10+ years ago just aren't that helpful now (e.g., a .org domain registration, nice looking website). Here's a good blog post showing why looking at the site itself isn't that useful, <a href="https://hapgood.us/2018/12/03/recognition-is-futile-and-also-dangerous/" target="_blank"><a href="https://hapgood.us/2018/12/03/recognition-is-futile-and-also-dangerous/" target="_blank">https://hapgood.us/2018/12/03/recognition-is-futile-and-also-dangerous/</a></a>. Instead, what's key is to search on other sites for information about the current source. </p>
<p>I think Poynter's MediaWise initiative,  <a href="https://www.poynter.org/mediawise/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.poynter.org/mediawise/" target="_blank">https://www.poynter.org/mediawise/</a></a>, does a great job at teaching people how to discern fact from fiction online as does the Check Please curriculum <a href="http://lessons.checkplease.cc/" target="_blank"><a href="http://lessons.checkplease.cc/" target="_blank">http://lessons.checkplease.cc/</a></a>.</p>
<p>One of the tricky things about teaching critical thinking is teaching people not just how to identify thing that are incorrect or that they shouldn't believe, but also to teach them how to identify correct information and trusted sources. It's easy for people to become disillusioned that everything online is false and everyone is lying. It's essential to also teach why we should listen to experts, scientists, and journalists.</p></div>		</li>
