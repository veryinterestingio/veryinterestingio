			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically bearing down on your abdomen to put pressure on your kidneys. I only know this because a friend was getting a bladder scope once and every time they coughed they could see little dribbles of urine coming in. It's kind of like squeezing a tea bag to speed up the steeping process I imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Valsalva is increasing your intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressure by tensing your stomach muscles and trying to blow out with a closed mouth/throat. You use this move for lots of things. Coughing and sneezing start with this before you let out the air (try to cough and notice your stomach muscles contract). You use it when pushing poop or pee out. If you hold your nose closed, you can use it to pop your ears. </p>
<p>It also causes changes in blood pressure and heart rate due to changes in blood returning to the heart </p>
<p>If you go to the Wikipedia page, youâ€™ll see how many different medical things it can be related to or used to help diagnose. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be using the wrong term - I thought it was just 'bearing down' on your abdomen as if you're coughing but it looks like the valsalva maneuver is more about bearing down on your lungs without letting the air out. I'm not sure if that alone would increase urine production rate!</p></div>		</li>
