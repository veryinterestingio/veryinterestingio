I think you feel them, rather than hear them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Negative.  If you go deaf your auditory nerve &amp; brain will try to amplify whatever signal is there and you'll end up with probably very awful tinnitus.</p>
<p>Even if you cut the auditory nerve (8th cranial nerve)this will still happen.</p>
<p>Best bet if you go deaf, is to wait for fx322 or get a cochlear implant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have moderate tinnitus so this has been something I've had to come to terms with. On the toilet with a tv playing in the other room I can hear a constant high frequency, kinda like when a flashbang goes off in CoD. Even at night in bed during a quiet scene of a show or movie I sometimes notice it and then can hear it during the louder scenes until I forget and stop focusing on it. </p>
<p>Be glad you just have to hear the pulsing of your blood vessels!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wtf, I had this my entire life and I didn't even knew that it existed before searching the term. I honestly thought that this was what silence sounded like.</p>
<p>It never bothered me, but at least now I have an excuse if someone asks me why I sleep with a fan on even when it's almost 0 ºC</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've been lucky to have it since childhood, though. I know it really bothers people who get it later in life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been inside a couple rooms like this: one at a university where they conduct sound experiments, and the other at the Shure microphone company where they test their products.</p>
<p>It’s really weird. It makes you feel uneasy. NOTHING is reflected back at you; you only hear direct sound. When someone talks it’s almost impossible to tell where they sound came from. And you can barely hear yourself speak since all the sound travels away from you.</p>
<p>But still a cool experience I’d recommend everyone try at least once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally random, but I have a form of conductive hearing loss that amounts to the same thing: I can't tell where sound is coming from unless I am staring at the source! It's not fun, but it uh, I guess it makes life interesting? Like when my son is in the living room calling me and I walk to his bedroom to see what's up. Sound localization is something you don't really appreciate until it's taken from you. I've always wanted to try one of these rooms as a result, but have no idea how to go about doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got to go in the anechoeic chamber where I work and I was slightly disappointed.  It was quiet, but not unsettlingly quiet as I expected.  We had a decent sized group in there, I suspect there was too much noise coming from everyone else to get the full effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up &quot;the quietest room in the world&quot;. I believe they isolated it from everything they could. Sounds (it's anechoic), it's built underground (no light), inside a faraday cage (no extraneous EM radiation), and on giant vibration dampeners so no movement from the Earth. Great for experiments!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah these are called Anechoic chambers. They use them to test and design audio devices like microphones. I don't know how long it would take. But it is extremely uncomfortable to be locked in an Anechoic chamber because the sound of self you're hearing is inside your head, not your mind but your head. So you can't get away from it, or turn away and make it quieter or really affect it in anyway. Which doesn't happen with other sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had open heart surgery in '08: they replaced one of my heart valves. Yeah, I heard the blood flowing, but there was this annoying pssss psssss pssss that I later learned was my artificial valve. I rarely hear it these days, but my ex said that if I slept with my mouth open, the sound kept her awake.</p></div>		</li>
