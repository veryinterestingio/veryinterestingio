			<div class="markdown"><p>Ice isn't all that smooth, the water layer on top is what actually makes it slick (that's how ice skates work). The rough surface of ice, relative to tiny molecules, create nucleation sites in the water where the bubbles are able to form. If you look closely, there are tiny bubbles clinging to the surface of your ice cube, that's the carbonation. Add that to the general agitation of the drink by dropping a solid into it and you have fizz producing actions on two fronts.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the Mentos reaction NOT a chemical reaction but the same physical reaction as ice, but the surface of a Mentos is super rough, creating more of those nucleation sites for the carbon dioxide to fall out of solution. There is no magic chemical in the candy, it's just a texture thing. It works better in diet Coke because there is less sweetener in it to naturally create these nucleation sites (aspartame is a very effective sweetener)</p>
<p>Here is an article on the Mentos and Coke reaction: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The surface of the ice (and mentos) has tons of imperfections and is 'rough'.  If you pour some water over your ice and then drain it off your soda pour will be amazingly less fizzy and your drink better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got it, and it's an easy experiment for you parents to do with the kids while you're stuck at home. Science lessons tend to take a back seat to math and reading - and let's be honest, for most people it all takes a back seat to screens ☹️</p></div>		</li>
