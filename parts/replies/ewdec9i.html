			<div class="markdown"><p>There must be one or a few biological / chemical models for the observed or suspected toxicity, not just the observed effects on average, statistically. Some good models may be tested reliably on particular representative species or on humans at a very low dose. </p>
<p>For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test" target="_blank">allergy tests</a> are often done on the arm skin at a low dose. Although allergies are relatively well understood there is still some very small risc of a surprise over reaction to the test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Toxicology doesn't stop at animal models though. Indeed animals could react differently to the tox than humans, that's why phase I clinical trials are always really small and mainly focusing on adverse events. Adverse events could be also a sign of toxicity in humans.</p>
<p>Toxicology studies for medicines and vaccines are alike, but rather different. Vaccines are mostly based on previous knowledge with hardly any new small molecules in it, whereas medicines could be mostly new small molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost right. It's a dose that will kill 50% of the test animals, i.e. one that is 50% guaranteed lethal.</p></div>		</li>
