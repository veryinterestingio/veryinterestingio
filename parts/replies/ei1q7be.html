			<div class="markdown"><p>Siblings (and fraternal twins) can theoretically be anywhere between 0-100% alike, but most siblings share around 50% of their genes.

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughters are fraternal twins. Seperate placentas, seperate amniotic sacs. They are not identical but they are also so similar that many people assume they are identical and have always had difficulty telling them apart. They have the same hair colour, eye colour and skin tone. They are the same height and build and have had the same development stages. They also have similar levels of intelligence.  They must have very similar DNA mix.</p></div>		</li>
