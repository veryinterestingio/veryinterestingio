<p>But also technique. Like whoever first started ski jumping with their skis pointed outwards versus parrallel. Or the Fosbury Flop pole vault technique.</p>
<p>EDIT: I have now been educated that the Fosbury Flop is a high jump technique, not pole vault. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot of people suggest this, and while it sounds good on its face (let's see just how far we can push science to get truly ridiculous sports achievements), it's really bad when you consider that athletes would absolutely <strong><em>obliterate</em></strong> themselves to win in such a league. Like, we're talking &quot;you compete exactly once and then you're dead or permanently disabled afterwards, but you have the WR for now.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There aren't many Olympic sports for which this isn't true. For instance, while the actual technology in gymnastics is not especially high tech, it is very different. The floor has become more and more springy over time, allowing bigger and more dramatic tumblingm. Same with the balance beam, which has enough shock absorption now to handle powerful tumbling. The uneven bars have been moved farther and farther apart over time (look up videos of the bars to see how the event was basically entirely differentnin the 50s) which allows the ladies to make full swings and big air releases.  Some of the skills they do today would be literally impossible on old equipment and most of it would be close, or at least much more dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gymnastics training also changed more than most sports as this happened.  The first back flip on the beam in the olympics happened in 1972.  It's been a skills race ever since, such that by the early 90s this skill wasn't uncommon even for the better 12 year old kids at the local gym.  In addition to equipment changes, more intense training and conditioning were also needed.  Gymnasts of today have a very different build and very different training from an early age.  , But the sport is no longer changing so much year over year, and you do see a few gymnast competing at older ages (which was near impossible in the years when an older gymnast not only had to maintain skills, but keep up with a rapidly advancing difficulty)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all goes hand in hand. To do bigger skills you need the equipment, but you also have to the training, etc. The need for greater strength is a big part of why the ages of gymnasts have crept back up. Flexibility and &quot;Grace&quot; are now not as important compared to strength and difficulty (still important, of course, but the balance has shifted a lot which is most obvious to me in the way all around gymnasts are no longer roughly divided into the bars-and-beam group and the vault-and-floor group but instead almost all of the top AA athletes are very strong in vault, floor and beam and much weaker on bars which is the only event that doesn't involve major tumbling now.)</p></div>		</li>
