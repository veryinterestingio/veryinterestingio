			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the biggest concerns are the transmission lines and anything connected to the transmission lines. The actual EM pulses aren't <em>that</em> strong, but when you apply it over thousands of kilometers of conductor it creates an extremely strong emf. That will fry the grid and anything connected to it. Electric utilities are developing plans and apparatuses to open everything as quickly as possible in events like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The system has to be opened.</p>
<p>In an electrical system:</p>
<p>Open = off</p>
<p>Closed = on</p>
<p>&quot;The circuit is open/closed.&quot;</p>
<p>As to why grounding wouldn't make a difference is because it is already grounded. Opening the system creates air gaps and reduces the connected surface area of conductors in the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of &quot;connect to ground&quot;, the issue is that we want to put normal electrical power through it... so grounding out the transmission lines would be an issue.</p>
<p>To be a bit more in-depth, but stay within ELI5, electrical transmission lines -- and the transformers at the ends -- are designed to move enormous amounts of power, <em>in one very specific way</em>.  So while it might be perfectly okay with moving 100 Happy power, 10 Sad power could start breaking stuff.... and that's what solar flares will cause.</p>
<p>We <em>can</em> open up the protective switches on power lines and transformers, if we're worried.  The problem then is that there's no power going down those wires to customers, which is bad.  So if you're a grid operator, and your stuff is happily carrying 100 happy power, but there's 3 sad power going through, do you pull the plug and cut power on a million people?  The hardware is probably okay with that much.  But what if it goes to 5?</p>
<p>If you are too careful, you hurt a bunch of people for the duration of the event.  If you aren't careful enough, you break multi-million-dollar pieces of equipment that take months to get replaced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto the other comment, there are already connections called &quot;surge arrestors&quot;. Think of like large capacitors that are between the line and ground.  If the voltage increases suddenly, it dissipates some of the energy back to ground. Events like the ones we're talking about would fry those *very* quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Size matters very very much here. A solar storm actually wouldn't fry any electronics directly. It fries the <em>power grid</em>, which in turn can wreck everything connected to it. A cell phone would be fine, or really anything not connected to an outlet.</p>
<p>It <em>could</em> also plausibly kill an animal or human, <strong>if</strong> they were thin and hundreds of kilometers long...</p></div>		</li>

<p>For context, lighting has way more energy than you would ever be exposed to as part of an EMP, and the only concerns there are direct strikes and ground currents extremely close to the impact site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except for an EMP capable of causing that much damage represents a considerable amount of energy. There is a reason why we only talk about the one generated from the sun or nuclear blasts. Someone made an EMP device to fry cars and even with that, where the pulse was focused through a ring just big enough for the car to drive through, it required basically its own little substation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  As others have mentioned, it's not hard to shield against an EMP locally.  As long as you're willing to cut off communication and spend the money that is.  Think of it like fire.  A bonfire is hot and being too close can hurt you.  However, that represents a large amount of energy.  Your skin also protects you.</p>
<p>For all we know, the Transformers could consider powerful EM waves (think continuous EMP) the same way we treat a sauna.  Or they might treat it like we do a loud sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A Faraday cage will largely protect whatever’s within it from an EM pulse. There’s one in every microwave oven, for example, although it’s designed in this case to keep the EM waves in, not out. It can be partially seen built into the oven’s window. It would still work, so you could theoretically put your phone etc. into a microwave oven to save it from an EMP (but don’t turn it on!). A metallic elevator cabin also works as a Faraday cage. A bag lined with foil would also work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Critical military buildings are actually sheathed in metal cladding that is grounded which turns the shells of the building into giant Faraday cages. This serves two purposes...it prevents EMP and other RF from making it to the electronic equipment inside and it prevents stray RF signals from leaking out and being picked up by unauthorized receivers. </p>
<p>The same type of thing is done with aircraft, but since there is no way to actually ground an aircraft in flight, the focus is on absorbing any stray RF and keeping it away from critical electronics.</p>
<p>So the point here is that there is a solution for this problem that would prevent a lot of the mayhem resulting from a huge solar event, but it is extremely expensive to implement. For this reason it has traditionally only been used for the most critical of critical applications (i.e. preventing killing people from plane crashes and making sure we can still kill people with military equipment). </p>
<p>Even if all critical infrastructure electronics were shielded though, it would still be close to impossible to protect the millions of miles of power transmissions lines, so they still represent a huge point of failure.</p></div>		</li>
