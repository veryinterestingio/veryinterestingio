			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I couldn't have said it better. I'm a laboratory assistant and I tend to do less damage vs an iv but people will always tell you their veins blow. Many people who don't understand how hard it is sometimes and it drives me nuts. I can't blame them but still:).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get infusions every month plus I’ve been inpatient a few times so my veins are fun. I’ve only had a vein blow once (and it hurt like a bitch) when the nurse tried to float the cath in. I’ve had many successful floats before and I still let them try, but man does it make me nervous.</p>
<p>That said, I’m very valvy and often a stick doesn’t work because there’s no blood return and I’ve had nurses tell me that vein was blown even though it wasn’t. Some people just use the term “blown” to mean they have to re-stick whether the vein is actually blown or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The few times i've tried donating blood,  i've developed clots and have had other issues with them being able to find/tap a decent vein.  I only successfully donated once or twice, and honestly felt bad for the waste of time and resources on the parts of all involved when it went awry.  Even with the present shortage, would it be a waste of resources for me to go try and donate again?  Should I 'warn' them about my previous challenges with the process, or would that seem too presumptuous?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely let the admitting nurse know your history during the interview, they want to make sure you are safe after the donation.  The interviewer can also make a note about your preferred arm.  Also let the nurse doing the draw know if it is not the one doing the interview.  They can check which vein pops up better or try a different vein on your other arm.  Also, instead of the young nurse, you sometimes need to get the older nurse who's done draws for 30 years.  They've seen it all and can get blood from a stone :)</p>
<p>My left arm is &quot;slower&quot; and harder to tap than my right arm.  But I'm right handed, so it's more likely to reopen if i forget to be gentle and take it easy after donating.</p>
<p>I actually had more pain from an IV on the top of my hand than my blood donations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had those same issues multiple times in a row, and gave up donating blood for a while.  During a shortage of my blood type, I tried again.  I got super-hydrated before donating, and it worked!  Try again, and as another person commented, warn the phlebotomist of your past issues.</p></div>		</li>
