			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer. Usually a group of companies get together and define the industry standards. It saves everyone time and money. Imagine if every phone charger was different? You would almost never be able to borrow a charger like used to be a problem in the old days. Imagine every brand DVD player took a different size disc? Or if every web browser needed web sites coded in a different language?</p>
<p>Sometimes there are companies that try to create standards by themselves. Unless you're Apple or Sony(back in the day), it doesn't usually work out. Your product tends to be niche and expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Screwdrivers are a poor choice of example. For the most part, people weren't trying to make universal standards,  they were trying to design them for specific purposes. For example Phillips-heads are designed specifically to provide low torque and to strip the screw, so they're hard to overtighten and damage whatever you're screwing. Torx, on the other hand, is designed so you can tighten the shit out of it. Slot heads are designed to maximize the usage cycles of the screw...etc etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting how different the different standards groups are. To take a recent example, look at the naming conventions... the usb group had a pretty simple system for ages where the numbers represented the speed, and letters represented the type of plug. So type C was the connector that goes in either way, usb 3 was 5 gb/s speed, etc.</p>
<p>Then they went batshit crazy and the new iterations have names like &quot;USB 3.2 Gen 2x2&quot;.</p>
<p>IEEE 802.11, on the other hand - simplified! Wifi always used 802.11 and letters like 802.11g, followed by 802.11n, followed by 802.11ac (the intermediate letters were other standards they published that weren't wifi-protocols). The next version was going to be called &quot;802.11ax&quot; but then someone thought &quot;hmm, that's dumb&quot; and they renamed it &quot;WiFi 6&quot;. They then retroactively named 802.11ac &quot;WiFi 5&quot; and 802.11n &quot;WiFi 4&quot;. So simple!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh that is pretty interesting. So are these crazy names like USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 the result of companies trying to make their own usb type? Or is it just different usb types created by the same group that made the mainstream types that just haven’t caught on yet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>USB-IF was always batshit crazy about names.</p>
<p>Look at the datarate names. The second slowest one is called &quot;Full Speed&quot; and when they could not come up with a new name after 'low' -&gt; 'full' -&gt; 'high' -&gt; 'super' they just slapped a '+' to the end of 'super'.</p></div>		</li>
