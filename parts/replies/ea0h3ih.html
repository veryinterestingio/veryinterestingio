<p>This change affects (while not really changing anything) all sorts of SI-derived units like Newton, Joule, Watt, Volt and Ohm and also a host of other non-SI unity that are defined through the kilogram including US-units like the Pound, which is legally defined through the Kilogram instead of having its own prototype of physical definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additional additional trivia:</p>
<p>According to NPR, early in US history they were trying to decide on a standardized system of measurement. Thomas Jefferson had heard of the metric system (which was still new at the time) and asked France to send a representative. This representative boarded a ship with a kilogram mass, but the ship was blown off course and the representative was killed by pirates, who sold the mass.</p>
<p>So yeah, the US might not have went metric because pirates stole our kilogram.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Planck was researching how to make lightbulbs better.  Old school light bulbs are just a piece of material in the the bulb which gets really hot when you run electricity through it, and then emits a bunch of energy - some light, and lots of heat in the form of infrared light/energy, plus other wavelenghs. (Studying that phenomenon also touched on a problem with the physics of the day - their best model for how hot things emit light/electromagnetic radiation indicated that everything in the universe emitted an infinite amount of energy all the time, which clearly isn't accurate.)  </p>
<p>Planck realized there was a nifty mathematical trick that would give him a formula that actually modeled what they saw in real life (which included not having everything emit an infinite amount of energy all the time.)  The trick was based on not assuming that everything happened totally continuously, but that the light/energy being radiated only happened in tiny steps.  His formula was based on only allowing one of the numbers to be an integer, and then multiplying it by a super-small number (the Planck constant.)  So instead of the result being a totally smooth curve, if you zoom way, way, way in you see that the light/energy &quot;curve&quot; is actually made up of tiny steps.</p>
<p>It turned out first that this was related to the energy of one electron moving up or down energy states in an atom, but they didn't really understand that at the time.  Einstein would build on that a few years later, working on how light hitting a material could knock electrons loose.  (His Nobel Prize was for that work, not for the theory of relativity.)</p>
<p>But that formula and constant - coming up with a mathematical formula that treated light as only being able to change energy levels in tiny steps, instead of infinitely variable - was a massive breakthrough towards quantum physics, relativity and the related science that made all our 20th/21st century technology possible, from nuclear weapons to solar cells.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure how we math a physical object into existence. So... How hard is it to build a new 1KG weight based on this constant, could it be a DIY project for a layman in his garage, or does it take an advanced level of understanding that will only be able to be pulled off by college labs and some private companies? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sarcasm aside, the Kibble Balance doesn't sound complicated when broken down into each step it takes to get to it's answer, it's just a very sensitive device that does its job in a roundabout way in order to rely solely on fundamental constants. I suggest looking up any recent articles on it, it's really cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the number of atoms in 12 grams of C12 IS Avagadros Number. Without that definition it’s just a random quantity of particles.</p>
<p>Can you explain why this change is being made? The point of a mole is to compare the mass of the same number of particles of different substances. If we don’t use 12 grams of C12 then why not make it a round number like 6 x 10^23?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a long time, it has been the number of atoms in 12 grams of Carbon-12, which is approximately 6.02214076×10^23. But that number is only an approximation, which was acceptably close to the true number of atoms in that mass of material.</p>
<p>As they are changing the kilogram, there may have been a subsequent subtle adjustment to the value of the mole. However, they have now decided to decouple the mole and the kilogram. A mole of something will be precisely 6.02214076×10^23 of that thing, which is more absolute and unambiguous, but slightly more arbitrary.</p></div>		</li>
