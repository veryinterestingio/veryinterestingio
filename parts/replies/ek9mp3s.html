			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still a bit confused. You're correct the ingredients doesn't say &quot;just oranges&quot; it says &quot;100% Orange juice&quot; it also says &quot;Never Sweetened&quot; which contradicts your claim they always add sugar. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a company makes a batch of juice, let’s say they use 2000 oranges. Sure, not all of the oranges taste EXACTLY the same, but once they are all mixed it gives you the stereotypical orange juice flavor. It’s all about batches </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any juice manufacturer wants their juice to be consistent every time.</p>
<p>Even if they do not supplement it with sugar, they will homogenise the juice from various batches, so if one crop is slightly sweeter, it gets mixed with others so the net result is a consistent taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The part about sugar in that case is incorrect but the thing to remember about orange juice is that even if it says &quot;100% orange juice&quot; and &quot;Not from concentrate&quot;, that doesn't mean they're juicing oranges and putting it into bottles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once the juice is squeezed and stored in gigantic vats, they start removing oxygen. Why? Because removing oxygen from the juice allows the liquid to keep for up to a year without spoiling. But! Removing that oxygen also removes the natural flavors of oranges. Yeah, it’s all backwards. So in order to have OJ actually taste like oranges, drink companies hire flavor and fragrance companies, the same ones that make perfumes for Dior, to create these “flavor packs” to make juice taste like, well, juice again.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, critically, those flavour packs are made entirely from orange extracts, so that they can truthfully say it's made from &quot;100% oranges&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
