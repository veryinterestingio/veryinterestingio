<p>This is also why black surfaces heat up much quicker than white / reflective surfaces - they not only absorb most of the visible light, but a lot of the UV and infra-red light as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Some birds and insects that look brown have much more variety in their colours in the Infrared and Ultraviolet.</p>
<p>Also - the white powder on the inside of florescent tubes absorbs ultraviolet light and releases a board(-ish) spectrum of visible light.  If you make a tube with less of this power coating, it becomes a &quot;greenhouse&quot; light which helps plants.  Remove it entirely, you get a &quot;black&quot; light that makes your t-shirt look green and teeth purple.</p>
<p>Black-light t-shirts and shoe laces and teeth is those materials (often in the Fluorine, Chlorine column of the periodic table) absorbing UV and releasing a specific set of frequencies of visible light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes-ish.</p>
<p>The sun puts out a lot of visible light, if your material looks black to humans, it absorbs that visible light.</p>
<p>However, the sun puts out even more infrared light. If you make your material reflect infrared, it will stay cooler than one that absorbs all wavelengths.</p>
<p>Except... There's one thing that makes everything a bit more complicated, and that's re-radiation. If you only absorb light, you'll keep heating up, so clearly that heat has to go somewhere! As your material heats up, it starts to glow. Your material isn't as hot as the sun, so it will give off mainly infrared energy. Interestingly, the absorption of a material is the same thing as it's radiative efficiency, so your material that reflects infrared is now unable to emit infrared photons. This makes it hard for it to get rid of it's heat well and can actually cause it to become hotter than if it just absorbed everything!</p>
<p>If you want to make a cool material, make a material that looks white (reflects the visible) but still absorbs (and emits) infrared.</p>
<p>(EDIT: How could I be this wrong! If your material absorbs only infrared it will still get hotter than if it's white across the whole spectrum. The material that I described here was developed for better cooling performance, but <em>it can not operate in direct sunlight</em>. Duh... That was the whole purpose of my experiment!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak for Infra-red, but UV? Definitely. </p>
<p>Our skin has a special history with UV - because UV can damage our DNA and cause harmful effects with prolonged exposure, we've evolved a special defence mechanism against it: melanin. This is the pigment that originally gives our skin color.</p>
<p>Melanin is produced by special cells in our skin when it detects UV exposure, they go right into the nucleus of every exposed skin cell, spreading out and shielding it - their purpose: to absorb UV radiation like an umbrella. Physically, this results in our skin getting <em>darker</em> over time with more melanin in increased Sun exposure - manifesting as a tan.</p>
<p>The more melanin in our skin = the greater the protection against harmful mutations caused by UV overexposure, such as melanoma. This may result in more heat being absorbed by some skin colors compared to others (and there are other mechanisms in our body to deal with that excess heat), however it's a small price to pay for the added protection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the frequency of that wavelength of light matches the vibration frequency of the electrons in the atoms in the material being hit by that light, the light will interact with electrons that vibrate at that frequency, causing them to vibrate more intensely and thus generate thermal energy. Since the energy was converted into thermal energy, it cannot be reflected outwards, and thus the object doesn't emit that light.</p>
<p>If an object appears white, it's because none (or at least very few) of the materials its surface is made of contain electrons that vibrate at the same frequency as visible light (400-800nm).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where quantum mechanics comes in. There's no real straightforward way to explain it accurately without math, but here goes. </p>
<p>The &quot;Quantum&quot; in quantum mechanics means that atoms and subatomic particles don't behave as a continuum, but rather have discrete steps they jump to. For electrons that are in &quot;orbits&quot; around an atom, their energy level is quantized. So instead of there being an energy level of 1.2, 1.35, 1.557, 1.76823 and every other value between one and two, it just goes directly from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc. </p>
<p>So it takes a precise amount of energy to jump between levels, and if the energy isn't exactly right it doesn't get absorbed because you can't do anything with a remainder. The energy of a wave is proportional to its frequency/wavelength, with shorter wavelengths/higher frequency being higher energy - that's why lights are safe, UV burns, X-rays damage in large amounts, and gamma rays kill. If the wavelength of a photon hitting an electron isn't the right energy/wavelength/frequency, the photon will just bounce right off. If it IS right, then the electron takes the energy and jumps to a higher level - and note that it can skip steps, from 1 to 3 for example, or kick an already energized electron even higher from 3 to 4. It just has to match the energy required for that jump (the lowest energy states are most common though)</p>
<p>So you have a whole combination of wavelengths that will work - 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 1-3, 2-4, each corresponding to a different &quot;color&quot; of light. When &quot;white&quot; light comprising every wavelength hits a material, the matching energy colors are absorbed and the remainder reflected back. That mixture gives your final color! The absorbed energy usually dissipates as vibration energy (internal temperature) which is why they warm up in sunlight, or reradiate at a lower frequency (like infrared). </p>
<p>A neat side effect is when energized electrons fall to a lower level, they do so by releasing a photon of that same wavelength! This is how we identify what things in space are made of like suns, distant asteroids and planets, nebulas, etc. - which colors are being emitted or absorbed will correspond to all the materials in them, leaving a spectral &quot;fingerprint&quot; that can be identified with a spectrometer. It's also why things that glow under black lights look so weird: light invisible to use is being reradiated at a lower frequency we can see, releasing light that seems to come from nowhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best explanation on this thread that I've seen so far and one of the better ways to think about this subject without diving into QED and more advanced physics topics.</p>

It's not meant to be a thorough discussion by any means, but it covers some of the key physics principles (Coulomb's Law, the photoelectric effect, Pauli Exclusion principle, etc.) and provides enough background to discuss various semiconductor technologies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>why does it absorb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine you have a ball that is constantly inflating and deflating between a small size and a large size, like a cartoon beating-heart. *Badump. Badump.* This ball is both rubbery/bouncy yet also has a sticky surface. Now imagine you throw another ball at it which is doing the same thing.</p>
<p>If they happen to meet with the right timing, like when one is expanding as the other contracts, their surfaces will touch gently-enough that they will stick, and the thrown ball will be &quot;caught&quot;. Other times, they will happen to smack into each other hard (like if both are expanding at the same time) and the thrown ball will bounce backwards and away. How often each stick-vs-bounce happens can depend on how quickly each one is beating compared to the other.</p>
<p>Imagine a flat surface made out of a bunch of stationary balls that &quot;beat&quot; at a certain rate, and &quot;light&quot; is a falling hailstorm of other balls, which have a wide mix-of-rates.</p>
<p>Some of the hailstorm  balls will be caught, some of them will be bounced, but on average it will depend on the beats involved. The part of the hailstorm that &quot;bounces back&quot; can often be a different mix than what fell.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Changed the wavelength-metaphor from pendulums and sideways-speed to &quot;beats&quot; in order to avoid creating extra confusion with the whole speed-of-light thing.</p></div>		</li>
