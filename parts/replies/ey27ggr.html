			<div class="markdown"><p>Because evolution isn't about finding the best solution, it's about settling on the first solution that works for a given environment.  You're anthropomorphizing it by assuming that concepts like &quot;strategy&quot; or &quot;design&quot; or &quot;improvement&quot; factor into it - there is no intelligent, guiding hand.  It's just a random process that, over millions and millions of years, eventually selects for the first thing that solves a problem <em>good enough</em> for the specific environmental circumstances it appears in.</p>
<p>Artificial electric light has been around for like 200 years or less.  Given another million years, I'm sure bugs will evolve to find a better wayfinding mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually super interesting and makes perfect sense IMO. I would imagine all day long they're using the sun as a reference and flying straight, and when the sun sets and there is artificial light, they are thrown off. I wonder if there was a observable impact on the invention of artificial light on insects.</p></div>		</li>
