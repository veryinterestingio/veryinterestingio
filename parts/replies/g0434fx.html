			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! I think the answer is no. If there's less gravity, the water would weigh less, but so would the air. So all else being equal, I don't think changing the gravity alone would change the size of the rain drops. </p>
<p>When we say that water vapor is &quot;lighter&quot; than air, what we mean is that it's &quot;less dense,&quot; or that its molecules are less tightly packed together. Density is the same no matter the gravity. So whatever changes reducing the gravity might cause (and it would actually change a lot, because it would change all of the atmospheric pressure), my gut feeling is that the amount of water vapor that would have to gather together to become denser than air is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand, my reply above is oversimplified and  only considers gravity, &quot;air&quot; - Earth air, and water vapor. What kind of weather other planets have is entirely dependent on the makeup of their atmosphere. Weather is a chaotic system, which means tiny changes can have unpredictable impact. </p>
<p>One thing gravity would have a huge effect on is atmospheric pressure. I don't have a clue how reducing Earth's gravity would affect its weather as a whole. </p>
<p>But another thought I had was this: if you reduce gravity, would a glass marble still sink in a bathtub full of water? I'm pretty confident it would. The marble wouldn't have to get bigger to sink. It would still be more dense than the water. Same principle for rain vs air.</p>
<p>Different atmosphere,  different materials and densities,  you could probably come up with a combination where the drops are bigger or smaller. But as long as the ingredients are water vapor and &quot;air,&quot; neither of which are pure in our atmosphere, the possible size will fall in a limited range that can be influenced by things like temperature and motion.</p></div>		</li>
