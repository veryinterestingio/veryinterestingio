			<div class="markdown"><p>The same reason your phone's battery still drains when you're not actively using it. It's still <em>doing stuff</em>, just not as much stuff as when you're moving around. </p>
<p>When you enter sleep, your body enters a mode where it does all kinds of things it can't do -- or can't do effectively -- while it's awake. Those things &quot;recharge&quot; you. Your body behaves differently between active, at rest, and asleep.</p></div>		</li>
