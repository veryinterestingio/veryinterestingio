<p>I'm in the same boat, and I'm sure it's similar.  I definitely believe that sweet spot like 4 beers in when you're feeling it but not drunk yet is probably what normies feel all the time, but then you need another 4 or 5 to get on a normie level conversationally and by then you're feeling a lot better than &quot;normal.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man,  that's really crazy. I didn't know it could do that. I have a good amount of anxiety, had an anxiety attack in March,  and have developed pretty bad stomache issues shortly after that,  which i wouldn't be able to find out what it was unless i got an endoscopy which i can't afford. I didn't even think to put those together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally get it. I used to have a ton of stomach issues and used to think it had to do with diet till I received an anxiety diagnosis :/ Like another poster said anxiety is very very physically draining and demanding on your body. But on the bright side for you once you start to learn how to manage your anxiety, your stomach issues will show improvement as well.</p></div>		</li>
