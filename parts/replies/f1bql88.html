			<div class="markdown"><p>To add: this is why many systems use a form of base-12. </p>
<p>12 inches in a foot, 24 hours in a day, etc. </p>
<p>They're highly compound numbers. They can be divided by 1,2,3,4,6,12, and in the case of 24 hours, 8.</p>
<p>This is also why the mile is 5280 feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, using a base-12 would really make sense... if we also counted in base-12. </p>
<p>Binary is base-2, and it uses 2 characters; </p>
<p>Decimal is base-10 and it uses 10 characters;</p>
<p>Hexadecimal, base 12, 12 characters. </p>
<p>Imperial? Base 12, 10 characters. </p>
<p>This is the huge problem about imperial units, not the fact that they are base 12 (and not even all of them).
1.5 meters means one meter and 5 decimeters; 1.5 feet means 1 foot and 6 inches. That's the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. But thousands of years ago we all standardized on the number of fingers we have. A bit late now.</p>
<p>I'm still holding out for base 12 in science at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was also because a person can, generally speaking, halve something fairly easily and consistently. So having units of measure that can be doubled and halved easily was a benefit because you didn't need tools to perform trade or rough construction.</p></div>		</li>
