			<div class="markdown"><p>To add that post-production, additional scenes, marketing, distribution and subsequent releases are all part of the movie budget and time. Some times movies are finished half a year before released. There are some movies out there that will never actually be released.</p>
<p>If a movie is a few months away from releasing and they are still filming (looking at you, rise of Skywalker) ot might actually mean it's still not clear what the script /ending should be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, I was generalizing.  I only picked the Flash because I had literally just watched it on Netflix and assumed the poster would be familiar.</p>
<p>Each studio is going to have different timelines and different shows are going to have weird specifics.  I know Arrow has all these elaborate fight scenes that the actors never see. They're done by a whole different team.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got to hang out with the stunt team for Supergirl once. They're good dudes but I will confirm that the actors don't get involved unless they need to. It's not their specialty and when you have a timeline that ridiculous you wanna either get the fuck out as soon as possible or at least have a break. Or if you have a good production then there'll be action sequences happening in a different location nearby or on another day entirely for efficiency sake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For any show with established sets there's also the benefit of shooting non-linearly. When The Flash Crew are filming scenes in CC Jitters, they could be filming scenes for 3 or 4 different episodes just to avoid having to move the equipment for a while. Change out the extras and sort out the wardrobe changes for continuity and nobody would know scenes from opposite sides of the season were filmed in the same afternoon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, this is extremely unlikely unless there is a common director for all those episodes.  It's not weird for a director to do two episodes at a time, but directing 4 at a time would be rough.</p>
<p>It would be very unusual for a director to come in Thursday morning shoot a scene, and then have a different director come in Thursday afternoon to shoot a different scene just because they are both taking place on a common set.</p>
<p>An obvious example of multi-episodes would be when flash does 2 part-ers.</p>
<p>I've never checked, but I wonder how they handle directors when they are doing those Flash/Arrow or Flash/Supergirl connected episodes.</p></div>		</li>
