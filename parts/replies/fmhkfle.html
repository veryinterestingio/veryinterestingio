			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with all of this, except I think my physical withdrawal symptoms lasted a bit longer in regards to learning to sleep again, probably around 2-3 weeks. The mental ones much longer than that, months if not years. I had to learn how to be happy, sad, motivated, deal with problems etc without getting high. </p>
<p>To say it’s not an addiction and it’s totally safe is very misleading in my opinion. I do think people should be able to do what they want if it doesn’t negatively affect others but that doesn’t mean it’s absolutely without consequence. As you said, if it were there wouldn’t be so many people that use it every single day. It took me around 7 years to finally quit (over 10 years ago) and it’s the hardest thing I ever did, including quitting several Class A substances. </p>
<p>Unlike for example cocaine, which is extremely physically addictive, marijuana I think is lightly physically addictive but can be extremely mentally addictive. People who use it continually for both motivation and to relax are really using it to avoid dealing with life, and when that happens it’s very hard to stop. </p>
<p>I heard a quote from a TV show recently that summed it up for me better than anything I have ever heard - “we know why we take drugs, it’s to cover the pain. So the questions isn’t ‘why drugs?’ it’s ’why pain?’”  This is course is a very hard question to answer which is why I think so many people just don’t stop getting stoned. However life, as hard as it often is, is best lived fully experienced in my opinion. Blunting it with weed may be socially acceptable now, but it isn’t “normal” or even particularly helpful to a full human experience.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not always the case. You can deal with life just fine while smoking every day. But it certainly can be the case and it's not healthy at all if it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a reward for doing nothing, of course it's mentally addictive. It's the same vein as gambling addiction. There's no physical aspect, it's all about the easy reward. </p>
<p>It's simple reactionary instinct. A lot of people seem to overlook the fact that we are still just animals. Conceited, pompous, and incredulous animals, but still some basic-ass animals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ingesting any psychoactive substance chronically is going to cause differences in receptor expression due to the shift in homeostasis, and cannabis is no exception.  The physical withdrawal is very mild, however.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't remember anything without a pain so deep that it hardly becomes known to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well , I was a a heavy weed smoker for 3 years, and the last of these 3 years I was already wanting to stop but was struggling to find a reason why I should. Thoughts like &quot;There's no reason to stop, it doesn't affect me in any way, I'm a more relaxed person when I smoke&quot; were frequent. But the trigger for the stop was when my dad had a stroke, he quit his 40 year smoking habit from one day to another, and I haven't smoked since. I haven't felt any withdrawl symptom, but I feel that it's way better without it, I started exercising regularly, I can dream again, my sexual appetite increased dramatically, social skills definitely improved, and I can socialize with my family again, I couldn't stand them before...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the reason one quits plays a large part in how the withdrawal works. If you're ready to quit, they can be minor but if you're not really ready and want to smoke but can't for some reason, they are much worse. It's mostly psychological.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came to say this.  I actually was gonna say it in response to the parent of this thread, in response to their saying different times have been different.  Quitting against your will for a job or something, when you’re not really wanting to quit, will be hard.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is how I know I’ve cleaned up. About a week after I quit I can start dreaming again and after years of not remembering dreams they hit in a big way.</p></div>		</li>
