			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but more Cultural Psychology. Evolutionary psychology is more about genetically influenced traits humans have from our evolutionary history. Evolutionary psychology would tell us why humans (or earlier species) evolved concepts like sexuality. Cultural psychology would tell us why differences exist among cultural ideas and norms about sexuality in different parts of the world, and how different understandings of sexuality is and affects other aspects culture and the behaviour and thoughts of the people.</p></div>		</li>
