Also the sheer volume of data would make it impractical, if they want a targeted attack they can just tap a more specific cable on land, ie, right outside your house, though that has the same issue of almost everything being encrypted these days.</p>
<p>One of the Merican spy agencies did this to Google data centres earlier in the decade, it was a big driver toward everything getting to the encryption state it is now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't work with fiber directly much, but I my employer run some of the largest and fastest fiber installations in the world.</p>
<p>With old copper cables, it was possible to put a listening device next to the cable and listen to the signals as they pass. In the older days, the signal was already poor quality and so cutting the cable could happen without being noticed too much. There are a few documented cases of Russia and the US doing this with undersea cables.</p>
<p>Installing a listening device is not possible in the same way with fiber optics, otherwise we'd be doing that in datacenters all the time. Intercepting a signal from fiber-optic requires a  cutting the cable (a very clean cut) and inserting a repeater and a large data storage system, which would be fairly sophisticated and requires a power source. A light source needs to be converted to an analog signal in order for it to be saved to a recording device like a computer-- this signal conversion is actually a complicated problem in data centers. Cutting a fiber cable is very disruptive, and will get noticed quickly. My coworkers can even determine the location of a cut cable down to a couple dozen feet by analysing the reflected light signal-- it's amazing.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe a nation state has come up with way of doing this, but would be a pretty sophisticated thing to do and it's not something that the industry has been able to my knowledge.</p>
<p>Also remember, a fiber cable will often contain packets from hundreds if not thousands of different sources, and any listening device would end up with a ton of irrelevant data. Add encryption in, and getting useful info becomes even more difficult.</p>
<p>When espionage does happen, it tends to happeen by installing malware inside of facility, because it's difficult to do from the outside. A 'facility' might just be a small building somewhere that's guarded by cameras, where the signals are split into other cables, so that's a possibility too. But the cable itself? Probably not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can’t tap into fiber like you can a copper connection. Cross talk is non existent because it’s just light being transferred. If they were to try to splice into one, hijacking the stand(s), they would be found out immediately</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are certainly a few relative to all that exists outside the cables at the bottom of the ocean. That is what makes it so interesting, that those relatively few can step up and handle massive regions with thousands to millions of people being supported.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned cables at the bottom of the ocean.   While there are cables laying along the bottom miles and miles from shore, the majority of routes are floating deep below the surface but far from the bottom.  Suspended in other words.   In a lot of areas the ocean is very deep with mountain ranges like we see across dry land.    The cables float below the shipping channels and move with currents above these undersea mountain ranges.</p></div>		</li>
