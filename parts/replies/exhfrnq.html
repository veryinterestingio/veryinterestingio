			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the advice I give everyone. Clear care is amazing. Dont get the hydroglide version just the regular one. Comes with a case and my contacts never felt better. Also I had a fungal infection from using optifree. It wasnt adequately cleaning my contacts but using clear care I have yet to have an infection. I almost went blind. Bit of ineptitude and lack of research on my part but that definitely woke me up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I wore contacts I found the peroxide based solution to be far more comfortable than anything else. I wore contacts for nearly 20 years and I tried everything in that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely hate the peroxide stuff. Following all directions properly and 10% of the time burning my eyes. Happened multiple times with different bottles and cases, seemingly at random. I moved to dailies.</p></div>		</li>
