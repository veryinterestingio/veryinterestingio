			<div class="markdown"><p>Most car heaters are heated by the engine's coolant.  The engine takes a very long time to heat up because it has so much mass and building an efficient engine means turning more of the energy stored in gas into energy to move the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are newer cars that have an electric heater assist.  When you first start the car the electric heater gives you instant heat until the engine heats up and takes over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be the dumbest question ever and if no one can answer this, that’s totally cool but... why is it called coolant if it’s used to heat things??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It cools the engine by moving heat from the engine to the radiator, the heat produced is a waste product. When you turn your heat &quot;on&quot; you just divert some of that waste heat into the cabin instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re thinking of cold air. The heater uses the heater core. You’re waiting for the friction of the pistons and moving parts to be absorbed by the water running through the cooling jackets which circulate to the heater core that has a blower motor behind it. My car has a water line running by the exhaust speeding up the process. </p></div>		</li>
