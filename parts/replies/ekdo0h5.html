			<div class="markdown"><p>I stopped watching him a while ago. A lot of his videos became too theatrical and I just hate his voice. He makes great content that nobody else is doing but I can’t watch a video where he’s trying so desperately to build suspense and create a story line where there really doesn’t need to be any.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I assumed it was all an on-the-nose gimmick. Like, we all know we’re watching fucking ants so he plays it up to be amusing. Is ironic the right word?</p>
<p>If he’s actually earnestly trying to create drama that’s cringey as fuck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree.  His target audience is early/mid teenagers and his content is literally ants.</p>
<p>He has done an amazing job creating a massive community and his production value is top notch.   Yes, he does try to create drama, but he finds a way to make a 15 to 20 minute video about ants every week.   Every single week.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm getting at is that I appreciate his efforts. </p></div>		</li>
