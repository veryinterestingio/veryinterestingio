			<div class="markdown"><p>As a chef perhaps you'll know more than I do on this, but I've also heard that because the food itself has been heated already, it retains this heat quite well for short periods of time so even letting out some heat from the oven won't significantly cool the food enough to make a significant difference... basically food can continue cooking once it's removed from immediate heat because it's already hot, even if it isn't getting a lot of new heat added. Is this definitely wrong or is there a bit of truth to it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No that’s correct that’s totally a thing it’s called carryover cooking. A good example of this is chicken, people are scared to undercook it so they over cook it. You really wanna pull it at like 162 ish so that it carry over cooks and finishes at 165</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man chicken is a pet peeve of mine! I can cook seasoned chicken breasts in a frying pan with a bit of oil perfectly every time. I had a lot of dry chicken growing up so I was pretty meticulous about getting a feel for not overcooking it, but oven baking is still not as strong a skill for me yet..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya because in a real kitchen like a line or a brigade they will be opening the oven every other minute. It’s not uncommon to have an oven completely full with sauté pans filled with all kinds of different things for hours at a time and everything comes out great. The oven WILL break down eventually from this abuse lol but that’s how it is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can’t speak for all kitchens but yes we will put our sauté range oven on 500 on a busy night because of how much it’s open/how much food is going in. Happens a lot.</p></div>		</li>
