<p>Unfortunately biometrics aren't even as secure as people think. They work similarly to passwords in the way that the device that is using them still has a &quot;value&quot; for your fingerprint that it has to hash and store on a database for it to be able to authenticate you in the future by comparing the fingerprint you are giving it to the one stored in the database. Well these databases are just as susceptible to hacks as databases containing the hashes for your text passwords. The difference is, text passwords can be changed. If the hash for your biometric password is leaked, you can't change your biometrics.</p>
<p>There was a hack of a biometrics company that controlled all the biometric safes for my workplace last year, where tons of biometric data was stolen:</p>

<p>Uh no... first of all, they’re not databases, it’s a chip that’s been designed from the ground up with biometric authentication and security in place. People might’ve heard of this as the “Secure Enclave”. </p>
<p>On iDevices with biometrics, all of the individual bits of data needed to authenticate you are hashed and saved in this chip. To date, since the iPhone 5S came out, no security researcher has been able to crack the encryption or algorithms running on this chip in order to provide authentication. </p>
<p>Further, if you try removing this chip and and placing it in another device to try and crack it, this too actually completely disables it, similarly to how iPhone finger print sensors only work on the first device they shipped with. </p>
<p>Some companies biometric authentication is both very secure and accurate. Others have certainly half-assed their solutions, but don’t blanket statement the entire market.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's unfortunate that this is currently the top upvoted comment because it's not actually correct.</p>
<p>Most modern devices are encrypted by default. Fingerprint matching is imperfect and the logic is managed via software. By their nature, fingerprints (at least today) cannot be used for encryption. If the device is encrypted, then the software for the fingerprint match is encrypted. In order to unencrypt the phone and thus load the fingerprint matching software, you need the pin/password for the device.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More than just that the finger print scanners in phones are often easily defeated so they are really more for convenience than actual security. It's good for keeping your sibling out but someone who actually knows what they are doing can get through in with relative ease. Cracking a decent length pin without brute force?  infintely harder.</p></div>		</li>
