			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very western-centric answer. Almost all rabies (<a href="https://www.who.int/rabies/epidemiology/en/" target="_blank">95% of the 50,000 human cases a year</a>) occurs in Africa and India, and in those countries the disease does persist almost entirely (<a href="https://www.who.int/rabies/epidemiology/en/" target="_blank">99%</a>) through dog-to-dog transmission, not wildlife-to-dog or human.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From phylogenetic trees it is apparent that while rabies spillover events happen and they do quite frequently, they form quite species-specific clusters.</p>
<p>A lot of common strains of rabies were common to dogs, which then serve as the main reservoir for a following human infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a wild guess but if you have a lots of dogs per sq km and maybe lots of stray dogs the infection rate may just be higher that the dying rate.</p></div>		</li>
