			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what part of the nerve is damaged. If the cell body is lost and the neuron dies, it cannot grow back. If only the axon is damaged, the nerve has the ability to repair itself. In this situation, the sensory nerves have cell bodies near the spinal cord (in the dorsal root ganglia) and therefore a skin graft will not damage the neuron cell bodies and regeneration of sensation will be possible but it can take a long time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PhD with thesis focused on single cell wound repair. Almost all cells in your body have a capacity to heal and regenerate. About 20% of the cells in mobile organs like muscles and your heart will have some amount of measurable cellular damage after a workout, but these cells are able to quickly heal and regenerate damaged parts. In contrast, some diseases like muscular dystrophy are caused by either increasing how often cells are damaged or decreasing their wound repair capabilities, leading to long term consequences. PS: very cool about neuron regeneration, I knew they could heal in theory but did not know in practice they could regenerate function like this, e.g. with skin grafts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscience degree here, so the current accepted rule of thumb is that nerves from the Peripheral Nervous system, like sensory nerves in the skin can regenerate. Central nervous system nerves, like brain or spinal cord cells, cannot. There’s a lot of theories as to why, and much of it starts with this idea of the destruction of the cell body. Part of that is because mature nerve cells generally don’t divide and create more cells. Another is that axons in the peripheral nervous system have different myelination, AND they generally don’t connect multiple cells together. By that I mean the nerve that generates the touch sensation in your tip toe is the same long cell that reaches your spinal cord. If this axon is damaged, it can regenerate (slowly) to give you sensation back in your toe. Whereas CNS nerves connect nerve to nerve and it’s very difficult for your body to reconnect severed axons because they don’t know which connection goes to which area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a common conception, and it is true for nerves belonging to the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord, etc.). But the nerves of the peripheral nervous system does posses ability to repair. In case you want to do more reading the key difference is central vs peripheral nervous system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An axon is actually a projection from a single cell body. As u/catharsis724 said, there are single axons in the sciatic nerve bundle that extend over 1m. The cell itself is the neuron, and the axon is a cytoplasmic protrusion from it which can extend very far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. We think of cells as microscopic, but the sciatic nerve--the one that runs from your lower back through your pelvis down to your feet, and is the main nerve for enervating your pelvic, leg, and foot muscles--is about a 3 quarters of an inch thick.</p>
