			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not coincidental. Where I live they saw an increase in narcolepsy in children who had gotten the Pandemrix vaccine.</p>
<p>According to an article I found they are still investigating exactly how it happened but it seems like a virus protein which is in the &quot;Pandemrix&quot; vaccine but not in the &quot;Focteria&quot; vaccine which did not give the Narcolepsy problem is very close to the hormone Hypocretin which regulates sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were increases in narcolepsy diagnoses in non-vaccinated population also so whilst this was suspected it was the vaccine it was not proven scientifically. At least according to the article the original commenter linked. </p>
<p>This article has peaked my interest a lot actually, I'm going to to further digging today when I get off from work. See if I can find a more scientific source. Very interesting. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not because it was rushed. The virus it self caused narcolespy. It was something immunogenic about the virus and therefore components of the virus</p></div>		</li>
