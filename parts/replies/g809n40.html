<p>The first notion of time warping would be Enstein’s theory of <strong>special</strong> relativity which described how time warping, ie. time dilation occurs for objects moving at significant fractions of the speed of light when compared to those that are not. </p>
<p>This was published by Einstein a good 10 years before he generalised the theory to cover the warping of space too, thus giving us a new understanding of gravity. Your description of how the 1919 solar eclipse was used as a proof of general relativity is spot on, there was also some details about the orbit of Mercury that couldn’t be explained by Newtonian gravity but was accounted for under general relativity. This had the benefit of not having to wait 4 years for a solar eclipse!</p></div>		</li>
