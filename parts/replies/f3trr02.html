			<div class="markdown"><p>This is sort of useful, but in all honesty, sleep is better defined as the &quot;idle&quot; of a car engine. the idle of a car engine is actually a commonly used  parallel for the brain during sleep. Not in terms of what sleep does for memory consolidation, neural reinforcement, etc... but in brain wave activity. In fact, the brain activity of REM sleep is almost indistinguishable from an awake brain. So your brain is actually very active during sleep. So likening it to a car being turned off isn't really accurate. It's more like a car at idle, if idling gave the car the ability to tune up and repair itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why does your car continue to wear and age if left running but parked in the driveway and not moving versus a car shut off in the same driveway?</p>

<p>I wouldn't naturally assume this either lol.</p></div>		</li>
