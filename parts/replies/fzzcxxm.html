			<div class="markdown"><p>DARPA is several years into developing new methods to radically cut down the time to develop new vaccines. Why DARPA? Because they were concerned about new viruses being used in biological warfare.</p>
<p>I believe that DARPA tech contributed to the Moderna vaccine based on this story: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/how-a-secretive-pentagon-agency-seeded-the-ground-for-a-rapid-coronavirus-cure/2020/07/30/ad1853c4-c778-11ea-a9d3-74640f25b953_story.html" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/how-a-secretive-pentagon-agency-seeded-the-ground-for-a-rapid-coronavirus-cure/2020/07/30/ad1853c4-c778-11ea-a9d3-74640f25b953_story.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now, it's going through a combined Phase II/III trials. They're looking for potential side effects in patients and to make sure it's safe when given to a larger group of people than you'd get in Phase I. They also make sure the vaccine is effective, and how effective it is. You don't really want a vaccine for a deadly virus that expires in a few months, if at all. This is the last stage of testing before releasing it to the general public, and will probably take a few months. Maybe January, maybe a bit earlier but then you're rushing to get it out there, which can be very dangerous.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they'll continue to monitor the vaccine for any issues that come up, maybe some people have an allergic reaction for whatever reason, or it's not safe during a pregnancy... </p>
<p>Tl;dr: it's pretty far along, they're checking it's safety and effectiveness, next stage is public release, but is probably still a few months awway</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there aren't any cold vaccine because there are more than 200 different viruses that cause a cold and they all mutate super quickly. making and keeping up to date a vaccine for every single one of them is quite frankly not worth it when you consider how minor a common cold is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SARS died out entirely before any vaccines could be completed.  MERS is rare enough that vaccine development wasn't rushed...but some of the work done on MERS has been applied here.  The common cold coronaviruses are mild enough and infrequent enough that there's no demand for a vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
