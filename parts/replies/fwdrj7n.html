			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. In this case by &quot;shouldn't take more than a millisecond&quot; i meant that it's done before you notice it. But in this case it's a bit confusing, because pings and connections are also expressed in milliseconds. </p>
<p>I edited it to &quot;a few milliseconds&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true but the algorithms I'm familiar aren't so slow that a user would experience a delay of several seconds. The time taken to hash is probably a negligible component of this process. They're only slow enough to make brute force attacks unfeasible, not slow enough that a single call would take a noticeable time.</p></div>		</li>
