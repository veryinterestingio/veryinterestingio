			<div class="markdown"><p>Your question is valid but I feel like it misses the point. I'm sure that any light stretching routine would work as well as any other. Light stretching is a placeholder that could be filled with a variety of things so long as it is consistent. You could replace it with drinking a cup of Chamomile Tea or reading for 30 minutes. The goal being that you build up a Pavlovian response that connects the activity to being tired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This exact conditioning has ruined certain aspects of life for me. I spent so many years reading before bed that now any sort of leisure reading or studying immediately puts me to sleep. </p>
<p>So basically, if you enjoy reading as a leisure activity, or you are a student. Try to avoid reading before bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This stranger has the correct information. Do the same thing before bed enough times and you're good. Thats why guys probably fall asleep after sex. They jerk off before bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Really the whole point is to teach your brain signals that it’s time for bed. Along with this routine, I’m also only supposed to use the bed for 2 things - sleeping and the fun stuff with my wife. Otherwise, the brain associates the bed with work, tv, video games, etc... and so it gets mixed signals when you get into bed to sleep. Your brain is trying to prep for a bunch of different things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here is the stretch routine. I’m a 30 year old guy so I had a solid laugh with my therapist and wife over this. Funny story - I was getting my iPhone upgraded the day after I got this routine and they did the data transfer to my new phone. The apple employee (female) then said, “cool let’s check and make sure everything transferred”, and opened my pics. The first thing to pop up was a giant thumbnail of the nighttime goddess stretch. I didn’t even explain myself, I figured they’ve seen weirder things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a lot of times I'll wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble getting back to sleep, and the thing that helps the most is getting up to go to the bathroom. Once I get back, my spot in the bed has cooled off, and I can start over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on the opposite side of this, I struggled with sleep disorders my entire adult life, one of the problems is that whenever I start feeling sleepy I have to sleep wherever I was at that moment, on the couch, sitting on my desk, in the kitchen, wherever... if I get up and go to my bed I would immediately feel awake and I will not sleep under any circumstance, So this stretching is a big no for me.
What did work for me though, is using my phone while in bed for a short amount of time with one eye closed and a blue light filter active.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahah I’m the same with the one eye open on my phone! I usually try to read a nice Reddit post that will leave me feeling like if I end there, it’s the perfect ending and best place to stop. Like having the perfect last bite.</p></div>		</li>
