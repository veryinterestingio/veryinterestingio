<p>In some cases, a lot more than that. I'm 46 and most days I don't consider myself a &quot;functional adult.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I know a lot of people are going to read this and think: <em>It's amazing that something so stupid can be so successful!</em></p>
<p>Let's rephrase that. How many times have you, by reflex alone, managed to swat a fly? Not by using a swatter, or trying to trap one or lying in wait, mind you; how often do you actually kill a fly when you're trying to get your own shit done? If you're being realistic, it's probably a pretty small number.</p>
<p>The fly doesn't <em>need</em> fear. Unless you stop what you're doing and turn killing that fly into a task in and of itself, nothing's going to happen to it. It can pull all of those crazy aerobatics because it doesn't even know that failure is something that can happen to it. The fly doesn't consider it. The fly knows what it wants, and every waking moment is going to be spent pursuing that goal because it does not give a fuck about you or anything that you'll do to stop it.</p>
<p>And I think that's neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago I was with some friends at a Lake Michigan beach. There was a particularly aggressive fly, and after getting bit for the 4th or 5th time decided just shooing it wasn't enough.  </p>
<p>I prefer not to kill things, so I grabbed it, dug a hole in the sand, dropped the fly in, and covered it back up--basically a time-out. After about 45 minutes when we were ready to leave I let the fly out, and it took off in a hurry without stopping to land on anybody.  </p>
<p>I like to think that fly actually learned something from it's time-out, even if it only stuck for a few minutes.</p></div>		</li>
