			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple reasons. First, some drugs (including serotonin) can’t make it from the pill to your brain because of the blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain from harmful chemicals and microbes. For instance, straight dopamine pills don’t help people with Parkinson’s but the prodrug L-dopa can enter the brain, be converted into dopamine, and reduce their symptoms. The equivalent with serotonin is 5HTP. Second, some drugs, especially drugs that mess with fundamental brain chemicals like dopamine and serotonin (think cocaine, heroin) are dangerous and often only available through prescription or illegally. Serotonin syndrome occurs when people have too mich serotonin in their brain, and it can kill.</p></div>		</li>
