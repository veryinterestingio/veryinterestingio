			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that earthquakes have some periodicity to them in the typical earthquake zones.  I’m no geologist, but doesn’t pressure slowly build up until it overcomes whatever resistance, releasing as an earthquake?  When exactly that happens and at what intensity is highly random, but they <em>will</em> happen, and this would show as a non-random portion of the distribution.</p>
<p>A flood doesn’t have this pressure mechanic, so those are effectively random / Poisson distributions...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some level of periodicity, and this is what is being captured (to a certain extent) with the recurrence interval, but there's also a lot of stochasticity and interactions that push fault systems away from truly perioidic behavior. Probably the simplest example is in a classic demonstration/lab for kids, i.e. <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/ANGLE/educational_materials/activities/205290.html" target="_blank">the earthquake machine</a>. Earthquakes represent stored strain energy overcoming the frictional resistance of a fault, so a super simple simulation of that is pulling a block of wood over a piece of sand paper and tracking the motion of the block through time. Even if you scale this up and make it closer to reality and set up a little motor to pull the block at a constant rate (as faults tend to experience constant rates of motion on either side) and put a spring in between the block and the motor so that some elastic limit needs to be overcome before the block 'feels' a pull (as the crust behaves elastically), the block of wood will not displace the same amount in each 'earthquake' and the time between each 'earthquake' will not be the same because of variation in the frictional behavior of the wood and sandpaper sheet (i.e. neither of them is perfectly uniform). This variation in frictional strength along a fault plane and incomplete release of stored energy (i.e. the earthquake may not release all the stored strain) alone are enough to expect some amount of variability in magnitudes and times between earthquakes, but add in things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_stress_transfer" target="_blank">Coulomb stress transfer</a> where an earthquake on one fault changes the stress on another fault, etc, and it becomes clear, quickly, why earthquakes are not truly periodic even if the rate of strain accumulation from plate motion / fault block motion is constant. Also it becomes clear why 'predicting' earthquakes is a fraught exercise.</p>
<p>Floods are much closer to random, but even they are not truly random. Things like antecedent soil moisture are incredibly important. For example, imagine a scenario where you have a big rainstorm but this doesn't generate a flood because the soil was dry and a lot of the rainfall just infiltrated the soil and didn't enter the streams quickly. Then you have another big rainstorm a few days later and because the soil is already saturated from the last rain storm, this water flows quickly into the streams and does cause a flood. If that second rainstorm had occurred just a little later, after the soil moisture had time to decrease again, then there might not have been a flood. Thus, the probability of a flood occurring actually is linked to the probability of rainstorms and the details of their duration and timing between storm events (along with a whole host of other properties of the system). Similarly, if stream flow is highly seasonal (e.g. maybe a stream is fed mainly by snowmelt so it has very low flow in the fall and winter and high flow in the spring and early summer) then the same rainstorm happening in different times of the year effectively have different probabilities of initiating a flood. What that all means is that there is strictly not a single probability of a flood of a given magnitude. So we could say something like &quot;There is a 0.1% probability of a flood of X magnitude occurring an any day, but there is a 1% probability of a flood of X magnitude occurring on any day within 5 days of rainfall event that lasted Y hours&quot; etc. On multi-year time scales, a lot of this kind of averages out and we can characterize most of the behavior of floods as a purely stochastic process (and in detail, we can account for some of the influences above by the exact way we represent the probability distribution of floods and how these vary from place to place, specifically how we treat the 'tail' of the distribution and the shape of this tail).</p></div>		</li>

Just that every year there is roughly a one in 100 million chance it happens. It could happen 2 years in a row if you’re unlucky enough. </p>
<p>Certain things do have a “sort” of periodicy. Like volcanoes erupt because of build up pressure so while you wouldn’t set your watch by it, it isn’t a fixed chance daily either. The chance of eruption would increase yearly as the pressure builds in the right type of volcano.</p></div>		</li>
