			<div class="markdown"><p>The sliding portion is important because as you throw this heavy object you want things to have a continuous forward motion. If you have a rubber soles that create friction and stop you the likeliness your ball gets stopped/slowed goes up. If you are still moving forward as the ball is leaving your fingers it doesn't lose as much momentum.  </p>
<p>Or maybe not I don't bowl this is a total assumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much the ball as your body. The slide kills your momentum in a controlled way.</p>
<p>The &quot;normal&quot; way of bowling, you walk forward as you swing the ball, ending on one foot; the ball mostly just swings on your arm. When you do it right it makes for a very smooth delivery. But that walking gives you forward momentum - you can't just stop dead. The slide kills your momentum under control.</p>
<p>If the shoe suddenly grips too much instead (which sometimes happens the first couple of times you approach the line, if they haven't been worn for a while, or even you just aren't warmed up and your technique is off) - you'll be lucky if (a) you stay on your feet, and (b) the ball stays out of the gutter. Sneakers would have the same effect.</p>
<p>(Only one foot actually slides; if you buy your own shoes, you'll only have a slide sole on that one.)</p></div>		</li>
