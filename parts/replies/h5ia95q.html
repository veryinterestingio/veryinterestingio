			<div class="markdown"><p>Pitching is definitely one of those supraphysiologic activities. When a pitcher gets sore, their mechanics change, and that can lead to injury. So if they are noticing soreness, tightness, discomfort, mechanical changes, or premature fatigue, then I think staying ahead of it with icing can help prevent those symptoms from progressing to actual injury. If a pitcher is not experiencing any soreness, discomfort, etc, and is showing no signs of progressing towards injury, I donâ€™t think you need to do it just because.
I also tell pitchers not to pitch through pain. Soreness/tightness is one thing, but never pain. And if symptoms are persisting beyond 24-36 hours after stopping, they likely need some days off, to stop the injury cascade. </p>
<p>I do think pitchers should stay on a regular strengthening regimen, core work, hips, in addition to just the classic shoulder and scapular strength, to make sure they have a sturdy kinetic chain linking their lower extremity to upper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it really depends a lot on what they do <em>after</em> icing it. If they keep training just as hard, using icing to ignore escalating symptoms, then icing might be making it worse. If they use icing as part of a recovery and training regimen designed to prevent injury, it could help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can speak to this a bit. Not in medicine at all. But I have had back surgery. I had a ruptured disk and a bulging disk pressing on my spinal nerve and rubbing it into bone etc.</p>
<p>Ice 100% helped and I had to ice every 10 mins for 10 mins all day to reduce swelling, as less swelling meant less pressure on the nerve and less pain, and less damage.</p>
<p>So I suppose it depends on the case but in mine. It was definitely a positive</p></div>		</li>
