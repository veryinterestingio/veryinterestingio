			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a video game, but the tabletop game Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a 1vMany PvP campaign. 1 player controls the Empire, and a group of other players control the Rebel Alliance. Whomever &quot;wins&quot; the mission gets bonuses for the next stage in the campaign.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that was a problem in the tabletop games too.  If the winner ends up in a better position, so that it's easier for them to win the next match and so on then it snowballs and isn't fun.</p>
<p>Imperium had a neat mechanic for that.  During the peacetime between engagements, the winner's government would be more confident and lax, so they'd stand down more of the military forces, while the loser's government would be determined not to let that happen again, so they could preserve more force and end up more evenly-balanced for the next game.  So winning a game put you in a better position strategically (more colonies/worlds conquered) but tactically, you'd start the next game with a disadvantage.  You had to balance that over the campaign.  It's rare where that sort of thing would fit into a game's design though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all.  One side winning simply moves the battle map in the direction of their goal.  The PvP mode in General Chaos for the Sega Genesis had this structure in their single player, co-op and VS modes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that early war games were designed and used by militaries in Europe to train officers. That is why war games used the term Campaign.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Also, it is contrasted by the fact that most multiplayer is generally not a series of objectives like a campaign, but episodic engagements unrelated to each other.</p></div>		</li>
