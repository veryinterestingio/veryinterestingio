			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Cassini has several options for its EoM. They could have escaped into interplanetary space, but that would have dramatically reduced the science output (it basically would have become a deep space weather station). They could have put it into a stable high orbit around Saturn, but again compromised the science output, or they could do what they chose: initiate the proximal orbits between Saturn and the rings (allowing direct measurement of the rings) but that would result in the eventual destruction of the spacecraft.</p>
<p>Other options included directly crashing it into the rings or minor moons, but these didnâ€™t guarantee full destruction.</p>
<p>This was necessitated because the status of the moon Enceladus was upgraded based on Cassini itself discovering and flying through the guyser plumes emanating from it.</p></div>		</li>
