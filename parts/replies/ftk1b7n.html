			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been retired for over a year now. I go to bed or take a nap when I feel tired. When I wake up, I get up (don't just roll over and try to sleep more). My sleep schedule is not regular at all. I love it.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning I went to sleep at 5:30 am, woke up at 10am, took a nap from 4pm to 7pm.  Been awake since then, it's now 4am and I'm watching a movie. </p>
<p>Tomorrow might be totally different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly I can't wait for retirement for this exact reason, just enjoying life on your own terms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah if you can sleep undisturbed until you wake up normally I don't think it's a big deal.</p>
<p>Most people have all sorts of outside factors work/school/family members that dictate when they have to be awake so that's why a fixed schedule is the recommended strategy. Just sleeping whenever is nice if you can pull it off though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He was told he had to be in bed in his room for 23:00 en get out at 07:00 no matter what. Even if he’s up all night, or if he’s sleepy during the day.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done this. I was having an awful time of sleep so at first I was entirely nocturnal. I used two weeks of moving my bedtime by an hour to get myself on a normal schedule (for a day) and then followed that rule. </p>
<p>It took a few days but it worked. Went to sleep at 11pm and woke up at 5 or 6 with no alarm and wide awake. </p>
<p>The problem is I wanted to go to a party once and stay up past eleven. Well I fell asleep on the couch at the party by midnight and my sleeping pattern was fucking ruined. Couldn't get it back on track. </p>
<p>...now I just live my life tired. I don't have the time to do the reset again. Regardless if I don't do a slow reset back around to the right hours then I go to bed at 11 and sit awake until 2-3 and wake up at 7 almost crying because I'm so tired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about that, If I want to wake up at like 8 am I just tell my self repeatedly that I want to wake up at 8 am in my mind for 1 or 2 minutes straight and if I go to sleep a little earlier than I do (normally it's like FRIGGIN 3 am) there's a big chance imma wake up at 8 am.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people actually have longer or shorter circadian rhythm days. This is very common in blind people, I think I read 60-70% plus.</p>
<p>This basically means your body doesn't product melatonin and start prepping you for sleep at the same expected time every day. If you are on a 26 hour circadian rhythm then your sleep time will be offset by two hours every night and you will slowly rotate your sleep schedule.</p>
<p>Those who have this condition have reported better sleep and health just going with the flow in this case. You CAN treat it but it is a combination of melatonin and might therapy daily which your cannot stop without risking the offset returning.</p>
<p>Just as an FYI for three majority of people out there. If you have a healthy diet and get enough activity then your body should regulate your sleepiness with some regularity. Those who report not being able to get sleepy are most of often those with either poor diet (too much sugar, coffee, eating large meals late, etc), not enough exercise, too much stimulation from screens and electronics. These are the common factors that inhibit sleep. Mental illness and physical issues are still factors after ruling the above out.</p>
<p>If you have trouble sleeping, choosing a regular bedtime does help reinforce your bodies natural function to regulate your sleep as the commenter above stated. Eating balanced diet, little bit of exercise, and cutting back on screens in the last couple hours should also be priorities if you are having trouble.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Literally me. I cycle from normal to full nocturnal at an almost weekly rate. For a while I was on a 30hrs awake, 14hrs asleep cycle. I do not feel healthier for it at all, I feel like my heart is gonna give out in the next 10 years because being awake for 24hrs+ does stupid amounts of dmg to it.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yep. This is called non-24 rhythm.</p>
<p>There is also irregular sleep/wake phase where there is no circadian rhythm and you basically have the sleep schedule of a newborn where you sleep for a couple hours then wake up for a couple hours and rinse and repeat with no actual adherence to any sort of normal sleep/wake cycle. It’s pretty rare but most common in the blind, people with dementia and people who have had traumatic brain injuries.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with this last year. I was tired all the time and unable to keep a job or have any sort of social life because I couldn’t stay awake for more than three or four hours at a time. It’s terrible.</p>
<p>My doctor has me sticking to a strict schedule where I go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day (even weekends), plus melatonin at night and sunlight when I wake up. I’m not fully fixed, but I’m making progress.</p></div>		</li>
