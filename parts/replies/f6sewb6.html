			<div class="markdown"><p>This raises another question I've had for some time... Gravity is considered a force, but it's just a warping of spacetime, why is gravity lumped in with all the other forces when, its just bumps in reality?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion, the other answers to your question so far haven't been quite right. You're right to notice something funny.</p>
<p>Gravity is in some senses a force like the others (even to the extent that we can model it as being propagated by &quot;gravitons&quot;, much like we can model the electromagnetic force as being propagated by &quot;photons&quot;), but in other senses it is a different kind of thing. Physicists don't yet have a good resolution to this, though there are attempts.</p>
<p>&quot;Bumps in reality&quot; (as you put it) can be thought of as variations in the &quot;geometry field&quot;, while the EM force (for example) can be thought of as (being mediated by) variations in the EM potential field. But, you might ask, if the geometry field defines the shape of reality itself, what's the underlying reality it exists on?</p>
<p>One natural approach would be simply to fix a base geometry and view gravity as a perturbation of that geometry, but that has a number of problems: for one, you can't answer &quot;cosmological&quot; questions systematically in this way; for another, this perturbative approach doesn't play very well with quantum field theory (string theory, loop quantum gravity, and some other ideas try to make this work, but these are incomplete projects).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In physics the thing that matters is potential and kinetic energy, not the forces. The forces are just manifestations of the change in energy. Since two massive objects in space have potential energy relative to one another, we say there is a force of gravity acting on them. </p>
<p>The same is true with other forces. There are electric and magnetic potentials, and the change in those potentials is what determined the electromagnetic forces, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a force in exactly the same sense it is a field which propagates with the speed of light  generally pulling things towards it. Reason why you usually don't see it in calculations or interactions with smaller particles is due to it being so weak that the chances of it are usually disregarded. But of course it is a force in just the same sense as any other. It even slows down time. Now the warp is a consequense of this field much like you would have a magnet attracting a metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know enough about it to understand it unfortunately, I just can't shake the feeling that gravity isn't a force, merely a consequence of the presence of mass.</p>
<p>I understand my feeling is undoubtedly incorrect, but still.</p></div>		</li>
