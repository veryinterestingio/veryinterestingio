			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the question. You are very right about that. We’ve been working very hard to identify every potential choke point and limiting factor – in vaccines its both the raw materials and the very specialized lab equipment used to make them. We have some powerful tools at our disposal as the Federal Government in the Defense Production Act, which lets us put “priority ratings” on things, to ensure we get what we or our private sector partners need, or even do “industrial expansion” which lets us help build new plants or manufacturing lines when there isn’t enough of something. Some of the recent actions we have announced like the ones on Friday are targeted at very specific parts of the process, such as vaccine filling pumps and things called “tangential flow filtration skids.” So far, thankfully, one particular area has not caused any major bottlenecks but we continue to monitor all up and down the supply chain. And to your other question, industry has been extremely committed toward working together and around the clock to make this happen. Everyone knows how important this is.  -- TM</p></div>		</li>
