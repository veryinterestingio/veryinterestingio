			<div class="markdown"><p>When you’re laying on the couch you’re relaxing. There’s no expectations. When you’re in the bed it’s hurry up and go to sleep I have to get up for work soon. The expectation can cause anxiety and the anxiety of course leads to restlessness. In short, stupid brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the OP, as my psychiatry professor said - the bedroom is for sleeping and making love, so if at all possible you should have your screens(TV/computer) in a different room, avoid browsing your phone before bed and don't read off anything backlit.</p>
<p>If you do this your brain will automatically go to sleep mode when you actually go to bed and you'll have less trouble falling asleep.</p>
<p>You can also try sleep genius app, it features &quot;sleep music&quot; apparently developed by NASA with some neuroscientists and the vibrations are supposed to make you sleepy. I have tried it a few times (it is paid tho, a pirates life for me, personally) and it put me out in 10 mins even when not that sleepy.</p>
<p>Edit - obligatory im typing this at 3am, in bed when i should be sleeping, so i am not the best example myself.</p>
<p>Edit2: Coffee has a half-life of 6 hours, avoid drinking strong caffeinated beverages in the second part of the day.</p>
<p>Edit3: some extra info regarding the app <a href="https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2015/hm_2.html" target="_blank">https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2015/hm_2.html</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>There's one called <a href="https://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/" target="_blank">Sleep With Me</a> (which I actually don't like). My favourites are history podcasts - <em>this dude-with-a-long name</em> killed <em>that dude-with-a-long-name</em>, who then had three children called Arthur, Martha and Bill, who...

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a caffeine note: If you're a smoker the half life can be cut by upto 50% compared to a none smoker. So if the half life is 6 hours a smokers could only be 3!!!

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sure fire method to fall asleep is to count backwards from 300 by threes. 300, 297, 294...etc. </p>
<p>I think its sort of like meditation technique where you shut the brain off from thinking about stuff you did or need to do, which can keep you awake. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Another interesting fact though is that if you do your work on your bed a lot your brain begins to start getting used to your bed as a work station rather than a resting place. Thus when you try to sleep your brain will be confused about why you’re sleeping at your workspace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you use your couch to watch your TV and play games, the same thing beds are used for with bedroom TVs and smartphones.</p></div>		</li>
