			<div class="markdown"><p>Creatures can also come to be dependent on the waste of others.  Once there wasn't so much free oxygen on the planet but the metabolism of lots of early organisms produced tons of waste O2.  It eventually provoked an oxygen crisis over the whole planet but gave a boost to organisms that (now) need oxygen to live, like us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nitrogen cycle is a critical step in setting up a new aquarium, too, both freshwater and saltwater varieties. </p>
<p>Before adding fish, you spend weeks cultivating nitrogenous bacteria in the tank. Eventually, a well established tank will quickly convert ammonia into nitrite and nitrite into nitrate. </p>
<p>Nitrate itself only becomes dangerous to aquarium fish in very high concentrations (50+ ppm). So you remove excess nitrate with weekly partial water changes. </p>
<p>But wait! There’s more!</p>
<p>Most aquarists opt for live aquatic plants in their tanks. These aquatic plants not only look beautiful, but will gobble up excess nitrate, as N is an important macronutrient for plant growth. </p>
<p>Owning aquariums will teach you a ton about aquatic biology as well as water (pH, GH, KH, TDS, etc).</p></div>		</li>

I respect those who do, for me it's something I love to look at and like to hear the process and science about it but don't need to have one.</p></div>		</li>
