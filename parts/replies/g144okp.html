			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting source! It definitely suprises me that there would be a receptor that requires the presence of both constituents of NaCl to trigger a response rather than the mixed response caused by simultaneous Na+ and Cl- receptor triggers, since receptors within my knowledge only have a single signal molecule site for triggering a response. Even more surprising is the dual action response of TAS1R1 and 3 to trigger a taste from a single signal molecule (glutamate) , which is something quite novel for me. Thank you for your detailed response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even stranger than this, because they'd done knock out genes on mice (where they remove certain proteins) and even without some of these proteins they still elicit a response. </p>
<p>So that means they aren't JUST those things. It's like they are 'best' at those things, but the rest are just a little bit receptive to them. Enzyme promiscuity is strange. Some enzymes only work with a single chemical, others with an entire class of chemicals, others yet are just charge, and others are rough 'shape' of a chemical. There's a LOT of interesting bits of chemistry going on in that kind of research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc the ENaC is very selective for Na and doesn’t really care which negative ions are present. I remember there being some evidence for another channel that was not selective (or at least allowed both Na+ and K+ ions) and graded its response based on the size of the negative ions present. All this is to say that the more sodium specifically is present, the saltier a thing will taste. This is modified to a smaller degree by the presence of other ions, but we really don’t know enough at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look into sucrochemistry. The interaction between water and sucrose to breakdown into fructose and glucose is very weird. You require an acidic environment but water is amphoteric, so it would take an eternity for the reaction to occur because water is just small enough to fit in a specific gap on sucrose to catalyze the reaction. (As hydronium)</p>
<p>The perfect programs, our DNA. The perfect gears, our proteins and enzymes. The perfect electricity, our water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes a lot of sense that these exist though since controlling sodium intake is crucial for how much we stress our bodies to maintain homeostasis (especially kidneys and vascular systems) so being able to distinctly tell how salty something is makes a huge difference in overall fitness (and most naturally occurring sodium in human diets at least is (and has been) NaCl for a very long time.  It makes perfect sense we’ve retained redundancies and have multiple sensory mechanisms for detecting its presence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glutamate is a common neurotransmitter, it is not at all surprising receptors would be present on the tongue. If anything it would be surprising if it did not affect the taste.</p></div>		</li>

For me it's a totally different taste, I don't like it at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a direct answer, but potassium and sodium ions have different permeabilities through neuron cell membranes, so it's very plausible that the taste system can distinguish between the two</p></div>		</li>
