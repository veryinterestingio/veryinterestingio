			<div class="markdown"><p>They can't cancel out because only one of them is valid depending on how you choose to analyze the problem.</p>
<p>Imagine a ball hits a train, instead of a photon hitting a mirror, because speed of light and stuff.</p>
<p>If you decide the ball is moving away from the train and the train catches up with it and gives it a bump, then the train is giving the ball extra energy. You could also use a different reference frame where the ball is chasing the train, catches up with it and gives the train a bump, so the ball gives the train extra energy. Somewhere in between is one where no energy is transferred.</p>
<p>It is surprising, but true, that energy can be different in different reference frames (even different inertial ones). Still, all the equations work out in every reference frame. Also note that the <em>momentum</em> exchange is the same in every reference frame (including non-inertial ones, I think).</p></div>		</li>
