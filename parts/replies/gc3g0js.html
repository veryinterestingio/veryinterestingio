			<div class="markdown"><p>Using this information, you can actually shorten the URL as OP suggested. Just use <code>tbm=isch</code> to search for images and <code>q=adorable</code> to search for adorable. Thus you get the URL <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=adorable" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=adorable" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=adorable</a></a> which works as intended.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For exampl this amp link.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's called Accelerated Mobile Pages, and the idea behind it is to make certain news publisher websites load faster when you're on mobile. </p>
<p>There are a lot of problems with it though... publishers essentially have to use it if they want their articles to show up at the top of the results, but it limits how their websites can be built and it basically means all of the traffic to those URLs are going to Google rather than NYTimes etc, etc.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Iirc, it doesn't <em>directly</em> increase the ranking, but does so indirectly via faster load times and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a link for a page enhanced with a Google service called <a href="https://developers.google.com/amp" target="_blank">AMP: Accelerated Mobile Pages.</a> This is a framework provided by Google to greatly enhance the performance delivery of web content, and content is often cached directly on the google servers. Hence the reason you're seeing it preceded by Google's domain.</p>
<p>AMP has, of course, proved <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/01/10/enclosure-vs-expedience.html" target="_blank">controversial.</a></p></div>		</li>
