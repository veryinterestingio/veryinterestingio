			<div class="markdown"><p>See, this is what I thought, too. Until a MD explained it can’t be compared like that. Kind of like the differences in mg on two similar types of ssri’s. They’re the same type of drug, but the dosing is different for each. Am I correct in thinking this? </p>
<p>Btw I had moderna in the beginning of feb and had some severe side effects I was NOT expecting at all. Still have some residual neurological pain in my hands. Am I happy I got the vaxx? Hell yeah. It makes me think if I would have gotten the covid it would not have been pretty for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you can't really compare them directly like that but there is still going to be a correlation. It's a little different than ssris that may have different targets but both mrnas here are very similar and target the same fusion spike protein with overlapping sequences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it because it's related to the science behind the vaccine rather than the vaccine itself?</p>
<p>Why them and not the person behind making of Sputnik V, their vaccine is the first one and its efficacy is very similar to Modern/Pfizer too. Or AstraZeneca and others. You get my point.</p>
<p>I took the Pfizer shot myself, I am not here to spread rivalry, I'm just curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because Sputnik V is just a regular old-fashioned vaccine like the one from AstraZeneca.</p>
<p><em>If</em> these two get a Nobel prize, it would be for discovering a whole new class of vaccines that theoretically also allow to vaccinate yourself against stuff like cancer. (That's actually the main topic biontech was doing research on before covid-19 hit).</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are replication deficient viral vector vaccines. Not your traditional vaccine with an inactivated or live-attenuated virus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While Sputnik actually seems like a good vaccine it should be noted that so far not everything is fully verified by reliable sources outside Russia.</p></div>		</li>
