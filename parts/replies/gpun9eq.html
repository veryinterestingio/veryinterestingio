			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a quickie summary of current vaccines (MSR), they include the outer shell (spike proteins) with no harmful DNA included.</p>
<p>The body is given the opportunity to recognise the shape of the virus so our antibodies can attach to the specific spike protein shape and thus the actual virus in the future. However, with no harmful DNA contained within the shell, there is no risk of actual infection.</p>
<p>I think of it as showing someone a counterfeit $5 bill. They will know not to accept a bill specifically like that in the future without having to get duped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, great clarification! The vaccine doesn't lead to what we consider &quot;infection.&quot; But still loads the immune system.</p>
<p>And actually with these mRNA vaccines, we don't even get exposed to the virus at all. It's like getting the instructions for making the counterfeit $5 bill, instead of the bill itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just reading up on mRNA vaccines (I  wasn't even aware the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were avalable!). I seem to recall that a future goal is to have tailor-made &quot;vaccines&quot; to teach a cancer patient's immune system to target malignant cells in their body.</p>
<p>If that's the case, it would be a huge advancement from chemotherapy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting. Why then, do many people who get the vaccine report some symptoms (e.g. flu like symptoms)? Is it sort of like this:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>(1) we put a ton of empty &quot;virus shapes&quot; into the body, </p>
<p>(2) the body's immune system recognizes that this is an unusual shape and it's plentiful and needs to be destroyed, and learns how to create antibodies</p>
<p>(3) The body's immune response includes not only the antibodies but the ancillary symptoms (aches, fever, etc.). Intense symptoms imply an intense effort to destroy the shape, so in that sense the the &quot;symptoms&quot; are a sign that the right kind of body response is happening.</p>
<p>(4) There isn't any significant &quot;true risk&quot; to the patient because the virus isn't really present and therefore can't replicate. There is a &quot;fixed number&quot; of empty virus shapes for the body to kill, and it can't go any higher.</p>
<p>Any clarifications would be helpful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a great clarification. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Mine was the way a guy I knew (who got a ton of speeding tickets in a short while, thus losing his license) kept getting &quot;profiled&quot;, until his car got impounded : <strong><em>His wheels had colored caps</em></strong> (each a different color). They were ugly and it was <strong><em>obvious it was his car.</em></strong> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The immune system gets the information about the &quot;caps&quot; of the virus, profiles it and targets it.</p></div>		</li>
