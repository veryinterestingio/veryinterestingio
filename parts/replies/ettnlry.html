			<div class="markdown"><p>Via u/turanga__leela's response to earlier comment about increased breast cancer risk:<br />
&quot;This is not 100% true. It is linked to slightly higher rates, not significantly higher rates, but not because estrogen causes breast cancer.</p>
<p>Our body ends up with irregular cells, or cancer cells, every day. But we have defense mechanisms, specific antibodies, that destroy those cells. When it comes to breast cancer there are types of cancer cells that have estrogen receptors on them. These cancers are made to grow larger by estrogen, but are not caused by estrogen. So when a woman is taking estrogen (whether birth control or on estrogen for treating menopause symptoms) it basically 'feeds' those cancer cells to multiply and it becomes bigger than our bodies naturally defense system can handle. It also often makes the cancer grow more rapidly than it normally would,8 leading to it being discovered when the mass is palpable or more advanced.</p>
<p>Source: I'm a mammographer and work in the diagnosis of breast cancer.This is a simplified explanation but if you just look up 'estrogen receptor positive breast cancers' you can learn more or get a more detailed explanation.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very slight increase yes.
But there's more risk particularly after menopause because you're putting back in estrogen when there shouldn't be any, which adds to the naturally increasing rate as you get older.</p></div>		</li>
