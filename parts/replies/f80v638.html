			<div class="markdown"><p>It also really helps if the store offers a service rather than a product:  laundromats, arcades, hair salons, cell phone repair, massage parlors etc make good candidates because it is very hard to prove the number of customers or how much they actually spent.</p>
<p>You can do it with an ordinary business but then you have to always be very careful with cost of goods and inventory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your main risk is that someone gets greedy and tries to have it both ways.</p>
<p>For example to actually buy those hotdogs (or at least produce a receipt showing that you did) and the buns, packaging etc all have to sort of align.  There might be a temptation to just buy the receipt but now you're counting on your &quot;supplier&quot; to be just as careful as you are.  Or you may actually buy everything but the guy supposed to dispose of it decides to make a little on the side. If anyone turns out to be a bit less clever than they think then suddenly the crown/DA has a lovely paper trail to work with.</p>
<p>Better to just go to a casino and &quot;win&quot; a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less. If you pay your taxes appropriately and do not go completely overboard on the inflated amount compared to prior years, the likelihood of someone looking into the business without some other motivation (like a tipoff) is fairly low. </p>
<p>Art is also very good for money laundering since the art &quot;market&quot; does not do price discovery in the same way as markets that follow supply/demand closely; you can overpay for your accomplice's crappy art and, because art's value is pretty arbitrary, there is very little reason to investigate (again unless you do something aberrant or someone tries to expose you). There was a good post on this, specifically, last week (?), but I cannot find it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Casinos are also a good way to launder money. You buy chips with the illegal money one day and thus sell the chips back at a different day. Or if the criminal organization owns the casino, they can just buy the chips with the dirty money and the caniso reports it as profit.</p>
<p>This is typically easier to launder money this way since if an audit is done, there is a paper trail that looks legit. While other means, some of the money won't add up. This is why there are typically laws in place to limit the amount of transactions or if they go over a certain amount, the casino is to report it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I robbed a bank and got away clean, but tried to just deposit 100k into my savings accouny, someones gonna look into it and put the pieces together </p>
<p>I launder it through a business, they take a percentage, and now I have 'earned' that money and I can trace it back to my 'job' at massage and swords + discount warehouse</p></div>		</li>
