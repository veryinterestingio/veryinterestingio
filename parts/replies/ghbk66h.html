			<div class="markdown"><p>The surface of the Sun does move due to acoustic waves propagating through the Sun. I'm not sure if they're exactly what you were imagining, but they're pretty close. The study of those waves is helioseismology. One way to conceptualize them is like a ringing bell. You know a tuning fork rings with a single tone, a single frequency, but a bell has a different sound because there is a mix of many frequencies that give it the particular quality. The Sun is like that too. It 'rings' with many frequencies (it has a power spectrum of frequencies). Just as the way a bell rings depends on the structure of the bell, the way the Sun 'rings' depends on its structure, too, so helioseismology is a way to study the Sun's interior. You may know that you can describe waves on a string as sine and cosine waves (freshman college physics). Well, waves on the Sun are described as spherical harmonics, the oscillation modes of a sphere.</p>

<p>I couldn't find a source on the physical size of the waves, but I did find a source that gives the oscillation modes varying from a period as short as a few minutes and extending to over an hour. This paper doesn't have many citations, but I found it to be very readable. See the second paragraph on page 3 especially.</p>
