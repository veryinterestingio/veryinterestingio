			<div class="markdown"><p>But how many of those people are telling the truth when you ask them? Not that I believe that would bump up the numbers to anywhere near 100%, but I would be willing to bet that a large number of people with suicidal thoughts are afraid to admit it due the potential repercussions (ie fear of being institutionalized).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has been brought up by a number of people, and it's a legitimate concern. People can and do lie, and it can be both ways (both falsely claiming suicidality or rejecting it.) However, most of the people that I was seeing were actively seeking help, and so they were less likely to lie than if you approached someone on the street demanding to know if they are feeling suicidal. </p>
<p>Secondly, most of our patients were intimately familiar with the mental health system, which means that they knew exactly what would end up cause them to be placed on a mental health hold (forced hospitalization, for those unfamiliar). Namely, imminent suicidal ideation with a plan. Our patients  understand that we are not going to hospitalize people for just reporting suicidal thoughts. Many of them had been dealing with these issues for decades and had never been hospitalized - it's actually pretty rare to place a mental health hold, which is as it should be.</p></div>		</li>
