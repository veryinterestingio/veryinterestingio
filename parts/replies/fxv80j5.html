			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s my understanding that the Japanese whiskeys have also become quite scientific about how they make thei whiskey and don’t need the same number of years. And that the industry as a whole is trying to move away from age labels because no one has the ability to meet demand for 25 year old whiskeys and the like. I’ve also read that “new” distilleries are making vodka and gin for the first few years while they wait for batches to mature. There was a period where you could get a loan to start a distillery in Scotland a few years ago but no one could afford the business model without supplemental liquors because of the sheer wait time. It’s been a while since I researched and I don’t drink anymore (though I miss a great Lophraig on occasion) so my info may be dated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Went to a distillery in Dingle, Ireland that said this. They were working on their first whiskey at that time and in the meantime were producing a really nice gin as you could bring that to production in a matter of days.</p>
<p>Got to taste their &quot;whiskey&quot; that hadn't been aged enough to be called whiskey though, and it already tasted great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most new distilleries do this - Cotswolds Distillery &amp; Aber Falls in the UK make vodka, gin and derived liquors as a brand-builder and to get a product to market whilst their whisky ages in.</p>
<p>The other alternative is to buy in no-brand whisky from another producer and badge it as your own. Oban's original business was selling whisky to other labels. These days they mostly sell under their own brand.</p>
<p>Penderyn bought wholesale Scotch in their first few years and then got in a spot of trouble for selling it as Welsh whisky when it was Scotch and only bottled in Wales. These days they're up to speed with their own product (and also did the Gin/Vodka thing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hadn't heard the first but and tbh thought it was mainly just shitty distilleries doing it to make quick money as quite a few of the Scottish no age statements that you'll find (in a supermarket at least) are terrible, especially that one that tells you to put the bottle in the freezer. </p>
<p>But yes, a lot of the newer distilleries are most definitely making whisky on the side and letting it age before they can sell it- but selling gin at the minute, hence the current gin boom. </p>
<p>I don't much like the company but I can't wait to see what the inevitable brewdog whisky will taste like, their gin is pretty damn good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I loved it a lot and when I tried finding 12yo it was already rarity and priced accordingly, then, even their blend's price started skyrocketing, which wasn't cheap to begin with. So yeah, no Hibiki for the poor!</p></div>		</li>
