			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the fact that mutations don't appear at an even rate. The Ainu people in northern Japan and Siberia are more closely related to Melanesian and darker skinned groups that came directly from Africa than most other neighboring Asian groups, but developed their lighter skin tone separate from others. That particular group only came to Japan 30,000 years ago. Which is before humans got to North America, but not by much by comparison to Europe.</p>
<p>At the same time though a lot of Europeans were fairly dark skinned for a majority of that time. The series of mutations that led to lighter skin in Europe is estimated to have spread less than ten thousand years ago by some experts and generally is composed of multiple successive mutations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect, there are multiple genes that can cause blue eyes. There is no single ancestor with a blue eye mutation, there are multiple with different kind of mutations that all give blue eyes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inuits and other Alaskan tribes just look Asian/Mongolian to me, my best friend warned me about it going to visit and I never took him seriously despite the fact that he did look Asian. They don't share any similarities in their looks with Native American tribes from the states, at least none of the natives I've run into look anything like the natives up in Alaska.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When humans first became a thing, we were in small tribes scattered randomly. Differences in communication and whatnot caused the tribes to not like each other. So let's say one tribe found out a new way to do something important like agriculture; human development is all about sharing ideas and new was if doing things, but tribes didn't like each other, so the idea never got shared.</p>
<p>So now the tribe that learned something new, either never shared it, or died off. Human knowledge is exponential due to the sharing of information. If information isn't shared, then no one can grow on top of that knowledge.</p>
<p>This is a simplistic explanation, and I've had a few whiskeys, but I think it's fitting for an ELI5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a /r/askhistorians thread about this, but basically 'civilization' started because of agriculture and people settling in the same area for a long time. And conditions for agriculture were only good 'recently'.</p></div>		</li>
