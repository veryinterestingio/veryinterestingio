<p>Gut bacteria of a child can be different from that of an adult, which leads to changes in gassiness.</p>
<p>But yes, that's more related to diet than age; children are the &quot;only&quot; special case, because their gut bacteria is developing; but there's no inherent &quot;get gassier&quot; as we age, probably you just realize holding it is not healthy and stop giving a fuck.</p></div>		</li>
