			<div class="markdown"><p>Good write-up.  I'd like to piggy-back on this a little bit.  You explain how we get iron well, but I don't think your comment really explains why we don't get, say, copper meteorites.  </p>
<p>Earth is a unique body in our Solar System in many ways.  Since we're talking about concentrating particular metals, it's worth mentioning Earth's structure, hydrosphere, and plate tectonics.  </p>
<p>The vast majority of asteroids in the Solar System accreted and, if they were large enough, differentiated and cooled within 100 million years of the formation of the earliest Solar System solids we can reliably date -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium%E2%80%93aluminium-rich_inclusion" target="_blank">CAIs</a>.  They were too small to retain heat for more than 100 or so million years, so even if they formed early enough (and contained enough radioactive elements to melt), they still cooled pretty quickly. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafnium%E2%80%93tungsten_dating#Core_formation_times_for_Solar_system_bodies" target="_blank">Most bodies went through the process of melting and differentiation within 5-10 million years of CAI formation</a>, which would mean that the first solids formed, accreted into large bodies, those bodies melted, and differentiated -- all within just a few million years.  </p>
<p>And we're talking about relatively dry asteroids in the vacuum of space.  They outgassed when they melted, and then cooled.  That doesn't leave you much time or opportunity to chemically concentrate something like [copper] or [gold].  If you melt an asteroid without water, your heavy stuff will sink, light material will float, and just about the only chemical separations you're going to get are between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldschmidt_classification" target="_blank">lithophile and siderophile elements</a>.  Some elements are going to want to go into metal / the core, and some are going to want to be concentrated in the mantle / crust.  </p>
<p>Earth, on the other hand, has been geologically active for billions of years.  Because Earth is larger, it's stayed hot the whole time.  And thanks to Earth's hydrosphere and plate tectonics, there's a constant cycling of volatiles (solvents) and raw materials into the upper mantle.  </p>
<p>Think about what it takes to make a copper deposit on Earth.  You need good geology to start with, and then what?  <a href="https://www.arizonageologicalsoc.org/resources/Documents/Short%20Papers%20by%20Members/2014/Mining%20and%20You%20-%201-19-2014.pdf" target="_blank">Extensive hydrothermal alteration (usually near or due to a heat source like a batholith), secondary concentrating mechanisms, etc., etc., etc.</a>  You can't get it without extensive groundwater interaction with a heat source for millions of years.  Time, water, heat.  And probably strong acids in the water due to fluid interaction with volatiles escaping from the magma (H2SO4, HF, etc).  That will also help to dissolve and then deposit your metals later.  </p>
<p>Nearly all asteroids that melted look to have been dry since roughly 15 million years after CAI formation.  They accreted, melted, devolatilized, and...that's it.  They've been in cold storage for billions of years.  </p>
<p>Some asteroids have gone through processes that can concentrate some elements in small amounts, though.  Impacts often melt portions of asteroids, and the evaporation / condensation of material can result in slight enrichments of particular elements as they condense together at particular temperatures.  So you can get things like 3-5 Âµm inclusions of copper in some meteorites that have experienced big impacts.  That's about as big as they usually get, though -- to get them any bigger, you'd need to bring in something like extensive hydrothermal activity and a much longer-lived heat source than an impact.  We've never seen evidence for anything like that in a meteorite -- excluding Martian meteorites, but that's a whole 'nother bag of worms and I don't want to go there right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  So the chances of their being a solid gold meteorite out there is pretty slim?  Or something else that's heavy in platinum groups enough to make it worth being mined?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mined yes, that only requires a total amount in the asteroid. Most mining is just crushing up large amounts of rock and extracting a small percentage of useful product from it. There are no environmental restrictions in space so you can just dissolve it in acid. </p>
<p>But you won't find concentrated veins or shiny gold asteroids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a minor addition... the reason the earths core has stayed hot this long is <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/nuclear-fission-confirmed-as-source-of-more-than-half-of-earths-heat/" target="_blank">nuclear fission</a> of uranium, not simply being large enough to retain heat</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two comments to add.  First, when /u/CrustalTrudger says iron and nickel are more abundant, it's hard to imagine just how <em>much</em> more abundant they are.  We know that iron is more common than copper or gold in the Earth's crust, but keep in mind that in addition to that, Earth has a blob of iron and nickel almost twice the diameter of the Moon as its core.</p>
<p>Second, common elements like iron and nickel can separate from rock just by virtue of their weight, but on Earth, the rarer elements like copper, gold, etc. are typically concentrated into ore deposits through hydrothermal activity -- large-scale flows of hot water through the rock, which dissolve and reprecipitate minerals.  While <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/MESSII/9022.pdf" target="_blank">we know</a> that some asteroid parent bodies got warm enough to have liquid water, there's not a lot of evidence that they had enough heat and gravity to drive enough large-scale hydrothermal action to concentrate rare metals into ore bodies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's insane to think about as how big the moon looks to us, and then realise that all the other planets can fit in the space between us and the moon (at apogee).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a perspective that I have not heard before. The only speculation on metal deposits
that I have not heard discussed before  is the gravity anomaly on the South Pole of the moon. There
appears to be an extremely dense body buried there. The physics of the collision of the early
earth and the proto-moon planetoid is amazingly complicated. There was a good article on Space.com
about a super computer simulation: <a href="https://www.space.com/18106-moon-formation-earth-giant-impact.html" target="_blank">https://www.space.com/18106-moon-formation-earth-giant-impact.html</a></p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For the benefit of those coming through this (fantastic) thread at some point in the future, you can imagine the result of the hydrothermal process as a vein of deposit, exactly like what gold miners look for.  (Or miners of nearly any miner-al).  The vein has varying composition, volume etc.  It is a 3d &quot;river&quot; that ebbs, flows, and freezes at the end of its life.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my memories of chemistry and geology classes Long ago...Different minerals precipitate out from solutions at different temperatures, concentrations, ph, and other attributes.
