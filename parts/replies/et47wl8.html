I got really motivated after the events of 9/11, and the following rhetoric that got us into the Middle East to begin with, to start researching everything I could about our involvement there and elsewhere. It opened my eyes quite a bit. I knew the world was corrupt as a kid, but I didn't know HOW corrupt it was back then.</p>
