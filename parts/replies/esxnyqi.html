			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, its asking about the gravitational slingshot effect. Where a body, say a spacecraft, comes towards some other body, say a planet, at such an angle that the gravitarional pull of the second body accelerates the first, but the angle of attack and velocity of the first body are such that it doesn't end up orbiting or crashing into the second body. NASA has uses in some missions, like the voyager missions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know about the gravitational slingshot effect, I thought the top voted answer explained that well.  </p>
<p>I just wanted to check the OP understood that unlike crashing into a body because you got too close, you have a very specific issue with black holes which is even more severe because even if you are travelling just under C your slingshot won't end well if you cross the event horizon!!  </p>
<p>(Which in fairness is the same thing but taken to an extreme...) :)</p></div>		</li>
