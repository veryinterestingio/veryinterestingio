<p>Toronto and Vancouver are seeing a major compression of condo sizes for the $ as well, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who lives in Montreal and started thinking about buying a property, I'm very concerned that our city is starting to be like Vancouver or Toronto. Seems like prices have already started going way up and I already can't afford something as big as when I started looking last year. The category of property I'm looking at went up a lot since I started looking at the market and before the whole covid thing, good deals sold on the spot. Some landlord told me they already had 30 offers one day after listing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you live in the city center of a big city, you would be using public space more for meeting friends, spending a lot of time at work, you wouldn't use your own condo except for sleeping, early breakfast or late dinner, or maybe watching that one series that's no one wants to watch at your rich friend's house out in the suburbs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apartments are not shrinking <em>because</em> of any of that.</p>
<p>They are shrinking because demand for proximity to the city core is driving down how much space people will accept for their $.</p>
<p>Yes those amenities are apart of why people accept this otherwise brutal trade off.</p>
<p>This has a knock on effect well into the suburbs, well outside where those city &quot;upsides&quot; you mention are of any benefit.</p>
<p>Lots are narrower and shallower. Yards and driveways are smaller, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in the 80s room size rules were removed in favour of the market deciding how big rooms should be.</p>
<p>Totally unpredictably the market decided rooms should be smaller</p>
<p>I have a council house from the 70s that has reasonable sized rooms compared to houses now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Population density in the UK is much higher than the US.</p>
<p>In the US, we could afford to switch fields around cities from grown beans to growing houses.</p>
<p>In denser areas of the US, like NYC and San Francisco, I expect to see home sizes fall.     In midwestern cities the population growth has been 50 miles from the city center.   </p>
<p>Much of the population growth of the US in the last 75 years has been in the south, that's only recently been made tolerable with air conditioning.   Just 100 years ago it was sparse.   Since it's all grown up after cars were invented, it's spread out, so a bigger house is no problem.</p></div>		</li>
