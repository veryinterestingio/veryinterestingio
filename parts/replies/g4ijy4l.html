			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people think they have aphantasia because people assume “visualising” means actually seeing things in your brain, as if you were wearing a VR headset. It is incredibly rare for this to happen, to in a sense “hallucinate” your imagination. Everyone sees black. But you can “visualise” memories etc, but it doesn’t mean you see them</p>
<p>EDIT: to me, this is a classic case of people creating an echo chamber and wanting to feel special for something that is completely normal. r/aphantasia has a shit ton of tests that are really confusing and there’s little discussion on what the term “visualising” means. They want to believe that “regular” people can full on hallucinate their imaginations, I’m talking when you close your eyes, you can still see colours etc just like if they were open. These people then feel special for not having that ability. Also the gate keeping is real lol. Anyways I’m tired of this discussion so I don’t think I’ll respond further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually no. You are the one that is wrong here. I have done a survey on this. More than 700 participants and for the majority it is like VR. Just better because as far as I know we still don't have tactile, olfactory and so on VR.. Yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the easiest way to describe it is that I have two sets of senses.</p>
<p>My &quot;real&quot; senses that exist in the real world.</p>
<p>And my &quot;inner&quot; senses that exist in my inner world.</p>
<p>Say someone asks me to imagine a sunflower.  I can walk around it in my inner world, I can look at it from up close/far away, I can feel the texture of the seeds when I run my hand over it, I can smell it, I can hear the wind through the grass.  I can interact with it in every way I could interact with a real sunflower.</p>
<p>I'm not seeing it with my physical eyes, but I am seeing it.  I'm not physically standing beside a sunflower right now, but I am standing beside a sunflower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i’m not sure if you’re the same guy i already responded to but what you said is just false. most people (including me) can actually see things in our head as if it were a movie or video game. if you can’t do this then you probably have aphantasia or at least a mild form of it</p></div>		</li>
