			<div class="markdown"><p>Front bench seats were common in the US up until the 80's when bucket seats became more common, mostly due to safety concerns about airbags, european influence, and the fact that they were seen as more &quot;sporty&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally, bench seats saved my mother’s life, and I never would have been born if it weren’t for them. </p>
<p>My mom was in the right turning lane, and a semi began turning right from the middle lane (claiming later that he didn’t realize there was a turning lane). He completely crushed my mom’s Gremlin, and if it weren’t for the fact that she was able to easily slide to the passenger door because of the bench seats, she would have been a goner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most cars (70s and older) used to have a bench seat in the front that could easily fit 3 people. Many pickups still have a front bench seat meant for 3. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if you drive manual, having the shifter be in the middle of the car makes more sense mechanically, and doesn't leave a passenger with their leg space crowded by it. And why would you want to have automatics and manuals have different cockpit layouts?</p></div>		</li>
