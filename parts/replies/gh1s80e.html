			<div class="markdown"><p>Time does not matter generations matter., In ideal conditions bacteria might reproduce every 30min while humans take 20 years. This is why we use small rapidly reproducing species like C elegans, E coli, Mus musculus, &amp; Drosophila melanogaster.</p>
<p>Large changes depend on the chance mutations arising. In a varied gene pool with strong selective pressure 40 generations can be enough to adapt to an open niche.  <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com" target="_blank">https://www.nationalgeographic.com</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The million years is an average across a broad range of species. It can take less, but on average expect it to take about a million.  </p>
<p>My understanding of <a href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/archives/2011/aug/lasting-evolutionary-change-takes-about-one-million-years" target="_blank">this study</a> says that white to black change could very well revert and not last in the species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right that big (i.e. visible) changes generally require huge time spans. </p>
<p>But itâ€™s more a matter of generations and it can happen fast with enough coincidence and selective pressure on your side. Just look at how humans have changed domestic plants and animals in a few hundred or thousand years. And those plants and animals often only reproduce once or twice per year, in bacteria or insects you can have much faster evolution.</p></div>		</li>
