			<div class="markdown"><p>extreme eli5: calculators turn every number into a number using only 1's and 0's. they can add/subtract these numbers very quickly using a set of rules humans created, and they can use addition and subtraction to get multiplication and division, which gets them everything else they need to do any calculation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now I would be curious how you would explain microelectronics and binary numbers to a five-year-old. I mean, you could simply say &quot;it does a lot of tiny little calculations, like you do in pre-school, just with electricity and very quickly&quot;, but that wouldn't help you either in understanding how it actually works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty cool. Didn't think of how a nand-gate would result in addition in binary. Is multiplication just recursive addition? Or does it use other logic tricks to calculate? And what kind of algorithms are used for division?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suppose that you have two four-bit numbers whose bits are ABCD and WXYZ. Their product is equal to:</p>
<p>2^3 × A × WXYZ +<br />
2^2 × B × WXYZ +<br />
2^1 × C × WXYZ +<br />
2^0 × D × WXYZ</p>
<p>This is similar to how you would do it on paper. But since we're in binary, there are some shortcuts. Consider A × WXYZ: if A is 1 then the product is WXYZ, and if A is 0 then the product is 0. This is an extremely simple operation for a circuit to perform. Then, consider 2^n times some number. A circuit can compute this by just shifting that number to the left by <em>n</em> bits. So all we really need to do to multiply ABCD by WXYZ is a few shifts and conditional additions.</p>
<p>This gets slower as you have more bits, so really powerful circuits like computer CPUs use more optimizations to make it faster.</p>
<p>Division is more complicated. A common approach is to find the reciprocal of the denominator, then multiply. The reciprocal is found by guessing the result using a linear approximation and a lookup table, and then using Newton's method to get to the right answer.</p></div>		</li>
