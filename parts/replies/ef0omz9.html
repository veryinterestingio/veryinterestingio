			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not an expert (just a med student), but my guess would be no. The thymus mostly involutes by adulthood and only small remnants remain functional. Final stages of T cell maturation and selection do not really occur in the bone marrow. Furthermore this doesn’t address the issue of B cells producing antibodies against transplanted organs (or any other lymphocytes attacking for that matter, like NK cells or neutrophils etc). All of this is only relevant to typical transplantation, not bone marrow transplants. </p>
<p>BMTs cause GVHD because the new immune system doesn’t recognize a lot of the patients own normal antigens. If what you described were possible, we would have to “train” the new T and B cells (as well as all the other types of lymphocytes) to recognize all the antigens present in the patients body beforehand. I would figure that with the level of tech required to do that, we could probably just create new bone marrow from the patient’s own DNA but altered to remove whatever mutations or issues that caused their disease in the first place. </p></div>		</li>
