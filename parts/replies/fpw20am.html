<p>Since you specifically asked about a rainbow and the top answers are detailing prisms, here is an IR photo of a rainbow. </p>

<p>I have literally never seen this picture before I and I love it and I'm going to use it in classes now, thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As to radio and x-ray I don't think the waters absorption is the crucial factor. When the wavelength gets larger than the size of the droplets, the physical model will transition away from reflection/refraction within the droplets, and thus not create a rainbow. As for high energy waves, the difference in refraction index between substances gets quite small when you get to x-ray energies and above, so there is probably minimal refraction and reflection happening.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suspected UV and IR would be there as they are very alike to the visible light property wise but had no idea why other wavelengths would not be present.</p></div>		</li>
