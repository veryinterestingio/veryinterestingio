<p>The main culprit is lack of activity compared to youth.</p>

<p>Yep. I am man in my mid 40's (6' tall) and ballooned up to 230 lbs in my late 30's due to a combination of over-eating and a sedentary lifestyle. Finally got sick of being fat and decided to cut back on the unnecessary food and get active again. I currently clock in at 165 lbs and have an athletic build. </p>
<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the &quot;dad bod&quot; isn't mandatory as men grow older. It just takes discipline and exercise to stay in shape.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another trick I've learned is not to contort your lifestyle to a diet but find a diet that is already close to what you're doing. When I was in university, the way my days were scheduled made it optimal for keto for a few reasons, and I was able to stick to it  because it was just a couple minor changes to what I was already doing. I was able to lose 30 lbs that way. I no longer do keto but now, with my current job, I find doing a 16:8 intermittent fast is perfect for my lifestyle currently. </p>
<p>Also, check out <a href="https://darebee.com" target="_blank">darebee.com</a> - it's a complete not for profit with no ads that has articles, plans, nutrition and workouts for free. Useful and seems less known than it should be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never got married or had a family, so that's a HUGE plus in my favor when it comes to fitness.</p>
<p>If you're not already, try just walking as much as you can during the day. Maybe a five minute walk here, a five minute walk there. Buying a smart watch that measured my steps made a big difference in allowing me to see how much walking/running/physical activity I was getting in a given day and then to set goals on what I wanted to be getting. I walk/run between 18,000 and 20,000 steps a day five days a week now, but I started out with goals of more like 5,000 steps and slowly increased over time.</p>
<p>Try to cut down on your caloric intake. I initially lost the majority of my weight through intense hiking and then kept it off just by eating less, cutting back on carbs, cutting out most refined sugars (stop drinking soda and or sugary drinks if you haven't already). I actually went back to a pretty sedentary lifestyle after the initial weight loss but managed to avoid bouncing back by eating only when I was hungry and never a huge amount. It's like the old motto says: Eat to live, don't live to eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am late 30's and was over 200lb. Decided to get in shape for myself and for my toddler. I am going to a personal trainer 2x a week (and do cardio at home). Yeah it is expensive, but it forces you to do it, creates accountability, and I have seen far more progress with a trainer than I ever did doing exercise at home. Currently down 30lb.</p>
<p>Also I eat a fuckload of plain cheerios. Probably not the single best diet, but I am kinda lazy and it gives me 1-2 meals that are low calorie and filling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 32. Doing further study at uni and changing to a more office style job = fat.</p>
<p>Also more income = better food, wine, whisky etc  more often = higher calories.</p>
<p>Just currently trying to reduce unnecessary intake atm also and increase activity.</p></div>		</li>
