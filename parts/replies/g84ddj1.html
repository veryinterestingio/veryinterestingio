			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Up is toward the sky, down is toward the Earth. This is completely regardless of your orientation or position in space.</p>
<p>Left and right, however, are relative to your position and orientation which are constantly changing. If we're facing each other, your left is my right, and vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean if you want to get that technical then you're wrong as well. If you're in space and not being acted upon by any significant source of gravity, &quot;up&quot; is whatever direction you define it as, with &quot;down&quot; being the inverse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets even funnier when you talk about stage directions. This is taken from an old quote, and for context when you are talking about stage left and stage right, you are thinking of yourself as an actor participating in a play looking toward the audience, not an audience member watching said play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In is down, down is front,</p>
<p>Out is up, up is back,</p>
<p>Off is out, on is in,</p>
<p>And of course -</p>
<p>Right is left, and left is right.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--</p>
<p>For anyone really interested in what it all means, here's a short explanation of terms:</p>
<p>&quot;In&quot; - lowering a pipe batten with a scenic element attached to it to the stage deck (down)</p>
<p>&quot;Down&quot; - downstage, toward the proscenium and the edge of the stage nearest the audience (front)</p>
<p>&quot;Out&quot; - opposite of in. Raising a batten out of the eye-line of the audience (up)</p>
<p>&quot;Up&quot; - upstage, toward the back wall furthest from the audience (back)</p>
<p>&quot;Off&quot; - moving a set piece beyond the audience eye-line into the wings on either side of the stage (out)</p>
<p>&quot;On&quot; - moving a set piece from the wings onto the active play area (in)</p>
<p>&quot;Right&quot; - stage right, toward the audience's left (this is also why we specify &quot;house left&quot; if talking about things in the auditorium</p>
<p>&quot;Left&quot; - stage left, toward the audience's right side. (Alternatively, &quot;house right&quot;)</p>
<p>Confused? Trust me when I say, it gets worse. I love it though.</p>

<p>House right, house left.... I stay confused. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In France, we use &quot;Garden side&quot; (c√¥t√© jardin) and &quot;Courtside&quot; (c√¥t√© cour), garden side being on the (audience) left, and courtside being on the (audience) right.</p>
<p>A funny thing to remeber this is to imagine a member of the audience saying &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;, so J-C goes for Jardin-Cour, from left to right (sorry if it's unclear, it's difficult to explain in a different language !)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't Sleep, There are Snakes</p>
<p>A book about a missionary who went to the Amazonian jungle to learn the language of the locals so he cold translate the bible for them. Interesting book on many levels. One take-away that has really stuck with me. </p>
<p>He was constantly confused when being taught a task as one day they'd tell him to us X hand, and the next day the Y hand. They don't have Left and Right. They have upstream and downstream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know sometimes when people are deep underwater they can confuse up and down, and only know 'up' because of the air bubbles, so maybe? But I guess there isn't really an 'up' or 'down' on the ISS</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is, the ISS is orientated with the same parts facing the earth, and within each module they‚Äôre designed with all the signage facing a certain way and with the lights on the ‚Äúceiling‚Äù. Most of the modules along the main structure follow that orientation but it changes in the modules attached orthogonal.</p></div>		</li>
