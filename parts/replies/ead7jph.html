			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there's a physical limit to the rate at which black holes can grow. The idea is that things get hot when they fall in and when too much stuff falls in too fast, it gets so hot that the radiation has enough pressure to push back on the stuff falling in. This is also kind of how supernovas work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if something happened long ago that was similar to this. </p>
<p>Condensed all known matter in the universe into a single point. Super black hole. Nothing makes sense physically anymore and we are incapable of describing how Physics works at this point. </p>
<p>Perhaps when Physics breaks down inside this super black hole, something happened that gave the matter so much energy that it can somehow escape the black hole (note that even light cannot escape a normal black hole by definition). </p>
<p>Maybe dark energy becomes more interactive at gravitational accelerations millions of times higher than anything we can even fathom. </p>
<p>Very interesting question! Fun to think about. </p>
<p>Edit: forgot to mention how this COULD follow ties to Big Bang theory (entire universe at single point followed by high energy explosion and expansion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting one. Basically, from what we can tell, all the matter and energy in the known universe <em>was</em> contracted into a single point. But it was not part of a black hole at that time, because the universe was also extremely dense, the point right next to it, that would later become some other observable universe, was also extremely dense, and right next to it. . . Basically, the universe was extremely dense in all directions, no matter where you looked from one point, there would be the same amount of mass-energy, and the same gravitational force. All these forces canceled out.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, the big bang occurs, and the universe starts to form. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The universe is massive, how do we know that one of your hypothesized super black holes only took up say, for the sake of argument, half the universes matter. Then resulted somehow in its own explosion/implosion - pushing the other half of matter out and away with it. Making the outer edge of this big bang contain older remnants of and older universe. Could that be possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For fun I did a <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=c%5E2+%2F+2+%2F+G+*+\(50000+light+years\)" target="_blank">back-of-the-envelope calculation</a> of how heavy such a black hole would need to be. The answer is very high, but not actually as ridiculously high as I thought (given that even very heavy black holes are still comparatively small to the scale of solar systems): 3.185*10^47 kg, or roughly 300,000 times as heavy as all stars in the the Milky Way combined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m sure you are right, but this seems so wrong to me. I’d assume with how much empty space there is between stars that to fill it all with compressed mass would be much much more mass than only 300000x. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What about in the universe “end game”? Like, there are very few things left in the universe except black holes that have merged with each other and such. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how the expansion proceeds, but the current evidence makes it seem like the black holes left at the end will be pretty far apart and endlessly getting farther apart.  Lonely black holes, slowly evaporating over timeframes that make the current age of the universe seem like a blink of the eye.  </p>
<p>The ones near each other should merge, so there will be some big ones, but not as massive as say a whole supercluster collapsing into one black hole.  Superclusters are already appear to be gravitationally unbound today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha. The endlessly getting father apart aspect is what I missed. Hadn’t realized that was the prevailing theory/what evidence supports. </p>
<p>Always seemed to me that they would eventually catch each other’s gravity and converge. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that the end of the universe looks substantially different depending on whether or not proton decay is a thing.</p>
<p>If protons decay then eventually all nucleons in the universe will decay. Then all that's left are black holes which evaporate via Hawking radiation.</p>
<p>If protons do not decay then much, much later all regular matter eventually becomes iron-56. These iron stars then collapse due to quantum tunneling, first into neutron stars, then into black holes. Then the black holes evaporate into subatomic particles.</p>
<p>Both outcomes happen over incomprehensibly large timescales.</p>
<p>After that the universe enters the Photon Age, where there is nothing but photons, neutrinos, electrons, and positrons flying around, rarely ever encountering one another. The universe reaches an extremely low-energy state.</p>
<p>This page does a good job of laying it all out:</p>
