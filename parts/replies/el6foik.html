<p>But, you can FEEL a higher-dimensional space. Like, if you move a solid object through space, you're actually exploring a 6-dim space (the cotangent bundle to the 3-sphere) that can have a Calabi-Yau metric. The 3 dimensions of Euclidean space and the 3 solid angles of rotation.</p></div>		</li>
