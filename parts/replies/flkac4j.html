			<div class="markdown"><p>Geologist here, it is correct. I believe that technically to be called a spring it has to originate from below the surface, but I'm not 100% on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Because a water body above surface is called a lake, run-off (from intensive rainfall) or a river.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it initially all comes from rain. Most of the time, the rain just soaks into the spongy mountain. Occasionally, it will soak into the ground surrounding/beneath the mountain and so much pressure will build that it can shoot water up into the mountain kind of like how you can suck water into a straw and hold the top of the straw and keep the water in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: for a very long time people didn't believe that rainfall alone could explain river water. They did have the idea of a hydrological cycle, with water flowing down from springs and through rivers into the sea, but they believed that the water then travelled back up through the earth, like blood through veins. It was only in the eighteenth century that people started making actual calculations about the volume of rain and rivers and realised that rainfall did in fact correspond to rivers' volume.</p>
<p>There's a great book on this by geographer Yi Fu Tuan, called <em>The Hydrologic Cycle and the Wisdom of God</em>, which goes into early (Antiquity and Renaissance mostly) scientists'  attempts to figure out the hydrological cycle and how it meshed with theology (God as the great artificer making a perfect world).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogeologist here. Water does not shoot up into the mountain. It flows down the mountain. Groundwater recharges in areas of higher elevation and discharges in areas of lower elevation.</p>
<p>Geysers or hot springs are generally located in groundwater discharge locations (i.e., lower elevation at the base of the mountain).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't rise up higher than where it went in, without a pump. That pump might use the &quot;finger on straw&quot; method for short lifts, but you will never get a spring right at the top of a hill unless there's another, higher hill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just would add that some rocks are porous and permeable can allow water to flow into it and/or hold it. While other rocks can be impermeable and without pours and that rock can create seals so the porous/permeable rock can hold the water in to create springs. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, rocks are fractals and that's the best part of everything I think. I fucking love it. Zoom in, zoom out, water acts the same.</p>
<p>except when you get ionic and cohesive forces and then you've zoomed into far and everything's about to fuck up your brain.</p></div>		</li>
