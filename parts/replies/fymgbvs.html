			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans actually sleep better when they hear a dog snoring. Dogs are very alert so if humans hear them snoring they know nothing is around. Also we are likely more attuned to a dogs bark, so when your neighbors dog barks at 3 am it will probably wake you up</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's why you don't notice where your tongue is in your mouth or the clothes on your body.  Continuous stimulus is ignored because it's not a threat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That‚Äôs more psychological than neurological I‚Äôd think. Habituation is actually constant things, like how you don‚Äôt really notes your clothes or a mask on you that much after a few minutes. It‚Äôs your neurological system going ‚ÄúI‚Äôm receiving this input but it‚Äôs not changing so probably not important‚Äù. Involving action potentials and nerve cell physiology that I can‚Äôt remember the specifics of. </p>
<p>Your question about the news is more like your bar for what is upsetting keeps moving. More of a psychological resilience or desensitization.</p></div>		</li>
