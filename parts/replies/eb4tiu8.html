			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, the name Rose is (traditionally*) etymologically unrelated to the flower.  It comes from the Germanic hros-, meaning &quot;horse.&quot;</p>
<p>*Yes nowadays I'm sure most people using the name &quot;Rose&quot; are doing so because of the flower.</p></div>		</li>

<p>as the url suggests, an Israeli couple has named their third child, a girl, “Like.”Like, as in Facebook. “If once people gave Biblical names and that was the icon, then today this is one of the most famous icons in the world,” said Lior Adler, Like’s father.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I misread this as &quot;Adler means German in eagle&quot;.  I thought that was cool so I immediately blurted outloud &quot;Oh thats cool&quot;.  </p>
<p>Which was a mistake because of course somebody heard me and asked &quot;whats cool?&quot;</p>
<p>It wasn't till the actual words &quot;Adler means German in eagle&quot; came out of my mouth that I realized that you don't really speak eagle, that I didn't just learn how to say something in eagle, and I will never get to impress a new eagle friend by screaming a word that means German.</p>
<p>I don't know how to put all these giggles and tears into words...</p></div>		</li>
