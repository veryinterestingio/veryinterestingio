<p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>Voyager 1 is 12.5 billion miles away. If we wanted to calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of 12.5 billion miles, 15 decimal places of PI would get you accurate within 1.5 inches of the 78 billion mile circumference, or an accuracy of:</p>
<p>99.999999999999% or so.</p>
<p>39-40 decimal places of PI is sufficient to calculate the circumference of the universe with an error about the length of a hydrogen atom.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can roll-your-own even-higher precision math, but it becomes more cumbersome to hold different parts of the each number in memory and work with existing software libraries.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You can't use &quot;infinity decimal points&quot;, but you can use arbitrary precision integers/floats, including e.g. adjusting it so that whatever is being displayed is displayed at full precision (recalculating with a higher precision if needed).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your phone does calculations using 32 or 64 bit floating point numbers. If you're using that many bits to store the value of pi anyway you might as well use that extra precision. It also helps to reduce floating point errors.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I don't actually work at OnePlus, this is just the most likely explanation. Also if you're using the method of subtracting 3.14(...) to see more digits of pi you are introducing the aforementioned floating point error and aren't seeing the actual number of digits stored.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since I managed to find the Feynman point at the correct location, my assumption is that it's using some kind of recursive function to accurately calculate however many digits you are willing to scroll for (as opposed to storing 13000+ digits, at which point I got tired of scrolling)</p></div>		</li>
