			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I’m 27 months sober, I was at a liter of vodka+ for about 8 years almost daily before I quit.</p>
<p>First and foremost, as others have said, PLEASE see a doctor.  I didn’t go to the doctor for 10 years because I was afraid of what they’d say.  Turns out, it wasn’t great, but I had a baseline and something to work on.</p>
<p>So, please, go to the doctor and if you need rehab there is ZERO shame in it.</p>
<p>Second, hop on r/stopdrinking, that sub was a life saver for me...there is little to no toxicity AND you realize that so many people are just like you.</p>
<p>Towards the end of my drinking days, my whole body ached....I can’t say it was specifically my liver or not, but I was tired of the pain and exhaustion....there is an endlessly better life out there for you, and asking for help is hard, but it’s key....I relapsed twice trying to do it on my own....</p>
<p>Again, please see a doctor, no matter what you say to them, they’ve heard worse and they’re not there to judge....my doc was SOOOOOO supportive, it was the first time I cried in front of someone that wasn’t family, and I was vulnerable as hell, but she walked me through it, talked about options, and set me up with a plan to get better</p>
<p>Need to chat, please feel free to PM, but don’t do anything without talking to a doc</p>
<p>Edit: I read some more comments, sounds like you saw a doctor, that is a great first step....if they aren’t getting back to you, make it an issue or find a new doctor....go to the ER if you need to.</p>
<p>If you’re like me and thousands of other alcoholics, you’re likely depressed and that sounds like a ton of work....I can empathize....but as someone on the other side, I know you can get there and once you push the issue, the train will start rolling in the right direction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm doing this off the back of losing a friend a few years back and one that I lost this week due to liver failure and an overdose.
I can see simular patterns in my behaviour so I'd like to nip it in the bud before I do any more damage.
Thanks pal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No better time than the present.  Sucks that you lost people, so sorry to hear that....it’s such a dangerous drug to folks like us.</p>
<p>I’ve never been able to explain addiction to folks that don’t struggle with it...I hated being drunk, but I NEEDED it...I remember at the end of every workday saying to myself, “I wish I didn’t have to stop at the liquor store.”  And then driving out of my way to go to another liquor store so that the cashiers wouldn’t know how much I drank </p>
<p>I’ve had cashiers offer to leave vodka in the freezer for me, tell me my car was too nice to be drinking the shit I drank, and even have the bottle on the counter before I entered the store.</p>
<p>You are not alone, friend, and you don’t have to do it alone.</p>
<p>I wish you well, and the offer stands, if you need to PM someone, feel free</p></div>		</li>
