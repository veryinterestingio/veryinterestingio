			<div class="markdown"><p>Pluto is in an orbital resonance with Neptune, which means that they are locked in the 2:3 ratio of orbital periods. This happened because Neptune migrated in its early days as it was scattering the original Kuiper Belt objects. This orbital resonance keeps the two bodies from colliding despite being on crossing orbits, and makes Pluto's orbit more inclined and eccentric. As the previous answer said, there is a large group of Kuiper Belt objects that are in the same orbital resonance with Neptune, and they are called Plutinos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct, it's inclined such that when they pass the same distance from the Sun, Pluto is well north or south of Neptune.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not Matija, bu as far as I know, Pluto's orbit is not that weird, there are several Kuiper Belt Objects with orbits similar to Pluto's. They are tilted with respect to the planet's orbit plane, they cross Neptune's orbit and are in some sort of orbital resonance with it, they labelled them &quot;plutinos&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
