			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, optical systems are really hard to miniaturize. You can do a bit with a high resolution sensor and cropping out the stuff around your subject (what they like to call digital zoom), but if you want good quality, you'll need a lens that is bigger than the entire rest of yor phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Zoom&quot; is the act of <em>changing</em> focal length. It kind of makes sense for a compact camera, as they often come in equivalents of slightly wider angle to slightly telephoto lens. But on a camera with interchangeable lenses, this does not necessarily make sense. You can mount an 800 mm prime, which has no &quot;zoom&quot; but it's a really long telephoto lens. Or you can mount a wide angle zoom lens, say am 8-15 mm, which even if you zoom in still gives you very very wide angle photos :)</p>
<p>Tl,Dr: you probably mean &quot;zoom in&quot;, and that's more technically correctly stated by &quot;increase focal length&quot;.</p>
<p>But it's just a technicality :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try this during the next full moon. While the moon is low near the horizon, hold up a quarter at arms length next to it. It should be roughly the same size, but in comparison to the objects on the ground it looks huge. Later that night, when the moon looks smaller higher up in the sky, do it again and you'll see it's still the same size. Our brains do weird things with context clues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the same subject, but at the other end of the continuum... When I was young and immortal, I climbed a cell phone tower with a friend.  The moon was amazing.  It was my favorite part of the entire experience.  It was close to the horizon and compared to the city we were overlooking, it was huge.  It occurred to me that it was the same size when I got down, but it just seemed smaller.  </p>
<p>Amazing what perspective seems to do to what we are observing.  Makes you wonder how else you’ve been fooling yourself without even being aware of it.</p>
<p>(Don’t climb cell phone towers.  One can be arrested for it.)</p></div>		</li>
