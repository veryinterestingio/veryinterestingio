			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, if you ever play a flight sim like war thunder that has you flying a biplane in a match with fast later-gen &quot;zoom and boom&quot; fighters like ME-109 or P-51s, I think that's the best analogy I can come up with.</p>
<p>The fast-climbing, less maneuverable, fast-flying fighters will swoop from high altitude and make a single pass before gaining altitude to try another pass.  If you are a Sopwith Camel, you <strong>do not</strong> want to be in their path when they put their tail to the sky and dive.  If they can see you on a lazy, straight path from point A to point B, maybe you're long-hauling to a fight half a county away, maybe you're levelling off to attempt a bombing run, or drop a torpedo, they know they have you.  They will pick a point where you will be, put their nose down and beat the holy hell out of a cone right where you will be with gunfire.</p>
<p>The only way to survive is not be in that cone when they get there, that means you take advantage of your superior agility and you fly like a drunken moth, and when you have to fly predictable, like you get pinned down in a canyon with walls around or you steady out to drop ordinance, you just hope none of them notice you or they can't get to you before you can resume erratic maneuvers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was brought to the idea that moths and such creatures navigate by the sun/moon. This in mind you can imagine they think they're flying in straight lines when pulling 14G around your lightbulb.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, they have the simplest ear in the animal kingdom, one single cell. You can get them to drop by jingling your keys (creates ultrasound).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like only the ultrasonic range is single-cellular, and that a ton of processing is done to turn the two signals a moth receives from it's ultrasonic receptor cells into actionable direction data.
