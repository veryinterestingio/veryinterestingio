			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionaly, buoyancy is a function of volume and mass. The mass isn't going to change (much), so the question is really: how much volume change occurs between a whale with a full lungs vs empty, and what percentage difference is that to their overall volume?</p>
<p>I would hypothesize that they are fairly neutrally buoyant and their percentage volume difference doesn't change much with a full breath, therefore muscle propulsion could easily overcome buoyancy. </p>
<p>But I'm definitely not a whaleologis and I can't back that up with paperwork.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that response is very interesting and informative, it's actually much more about how they can &quot;hold their breath&quot; so long and so well but says almost nothing about buoyancy and maneuverability which was the original question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Divers see this all the time.  They dial in their buoyancy so that breathing in makes them positively buoyant and breathing out makes them sink (this isn't the effect, yet).  If they breathe out and hold that until they've sunk a meter or so, breathing in isn't sufficient to become positively buoyant again and, even with full lungs, they keep sinking.  It's a real dance to dial in and maintain your buoyancy -- especially as you change depths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard stories about critical freefall (that I've never done the math to actually confirm are possible) where a descent too fast results in a scenario where filling a BC doesn't increase volume fast enough to overcome the increased pressure gain.  Scary concept</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but then you can swim upwards using your legs to help you maintain depth. You don't sink all that fast so a couple of quick kicks and you'll be good to go. The annoying part is when you're close to the bottom, kicking can stir up the sand and mess up visibility or disturb the marine life. That's why maintaining your depth without too much physical effort is pretty important for a pleasant diving experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except when youre freediving, you dont let out air.  Letting out air decreases the amount of 02 in the system which means less bottom time.  </p>
<p>The air in your lungs compresses with depth, so overall lung volume does shrink (as would a whales or any other marine mammal).</p></div>		</li>
