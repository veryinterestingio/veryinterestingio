A lot of cables currently in service around the globe were laid around the dotcom bubble (1995-2002ish). New cables are still being laid but the industry is nowhere near as frantic as it was back then. It takes around 2-3 years for the cable laying project end-to-end, but this involves things like permitting, finding financing, doing seafloor mapping etc. The laying of the cable itself takes in the weeks-to-few-months timeframe depending on the ship used, the weather, the length of the routes, the current, the type of cable etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One interesting point about the cables layed almost 20 years ago is technology has progressively increased the amount of data we can send over an existing fiber pair. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One challenge with this anticipated growth is that the information-carrying capacity of a singlemode optical fiber may be maximized during the cableâ€™s lifetime. This boundary is known as the spatial spectral efficiency-the limit on the amount of data an optical fiber can transmit. The industry speculates that this will occur at single-channel transmission speeds of about 1 Terabit per second (1 Tbit/sec), and the combined DWDM channels will enable about 50 to 100 Tbits/sec to be transported on a fiber pair.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like the zone between the ridges is a bottomless pit haha. There's still a seabed there, even if it's deeper. They just plop the cable along the seabed at the bottom. Here's what the continental ridge looks like in Silfra, Iceland for example: <a href="https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/vkCf-ItkQVGKXLZM2MxmXiS7vJA=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/6e/60/6e6091a8-fbf5-45ac-ad2a-79102bc3abf4/silfra-sw-5.jpg" target="_blank">https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/vkCf-ItkQVGKXLZM2MxmXiS7vJA=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/6e/60/6e6091a8-fbf5-45ac-ad2a-79102bc3abf4/silfra-sw-5.jpg</a></p>
<p>In this case it's very near the surface, but under the ocean it's the same thing, just with a lot more water on top and a lot more distance between the cliffs. You can simply drop cable from one edge of the cliff, run it along the bottom and bring it back up on the other side.</p>
<p>And yes, before you ask, the cable will break in case of earthquakes (<a href="https://www.submarinenetworks.com/news/cables-cut-after-taiwan-earthquake-2006" target="_blank">https://www.submarinenetworks.com/news/cables-cut-after-taiwan-earthquake-2006</a>) or sharks biting it (<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/sharks-are-eating-the-internet-in-vietnam-9962747.html" target="_blank">https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/sharks-are-eating-the-internet-in-vietnam-9962747.html</a>).</p>
<p>At least with the earthquakes part, there's no real cheap-yet-effective way to mitigate that yet. People just have to head out and fix it if it's broken. Here's a ship that does things like that <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/subsea-internet-cable-ship-boat" target="_blank">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/subsea-internet-cable-ship-boat</a>.</p></div>		</li>
