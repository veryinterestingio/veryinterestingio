			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, we have done in the past. </p>
<p>Look for the Hymn to Ninkasi</p>
<p>Its a 4000+ year old mesapotamian prayer to the godess of beer, and essentially is a recipe for brewing a kind of proto beer using the yeast from yesterdays bread dough. It was kind of like a thin porridge, and you would sip the liquid from the surface to get a little closer to god  </p>
<p>Almost every religion has either a saint or a god dedicated to the art of the brewer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain types of yeast die off at different alcohol concentrations. Go and visit r/mead or r/wine and check out all the different types of yeast, some die off early causing a sweeter mead/wine due to  unprocessed  sugars, some have high resistance to alcohol and produce dry meads/wines.</p></div>		</li>
