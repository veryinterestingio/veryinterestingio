			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why - regardless of being in a desert - cloudless nights are often cooler than clouded nights. This isn't always the case - other whether can effect temperature - but especially in cold winter climates, clouds can have a pretty big impact on overnight temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially. Wind is always generated when air masses of two different temperatures collide. Sometimes it’s when air masses are moving across the surface, but mostly it’s churning colder high altitude air into less dense warm air masses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sand storms are mainly a couple things.  </p>
<p>One. There hasn’t been rain in a long while. So you have a ton of loose sand/dirt just kicking around on the surface.   </p>
<p>Step two is add in some wind and now you have what you need. </p>
<p>The sand storms are usually out in front of the actual storm.  It’s the leading edge of the storms picking up and putting down some serious winds that kicks up all that dirt that has been around for 3 months.   </p>
<p>Once you get into the storm and it actually has rain, it just turns to raining dirt for good while until all that is filtered out of the air.  A lot of the time it is just wind and no rain.  So it turns out to be a dirt/sand storm. Which just deposits all that loose sand and dirt around for the next one.  Rinse and repeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty close! There's also some residual airflow from the movement of the water, but yeah, it's mostly cooler air falling into the shower, where the air is now warm. Take a cold shower and you'll barely notice any air movement at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Just about everywhere on earth the temperature drops pretty quickly after sunset down towards the dewpoint. If the dewpoint is 75 then things will struggle to drop below 80. If the dewpoint is 30 like in the desert, then there is nothing stopping temperatures from falling down into the 50s or even 40s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but OP is speaking about temperatures going from hot to cold. I was fishing earlier this year on a day where it was 95 degrees but the dewpoint was only 45. By the time we got the boat out of the water just after sunset the temperature had already dropped to 66.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because air holds very little thermal energy - and it radiates out in space quickly. However, condensing water releases thermal energy. So once dew starts forming it reaches an equilibrium where the heat radiating into space is replaced by energy from condensation.</p>
<p>Note that cloud cover can really slow the radiation into space, so areas blanketed in thick clouds for the night might take longer to get there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add to this that clouds reflect heat back to the earth.  Deserts have very few clouds. So during the day the ground gets baked and at night it quickly releases that heat as infrared radiation, if that is allowed to escape back into space then you get cold pretty fast.  Even in non desert environments if you go out on a clear winter night vs a cloudy one you will notice a significant difference.</p>
<p>Humidity in the air also enhances this heat trapping effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fire a decent IR thermometer up into the sky sometime.  Clear sky reads extremely cold (maxed out my instrument at like -70F, so it's probably lower) -- compared to that, frozen clouds reading -20F are quite warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the sky is clear, it's probably not reading anything at all, as there's nothing close enough to reflect the IR beam back with any detectable level of intensity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put this in perspective, when I was living in a semi arid desert part of the USA sometimes during the winter months the temperature would drop to -15f. But there was so little moisture in the air that on sunny days the direct radiation of the sun was enough to keep me warm, to the point where I would walk around in just jeans and a t-shirt on days like that. </p>
<p>Contrast that to when I was living down in the south, even a 50f degree day felt absolutely freezing because the cold, moisture laden air would sap the heat right out of you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I climb to high altitudes the air can be so thin and dry that the second you walk into a shadow you instantly start to freeze.  None of the warmth is trapped in the air.</p>
<p>Down south I'm usually sweating like crazy even at night because that humidity is trapping all the heat and interfering with cooling via sweating.  It was horrible in China with the constant haze adding to it.</p></div>		</li>
