			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it'll bond pretty much instantly, more like when you accidentally super glue your fingers together (it cured extra fast because it used the water in your body to cure).   </p>
<p>That's also why super glue gets slower curing as it ages (more of the glue has absorbed water from the air when you opened it).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be aware though, the bond can be weaker when you force it to cure faster like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait so does that mean that regular glues are the same strength as super glues? If you give it enough time to cure the bond is just as strong as super glue? I always thought super glue created a stronger bond. Maybe because of the name &quot;super&quot; glue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No - Super Glue is a trade name for a special blend of cyanoacrylate (CA).   In theory, if an adhesive is &quot;well-suited&quot; for the material it's bonded to, the material will tear/break before the glue itself will.  This also has to do with how the glue is &quot;stressed&quot;.  A glue that might be very strong by straight pulling (called &quot;normal&quot;) may not be very good when it is &quot;peeled&quot; apart (called &quot;shear&quot;).  This is exactly the case with CA.  A good example is using CA to bond something to glass.  It just doesn't work well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how regular of a glue we need to be restricted to here, but there are some wood glues that require clamping and longer dry times that will bond stronger than the wood itself.</p>
<p>I seem to recall a shop teacher demonstration where two pieces of wood were glued and force applied to the joint and the wood itself broke before the joint.</p>
<p>There are also nails coated with adhesive for use in nail guns.  As the nail goes in, the adhesive melts and bonds the nail into the wood.  You have to cut apart the wood if you want to separate them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood glue is PVA Poly vinyl acetate, super glue is Cyano Acryalte, Epoxy is some sort ester, or amine ester, some wood glues known as &quot;hide&quot; glues are actual protein based from leather hides, white glue i cant remember if its PVA or Casein (milk protein) , rubber cement is latex rubber, contact cement is neoprene, the various forms of &quot;rubber cemet&quot; and &quot;goops&quot; or &quot;uhu&quot; aka universal contact cements (i realize the names are confusing but rubber cement is latex in heptane, and contact cement is neoprene in petro distillates) are usually some form of butyl rubber, or proprietary co-polymer rubbers. Then there is silicone but its bonding properties are not very high even when used as a glue thus why its sold primarily as a sealant.
also a term for how well a surface bonds is called &quot;surface energy&quot; and you can look up a chart on 3M's website to see how well certain plastics etc bond. FYI Polyethylene cant be bonded by anything.
*edit forgot to mention the weird bastard brother of glues, Gorilla Glue and the like, those are Polyurethane based construction adhesives, and expand 3-10 times the bead size when curing (they bubble and foam sometimes too) but are some of the strongest glues. Personally i use Loctite PL 3X in a handheld tube as my go to for anything wood, or furniture, especially those dowels. </p></div>		</li>
