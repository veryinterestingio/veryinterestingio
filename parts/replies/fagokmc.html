			<div class="markdown"><p>You would need an absolutely massive rod with incredible rigidity and strength to be able to handle the stresses from one end spinning the speed of light. Any material would just break apart anyways</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A material can only transmit a signal through it, like you moving it through the air, at it's rate of signal transmission, which is governed by the medium. The waves have to propagate and that takes time. If you move the rod faster than the signal transmission rate, the rod will disintegrate or you won't be able to keep spinning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you had a perfectly rigid rod, as the end of the rod approached light speed it would take an increasing amount of force (essentially infinite force at light speed) to continue to accelerate it.  You would never actually get to light speed.</p></div>		</li>
