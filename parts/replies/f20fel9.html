<p>If you have an automatic transmission, your engine and drivetrain are not mechanically interlocked; they're independent. You have this device called a torque converter - it's a drum filled with oil, and a turbine. The drum is bolted to the engine crankshaft, the turbine is attached to the transmission. As the engine spins, it rotates the drum, which gets the oil sloshing. This creates hydraulic pressure, which runs over the turbine. This pressure CAN rotate the turbine, and move the car, but the brakes can overcome this pressure. If this is the case, the oil just flows around the turbine.  </p>
<p>In a manual car, you have a pair of friction plates held together by a spring. The clutch pedal pushes the plates apart. The engine and drivetrain are physically linked, but if you're going to stop, you have to step on the clutch pedal and disconnect the engine from the drivetrain, or you'll stall the engine and it'll be a bumpy stop, as you imagine.</p>
