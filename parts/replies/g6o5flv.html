			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that domestic dogs have evolved eyebrow muscles since being domesticated for so long, because humans use eyebrows in facial expressions so we recognise emotions in dog faces when their eyebrows move. (So eyebrow-moving dogs have been favoured for breeding, etc...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs are also one of the only other species to understand when Humans look at and or point at something. Understand as in, look at the other thing. </p>
<p>Not even all monkey / ape species understand the concept. </p>
<p>It also can't be ignored that for as large an impact we have had on Dogs for breeding, there has been  a much smaller impact on Humans. Those who trusted and worked with dogs surviving. So we understand them a little better because of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. </p>
<p>Also, we <em>know</em> animals don't judge us, be it on appearance or actions. With this burden completely removed, its much easier to 'open up or 'bond' with an animal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well thats not completely true. A lot of dogs can react to people who look and dress very different than the people they regularly interact with, my inlaws had a “racist” dog which went crazy every time they met a black person.</p></div>		</li>
