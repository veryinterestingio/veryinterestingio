			<div class="markdown"><p>Though it's probably not enough to cause pain, the area around the burn is likely to be physically hotter as well. Healing requires quite a lot of energy, and that's going to result in more waste heat being generated in that area. This has an added bonus of making the area less hospitable to many pathogens which could cause infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is. Can anyone elaborate on why growing nerves are painful? I’ve never heard that but I’m sure there’s an evolutionary reason or something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat you’re describing has a minimal effect relative to the heat released from the area due to hyperemia(increased blood flow to the area) associated with inflammation and healing. This is also why there is redness around burns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you can argue that energy is still being expended as part of the healing process. It can still also be considerably warm even after vasodilation has reduced.</p>
<p>Plus it doesn't just happen with surface injuries. You can get a lot of heat off things like muscle sprains. </p></div>		</li>
