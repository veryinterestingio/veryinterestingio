<p>Secondly what's wrong with continually spiking every enemy aircraft with individual radars so they can't tell whether they're just being continuously locked vs getting a missle launched? (Drown them out in noise)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Locking in a target in TWS works the same as a STT (single target track, aka normal lock), except that it uses only a fraction of radar's power to track a target, while the rest of it keeps sweeping normally searching for other targets. </p>
<p>Continually spiking every enemy aircraft won't &quot;drown them out in noise&quot; because RWR can differentiate between locks and launches. Therefore the pilot will know that he's being locked but not fired at. It would definitely be stressful though. Also, RWR systems are designed in a way that allows the pilot to read displayed information quickly, so he would know how many radars are locking him, what type of radar are they (e.g aicraft radar, search radar, surface to air missile) and how far away from him are they, so that he can filter one's that present actual threats from ones that are just annoying. For example, if you're being locked by a Su-27 figher which is 150 nautical miles away, you can low-key ignore that, and focus on an actual threat at hand. </p>
<p>That is obviously assuming we're talking high threat, high intensity enviroment, usually a pilot that is locked (or worse, fired upon) will just go full afterburner, 180 away and get out of there, no mission is important enough to risk a multi million dollar jet and tons of money and time put into training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the RWR tell the difference between a lock and a launch?</p>
<p>How would they be able to tell the difference between locks? If I were designing a ground based system I'd have multiple radars, one of those radars would be as identical to the missile as I can make. So for example if my ground based system tracks for 300kms and the enemy aircraft was 30kms and it happens my missle radar detects a distance of 35kms, then I'd use the missle radar on the ground based system so they don't know if I've actually launched or not.</p>
<p>Additionally, what's to stop someone designing a cruise missile/UAV that uses the same radar as a missile to mimic a rocket? It'd be very handy to essentially create a no-fly zone over a few hundred kilometers with a few UAVs/ cruise missles</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Isn't the point of all the training and technology is to achieve the mission objectives and deal with the obstacles that may come in the way of achieving them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With 4th and below generation aircraft, radars had to be physically steered - mechanical scan radars. They could be pointed, as rule of thumb, 60 degrees off center line. However, the trading systems need a regular update and scanning an entire volume, called a &quot;field of regard,&quot; takes too long, and time between target revisits would be insufficient. Search patterns are then reduced to something like 60 or 30 degrees in width and several beam widths high (maybe 3-6 degrees). The search pattern could be moved while tracking a target so long as the target was in that window.</p>
<p>Modern advanced tactical radars use an Electronically Scanned Array, which comes in Active or Passive flavors. They use circuits to induce wave physics effects to steer the beam and can do so virtually instantaneously. Such a radar can scan a volume far to the left, update multiple targets on the right, and provide data uplink to weapons forward without much regard to timelines and inertial rotation moments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as with everything, depends on the RWR, and the threat radar. Once you throw LPI radars and radar ECCM into the mix, its hard to determine just how much of a threat that short little dwell time of RF was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others said, flares are typically countermeasures against heatseekers. There's also other types of decoys, but they're used mostly by larger aicraft such as C-130s, AWACS's and so on.</p>
<p>Edit: Typical defense against a heatseeker is to back on the throttle (to reduce heat coming from the engine), dispense a large amount of flares while performing a high G turn. There's much more to it but missile defense would be enough to make a thread on it's own.</p></div>		</li>
