Also no. But it is possible that dark matter interacts only gravitationally.
At the moment if dark energy is constant, there will not be a big crunch. Otherwise there can be a cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by a cycle? </p>
<p>And furthermore, if I understand what you said correctly, this “cycle” can only happen if the dark energy is rising/accelerating and it can NOT happen if dark energy is constant. Correct or no?</p></div>		</li>
