<p>I've also heard rumors that sometimes these mattress companies are actually owned by the same &quot;mother companies&quot;, and just operating under different names. Haven't confirmed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah auto dealerships might not have been the best comparison to mattress stores because auto dealerships have a lot of very particular requirements about where they can and can't be built regarding things like open land and environmental concerns so it's not like you can just put them anywhere if there's only designated areas around it in cities where they can be built forcing them to Cluster to some extent</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the &quot;two of the same mattress store in the same strip mall&quot; was driven by a series of acquisitions that maybe were not super well thought out attempts to grab market share. I suspect many of those have or will close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more about markup.  The reason all those places sell mattresses is because the absurd markup.</p>
<p>They sell a mattress and make a minimum of $500, many more a thousand.  Vs something like getting into appliances, and selling them for $50 a pop profit.  It's just not worth the time to get into something like that compared to Mattresses.</p>
<p>If the average consumer was more intelligent, they could save hundreds and in some cases thousands by doing a little shopping.</p></div>		</li>
