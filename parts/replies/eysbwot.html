<p>The top answers don't get to the crux of the problem. They're just giving a different (but still improper) name to it.</p>
<p>As this post states its called Hemholtz Resonance. Yes it's like when you blow over the top of a bottle and get different tones. You can calculate the frequency of the tone based on the volume of the bottle and the area and length of the neck of the bottle. This is why when you remove/add liquid from/to the bottle you get a different tone; you're changing the volume of the bottle.</p>
<p>When it comes to your car the same thing is happening. There is a slug of air in the window that is vibrating back and forth rapidly changing the pressure inside the cabin. You hear this as a wubbing or buffeting. You can relieve this by opening a differently window slightly on the opposite side of the vehicle. This disrupts the coherence of vibration (aka resonance).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I'd like to note that it's not the volume of the bottle that matters, it's the mass of the air molecules in that volume. As the air mass gets heavier, the pitch changes. You just happen to increase the mass of that air spring by making the vessel larger. </p>
<p>I know the two are basically linked for anyone running their own experiments at home under a standard atmosphere of air pressure, but if we're after the &quot;why&quot;, it seems an important point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the comment tells you what it is and gives a link to a mostly-ELI5 article, but the comment itself doesn't explain how it works</p>
<p>This is ELI5, not &quot;give me the name and link me to an article about it&quot;, that's why this isn't top answer</p></div>		</li>
