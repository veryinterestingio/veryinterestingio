			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of correct.  They are filmed at what aspect ratio the director of photography and director decide is best for the film, but not all films released in theaters are filmed &quot;ultrawide&quot; specifically for the theater.   When released on DVD/blu-ray it should maintain the same aspect ratio it had when it was in the theaters.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also depend on the lenses used.  If a film is shot using anamorphic lenses, it will most likely finish with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>However, it usually boils down to creative choice.  Sometimes a wider aspect ratio works better to communicate a certain story.  In some cases, like Netflix originals, the aspect ratio is determined by the production company.  Netflix produces most of its shows and movies with a 2:1 aspect ratio.  My guess for that is that it's a compromised, &quot;in-between&quot; AR that works on TVs and mobile devices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A recent anime, <strong><em>Astra: Lost In Space</em></strong>, took good advantage of this. Most scenes, like when the characters were on the spaceship, were letterboxed (those black bars) but when they wanted to show something epic and grand, like space itself or the panoramic vista of a new world, they went into full screen mode. If it hadn't been pointed out to me, I never would have realized it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, but I believe in that case they framed some scenes rectangularly to make them more cinematic - say, Jack and an adversary on the far left and right sides of the screen, dramatically starting each other down over a safe distance. The whole thing was originally shot in standard 4:3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was originally a manga, and the first one I read when it came out. 49 chapters spread over 5 volumes. The anime was 12 episodes (Premiere and finale episodes were double length) It's a science fiction murder mystery with the emphasis on mystery. The plot twists in the series were great. Because it was a completed manga, the production company was able to keep to the manga story pretty faithfully. It just won an award for best of the summer season 2019.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Legion swaps between the aspect ratios as well, though I haven't to this day figured out what it's meant to indicate. It's a really cool style choice though. Has the effect of making certain sequences feel more 'cinematic' than others - possibly to make them feel more surreal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are filmed in these formats because that’s how the camera apertures are shaped. </p>
<p>Camera apertures are shaped that way because that’s the way film frames were shaped, and that’s the shape most filmmakers learned on and are comfortable with, and it has the widest support for the tools filmmakers know and use. </p>
<p>You’ve seen pictures of movie film strips. They have holes running down the sides. Those holes are for the camera/projector mechanism to move the film strip across its lens. Each frame in the film has traditionally been four holes high, meaning it takes up the length of four holes on the film strip. This is so that the frames can be perfectly synchronized with the opening of the camera's aperture, or the projector's light strobing behind it (remember, they didn't have computers back then, all this stuff was mechanical, so cameras/projectors were designed to open the aperture or make the light flash with every turn of the sprocket, which had four teeth on it). The film strip itself is 35mm wide. That’s how film frames gained that shape, which is a 21:9 ratio. </p>
<p>The shape of widescreen TV was chosen as a middle ground between standard TV (4:3 ratio) and movies (21:9 ratio).</p>
<p>So you’ve got 4:3 TV which can be expressed as 12:9. And you’ve got movies which are 21:9. What’s the middle ground between 12:9 and 21:9? The answer is 16:9. So that’s the ratio they picked for widescreen TV. And here we are.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't make sense to me. Just because the film strip is 35mm, why did they have to go with 21:9 ratio? Why not 1:1 ratio (35mm x 35mm frames) or 5 holes high?</p>
<p>Isn't the real reason because that's the ratio that filmmakers wanted it to be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well firstly, square 1:1 images were never a thing (unless stylistically) because we as humans like to see images with width- it's engrained in us to look at the mountain and surrounding.</p>
<p>21:9 (or 2.35:1, which is the actual name for it) came about because Studios in the 1960s were desperately trying to compete with TV which had nearly destroyed the whole film business. In order to get bums in seats, the specticle of widescreen came about, for vast massive images and vistas (think Laurance of Arabia). It worked- the screen size is pleasing to the eye, compositionally it gives a much wider scale and was a breath of fresh air compared to 1.33:1 (4:3) which was the standard 4 perf film. Filmmakers love it.</p>
<p>But how do you use the same 35mm film stock for much wider, grander and more detailed images? You can't get any wider than 35mm unless you pay loads of money to shoot the whole film on 70mm films. Instead of shooting 4 perf, you could shoot 3 or 2 perf to get the letterbox size, but then the image is really blurry and fuzzy when scaled up to the massive screens that they were playing on. To make things even more difficult, 35mm film isn't actually 35mm wide- you have spiggot wholes on either side as well as the audio track which is literally printed on the movie theatre copy of the film. You only have about 22mm of image.</p>
<p>They developed Anamorphic lenses. The wide 2.39:1 image is composed in camera, but the lens squeezes through special bit of glass in the lens into the 4:3 scale that film is imprinted on the film. Then, when playing at the movie theatre, the projector as a reversing lens on it, so the film stretches the image horrizontally so it looks normal. Not only normal, but the image looks just as good as 4:3 film, but filling up a screen twice as wide!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually added a little bit of explanation for that as you were typing.</p>
<p>Obviously, there have been different aspect ratios over the years. They went from five holes to four holes to make the picture wider to compete with TV. But back then aspect ratios were very much dictated by the people making cameras, film and projectors, not so much by the filmmakers.</p></div>		</li>
