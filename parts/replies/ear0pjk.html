			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not an astronaut, but quarantine is a very resource-intensive prospect, say, if you’re on a three year trip through space to a location with no infrastructure already in place (Mars, perhaps). </p>
<p>Say your crew is 7 people. One of them contracts space aids and now they must be quarantined. It is a disease which won’t kill them immediately, but the long-term prognosis is zero. Now, one of the crew has a reduced ability to perform their duties, if any ability at all. The other crew members now have to bear the added burden of caring for the victim at least to some extent, by giving them food, checking in on them, etc. This can be planned for in the design phase, maybe, by creating an isolated suite where work can be done by any one of the crew, whether specialized or not. Now, what happens if a second crew member contracts something, maybe something different? Another quarantine suite? Just how big is this seven-man vessel, anyhow?</p>
<p>I’d hate to be the first person to have to decide whether to keep someone in quarantine for the remainder of a <em>very</em> long voyage, or simply <strong>space</strong> them, but in the future I think this will be an inevitable topic of debate.</p>

<p>What do you mean with &quot;entire human population&quot;? We got resistant bacteria on earth too.</p></div>		</li>
