			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I kept my early bedtime sleep schedule even though I lost my job because I know myself will take forever to fix it if I don't. </p>
<p>Also easier to do because my roommates are still working and I just go to bed at around the same time they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jumping on here, but I want to add that controlling the light in your environment can really help. The light reaching your retinas affects the productions of hormones that affect your sleep cycle, like melatonin. Melatonin helps you fall asleep. Light inhibits melatonin synthesis, when your retinas are detecting light less melatonin is made. </p>
<p>This has made the news most often recently in articles recommending against using screens before bed. But if you're trying to change your sleep cycle, controlling light can be a big factor. </p>
<p>I personally have to be awake and at work much earlier than most people. (As in, I wake up around 2 am and at work by 4 am) Consequently, I need to be asleep earlier than most people and often while it is still daylight out. It is very helpful for me to go around and close my blinds and curtains a couple of hours before bedtime, to block out the bright sunlight. About an hour after that I start turning down my lights, going from all the overheads to just a few lamps and, as I am getting ready for bed, to dim night lights that let me see without being very bright. My room has blackout curtains so that my room is quite dark when I close them. I go to sleep well before the sun sets, but I still gradually dim my surroundings to mimic the effect, which lets me sleep much earlier than I could otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
