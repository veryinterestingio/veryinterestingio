<p>It is not anthropocentric to recognize that life on Earth is composed of extremely common elements that appear, simply based on the laws of chemistry, to be quite possibly the best suited to generating complex structure: Carbon is incredibly common and it's chemistry is some of the most flexible in the entire periodic table; Water is incredibly common and has almost unparalleled properties as a solvent.</p>
<p>I really think if we built an AI that knew nothing but the rules of chemistry, and basic specifications for life, it could reason from just that information that the most likely basic structure of life would be based on carbon chemistry in water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's an understatement :P</p>
<p>Carbon appears in more molecules than the rest of the elements combined. </p>
<p>There's a very good reason to expect life to be 'carbon based' as we are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give an example of how much carbon-based life makes sense, we need to understand why carbon works so well for us. Carbon really likes to form multiple bonds at once, but it doesn’t hold those bonds too tightly. This gives carbon-based molecules a rich, complicated structure, and it also allows them to be used for complicated reactions. It’s why we can have DNA that can not only hold a lot of information but also break apart and reform as part of the cell replication process.</p>
<p>Silicon is in the same group as carbon, meaning that it can theoretically form bonds just as rich in structure as carbon. There are two main obstacles to silicon-based life, though. First, silicon doesn’t like to let go of its bonds so easily, which makes it harder to use it for things like energy storage. Second, we can exchange carbon with the environment very easily through consumption of other carbon-based life and through respiration of carbon dioxide, but only one of these options seems likely for silicon-based life. Silicon dioxide is not a gas at the temperature ranges we expect to be hospitable to life, because it’s pretty hard to have complex chemistry at the temperatures where solid rock starts to vaporize.</p>
<p>Water has several properties that make it incredibly convenient as well. For one, it’s very simple and made of very common elements, which means it’s likely to be present everywhere in sufficient quantities to support complex interactions. It’s an incredible solvent, which helps it to serve as a medium for other reactions, and it’s very strongly polar, which can be a great way to differentiate it from other common substances. The phospholipid bilayer that forms the basis of our cell walls depends on there being a separation of polar and non-polar media, for instance. It experiences all of its phases in a convenient range of temperatures, and its solid phase is less dense than its liquid phase, both of which are convenient for creating the water cycle.</p>
<p>Ammonia is a common proposal for another life-sustaining liquid, as is liquid methane, as they both exhibit many of the more useful traits of water at the right temperature ranges. Life based on either of these would at least be comprehensible to us, even though we wouldn’t be able to coexist. The trick then is that we’d need to get around the oxygen problem. Oxygen is useful for its sheer willingness to react and release energy, and having it as part of the aqueous medium is convenient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. The only way we could know something is life at the distances we're observing is by spectral analysis. Right now we only have our own planet for comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further on this, scientist have been looking to extreme environments on Earth for answers as to what alien life could be like -- caves and deep sea vents for example. We currently know of microscopic life forms that generate energy for themselves by breaking bonds between molecules in the rock walls of caves, not relying at all on energy from organic inputs/&quot;food&quot; sources. These things take hundreds of years to grow centimeters, but could ostensibly exist on a barren planet with little to no other organic life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure. Even then though, we're still limited to knowledge of carbon based life. I think it's unlikely we'll fine anything different than that on our planet, but I see no reason other life couldn't form from a different set of base molecules.</p></div>		</li>
