<p>Viruses are finely tuned, so as they adapt to those other cells, they start to lose the capacity to effectively infect the original human cells</p>

<p>Can you elaborate a bit on this? If they can adapt to the chicken cells, why can't they adapt back to the human cells? Is there just not enough time before the human immune system detects and destroys it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less this. The adaptation to, say, chicken cells takes several “passages,” or cycles of replication, to occur. Each passage involves getting fresh chicken cells, applying the virus to them, letting it replicate and disperse fresh viral particles, harvesting those, and applying to the next batch of chicken cells. When the vaccine virus infects a human again, it doesn’t have any time to re-adapt, because the human immune system attacks it immediately, both wiping it out and developing antibodies that will remember it. If the same virus or any closely-related strain infects the same human again, the antibodies will help wipe it out before it can gain a foothold.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This can in fact happen with some vaccines. Most notably, the oral polio vaccine (OPV) is a live attenuated strain of poliovirus, with several mutations that prevent it from causing disease in humans. But it is capable of replicating and spreading from person to person, which has the benefit of making more people immune than were originally vaccinated, but also makes it possible for the attenuating mutations to revert to wild type. This is actually a fairly big problem with OPV, in recent years as many or more polio cases have come from vaccine derived poliovirus as from wild poliovirus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OPV is also a superior vaccine to inactivated polio virus (IPV) in terms of the strength and durability of the protection, but because of the risks you mentioned, it's been phased out and replaced by IPV in countries that have extremely low polio rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought some virus vaccines used partial viruses...like, instead of the entire DNA or RNA structure of a virus, they simply included some portion of it, that was not capable on its own of infection, but still trained our immune system to recognize that structure when it saw it again, even as part of the complete virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some do. You can use just a protein from the virus in question to stimulate an immune response. DNA and/or RNA are trickier, because they typically won’t appear outside an infected cell (where immune cells and antibodies could find them). Nucleic acid-based vaccines typically encode a viral protein (one that appears on the surface of the viral particle) and cause cells to produce and excrete it to generate an immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some vaccines do just use a part of the bacteria or virus.  Vaccines can be live but weak pathogens, dead pathogens, just part of the pathogen, or recombinant- where you add a part of the virus to the surface or a harmless virus. (This is a simplified explanation)</p></div>		</li>
