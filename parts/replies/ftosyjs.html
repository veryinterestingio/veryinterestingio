			<div class="markdown"><p>A second, slightly different factor also contributes. Water has a higher heat capacity than air. That means it takes more energy from your body to heat the water around you up to body temperature than air around you.</p>
<p>Heat conduction = speed of energy transfer</p>
<p>Heat capacity = amount of energy required to change temperature</p>
<p>Both play a role in this phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated. Sometimes, but not always. Metal has high conductance but low capacity, which is why metal feels cold for a bit, then warm when you touch it. Water has high conductance and capacity. </p>
<p>Electrical conductivity and heat conductivity are related, though. I don't know the details, but something about free electrons being a mechanism for heat conduction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but there are exceptions. I think rocket heat shielding can be one such example. There’s a video on YouTube of a guy taking out glowing red cubes out of a furnace, putting them on the table and then handling them with his bare hands even though they’re red hot still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are correlated. Mass and heat transfer is based on the makeup of each material, and the rate of transfer is based on the capacitance and temperature of each material. It's all in the maths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Density comes in to play in this fun little equation, too. Specific heat capacity is measure in KJ/Kg * K, so the amount of energy (Kilojoules, KJ) recquires per Kilogram (Kg) per degree Kelvin (K). Since water is denser than air, you are in contact with more mass, AND you need more energy to heat up that mass. Double whammy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Put the same hot thing in both. The cup will be hotter to touch than the thermos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Ceramics&quot; is a very broad term, and there are a variety of materials with a variety of physical characteristics. For example, zirconia has a low thermal conductivity, but aluminum nitride has a significantly higher thermal conductivity.</p>
