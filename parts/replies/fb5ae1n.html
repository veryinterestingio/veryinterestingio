			<div class="markdown"><p>So, sometimes I will add a little bit of vinegar to my one tablespoon of detergent. Mostly in cases of my child wetting the bed. It takes the pee smell out perfectly. Are you saying it works better to add the vinegar later?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Detergent is alkaline.  Vinegar is acidic.  Basically (pun intended) the two compounds are going to cancel each other out if they are used in the same step of the laundry cycle.  In the laundry soap aisle at your grocery story or walmart or where ever you shop look for a product called washing soda.  Make sure it is washing soda, not baking soda.  Washing Soda boosts the PH of your wash, helping clean and take away odors.  Don't use vinegar with washing soda.  </p>
<p>To get rid of odors from bed wetters try a product called Lysol Laundry Sanitizer.  It has no bleach in it, but it will take out the worst odors a small child can produce, it will also take out the worst of the worst odors that an elderly adult will produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, a bit. Vinegar can make the detergent slightly less effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Add it in place of fabric softener. Most washers have a section to pour the softener which will release after the initial wash cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do not mix vinegar with OxiClean. At best, it will be a waste, and at worst, you could potentially cause some serious damage.</p>
<p>OC is basically sodium percarbonate (washing soda plus hydrogen peroxide). Sodium percarbonate is a base, vinegar is an acid. Mixing acids and bases causes an exothermic reaction, &amp; in the presence of an oxidizing agent (such as hydrogen peroxide), you could potentially start a fire. Even if you don't start a fire, you can wind up with a harmful corrosive, such as peracetic acid.</p>
<p>Best case scenario is that it does nothing or causes an eruption of foam from the washer. Worst case scenario could be potentially life-threatening in the form of fire or corrosive damage. Don't mix them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they misspoke, but everything else they said is right. Lipids have a head and a tail. The head is hydrophilic, and that's what interacts with the water. The tail is hydrophobic, and that's what interacts with the dirt. When you have a bunch of lipids in a water solution, the heads will assemble facing out and the tails facing in (called a micelle) to make the inside essentially water-free. You can see this on a macro scale when you add oil to water.</p></div>		</li>
