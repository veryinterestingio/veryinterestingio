			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I wanted to add. The Zika virus is actually a great example of this. They found that it runs rampant through children's brains, but it really doesn't target adult brains cells for some weird reason. Then they found that it does seem to target Giloblastoma (perhaps one of the worst cancers you could get as it's basically untreatable and almost always fatal) cells. There is a very good chance that future treatments of Giloblastoma could simply be a significant dose of live Zika viruses being injected directly into the tumor. Then with molecular surgical precision, it'll kill off the cancer cells and leave the healthy cells unaffected. Quite exciting!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cancer immunologist here. There is an added bonus that cancer usually adapts to suppress the immune system in some way in order to avoid an anti-tumor immune response. So therapies based on using viruses can exploit this fact by introducing viruses that the immune system normally has no problem controlling but in the tumor the immune system is suppressed and so the virus replicates only in the tumor. That's the theory at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's crazy. How / why does it know to do that? Is it just a evolutionary selection pressure of some sort causing selective &quot;breeding&quot; of cancer cells that are don't trigger the immune response? Or is it that we only see cancer cells that have already mutated in a way that doesn't trigger the response? </p>
<p>Also, another off topic question, but: My understanding is chemotherapy targets fast growing cells. Is the targeting effectiveness of chemo proportional to the speed of the cell growth? E.g, would slow cancers be less affected by Chemo? If so, is there a way to actually <em>increase</em> the cancer growth rate while administering Chemo as a way of differentiation between healthy normal (slow) cells, and the cancer cells?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not an oncologist here, but yes its a bit of both.</p>
<p>Right now every person everywhere has cancerous cells in their bodies. Most of these mutated dysfunctional cells don't become full on malignant monsters as the mechanism for apoptosis (cell death) remains intact and they self destruct, they get recognized as cancerous by the immune system and are targeted for elimination, or the necessary defects in the oncogenes and anti-oncogenes (genes that control and inhibit growth respectively) aren't there to create the &quot;perfect malignant storm.&quot;</p>
<p>Cancerous cells have to have the right set of circumstances and mutations in order to escape inherent cellular control systems and the body's defences in order to become full on tumors. So yes the cancers that develop into life threatening tumors that we see have in a way been &quot;selectively pressured&quot; to be the way they are.</p>
<p>To this end, I remember a huge landmark study was just completed recently that was the equivalent of the &quot;Human Genome Project&quot; but for cancer. I think the media called it the genetic map for cancer or something. Basically its being touted as an enormous tool for researchers in identifying many of the common denominator genes that many cancers have in common that allow it to escape  immune system detection and grow uncontrollably.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As far as I know, that is the answer; else, the immune system would already have killed them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, they usually aren't. Chances are that if you're able to make a connection based on information you've learned, someone else has also been able to make that connection before. In my experience, most scientific ideas we toss around in lab have likely already been at least thought of if not actually done by others.</p>
<p>That said...someone is always the first to have an idea. Crazy ideas probably aren't new, but they had to be new at some time. Plus, learning what others learned from that crazy idea might help you make more connections to future crazy ideas. In other words, keep thinking of crazy ideas!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The challenge with cancer cells is that they are not very different from healthy cells and they are not a unique cell &quot;type&quot;. They can be identical to the original as far as their surface goes. </p>
<p>But finding unique targets on cancer cells and using viral vectors to target these is one of the most active areas in all of cancer research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked in a chemotherapy lab, something else to consider when thinking about cancer treatments in general:</p>
<p>It's really hard to selectively target just the oncogenic (cancerous) cells as they mostly look and act like your healthy cells - in fact that is the essence of most cancer treatment research - we have plenty of ways to kill cancerous cells but leaving your healthy cells intact is way harder. We have nukes and we're trying to make smart bombs.</p></div>		</li>
