<p>Edit: Every person seems to think I’m talking about my nipples. While they did darken, I’m talking about my vulva.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pregnant women also get that darkened vertical line down the middle of their tummies.</p>
<p>Some women also develop a condition from pregnancy &amp; birth control pills called Melasma. It's a splotchy darkness on the face.</p>
<p>I've also never heard of the color reverting back to pre-pregnancy, but I suppose it's possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dark nipples and linea nigra went back to normal after my first pregnancy. The melasma spot on my face did not. Now 28 weeks into my second pregnancy, haven’t gotten the dark nipples or the linea nigra, but I do have another spot of melasma on my face. Going to try some vitamin C cream to fade them but I may have to wait until after baby is born and weaned to do some more intense treatments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you are correct, melanin is NOT an amino acid. Even with OP's correction- just because something has the same elements as an amino acid doesn't make it one. Melanin's structure does not contain any <em>acid</em> functional groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how it works though, something's not an amino acid just because it has carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. There are hundreds of amino acids sure, but melanin is not one of them. Melanins however ARE derived from an amino acid, tyrosine.</p></div>		</li>
