<p>Think of bandwith like a highway and the data like a package carried by a car you want sent somewhere. The more bandwith the more lanes the highway has so the more cars and packages can be sent at the same time. </p>
<p>With the time based method the packages arriving at certain times are ment for certain people, with the frequency method packages arriving by certain lanes are ment for different people. If you combine the two, packages that arrive at a certain time and by a certain lane are ment for a certain person. </p>
<p>additionally, everyone who ordered a package has an ID number that can be used to determine if a package is theirs or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mobile phones neither use Time-Division Multiple Access
(TDMA)  or Frequency-Division Multiple Access (FDMA). </p>
<p>FDMA was use for the old analog system and TDMA was used for 2G. Today it is Code-division multiple access (CDMA) that is used.</p>
<p>It is a bit complex to explain but multiple phones can transmit on the same frequency at the same time the way the signal is encoded make it possible to pick the signal apart and get the data each device transmited. </p>

<p>The ELI5 is that one phone speaks french and the other speaks english. An english speaker will be able to easily listen to the english language while tuning out the french, and vice versa, even if the other language is being spoken loudly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really a limit per-se, but a single tower can only have so much total bandwidth, so if you split that tower 10,000 ways, then each phone only has really slow speeds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. There are different kinds of cell tower, each of which has been designed for different scenarios or locations. If you used a cell tower intended for use in a dense downtown or mall in a rural location you won’t get the range needed. </p>
<p>I don’t think you’re ever communicating simultaneously with multiple cell towers, your call lives with one tower and then hands off to another. I don’t know if LTE or 5G allow for multi-path routing of data packets to multiple towers, that would be pretty neat if it was possible and could help increase speed if you were in range of multiple local high-power towers. </p>
<p>It might also help the network operator steer traffic toward higher throughput internet backhauls, because each cell tower is really just a big fancy Wifi Access Point, which plugs into its router somewhere else (maybe another city or county away) and needs a fast <del>ethernet</del> fibre optic cable run across the city to connect the two. Different trenches get dig at different times for those 10G / 40G / 100Gigabit backhauls, and retrenching is lots of work. Telling clients to prefer the 100G, slightly further away Tower vs the closer 10G tower could offset the need to re-trench more Fibre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a limit, but it's more complicated than &quot;traffic per square metre&quot;. Engineers would talk about &quot;Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio&quot; SINR.</p>
<p>If two towers are transmitting at the same time, frequency and code, then they will interfere and the signal will be garbled. But if you space the towers out, then a signal from a tower further away will be weaker, and you can treat it as &quot;noise&quot; on top of the &quot;signal&quot; you're getting from a nearby tower. If it's far enough away, the SINR will be high and everything works. &quot;Far enough&quot; depends how powerful each of their transmissions are. You can pack towers closer together if they all use lower power, and that will increase the amount of data you can transmit per square metre. That means installing extra towers and cabling, and it means more handovers between towers, which are an additional complexity. So it becomes a question of cost. Can you get a return on investment before you have to upgrade to the next generation (3G, 4G, 5G...)?</p></div>		</li>
