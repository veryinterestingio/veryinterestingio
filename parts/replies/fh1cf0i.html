			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt that atmospheric dust would get as high as the ISS, which orbits at around 200 miles above Earth's surface. In atmospheric terms, dust is actually quite heavy and tends to fall out of the sky within at maximum 20ish days. That part I can find a <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/dirt-atmospheric-dust" target="_blank">source</a> for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking more like micrometeoroids or space dust or space junk.</p>
<p>After some googling it looks like that is a problem, and it's solved by something called a Whipple shield.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've intrigued me. JW So in a spaceship living 4 astronauts, say live in ship for 6 monthes, how do they keep from accumulating dust and preventing corrosion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atmospheric erosion in  ISS  comes mostly from  combination of atomic oxygen  erosion  and radiation‑induced embitterment. Atmosphere at that high altitude contains lots of single‑oxygen atoms aka atomic oxygen (AO) and it's very reactive. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>AO is produced when short‑wavelength UV radiation reacts with molecular oxygen in the upper atmosphere. It is the most significant component of the space environment at ISS altitude in terms of material degradation. AO oxidizes many metals, especially silver, copper, and osmium. AO reacts strongly with any material containing carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and hydrogen bonds, meaning that many polymers react and erode. Polymers containing fluorine, such as Teflon®, react synergistically, meaning that the reactivity to AO increases with longer exposure to UV radiation (Pippin et al., 2004).  Even materials with AO protective coatings can degrade because of AO undercutting erosion at protective coating defect sites (Figure 3; Banks et al., 2004).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. There is not enough dust to even begin to make an impact. Not enough even to slow the vehicle. Compare this to an airplane which flies through the atmosphere all the time. Some planes on long haul routes even spend more time in the air than on the ground. They experience very little erosion despite’s 600 mph airstream with dust and other particles passing over the aircraft body continuously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The overwhelming majority of the ISS is simply anodized aluminum. Softgoods are typically covered in beta cloth, which is a Teflon-coated fiberglass fabric that is highly resistant to both UV degradation and atomic oxygen erosion.</p>
<p>One material on ISS that is very vulnerable to atomic oxygen erosion is kapton (polyimide film), which will get eaten away to nothing. It's the orange stuff on the back side of the solar arrays. The solar arrays are coated with a thin layer of silicon dioxide to protect them.</p></div>		</li>
