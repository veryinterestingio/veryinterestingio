<p>Do the water molecules carry the salt down along with them, or does the salt travel downwards through the water like a sediment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not qualified to guess, so I'll go ahead and do that anyway. It's probably a bit of both. Salt dissolves into water, so the water would have to be the method of transportation for any salt that's dissolved in the water. But water also has a maximum saturation level, which is lower in cold water than hot water, and I'd imagine at times that level is reached?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, water can have a salt concentration of around 25% (slightly lower at 0C). But seawater usually has concentrations around 3.5%. So it is quite far from the saturation limit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water moves. Water bodies of different densities (whether from different salinities, temperatures, silt loads, oxygen content, etc) takes a suprisingly long time to thoroughly mix without agitation.</p>
<p>Here's a rough illustration of the Atlantic ocean's cross section by latitude. You'll notice that the cold saline bottom water from the Antarctic gets up to 40 degrees North Latitude, and water from the North Atlantic gets down to 40 degrees South latitude. That's about 6000 miles.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, it's just like any other ice. Ideally, you would rinse it off first, because there would be salt water on the surface, but the larger the piece of ice, the less that would matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so does desalinization involve a freezing step then to separate the salt or is it some other method. The reason I ask is I've always heard we don't tackle fresh water deficits with desalinization because its an expensive process that isn't worth it in the end. But it seems like if you had to just freeze it and separate the ice and melt it back down how expensive could that really be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When seawater freezes, it pushes salt out which makes the cold, salty, dense water that sinks down to the bottom of the ocean, as OP said. However, IIRC, some of that salt gets trapped <em>inside</em> the sea ice in little pockets of hypersaline brine. I've never been near sea ice to try eating it before (I wisely chose to study tropical critters), but I'd imagine that it would still taste a bit salty because of those brine pockets. Also, there are a fair amount of algae and bacteria that live in those little pockets so that's something to consider too. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What other places have Bottom Water (implied by this stuff being Antarctic Bottom Water)? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's Antarctic bottom water because it originates in the Antarctic, but it eventually (10,000 years scale) makes it's way through all the oceans and cycles back up to the Pacific. Other water parcels are named for where they originated and where sit relative to each other, like the North Atlantic deep water and Mediterranean Intermediate water.</p></div>		</li>
