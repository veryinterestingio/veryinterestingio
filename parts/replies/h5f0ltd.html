			<div class="markdown"><p>The stomach is usually quite sterile. There are some pathogens (helicobacter pylori) that can cause problems (gastritis) and if the acidity is low normal microflora also can be found but it is usually a quite sterile environment due to the acidity. Most pathogens rely on getting through quickly to more livable environment as stated above but the gastric part of the tract does not normally have thriving organisms in it. Going further it is a whole different story. Humans and gut-bacteria co-exist in a mutually beneficial way and this is one of the reasons one should maintain a healthy diet and, if on a course of medication that interferes, probiotics are really helpful. I really urge enyone with a little time to read at least a little on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also this explains why if you get a gastric ulcer perforation (excluding large bleeding and other complicatioons ofc) it can be treated without surgery - basically sterile environment creates an inflammation that is painful and all but resolves by itself. Perforation of the large intestine (sometimes is covered by the omentum/fatty tissue and resolves also but not as usual as with less infectious tissue) on the other hand causes easily more inflammation and more severe complications due to the microflora (large scale peritonitis/abscesses/sepsis/etc.). That is why appendicitis usually needs surgery - if it bursts the complications are more severe and the recovey time is prolonged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>H. pylori is more of a commensal than a pathogen. It can cause gastritis and ulcers, but it only causes illness in a minority of people who have it. For most of human history almost everyone had H. pylori living in their stomachs, you can even use H. pylori strains to track human migration around the globe. Its so well adapted to living in the human stomach that its not naturally found in any other species or environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. This is just something that came to mind first and it most definitely is not considered normal gastric microflora today. Intestinal worms were prevalent also until the age of antibiotics drastically reduced the prevalnece (in humans) in more advanced countries. 100 years ago most people had more than a few parasites/pathogens going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is a mainly colon bacteria that can cause infections when introduced to normally sterile human tissues. Usually though e.coli, s.aureus, clostridum, streptococci etc. - depending on where they are more prevalent - are the usual infectious causes of most soft tissue infections. The rule is - more common things happen more often - and it applies to all medical cases. I'm not a specialised GI surgeon/infectionist (other type of surgery for me) so this is about as far as i'm comfortable expanding this subject without additional research.</p></div>		</li>
