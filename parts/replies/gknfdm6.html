			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Unpopular opinion: Although totally ELI5 in style, s/he actually sailed right over the specific question that was asked: “How does WiFi etc. pass through walls?”</strong> Here is where said sailing over occurs, at the very end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walls happen to be &quot;transparent&quot; to radio even though they're &quot;solid&quot; to visible colors</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like, the response adopts the perfect ELI5 flavor, and sets you up for an explanation with a bunch of relevant facts. But when the moment comes to tie everything together and actually explain <em>how</em> (or perhaps <em>why</em>) these signals can pass through walls, <strong>the “explanation” is simply a rephrasing of the observation (that they can pass through walls) in ELI5 language</strong>, giving the impression of an answer without really ever actually explaining it. But you need to think about it for a second to avoid being fooled.</p>
<p>After reading this response, while I def give it 5 stars for nailing that ELI5 feel, I still don’t understand the specific science behind how or why infrared and radio signals can pass through objects.</p>
<p>I upvoted anyway though, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Explaining how everything is a field and they interact (or don't) in different ways is tricky for ELI5. Once I accepted that everything is energy in some field or other interacting with other fields, understanding why some photons passed through some materials but not others and why (sort of) the Higgs field bestows mass became much easier. I just can't figure out a way to simplify what I see in my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it applies to all of the electromagnetic spectrum - want to know how come X-Rays work?  It's because your skin / muscle / fat / organs are transparent to them but your bones are not.  So they just take a picture of you with X-rays instead of normal light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The neat part is that these aren't analogies, it's not <em>like</em> light of a different color, it <em>is</em> light of a different color. </p>
<p>Put differently, light is just wifi in colors you can see :)</p>
<p>They certainly did an excellent job of framing that response, though, super easy to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2nd to last paragraph is made of analogies my friend. Just because they’re closer to truth doesn’t mean they’re not analogies—they still used a model of something we experience every day to help us understand something we don’t.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, what kinds of atoms it has and how they're arranged. Objects are made of little packets called &quot;atoms&quot; (fnord), and light is made of little packets called &quot;photons&quot; (DOUBLE fnord), which are also somehow waves (all the 'fnords' in the world won't get me out of this one), so basically the spacing between the atoms and the size of the atoms themselves (or more accurately the size of the electron cloud-shell-fuzzy-quantum-fnord-thingy around the atom) determines which frequencies of light bounce off or get eaten or whatever at what ratios.</p>
<p>I had this huge long metaphor about a bunch of dudes on inflatable pool floaties in a wave pool, but then I realized it was mostly &quot;not quite right&quot; and I didn't want to give you any bad science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The truth, generally, is that a part of the wave is absorbed, a part is reflected and a part is transmitted. The properties you are looking for is absorptivity, reflectivity and transmissivity. They are governed by the properties of the material such as which atoms are present, which configuration they are in (including which state the material is in), how thick the material is, etc, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electric permittivity and magnetic permeability.  Reflections occur when a wave hits an abrupt change in material (going from air to glass for example).  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations" target="_blank">This link</a> does a good job explaining it, but is definitely NOT ELI5 approved.</p></div>		</li>
