			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Sometimes the misfolded PrP doesn't originate in the brain at all, but is consumed (vCJD, Kuru in humans, CWD is deer). There is a lot of work going into looking at the specific cell types that are more susceptible to being infected with misfolded prions and which ones are likely to propagate the disease. </p>
<p>Interestingly, there are instances of CJD where we find cell death in a given area where there aren't any noticable plaques of misfolded PrP, and we have found places loaded with misfolded PrP plaques yet very little to no cell death. </p>
<p>Still lots of work to do, but we do know that different prion diseases have <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article/66/1/99/284868" target="_blank">preference for different brain regions</a> (the paper linked describes this in mice with TME, but another example is the prion disease 22L, which is a subtype of the rodent-adapted (from sheep) prion disease Scrapie, preferentially affects the cerebellum, whereas ME7, another Scrapie subtype, preferentially affects the cortex and deep brain structures). In addition, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005551" target="_blank">cell type</a> also plays a role in which strain affects which area.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately not. Even the acid in the stomach isn't enough to get rid of misfolded prions. </p>
<p>Generally, the infectious prion would travel up the nervous system that innervates the gut to the brain (Vagus nerve, etc.). Now, most prion disease can only replicate in the central nervous system (ie. spinal cord or brain). Some prion diseases, like Chronic Wasting Disease (deer, elk, moose, reindeer), replicate peripherally (spleen and lymphatic tissue usually) before invading the CNS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prions are surprisingly hardy, even the normal process of autoclaving isnt enough to destroy them (it can but takes special chemicals, higher pressure, higher temperature, and longer time). It's best practice to just incinerate and dispose of prion contaminated materials.</p></div>		</li>

<p>we do know that different prion diseases have preference for different brain regions (for example, the prion disease 22L, which is a subtype of the sheep prion disease Scrapie, preferentially affects the cerebellum, whereas ME7, another Scrapie subtype, preferentially affects the cortex and deep brain structures)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's the root cause of these differences?</p>
<p>Is it different variations of the prion protein that causes different areas of the brain to be affected?</p>
<p>Is it where the prion protein just happens by chance to end up in the brain that causes the different diseases?</p>
<p>Is it the same prion protein but with a different host genetic background that leads to these different disease subtypes?</p>
<p>If you took some 22L prion infected tissue and infected another sheep, do they always develop the 22L disease subtype?</p>
<p>What about if you took material from a 22L cerebellum and transplanted it to the cortex of a healthy sheep? Would that sheep develop the ME7 subtype, or the 22L subtype?</p>
<p>Sorry for the wall of questions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't know for sure. The best hypothesis is that due to the unique 3D structure that each individual strain adopts, certain cell types may be more or less susceptible to amplification of the misfolded prion. So depending on the cells present in a given brain area (and the trafficking between certain cell types), certain prion disease will be more &quot;infectious&quot; to these areas than others. There is also the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/318/5852/930" target="_blank">cloud hypothesis</a> which describe the possibility that each &quot;strain&quot; will have many different conformations of misfolded PrP and that when they transfer between hosts, a certain shape within that cloud will be preferentially selected to amplify based on the cell types that are present.</p>
<p>If you pass 22L from one sheep to another sheep (same hosts basically), they yes, they will always develop 22L (although I should clarify that 22L, ME7 and other strains aren't true sheep prion diseases, they are rodent-adapted scrapie diseases - ie. they were selected for in the lab from classical scrapie derived from actual sheep via passage through transgenic mice). There is one outlier prion disease type though - the transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) strain known as &quot;drowsy&quot; (due to the phenotype of the animal being very lethargic), when put through animals at a high enough concentration, changes to another TME strain called &quot;hyper&quot; (due to the animals being hyperaggressive and hyper sensitive to stimuli). This is the only prion strain known to do this though.</p>
<p>If you took 22L cerebellum (from the mouse, as I mentioned above these are all rodent-adapted scrapie variants) and injected it into the cortex of the same transgenic mouse, they will still develop 22L and not other variations.</p>
<p>No worries on the questions, just takes me a little more time to get decently formulated answers with paper citations.</p></div>		</li>
