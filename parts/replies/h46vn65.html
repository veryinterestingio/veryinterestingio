<p>The short answer is that people have no inclination to learn the rules of the sub they have come to from r/all, so for a stricter sub the up/downvote system doesn't work very well.</p>
<p>People like jokes, anecdotes, and snide political-ish statements. None of which are allowed here (rules 3 and 5). This subreddit has a specific and narrow vision, its not a general purpose QA sub, in order to keep it within its original vision we need to enforce rules, that don't line up with the general publics taste.</p>
<p>EDIT: feel free to message in mod mail if you want to continue this discussion.</p></div>		</li>
