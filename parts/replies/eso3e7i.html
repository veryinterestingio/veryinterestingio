			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The biggest prey depends on the species of carnivorous plant.  The plant I work with (Sarracenia purpurea) has been known to capture and digest something as large as salamanders; however, the largest carnivorous plant (Nepenthes rajah) can capture frogs, lizards, and even small birds and mammals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don't typically think of plants as apex predators, but carnivorous plants certainly have a unique niche.  There are several larval moth species that feed on different parts of the plant (leaf tissue, roots, etc.), and deer will occasionally browse the tops of S. purpurea. In the range of tropical pitcher plants,  there are actually a few Malaysian and Bornean tribes that use the pitchers as a food source (they stuff them with rice and vegetables!).</p>
</li>
<li>It's pretty unlikely the plants will ever get that large!</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This plant is gathered as traditional medicine among the Cree and Metis of Alberta, Canada. There are probably other nations who use it as medicine. It is considered to be a very important medicine plant. Do you think the microorganisms in the food web of S. purpurea might have an effect on humans, if ingested? Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the follow-up information-- I think it's fascinating and would love to find a good book about the traditional medicinal/cultural uses of the plants.</p>
<p>It's hard to say what the effects would be, but given the wide range of bacterial Phyla present in the pitchers, it is possible that something in there could be either beneficial or harmful.  I cannot comment with certainty on this (and don't recommend drinking the liquid-- it often smells pretty awful!), but it's certainly an interesting idea to consider.</p></div>		</li>
