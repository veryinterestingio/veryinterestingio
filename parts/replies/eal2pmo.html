			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, spider vision expert here. You summarized it correctly. In fact, the former doctoral student you mentioned (collaborator of mine) just published a paper on exactly this topic. Here’s a NY Times video on it: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000006182460/how-to-give-a-spider-an-eye-test.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000006182460/how-to-give-a-spider-an-eye-test.html</a></p>
<p>This is specific to jumping spiders, but there is no reason to assume it would be different in other, less visual, families.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So secondary eyes pretty much just add more peripheral vision?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that might be a good way to understand it; a spider's primary eyes are like your high-resolution, high-quality foveal vision that you use to investigate objects - its secondary eyes are like your lower-resolution, low-quality peripheral vision that you use for vigilance and orienting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the outer areas of our retinas, which control your peripheral vision, have more &quot;light&quot; detectors (<del>cones?  Can't remember which</del> rods) vs the center which has more &quot;color&quot; detectors.</p>
<p>You can see this in action by looking at stars at night.  Find a star you want to look at, then move your eyes about five degrees away from the star in either direction and use your peripheral vision; the star will appear brighter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good way to look at it is in terms of survival. Your peripheral vision makes up a lot of your field of vision. Your central vision is relatively small. Why is this. Well if you want to protect yourself from say a lion, it really helps to be able to know that there is something out there trying to kill you to begin with. It doesn’t matter if it is or is not a lion. Knowing that there is something out there that could be a lion is what’s important. Peripheral vision can see more of the world in the sense that it has a wider field and this can detect more potential threats. Moreover, rods require very little light and are good at contrast and movement. This is useful for detecting predators at night and if they are camouflauged. Remember the lion. We are more likely to notice it moving and it will stand out a bit against similarly colored terrain. </p>
<p>There’s also a really interesting disorder commonly known as blindsight  in which the parts of the brain associated with processing detail and identifying what something is gets damaged but the parts of the brain that help respond the to rod input and where something is is unaffected. What ends up happening is people will say they can see anything, but if you tell them to walk though a room full of desks they will successfully navigate around them. This indicates that in some sense we literally have at least two very distinct ways in which we see the world.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im kinda late to the party a little here, but wanted to add:  From what I have read and surmised on this subject is that evolution has two basic avenues it takes to address this engineering problem.  Either really super great eyes and a little brain, or sorta ok eyes and a really big brain to stitch together the world from what info it gets.   Spiders being the former and humans being the latter.  That, and all shades between.  And then Eagles and Mantis Shrimps as examples of outliers.   What do you think, that about right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's a more primitive eye sensing light and lack of light stimulus, it's probably closer to you being able to feel sources of cold and heat coming from different areas around your body. You know heat is there but don't know what it is that's hot. In the same sense primitive eyes sense &quot;there's light coming from this way&quot; or &quot;there isnt light coming from this way&quot; but have no idea why. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t our eyes work similar? Center of the eye for focus outer eye for peripheral which key in on movement better? Like at night if you are trying to locate something moving don’t look strait at it. </p></div>		</li>
