			<div class="markdown"><p>It usually does mean fewer kids though. People have a much harder time conceiving at later ages. Many either don't conceive or take so much time that they end up choosing to have fewer kids in total. The risks involved grow significantly after 30 and even more after 40.</p>
<p>And a lot of people who might have said &quot;I want two or three children&quot; often bow out after realising how hard it is to combine a well-developed career with having a child.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The number of women aged 40-44 that has no kids have dropped from 20 % in 2006 to 14% in 2016. The opposite trend to what OP was suggesting. Of course, it could be moving again in the other direction for millenials, but we will not know before 2030.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP did mention that people he talks to are in their 20-30s. It could just be that they feel that way at the moment. They still may change their minds in their later 30s.</p>
<p>You are right though. It is very different. Some countries have definitely felt the sting of low birth rates. Japan and Korea come to mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're better than the US, if that's your point of comparison.  But taking 1-2 years off to raise kids is still a major financial decision and even in a perfect world would have a major impact on your career momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot are, and it's a really great thing. But being able to get paid while taking an extended leave unfortunately doesn't mean that there aren't going to be other impacts to someone's career. You still received the money you otherwise would have gotten, but the suspicion is that it impacts promotion/compensation decisions after you return. And it's very difficult to build rules around preventing that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Better doesn't guarantee kids either :).The pivotal point is during the 9 months and the year after giving birth.</p>
<p>That's what makes having a child such an interruption.A five year old or 6 year, yeah day care helps, certainly. But it negates the problem of, 'what happens during the birthing process'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your research, has climate anxiety had an impact yet? I know in my circle of friends it's a big deal, but we're all middle-class background well-educated millenials. It's not like <em>none</em> of the people my age have kids, but those who do, are talking about not adding more after 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not currently doing research on populations (although I might for my master thesis).<br />
Although this would be an interesting topic to cover.  </p>
<p>I can imagine, although none of my readings has suggested it, that it could have <strong>an</strong> impact but it might be minimal. Bigger things like, mother protection laws and other stuff I mentioned earlier are better indicators.</p></div>		</li>
