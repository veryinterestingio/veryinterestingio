			<div class="markdown"><p>Most modern research seems to point to dinos being warm blooded, or at least closer to warm blooded vs cold blooded.</p>

<p>That's generic, but there are lots of articles and research papers in the results. &quot;It's generally accepted in modern dino research&quot; would probably be a more apt way of putting the warm blooded situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find any evidence to suggest larger animals are more likely to fossilize.  It varies wildly by environment.  </p>
<p>Also, dinosaurs were overwhelmingly likely to be warm blooded.</p></div>		</li>
