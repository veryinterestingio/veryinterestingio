			<div class="markdown"><p>To reiterate, analogies of a brain to a computer aren't entirely wrong, but they can be misleading. What is happening when humans are trying to learn and memorize, is that the brain is attempting to form new or strengthen existing neurological pathways. In addition, it is also storing those neurological pathways in the areas of the brain that is associated with short term memory. In order to convert those memories into long term, the brain requires sleep to finalize the process.</p>
<p>Most of the time, fatigue from intensive lectures comes from the brain trying to signal that it needs the host to rest so it has time to perform the necessary actions to manage the area associated with long term memory. Furthermore, humans can only focus for a limited amount of time before they are exhausted and need to be replenished through resting and the consumption of food and water.</p></div>		</li>
