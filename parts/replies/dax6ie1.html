<p>thats making a false implication that infection is <em>necessarily</em> caused by carelessness. Its nobody's fault when you get an infection. Yes, medical staff go from room to room. What else are they supposed to do ? It's inherent for their job. Unless you want to pay for your personal, private nurse.</p>
<p>What I'd like to know is how they handle the <em>really</em> nasty shit, like meningitis or other contagions that I've never even heard of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If someone gets an infection in the hospital, it's often due to negligence. This can be either on the part of the staff or the patient, but more often than not it's someone's fault. Some patients are more prone to getting infections that others due to their medical conditions, and others don't follow aftercare instructions which means they're practically guaranteed to get one. The staff are instructed to wash hands in between every patient, don appropriate protective gear which varies based on the level of infection the patient has, and use utmost caution when throwing away and sterilizing equipment. But as hospitals try to save money by cutting staff, this becomes increasingly hard to do as nurses have more patients than they can handle and not nearly enough time to get all of them. </p>
<p>As the truly nasty infections become more widespread, hospitals are taking more and more precautions to deal with them. A patient with meningitis, C-Dif, MRSA, and any of the other really nasty infections has a notice posted on the door of their room for everyone to see. This notice informs both staff and visitors of the infection they have, and includes instructions on what level of protective gear is required in order to enter the room. Most of these infections require you to wear a gown, face mask, gloves, shoe covers, and possibly something covering your hair as well. You're also instructed to wash your hands thoroughly before entering and before you leave. If staff are accidentally exposed to one of these diseases before precautions can be taken, they have to fill out an exposure report and go through multiple rounds of testing and decontamination procedures. In some cases they aren't even allowed to work until they get a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>Also, fun fact - wanna know what the nastiest infection is? The one that can shut down multiple wings of the hospital, contaminate entire emergency rooms, and take an ambulance out of service for days? Bedbugs. In the medical field we take those suckers very, very seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever truly taken care of an ICU patient with any of these diseases, you would realize how laughable most of these precautions are. Washing our hands and being as careful as possible is the best we can do. But if a C. Diff patient has poop running off of every edge of the bed and you expect a gown and shoe covers to protect you, you're naive as fuck. And where have you recieved information that employees get decontamination and fill out an exposure report? This literally never happened except with shit like ebola or TB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hospitals follow CDC guidelines on isolation.
All healthcare professionals use Universal Precautions with every patient. This includes hand washing, isopropyl alcohol, and gloves to isolate any bodily fluids.<br />
There are also three types of transmission-based precaution:</p>
<p>Contact precautions are intended to prevent transmission of infectious agents, including epidemiologically important microorganisms, which are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patientâ€™s environment. This is achieved by donning gloves and gowns with strict hand washing practices. MRSA and C.Diff would be placed in contact isolation. </p>
<p>Droplet precautions are intended to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions.
Droplet precautions use the above precautions along with face and eye procetion. If you have the flu in the hospital they will place you in droplet isolation.</p>
<p>Airborne precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus [measles], varicella virus [chickenpox], M. tuberculosis, and possibly SARS-CoV). Airborne precautions are the strictest with all of the above precautions, along with N-95 particle respirators and reverse pressure rooms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you go to a professional, they scrub it for what seems to be an eternity,, while using medical/ pharmaceutical grade antiseptics and depending on the wound, may inject saline or other solutions to pump out anything that shouldn't be in there. Also chlorhexidine glucagonate works wonders. Your over the counter debriding is nothing compared to what I or other docs have at our disposal.
Story: got bit by a monkey in my lab years ago. Scrubbed the shit out of it for more than 15 minutes, then tied a rubber band around the base of my finger and injected it for another half hour with ringers/saline... would not recommend. But yes it's better than being dead. </p>
<p>If you want to see something fun, look up cleaning a felon...and no it has nothing to do with criminals.  ? enjoy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for S&amp;G's. The staph on your skin is almost exclusively Staphylococcus epidermis, the staph that causes most staph infections in hospitals is Staphylococcus aureus, due to the antibiotic resistance as pointed out (MRSA). Though don't sleep on S.epi as it leads to a lot of nasty staph infections with catheters and prosthetics because of its precedence on the skin. The differences in genotype is pretty large considering they're closely related.</p>
<p>Interesting note: when we wanted to culture and compare microbiome staph cultures in our lab group, the best places to find them are your nose for S.aureus and under your finger nails for S.epidermis. Also found under your nails... fecal coliforms, or poop bacteria.</p></div>		</li>
