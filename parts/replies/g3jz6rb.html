			<div class="markdown"><p>Thankyou for explaining something technical incredibly clear  </p>
<p>How do toe hairs work?  </p>
<p>I have no thyroid, and take medication, it seems my hair code is all over the place; I have some hair that just keeps growing no matter what, and others which grows in spurts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I feel better about helping out with this. Please see update above and attached reply. </p>
<p>The factors that go into regulating how your hair grows, whether in your scalp or your toes is super complicated. It does have a lot to do with hormones, thyroxine, Thyroid stimulating hormone, and various growth hormones in particular. Countless studies point to the thyroid related axis as being highly influential in the finely tuned process of hair growth. </p>
<p>Other answers indicated that there are known cycles of growing stages, resting stages, and eventual falling out stages associated with predetermined anatomic locations of follicles. The length of these stages can be changed by your hormones. They can also be completely derailed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thankyou!  </p>
<p>Fascinating, our bodies are soo complex the more I think about how we are created, the more I can't fathom how we were initially hatched all those millions of years ago.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've now decided my hairs aren't wiggling - but actually waving to everyone as they walk by.</p></div>		</li>
