			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that‚Äôs pretty much the same mechanism. The brain always creates an internal ‚Äúmovie‚Äù from fragments it catches with the eyes. That input is always incomplete and most of that movie is actually interpolated from moment to moment. The blind spot is one such thing causing incompleteness, but the difference between central and peripheral vision alone causes a lot of interpolation between the two. That‚Äôs why your eyes are constantly darting around, trying to fill in the complete picture as well as possible. Actually, as well as <em>necessary</em>, until it thinks it has seen enough to help you with whatever your current objective is. A ton of information gets filtered out every second, you‚Äôre never actually seeing the ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù world around you in all detail.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you heard of sensory processing sensitivity? It's defined as an increased sensitivity of the central nervous system.  </p>
<p>As someone with it, I find it annoying most of the time and I wish I could turn the trait off somehow. It's like I can't not process the noise information that is someone's voice or the ticking of a clock or the tapping of a pencil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if a camera has a cracked lens, it will show the crack in the video or the picture because the crack is part of reality - just not in the outside world, in the recording system itself. The blind spot is the same: there is, in fact, no huge hole in reality (which is exactly why our brain tries to fills the gap), but the blind spot is a real consequence to something that actually exists, much like the cracked lens - that's where our optic nerve starts, and there are no vision sensory cells on there, so no light gets caught.</p>
<p>However, of course, it would be useless and actually counterproductive for us to have two big black spots in our vision (since it's just an artifact of our recording system and not something in the outside world), which is why our brain processes the images so that we have a full picture of what's around. Basically, it's as if the camera selectively hid the crack in its lens and &quot;bled&quot; the rest of the image over it to cover the gap! It's an effective solution to keep the continuity of the outside world without letting the inherent flaws of the vision system influence it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also don't see what happens on the far sides of your head or even behind your back like a horse or fly. Yet your brain doesn't simply stretch your vison into 360¬∞ to make sense of it and alters your perceived reality, it simply shows what's in your FOV.</p>
<p>Also you could argue reality is nothing but a glaring hole of emptiness if you consider the vast empty space between a nucleus and it's electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a processing trick. Everything we &quot;see&quot; has to be processed by the brain. Our conscious awareness of what we are seeing always has a delay and is subject to interpretation. Our reflexive brain can act more quickly, to dodge or catch a ball for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously though, how do you actually know that you are seeing things ‚Äúnow‚Äù and as soon as they happen and exactly how they are happening? You don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre basically always retroactively justifying your memories. For stuff that‚Äôs happening ‚Äúnow‚Äù that‚Äôs pretty close to ‚Äúreality now‚Äù, but only <em>close</em>. The farther in the past something is, the more it‚Äôs subject to interpretation and modification.</p></div>		</li>
