			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get chicken pox vaccine privately for £70. The reason we don't is the NHS thought the  risk of shingles as an adult is higher if vaccinated compared to natural immunity although it seems  like they may have over exaggerated that risk.</p>
<p>Exit: see comments below regarding actual reason...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two different Shingles vaccines. one &quot; <strong>Zostavax</strong> &quot; is basically just a large dose of the standard attenuated chickenpox vaccine. the other &quot; <strong>Shingrix</strong> &quot; is a subunit vaccine and does not contain the intact virus, just a fragment.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a likely future if it turns out a yearly covid booster is needed. It will take a few years, because you can't just combine two vaccines and assume they'll still work equally safely and effectively; you have to go through more clinical trials. But yes,lots of public health scientists are discussing this as the best option for an annual shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'a' stands for acellular and it pertains to the pertussis part. Older formulations for the pertussis vaccine used inactivated, whole bacteria. Newer formulations only use some components of the toxin and outer proteins but no intact bacteria. This reduces the incidence of side effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The new version has a lower rate of side effects but, unfortunately, is somewhat less effective, especially with regard to transmission. It appears to be partly responsible for the recent outbreaks of pertussis (along with some people not being vaccinated at all).</p></div>		</li>
