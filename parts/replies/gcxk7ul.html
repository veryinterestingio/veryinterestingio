<p>And why does your skin get paler when you don’t get enough sleep? If not getting enough sleep makes blood vessels dilate, wouldn’t that make the skin redder, rather than paler?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that it is due to varying levels of cortisol.</p>
<p>You will notice that if you use steroid ointments for inflammation such as hydrocortisone (effectively a pharmaceutical formulation of cortisol), it is often suggested to take it in the morning. Cortisol levels are related to melatonin levels, so they fluctuate with your circadian rhythm, and you can get insomnia if you use some of those creams too late into the day.</p>
<p>Cortisol is effectively a hormone that counteracts the immune response to inflammation. It is used to treat eczema and rashes for this reason, and causes effects that are opposite of histamine -- constricted blood vessels, high blood pressure, etc., which can make you feel &quot;awake&quot; in the morning or &quot;stressed&quot; if there is too much of it hanging around. When your body tells you to sleep, you will get a drop in this hormone, so you will get lightheadedness, fatigue, and other those dark circles. If you don't get proper sleep, the hormone levels will not rebalance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it’s also theorized that gravity is a contributing factor to eye bags. When you’re awake, you’re generally in a vertical stature, so the fluid is pulled down. Sleeping horizontal sort of keeps it in check, hence people who sleep less have the bags.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to answer your question about dilation and flushing of the skin think of it like this. You have a plumbing system that holds 2000L of water, if you widen the pipes but keep the same amount of water you’re going to have less pressure running through those pipes and thus water isnt going to get to the houses and buildings that are further away from the pump. To combat this you either need to raise the pressure (which our bodies can’t directly do but manages it through expelling excess fluid and vasoconstriction) OR you need to increase the amount of water going through those pipes up (which our bodies tell us through things like thirst).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I’ve heard, yes. I do believe part of it is genetics and whether your parents (aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc) experience permanent dark circles under their eyes as well. </p>
<p>I’ve had dark circles since I was a kid, and even on days where I’m well-rested with 8-10 hrs of sleep and tons of water, I still have dark eye bags compared to others. I’ve found some assurance and consolation in the idea that how prominent your eye bags are is just back to genetics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably genetics. Keep in mind that dark circles are also sometimes caused by how low profile the volume/bone is around your eyes. If you tilt your head back and the dark circles seem to go away, the circles are more an illusion/natural shadow. In which case there’s not much to do except rock it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my case, that I also have permanent dark circles, it's just anatomical variations in three fronts: bone structure, how thin is the skin in that region, and the distribution of blood vessels within that region of skin; all within the normality range. All that is both genetic and congenital. For other people it could be some type of anemia, not my case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're getting enough sleep and hydrating, then makeup's the way to go. There's a few concealers specifically for dark areas under the eyes to help lighten them up a bit. And guys can use them too, it's not at all obvious you're wearing makeup. You just look better rested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have permanent dark circles under my eyes.  My skin is pretty much translucent, so concealer doesn't blend well unless I have my whole face made up, which isn't really me.  I have given up and will go through the rest of my life looking exhausted, depressed, and/or prematurely aged.  </p>
<p>As u/The<em>Crushinator</em> suggested, I have a face full of character!  Unfortunately the character with dark circles is usually the villain...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple of things come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>cold compresses would work to make your blood vessels constrict</li>
<li>do you get allergies often? if so, antihistamines will help with inflammation-related dark circles</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is a particularly common/regular occurrence, get enough sleep, don't have allergies/irritation around the eyes, and are well-hydrated, it is probably not the classic thing that people refer to as dark circles, but it can be just genetics -- some people have hyperpigmentation around the under-eye area, and that is not caused by blood vessels at all. It's just that there's simply more pigment produced there. This is common if you have darker/olive skin, and the good news is that it's not a health problem.</p>
<p>For this, you could maybe try using something with alpha-arbutin, which is a chemical that inhibits melatonin production (as opposed to the bleaches that are banned in most of the developed world).</p></div>		</li>
