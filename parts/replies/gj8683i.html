			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your input, sounds like you have exactly the expertise for this kind of question! </p>
<p>To follow up, do you think there are big differences in REM and other sleep cycles between mice, cats, and humans, because we all have varying levels of complexity in our neural systems? By that, I mean since REM sleep is used for sorting memory in our brains, since cats dont possess as complex intelligence or big brains as humans, does their sleep look way different from ours?</p>
<p>Sorry if that's worded really poorly, I have this big ol' human brain but not enough skill to work it very well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand your question and I will answer it according to my opinion. I don't believe that humans have more complex brains than cats do. We have certain parts that cats don't have (i.e. language areas) but in terms of neural architecture, there is not much that is more complex in humans. I think we consider it more complex because our social cohesion (enabled by language etc) has allowed us to achieve some remarkable things such as going to the Moon. We tend to believe that individual human brains are more complex or intelligent but in fact, a single human brain is not capable of building rockets. In other words, our intelligence lies in society and the intergenerational memory carried within it (i.e. culture). Even tool use (which cats don't do) needs to be passed down and improved over generations for it to become remarkable. Sleep is known to consolidate memory and memory is definitely important for doing intelligent things.At a neural level though, the consolidation of memory is the same in cats and in humans it is just different concepts being consolidated. Maybe we dream of what some guy said on Reddit about sleep but a cat is more likely dreaming of treats and chasing squirrels. Our social affinity allow us to consolidate information passed on to us from others and this gets more complex every generation so we become more intelligent as long as we can keep this up. Feral children are arguably not very intelligent because they don't receive anything intelligent to consolidate despite having bigger brains than cats
So, as far as sleep is concerned, I can speculate that the differences in sleep patterns are due to adaptations of each animal to its niche rather than brain complexity. Sleeping is dangerous (you can be eaten while paralyzed) so it makes sense for predator to sleep a lot and in solid bouts (cats) while prey sleep in short, fragmented sessions. If you were mouse that slept for 8 hours, you were more likely to be eaten and your genes for 8 hour sleep would stop there while your buddy with fragmented sleep made babies and passed on its gene.</p>
<p>Edit: for the record, mouse brains are indeed less complex (fewer neurons, fewer connections) although it is hard to link their sleep patterns to their neural architecture. It would be indeed interesting if someone demonstrated it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow, I don't think you could have explained that more perfectly! I always assumed that our advanced social systems and inner monologue were evidence of our higher intelligence and more complex brains, I never even considered that it might actually be the other way around!</p>
<p>And your example of the feral child totally makes sense, I definitely wouldn't consider that a very intelligent creature - even compared to a cat or mouse, let alone a socially nurtured human. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for the valuable input!</p></div>		</li>
