			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fascinating. I never thought about it, but those folks who say &quot;I haven't been sick in 20 years!&quot; may have indeed been sick many times (and even possibly spread illness to others), but they won some lottery of genetics, physiology, or immunity that allows them to experience little to no symptoms for colds and ILIs. I always doubted those people, but now I realize they weren't necessarily lying but perhaps just unaware of their past illnesses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how you define being sick or having illness. It's possible that even the healthiest people constantly have infections that their immune systems are taking care of.</p>
<p>Personally, I consider being &quot;sick&quot; as feeling unwell, which can be caused by infection or even simple things like being dehydrated or deficient in a particular nutrient. Even hunger can make you feel unwell. Being contagious is something different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if they haven't been sick, then they really weren't sick, just infected.  This is the difference between IFR and CFR that we're all debating for covid.  Plenty of infected folks don't get sick enough to go see a Dr and become a case.</p></div>		</li>
