			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't an antivirus basically a &quot;benevolent malware&quot; that installs itself so deep that it is capable of checking all other processes and resources. Basically they want to be in full control of the machine and will detect other antiviruses as malware or atleast something to wrestle control away from and thus start to fight each other for privileges. Someone please correct my layman explanation, but that's more or less how I understood it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst I like Linux I can't help but think I'd be making a rod for my own back if I got my parents to use it. I think the vast majority of their problems are WiFi or printer related. If I can't fix it over the phone in half an hour I can at least get them to try their ISP. No way is that going to be a positive experience on anything other than Windows/MacOS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! My MIL kept having trouble with her PC because she installed EVERYTHING on it, whatever popped up. Once a month I'd have to go over and make it work again. Then I asked her what she did with the computer,  and realized that a Ubuntu install might work better. She loved it. It worked for a couple more years until she got an android phone and stopped using the computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With how seamless updates are now, it certainly gives the impression that hardware gets slower with age.  </p>
<p>An example I'll give is comparing the 3DS at launch to how it works today.  Super Street Fighter IV works the same, even 10 years later.  The difference is, the OS has updated, had features added, and been given enough stability, that it is comparatively slow to how it ran in 2011. You rarely notice the change a new update brings, but after a decades worth, it adds up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both this comment and the one above it miss out on the fact that components do wear out. Capacitors are notorious for this, for example. That's why most wifi routers slow over time and has nothing to do with software.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really true. Capacitors do blow but that happening is pretty rare on newer hardware (built in the last 10+ years). </p>
<p>I'm rocking an asrock z77 pro3 motherboard in my home server that I used extensively since 2012. It's been in my first gaming PC and now is in my ingestion server and I've had zero problems with it for the last 9 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Computer hardware doesn't usually wear out in a way that makes it slower. A part is either working or its not (or flips between). The exception being mechanical drives and heat related throttling.</p>
<p>Hardware failure is usually indicated by temporary, erratic, and/or extreme issues. Software failure is usually indicated in slowdowns or consistent errors.</p>
<p>Routers are a bit special because of how they are designed and coded. Often all of their issues manifest as a slow down to the user and they aren't especially concerned about protecting against component failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Operating systems and websites get closer to shit. I hate the bloated world we live in, both physically and virtually, but what can you do.</p>
<p>Also, the hard drive could be dying. When a hard drive dies, it has to re-read some things since there are read errors, which slows stuff down.</p>
<p>Try a good Linux distro like Elive 3.8.x, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, or something similar. THey might work wonders for you</p></div>		</li>
