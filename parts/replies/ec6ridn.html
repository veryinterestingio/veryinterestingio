Then say ‚ÄúAlexa wake me up at 6:30am‚Äù and it will set the alarm, which automatically starts out softly and raises in volume over time. <del>You don‚Äôt need special settings.</del> The setting is called &quot;ascending alarm.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use the &quot;Bedtime&quot; setting on my iPhone and it is actually a really nice way to wake up. It plays calm music that starts quietly and gradually gets louder. You can also set it to your bedtime/waketime and it will repeat every day, reminding you to go to sleep on time and waking you up at the same time, even calculating the number of hours you slept. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The music they use for the bedtime alarm is definitely less jarring than a normal alarm clock but eventually I just associate it with waking up and it's just as bad.</p>
<p>The music doesn't really start out soft enough or play out over a long enough period of time to be effective as a gradual way to wake up. I wake up the second the music starts and it just gets really loud afterward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those silent alarms are awesome and really help with getting out of bed at a good rate. For example I have one at 6:30 then another at 6:45 and finally my proper phone alarm at 7 in case the other two don't wake me up. </p>
<p>Also I use a silent alarm as a reminder to take pills which is a bit more subtle than a phone alarm/reminder</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just find it really great the way it wakes you up slowly. I'm less inclined to be grumpy because I'm not jumping out the bed in shock of hearing my alarm. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also an android app that you can put on your bed that tracks motion. You set a window of time you want to wake up during and it will wake you up during periods of light sleep and if you don't enter a period of light sleep it will work like a regular alarm clock at the end of the window. It obviously only works if you sleep alone because it will also track your partner's movements. </p>
<p>It also can be set to start recording audio when your deep sleep is interrupted for whatever reason and there was a really creepy thread in /r/creepy a few years back where a woman posted the audio of a back and forth conversation during her sleep. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think this is all that unusual though. I've been known to sit up and have a full blown conversation with someone (including eyes open) but not remember the next morning.
Unless that conversation didn't include her voice.. in which case that app can stay right where it belongs in the app store.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For iPhone it's called the sleep cycle alarm clock. You keep the screen face down on your bed and it keeps track of your sleep cycles and does it's best to wake you up at the right time. </p>
<p>I only stopped using it because you set the alarms for the latest your willing to wake up (say 8 am) but if your cycle isn't right it'll try to wake you up earlier (say 7 30.) I <em>know</em> I'm waking up more refreshed but I still personally felt like I was getting robbed of that half hour to sleep.  </p></div>		</li>
