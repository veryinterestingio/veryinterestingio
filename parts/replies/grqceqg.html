			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked as a chef for 10 years and I can say from personal experience and various recommendations from other chefs that:
The best thing to do with a burn is cool it down briefly and then let it return to room temperature. The sensation of pain is worse as the affected area is changing temperature. It always hurts more when that's happening. When it reaches a steady temperature the pain mostly subsides. And bringing the area close to a source of heat will always sting like hell. I think this is for the same reason.
I can't say this with any degree of medical experience but I know that when I had a burn that's what I did and I was generally nursing the burn for less time than other chefs that didn't take the advice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a bartender/Server for 10 years, I can confirm this. Cool it down and walk away. If it continues to burn at an &quot;unbearable&quot; (read annoying, not killing you but def distracting you), then hit up that glorious First Aid kit in the office for some burn cream.</p>
<p>That shit works wonders. If you're a bartender, you pmuch have to reapply every few minutes, as you are just constantly washing it off in your bar sinks. But hey, shit works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is also an example of out of sight out of mind. I forget where but I read an article about a study where the participants reported far higher on a pain scale of 1-10 when they were looking at their injury as opposed to not seeing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes potentially. Because I'm not fussing over it walking around with my hand in a cup of water I forget it. (Burn is on my hand in this example)</p>
<p>I just know that if I cool it down then when I take my hand out it burns again and makes me go back to the cold water it will hurt all day.</p>
<p>If I power through that first bit of pain as the burn area warms to the temperature of the room (after cold bath) it stops hurting and I forget about it (until i bring it near a source of heat or. Grill, oven, friers in the kitchen)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had something similar. When I asked the doctor, he said that the pain is caused when air comes into contact with the area, and added that there are cremes which can be used in such cases and they work. I heard from a couple friends that these cremes can stop the pain instantly. Since then I have always one ready.</p></div>		</li>
