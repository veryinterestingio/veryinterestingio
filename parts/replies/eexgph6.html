			<div class="markdown"><p>These bacteria tend to live in soil, or in the guts and poo of animals. The spores can live for a very long time (even when exposed to oxygen) and the spores wake up when they're in an environment in which they can grow.</p>
<p>A rusty nail <em>that came in contact with soil</em> is a frequent cause of tetanus</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and especially the thing being rusty makes it have a porous and flaky surface, so lots of places the spores and bacterium can hide in and not be 'wiped' off when entering the skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it’s also worth noting that puncture wounds are more likely than any other type of wound to lead to an infection. when a sharp point goes in, the skin around it basically wipes any microbes from the tip into the wound, and then seals it off upon removal, preventing oxygen from the surrounding area from killing those germs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more about the correlation. A rusty nail has clearly been exposed to the elements for more than a short while. It's not that far fetched that it's also been in contact with dirt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rusty nail and tetanus is a popularized thing, but what matters is the dirt and the deep puncture. Rusty metal is pretty much guaranteed to be dirty and to leave some dirt in the wound, but any deep puncture with a dirty object could give you tetanus.</p>
<p>The oxygen in the rust won't kill anaerobic bacteria any more than you could survive by breathing rust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct.  And the physical status of a rusty nail can better house/deposit a bacterium than a smooth one.  Rust is more important as in its relation to the endospore/germination state of the bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. You should be more concerned with any deeper puncture wound, regardless of what the artifact is. If you go to the ER with any kind of puncture wound they’ll ask/check if your shots are up to date for tetanus and probably give you one for good measure. The bacteria can exist without constant “nutrition” because of the spores formed around Clostridium species (think C. diff or perfringens). In the world of microbiology, there are various methods to produce growth in the lab of a pathogen: aerobic, anaerobic, body temp incubation, elevated body temp incubation (44 degrees C), CO2 environment. All of these help identity what we’re dealing with. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a term called facultative aerobes and facultative anaerobes. There are organisms, say for instance we’re talking about a facultative anaerobe. These produce ATP in the presence of oxygen, but if only anaerobic conditions exist, will use fermentation to achieve energy resources. On the flip side we have obligate aerobes and obligate anaerobes. An obligate anaerobe absolutely cannot exist in the precense of oxygen. C. tetani is an obligate anaerobe and the Dr. may have been concerned if the fall was a bad scrape, possibly embedding debris in the wound. It’s a stretch to think tetanus would be an issue, but he could’ve been overly cautious or kind of naive to the conditions required for tetanus. Doctors are required to rotate through microbiology depending on their practice, but only I.D. Doctors will be the front runners on understanding pathogens thoroughly. Think of doctors as mechanics. You may expect a mechanic who only works on small cars to name some parts/functions of a semi-truck, but the semi-Truck mechanic is going to have the best knowledge on his profession. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, earnest question from a not-science-man, why doesn’t the oxygen in the air kill it on the surface of the puncture device? Where is the bacteria (?) hiding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clostridium species are known as “spore forming”. This makes them more resistant to dying outright from exposure and also cleaning. Hospitals have constant problems with C. diff because it requires thorough cleaning and adequate time for cleaning agents to cut through the spore. You play video games? Think of your character starting out with a force field bubble barrier that blocks most incoming attacks, but can be popped with the right tools (cleaning, overheating, etc.) The spore provides the anaerobic environment required for C. tenani to survive. </p></div>		</li>
