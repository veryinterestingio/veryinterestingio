<p>Hygroscopy is the phenomenon of attracting and holding water molecules via either absorption or adsorption from the surrounding environment, which is usually at normal or room temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dunno about surgery but we visited an autopsy in nursing school and the patologist got asked a question about seeing the effect of smoking from the lungs. He answered that lungs from those living in cities with all the pollution and dust etc. look really similar to those who smoke, but he can see a clear difference between a smoker and a non-smoker from more rural backrounds with cleaner air than the cities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So am I correct in thinking it's &quot;healthier&quot; to only smoke a cigarette 50-75% of the way?  </p>
<p>Edit: Since there's a bunch of witty people commenting, I'm asking with the assumption that you're smoking the same amount but just not smoking the end where theres more concentrated oils and other residue. For example smoking 1 full cigarette vs smoking 2 half way.</p></div>		</li>
