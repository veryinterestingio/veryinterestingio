			<div class="markdown"><p>The layman's definition of temperature in terms of energy/motion of atoms &amp; molecules that you're referencing is kind of nonsense though.  If you have a glass of ice water that's reached equilibrium, both the liquid and solid water is at the same temperature (0°C), but the liquid water clearly has much more internal energy (since it's flowing freely vs the ice which is bound in a crystal structure).  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_temperature#Definition_of_thermodynamic_temperature" target="_blank">thermodynamic definition of temperature</a> in terms of entropy is used in physics for good reason.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to criticize people for having an incomplete understanding of physics (nobody is an expert at everything) but this is AskScience not AskRegularDude, so I'm going to answer scientifically to the best of my ability.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's just the lowest temperature something in interstellar space can cool down to</p>

<p>It isn't. Some gas clouds are colder. You need a combination of some cooling mechanism (like expansion) and a poor coupling to the cosmic microwave background, but it happens:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thank you for this detailled answer! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asking what temperature space is is like asking what the average speed of all the cars on a road is, when there aren't any cars on the road.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm somehow trying to decode this analogy: You're saying I'm asking what temperature is in space doesn't work, because there are no molecules (or not enough) to transport a warmth because of a vacuum. This seems reasonable. </p>
<p>Still I'm pretty sure if it was possible to travel somewhere where no stars are around (far away from any solar system) and a human being would go out there without a suit. How would this person feel? Cold, warm, nothing? If you're saying that 2.7 kelvin is the coldest something can get in the universe, but only because of this equlibrium with the background radiation, there must be a &quot;base temperature&quot; where spots in space untouched by warmth and light of stars and so on are more or less the same at 2.7 kelvin, right? This is like a minimum temperature, or did I get it wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at the other answers to OP, because the way you define temperature for this question is important.</p>
<p>For the simple definition: &quot;temperature is a measure for the average energy of a mass of molecules&quot; we can't give a temperature for empty space. Not because it doesn't conduct heat, but because there is no mass of molecules whose average energy we could look at.</p>
<p>Just like with the road analogy. The question of the average speed for a empty road isn't useless because I can't get from A to B, but because there simply isn't anything I can measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s colder.   Humans have reached very close to 0K. </p>
<p>By definition the “coldest” anything can get is 0K.  Anything lower than or even at 0K just doesn’t mean anything to us.  </p>
<p>Maybe that’s what you mean by base temperature?  The coldest possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that the definition of temperature has to do with molecules and so on but I'm sure the human body would feel either very vold or very warm and I want to know if there is a sciebtific answer for that question.</p></div>		</li>
