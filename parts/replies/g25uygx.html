<p>This is actually a huge debate in psychology (whether self-control is a depleting “resource” or not). </p>
<p>The term that’s typically used is “ego depletion” if you want to read more about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn’t there some sort of well known study about blood sugar and mental energy which could translate to self control? I learned about this over a year ago in social psych so I could be remembering wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope your prof followed up with studies that showed the effect was motivational, not metabolical, so you don't actually need to ingest sugar. For instance, it also works when you rinse with sugar water and then spit it out again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I never thought about it like that. Makes sense, even if it might not be the real reason.</p>
<p>Kinda like you feel like a reward after a long day. Same reason why people drink in the evening/night</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've been told it's because of our micro biome and gut bacteria. If you eat a lot of carbs and fat heavy foods, you attract these unhealthy bacteria that live in your intestines and send chemical signals to your brain asking you for more even when you're body doesn't actually need it. I think they disrupt your hunger hormones like ghrelin and leptin by increasing ghrelin levels in your body and cause cravings based on your eating patterns and the intervals in which you have your meals. They also suppress your leptin levels and you won't be as satiated as your normally would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I started my weight loss program, the nutritionist recommended a two day fast (eating only raw veggies with an apple a day) with some laxatives to cleanse the gut of exactly those bacteria (well, all bacteria to be honest) in order to allow new, healthier cultures to settle in. </p>
<p>I sometimes feel like I'm honest to God addicted to sugary shit considering how urgent some of my cravings were but this stopped all and any cravings I had for the past six months now, making the dietary changes so much easier to digest (pun intended).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your mental discipline is like a muscle that gets used throughout the day. By then end of the day it can get depleted.</p>
<p>Edit: mental discipline might be the wrong term I don’t remember but it was one of the cooler things I learned about in social psych.</p></div>		</li>
