			<div class="markdown"><p>I mostly come at it from the applied mathematics side and am mostly concerned with convection in astrophysical situations. With that there are a few chapters with this approach in the stellar structure and evolution book by kippenhahn, Weiss and I forget the 3rd author. </p>
<p>There is also the classic &quot;Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability&quot; by basically the god of convection and instabilities in general Chandrasekhar. This book is a little dry and hard going but its basically the bible.</p>
<p>I wouldnt be surprised if this stuff is in Landau and Lifshitz somewhere but I have not read any of that epic series....</p>

<p>There are also a lot of lecture notes if you look for hydrodynamic stability.</p></div>		</li>
