			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It's looking for &quot;no light&quot; followed IMMEDIATELY by &quot;light.&quot; If it doesn't detect &quot;no light&quot; (the one frame of a solid black screen), it won't calibrate itself and detect the light (and therefore the hit) on the next frame.</p>
<p>You'd need a tv synced up to flash EXACTLY when you pull the trigger.</p></div>		</li>
