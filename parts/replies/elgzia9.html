			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. Plants have their own immune response systems and one of them is to trap microbes in gelatins like aloe vera. And these inflammatory inhibition compounds are not strong enough to turn the human immune response completely off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so aloe actually <em>does</em> something?</p>
<p>I always thought Aloe was on par with menthol, where the &quot;soothing&quot; or &quot;healing&quot; properties are just the fact that it feels a bit cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons for this level of confusion is that there has historically been a massive amount of marketing misinformation or just downright counterfeiting of aloe products.</p>
<p>A product that calls itself an &quot;aloe gel&quot; that only has like 1% aloe isn't going to do jack.  Real aloe has a number of active chemicals like the mucilaginous polysaccharides.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Threads like this one is why I love Reddit, you learn something useful in areas you wouldn't normally even think about.  I did a little searching, first going to Amazon, and you'll see marketing in full effect.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fruit-Earth-Aloe-Vera-24oz/dp/B005C28Z9O/ref=sr_1_7?crid=1SS2ML0O2SKUR&amp;keywords=aloe+vera+gel&amp;qid=1555949081&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=aloe+ver%2Caps%2C597&amp;sr=8-7" target="_blank">This one advertises 100% gel</a>.  Not 100% aloe, just that the product is completely in gel form.  And <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-no-aloe-vera-lotion-wal-mart-cvs-target-20161122-story.html" target="_blank">this article</a> looked at several shelf brands, including the one in the previous link, and found no Aloe Vera whatsoever.  I guess it shouldn't upset me, since before reading this thread I though Aloe was just a cooling gel that felt nice on a burn.  But now that I know it's actually supposed to do something...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The study that was linked was just on bacteria and mouse cell lines. This study is very far from being able to show that rubbing aloe vera on a sunburn does anything. Studies like this show feasability for further study in animal and human trials down the road, but very rarely show any efficacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, it is much more important to get a human to the age where they can raise their child, rather than much longer than that. So much of our body is capable of tradeoffs that permanently damage us but in ways that can be made up for until we are older and weaker. The immune system is a big player in that. </p>
<p>Fevers damage us too, but if we don't use a fever to heal us quickly, we might die from a disease or be laid up long enough to starve or be eaten.</p>
<p>Additionally, a lot of cancers only humans get. Some animals, like elephants, are way better at preventing their cells from getting cancer. But cancers that a human gets at age 60 have considerably less evolutionary impact than some kind of fitness boost at age 20 or 30.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My hs Biology teacher used to use the example of the frog to counter any student who was smitten with the idea of evolution producing &quot;perfect&quot; designs. - Turns out, deciding your form of locomotion will be jumping - which results in repeatedly landing on very short arms, thereby repeatedly bashing your chest, where all your major organs are - is not necessarily such a good idea.</p>
<p>But it works well enough for them to mature and breed, so evolution doesn't particularly care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, an overactive immune response can be beneficial to the species as a whole if it kills someone who might be a disease vector. It makes sense that &quot;good enough&quot; trends towards overkill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here, it's because your body is being extra careful to not develop cancer or other dangerous pathologies. Your skin triggers apoptosis (cell suicide) when the cells are sufficiently damaged by UV-B radiation because the cell may stop functioning correctly--and some of the possible errors introduced may be one that will one day trigger tumor development--or because the cell has been damaged so much it no longer functions correctly and needs to be replaced. Ideally, your body then replaces the damaged cell with a healthy one.</p></div>		</li>
