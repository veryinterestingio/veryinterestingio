			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. Its not so much a conservation of energy thing. It is more to due to conservation of angular momentum. While the exact formation mechanisms of gas giants are beyond the scope of this. basically saturn and every planet form by dust and gas coalescing within a certain orbit and area. All that stuff is initially orbiting chaotically around the center of mass of the planet to be' sphere of influence. Some stuff going clockwise, some counter clockwise, some in polar orbits and every orbit in between. Heres the cool and key thing though it still has a net rotation vector as every free moving body and system of bodys has to. Over time the stuff orbiting counter clockwise encounters and or collide with the material going clockwise and due to conservation of momentum their motion Nets out as a sum of their masses and velocity.  The stuff orbiting polarly encounters other stuff and that nets out. Eventually you are left with a planet and depending on certain extra factors potentially rings and moons. They then generally share the same rotation vector with the host Planet because they were formed from the same system of material. What's even cooler is that you can extrapolate this out to the solar system and that is also why all the planets orbit in the same direction and with the exception of Neptune and other outer planets, along the same orbital plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recently saw a pic of Uranus' rings tilted over, also aligned with Uranus' rotational axis. All this gives rise to the question: how does an orbiting particle &quot;know&quot; the rotational/equatorial plane of the planet over which it orbits and stay confined to that plane? As objects in orbit, the origin of the ring particles certainly was from some object in space whose orbit could have come at the planet from any orbital inclination. In the case of Uranus, the planet's axis is tilted 97 degrees to the plane of its orbit around the sun. Objects approaching the planet from the solar plane of rotation/ecliptic are almost certainly going to encounter the planet in a plane pretty close to a polar orbit. If the rings are formed from the break up of such an object, how do they end up orbiting over the equator?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up: would it be plausible for the rings to orbit in the opposite direction of the planet's orbit, or on an axis other than in line with the equator? Or would those options be too unstable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m no expert, so you still might wanna wait for one of those smart guys, but I can answer a little. To the counter-rotating part of your question, there is a star named <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1SWASP_J140747.93%E2%88%92394542.6" target="_blank">J1407</a> where one of its planets is basically a super Saturn. It has rings that are approximately over 600 times the size of Saturn’s, that are believed to rotate the planet in the opposite direction of the planet’s rotation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a hypothesis assuming the rings are stable.  Another is assuming they are not stable, and are instead just a proto- exo-moon still in the accretion phase.  I’m more inclined to believe this considering the relative young age of the stellar system (only about 16 million years).</p>
<p>But, it’s absolutely possible for satellites to have a retrograde orbit.  There can be tidal forces that may complicate matters and other shenanigans that can extend or shorten the lifespan of the orbit (increase or decrease stability), but overall  it doesn’t really matter in terms of “can it be done.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms or orbit mechanics, there's no need to be in the same direction or aligned.  But typical planet formation is from a cloud of 'dust' coming together and swirling the same way.  The particles that are at exactly the right speed per altitude stay in orbit.  Collisions cause the particles to fall out of orbit, so you only get rings when a lot of the debris is all going in the same direction, so it would almost be the same rotation axis and direction as the particles that made up the planet.   But if a secondary object (asteroid) later entered a clear orbit and broke apart in just the right way, it could theoretically become a ring at any angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that rings would have to move in the same direction as the moons or else the moons would destroy the rings within a few decades.  If a planet was hit by a smaller planet, its spin might flip.  The debris from the collision could create rings which might end up spinning in the same direction as the moons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the objects at the inner edges of the rings were moving slower, they would fall into the planet. </p>
<p>Distance to travel over a full orbit isn't really a relevant quantity to the physics of orbits. What matters most is velocity: an object in space above the planet is always falling toward the planet, and for it to be in a stable orbit the object must be moving sideways fast enough to constantly miss the planet as it falls. The closer you are to the planet, the stronger its gravitational pull on you, and the faster you have to be moving sideways to miss the planet and stay in orbit.</p></div>		</li>
