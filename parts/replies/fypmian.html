			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you able to move the pinky alright? I had pretty serious arm break (both radius and ulna required plate and screws) a week ago and I have normal feeling but I can’t extend my pinky or ring finger. The doctor has been brushing it off saying it will return to normal as the swelling goes away but I can’t help feeling nervous about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the feeling has returned your nerve should be fine. Nerve damage generally affects sensitivity before motor functions, not the other way around. Also the ulnar nerve doesn't innervate the extensor muscles of your fingers.  It might indeed be from the swelling, or the muscles/tendons may have been damaged. Hopefully just temporarily.</p></div>		</li>
