			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they are efficient, the CIP (clean-in-place) routines are set to run against the amount of time the equipment has been running (72hrs?), or not running(30 min?). Worked at a bottling line as well for a large winemaker and our crews would be hustling to get the CIP complete to make the schedule for the next tank of wine. If the wine gets to the pre-bottle testing and there was something off (label alc% doesn't match, high DO (dissolved O2)) etc they only had a window of about 30 minutes before the equipment had to be run through an additional CIP cycle, which meant a lost hour of production (600 bottles/min). Can't rush a CIP either, had a crew finish one early and the Production Manager made them do it over, figuring they must have skipped a step.</p>
<p>We were incredibly fastidious about cleanliness and constantly tested for wild strains of yeast, etc, in our environment. Medical is a serious cut about this, they have even stricter protocols than food/bev industry</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was pretty impressive seeing how fast and thorough the process was.  The team doing the cleaning had all the tools set up in carts, and hookups for water and cleaning solutions were located close to each machine.  Was like watching a pit crew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your production manager was awesome.
You do not skimp. Yeah you might lose some volunteer but it's a hell of a lot more expensive at the final product stage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Lactic acid is 1.4%? Eh just run caustic at 6.5% next time&quot;</p></div>		</li>
