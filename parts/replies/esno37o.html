			<div class="markdown"><p>Recently had surgery: Surgeon said new research shows that water is quickly absorbed by the stomach and doesn't trigger the normal stomach processes that generate acids/bile that is associated with digestion. As a result, clear water is ok, but other liquids (Juice, soda, alcohol) may trigger normal stomach processes, hence why water is ok but other fluids are not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some anesthesia teams say it's not.  Depends on where you go.  They usually say &quot;put nothing in your fucking mouth.&quot;  Some people think the act of chewing a swallowing can promote gastric secretions.  How clinically relevant it is isn't entirely clear.  But if you tell people they can drink some sips of water, then they decide that maybe it's okay to have some coffee, maybe with some cream, etc.  These are the same people that will stop by McDonald's on the way to the emergency department (for a serious medical problem, possibly needing sedation for surgery) because &quot;we knew you wouldn't let him eat after he got here.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother was once yelled at by a nurse for chewing sugar free gum before surgery. Do you think that made sense? My mother  (and I) had the idea it shouldn't really matter as you're barely swallowing more than saliva, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They used to think that chewing gum increased gastric contents because it increases saliva production.  You then swallow the extra saliva as your chewing the gum and some believed it was comparable to drinking water before surgery.  Studies have shown this is not true but some older anesthesia personnel still believe it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case I think she even was allowed to drink water or tea (and swallow regular saliva, I presume). I guess the nurse must have been a bit overprotective. Or like other people stated, she may have come across too many people that are 'just chewing gum', while in reality they were eating other things as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to have an emergency c-section under general anesthesia, a few hours after having had dinner. The nurse gave me a little cup of something to drink that she said would &quot;settle my stomach.&quot; I want to say it was green and thick, but it was a long time ago. It evidently worked, because I didn't aspirate anything. Still scary though. That was almost 26 years ago, so it's possible they do something different now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still use something similar today that raises the pH of the stomach contents so if the patient does aspirate, the damage to the lungs is hopefully decreased with less acidic contents.</p></div>		</li>
