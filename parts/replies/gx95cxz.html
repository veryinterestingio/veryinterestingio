			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that many replies rely on &quot;proof of work&quot; cryptos, those are the ones that use graphics cards to calculate solutions to be allowed to sign the next block.</p>
<p>There is a new generation of cryptos getting more and more popular that rely on &quot;proof of stake&quot; which means those who hold the coins are the ones that sign the next block (it's based on the idea that people who are invested, don't want to fail the system and thus are honest participants).</p>
<p>Examples are ALGO and ADA. Algo is particularly interesting since to attack ALGO you need approx 66% of the coins and not just the regular 50.001% attack that you read here.</p>
<p>Also 4 sec transactions that dwarfs most major chains and could potentially get up to VISA and Mastercard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Proof of Stake&quot; is an extremely broad term. The reality is there are dozens of different approaches being taken by different networks with their own good and bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen a good answer to OPs real question. </p>
<p>Crypto code can't be broken because that's not the way it works. </p>
<p>ELI5 is: Find as many 6 digit numbers, that when multiplied together, give you a 12 digit number that ends with 7. Then divide that number by 3. If the last number is 0, then you got a coin! </p>
<p>But don't do this on a computer or calculator. Do this by hand with only a pencil and paper. Takes a long time, right? That's what makes the coins valuable, the length of of time to do the math problem. </p>
<p>Crypto currency is hard math problems for computers. Everybody already has the same code. They just need to wait a long time for the computer to solve the math problem.</p></div>		</li>
