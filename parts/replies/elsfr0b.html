			<div class="markdown"><p>Your reply definitely deserves an upvote. I honestly thought everyone else saw the movie too! IMO it’s the best part of reading — that’s often why movie adaptations of books are always kinda meh, in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me the book is ALWAYS better. It’s like a 6-12 hour long movie, where I get to choose the cast.</p>
<p>I also greatly prefer TV series to movies. So much more time to work with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cast is never super specific with me. I know characters by their deeds, personalities, and motivations. I &quot;see&quot; them in imaginary 3D space, but in a vague manner that doesn't have a specific appearance.</p>
<p>It's hard to describe. Some things are detailed, but I don't come up with unique faces for characters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's better than a movie partly because you're not just looking at it on a 2-D screen, you're there in the middle of it, feeling the warm storm breeze, smelling the salty spray of the sea; even inside the heads of the characters - wary but hopeful about the stranger who stopped to help you out, comforted by the tinny sounds of &quot;Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress&quot; echoing across the desert because they remind you of a time when you were safe at home and had nothing to worry about, etc.  Being able to get into the minds of the characters and experience it from their viewpoint is the major difference between books and movies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like stories but I get so bored reading. Audible has been a godsend. I can “see” it so much better when I can hear it. Movie adaptations always leave out so much detail. A full reading of a book doesn’t. </p>
<p>I find it much easier to follow the intention of characters when I hear it also. I drift away from the present if I read and lose the threads. </p>
<p>I’m sure the “movie in your head” helps you retain focus. I’ve never experienced anything remotely realistic visually in my head unless it’s a dream when I’m asleep. I just don’t think in pictures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting. I love reading but I've never even been a little tempted to use an audiobook. I know I would not be able to focus on the story and get immersed by hearing it aloud; I often jump back and forth between lines while reading to grab details that I know I read but want to re-reference, and it streams along like a movie. I couldn't do that with an audiobook.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm 100% focused on the audiobook it's just as vivid a picture in my head as if I were reading. If I'm using the audiobook as multitasking entertainment not so much.</p>
<p>I honestly thought everyone could see a movie in their head while reading a book or listening to a story. I can't imagine the appeal of reading without it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always had trouble explaining it to others in my family.  Once I start reading a book I become so immersed in it, that everything else seems to disappear.   I &quot;see&quot; the action and someone could be shouting at me to do something and I won't pay attention....used to get into trouble all the time because they always thought I was just ignoring them, which pissed my father off to no end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read quite often and definitely “see” the story that I am reading. In my case it is so vivid that I often think I’m watching something I’ve already seen.</p>
<p>Perfect example...While I was in prison I read every book Michael Connelly had written. His main character is Harry Bosch. Since I read the whole series, I was excited when I found out Amazon made a series out of the books. I started watching a few days ago and last night I was totally convinced I had seen this episode before, when I had really just read the book that the episode was scripted from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once or twice I've been halfway through a book only to realize I'd &quot;filled in a blank&quot; completely wrong regarding a character or place's appearance, or something like that. It's hard to reset to the author's intent after that and sometimes I prefer my interpretation and just go with it. When I was much younger and I found words I didn't understand I'd often keep reading and just try to guess on context. Usually I was on the right track and could figure it out. If you read a lot and the author doesn't suck it should flow naturally but sometimes you just have to shift your mental image to adjust to details you misinterpreted.</p>
<p>I don't read novels as much as I used to because I have other hobbies, but this isn't something unique to reading. When playing Roguelikes or MUDs (back in the day) I have a parallel daydream going on to fill in the missing graphics. When I play 4x games I spend a lot of time daydreaming about what's going on in my little empire. When I play XCOM or similar games I fill in a lot of the blanks in a similar way. I can't imagine playing video games without it and it's a big reason I don't really care about a game's graphics beyond a certain point. Not to mention something like math or programming. When I'm programming something there's a ton of visualization going on. I don't know how you'd do it without it.</p>
<p>I hope that didn't come off as r/iamverysmart. I don't think I'm that smart (I'm actually pretty dumb a lot of the time). But I spend most of the day with clear visualizations that are very vivid and they're a crucial component in my practical daily life. It's even something you can train. I used to use GPS to get around town for fear of being lost but when I forced myself not to do it for awhile I recognized the same part of my brain stepping in to fill the gap.</p></div>		</li>
