			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. I used to work in pharma, and the plant I worked at had multiple different lines and buildings for different product. </p>
<p>Flu buildings/lines ran for 9 months out of the year, and were down (due to no demand and maintenance for the rest of the time). </p>
<p>Meningitis would run 6-12 months depending on the year and the demand. Last year I worked there the meningitis building only ran 6 months, and wasn’t planning to run next year because there was enough supply built up (and it’s a 10 year expiration date). </p>
<p>Yellow Fever ran every other year or so (at least until Ebola outbreak). </p>
<p>Could you have converted a line between? Potentially, depending on the line and manufacturing style. Could they just have a smaller stockpile and play it that way? Potentially</p></div>		</li>

<p>Producing these vaccines will take up resources (raw materials, lab space, machines...</p>

<p>If I may add to that follow-on question (so not attempting to answer it). Recently Bill Gates was talking about building vaccine production facilities in anticipation of that very problem. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most Pharma companies that are competing for these resources carry a ton of finished goods inventory to mitigate risk... they can do this being in a cash rich business. Supply chain teams are still scrambling for PPE and common items (syringes, vials that can withstand low temps, etc). </p>
<p>Vial filling machines can be bought without knowing what it’ll run. Most of the upstream manufacturing (I can only speak for biological mfg) involve large stainless steel tanks (20,000 L) which are often the long lead time item. So you can start building out a facility without knowing exactly what it’ll run. Modular mfg has become really big in industry over the past 10 years too. That helps. </p>

<p>Common building blocks, in large part.  I can tell you that you're going to need to build me a dozen tables table in a month, but not tell you what kind.  So you can build a workshop with a tablesaw, drill press, lathe, planer, dust collector, etc., along with space to assemble and glue things up.  You might also acquire a bunch of wood boards and plywood.</p>
<p>When I actually give you the specifications, you can then start building them with the tools and materials you have on hand.  Doesn't really matter if it's a mid-modern end table, or a classic dining table; they use the same kinds of tools.</p>
<p>Drug (and other pharmaceutical) production uses similar building blocks.  You need a bunch of ultra-clean floorspace, tanks, specialized machinery, etc.  When the time comes to use it, you'll have to move stuff around into a production line, but the point is that you already <em>have</em> that stuff.  Especially the custom-made hardware that takes months or years to build.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the stuff you can probably safely assume will be needed with any vaccine and for other stuff id imagine taking educated guesses. With that said I'm with you on this and am curious to know more because how much of these facilities can be &quot;premade&quot; vs how much is going to be specific. </p>
<p>Id imagine in the grand scheme of things doing some of this really isn't nearly as expensive as us mere mortals would consider it to be but its probably pretty hard to push through a government budget.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true, but remember that those industries have also been ramping up for awhile. Back in March/April when everyone started the race to find the vaccine, companies that believed they were on the right track started placing huge orders for packaging components (vials, stoppers, seals, etc) and other materials. Packaging companies then had to prioritize orders and ramp up production where possible, but lead times are still huge compared to normal. It's a juggling act of which medicines are needed when, etc.</p></div>		</li>
