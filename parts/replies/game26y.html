			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thank you so much for your reply. I had actually read that paper before and most papers on teplizumab have very similar results afaik. No increased risk in infections is what confuses me as the antibody/drug does not seem to be selective. I'm only in the first year of uni so forgive my inexperience but what would you assume could be the case for no increase in infection rates?  Could you kindly advice me on a starting point/question to look for the answer please? E.g: Did they give something else to counteract the infections? Was it administered is a specific way? etc..</p></div>		</li>
