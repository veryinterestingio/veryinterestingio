			<div class="markdown"><p>Your sound recording is effectively all of the different waves added together.  They each overlap, they interfere with each other, they complement each other.</p>
<p>Think about you sitting in a concert hall listening to a performance.  Sound waves come from every direction, but you only have two ears.  Your hearing is effectively what the combined waves look like at each of your two eardrums.</p>
<p>Your speakers are doing the same thing, in reverse, playing back two different sets of &quot;all the sounds combined at a certain spot&quot;</p>
<p>And there's this concept in recording called &quot;binaural sound&quot;, where they actually do recording by placing two microphones in a position designed to precisely mimic the human ears.  If you play back such a sound recording on some good in-ear headphones, the sound should be just as directional, dynamic, and &quot;surround&quot; as if you'd been in the original recording studio hearing it live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The different tones just change the shape of the wave from a pure SIN wave to other shapes.  For example, if you take a note and add all its odd harmonics (3,5,7,9,etc) you will get a square wave.  Still the same note, but distorted AF.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be too frank but what exactly has you stumped about music? Not to kill your curiosity most definitely pursue that but I'm just saying in this case it seems like you're kind of ignoring that we hear hundreds of sounds all the time. How is this question different than asking &quot;How can I hear a person talking and a car driving by at the same time?&quot;</p>
<p>It struck me as odd that your original question used two instruments for examples because you could just as easily ask &quot;Why does a chipmunk sound different than a lawnmower?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
