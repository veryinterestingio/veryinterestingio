			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the cause, most functions will still be active, as it is the brain itself which is responsible for consciousness. Unless the organs are the underlying cause (kidney or liver failure) they will continue to work. Catheters are used to monitor the amount of urine produced, and other thing can be used to monitor the patient. </p>
<p>Consciousness is sometimes thought of as peeling an onion - the top layers are what people associate with being alive - memories, speech, what it is to interact with your environment. As you go further through the layers, the brain becomes more basic. It controls the most fundamental aspects of being alive - breathing, certain reflexes etc. If these are damaged, then a person may not be able to breath for themselves and would require a ventilator. The most catastrophic of this is termed ‘brain dead’ (in the UK anyway). The brain can provide no function, but other functions persist, such as a heart beat which doesn’t require the brain to happen. If only the top layer has been ‘damaged’ the body will function normally, but the only outward sign of something being wrong is that the person is not awake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my own personal experience being in a coma, I had a catheter in and had my breathing controlled via a tube down my throat. I woke up on my own, in complete and utter shock and ripped the tube out of my throat. That was a terrible idea. Comas suck something fierce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Following on from this perfect response.
There are many different tools used to assess someone’s conscious level, however the most common is the “gcs” or Glasgow Coma Scale. It’s a very quick and easy assessment completed by ems, nurses and doctors . </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating, thank you for answering these questions.
When someone has had a head injury and been in a medically- induced coma for weeks or months, then medication (to keep them unconscious?) is stopped and they don't respond, but some weeks or months later they do, what has changed? The brain has somehow managed to heal more in that additional time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real answer is no one knows for sure. What we do know is that dead brain cells don't grow back, but connections between cells sometimes can develop (more common in young people) that can bypass dead areas. So on rare occasions, your brain can sort of fix itself. But there are some cases where we have no idea why a person got better months down the road.</p></div>		</li>
