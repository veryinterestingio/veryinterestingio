			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you able to hold your pee? My friend has 2 kids and told me that when she was jump roping that pee would come out alittle. She was told she should do kegels to strengthen the walls. She’s able to hold her pee for awhile but for only a certain time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EXACTLY! It was an impossible guessing game that was seemed physically impossible! I don’t think they make you drink water anymore like that. I don’t remember having to do it with my second, they were 12 years apart.</p></div>		</li>
