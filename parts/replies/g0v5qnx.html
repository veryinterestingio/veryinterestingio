			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain killers are often thought of as fixing the problem, but instead block nerves from sending signals and decrease pain. </p>
<p>But chemo and radio therapy can contribute to loss of function. The basic idea of those two therapies is kill the bad cells (cancer) and save the good ones (healthy tissue). The problem is that a cancer specific drug/radiation doesn't exist. </p>
<p>Chemo therapy targets rapidly dividing cells. Since most of your body doesn't divide rapidly, that's ok. But things that do (hair, sperm, finger nails) will be affected pretty noticeably too. Prolonged treatment will affect good cells too.</p>
<p>Radiotherapy uses radiation to destroy DNA to prevent cell division as well. This can help manage tumors in places that aren't vital, but can also have lasting effects on organs near the tumor. </p>
<p>Both come with high risks and weaken the body. Doctors balance the fine line between trying to kill the cancer (which in some cases could spread rapidly and kill you if untreated) and not giving a high dose that permanently damages the body. </p>
<p>Many people often refuse these treatments for that very reason. The quality of life vs length it could give isn't worth it. Sometimes they're done to decrease tumor size to make surgery an option. Sometimes they can successfully eliminate the cancer. That's what makes cancer such a tough disease to cure. It's hard to find a way to attack cancer without attacking the body along with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a good read. Thanks! Personally having seen how sick chemo and radio therapy make you, I wouldn't seek treatment unless it was an extremely high survival rate. I can definitely understand and respect those people who don't seek treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. I read something about how some people on chemo often die of starvation basically. I'm not sure if that means literally starvation (like not eat due to lack of appetite or inability to absorb the vitamins, minerals and energy out of the food) or if it meant that it starves your body's cells. Just trying to find some answers on my grief journey in the hope it'll sit better with me</p></div>		</li>
