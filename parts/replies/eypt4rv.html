			<div class="markdown"><p>Geology and Geotechnical areas are probably the most specialised if we are talking about subways, the rest of the subway infrastructure can be adapted from other civil projects. Both geologists and Geotechnical engineers would be transfering a lot of their skills from the mining industry. I would say most of the surveyors working on this type of project probably come from underground mining rather than civil backgrounds as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modeling and digital services are also changing the way subways are designed and built. There are a handful of engineering companies around the world who pretty much specialize on this. </p>
<p>There are some great examples of what modeling has simplified/made possible in the last 5 years alone! Unfortunately most of that stuff is super confidential, but you can find a lot of nice case studies presented in conferences around the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there a lot of articles in civil eng. journals that have case studies from specific projects?  As you say, companies probably want to keep their techniques confidential (and are probably reluctant to share their failures)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geotechs do way more than mining.  Nearly every civil project requires a geotech at some stage since most things we build have to interface with the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, not at all...  there are massive engineering conglomerates that specialize in large scale civil and transportation works and plenty of engineers that spend their careers exclusively in those areas (not from mining).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As well as gathering experts in those systems, remember that previous subway construction projects were well documented. Anyone who is an expert in the construction field can follow the guidelines set by previous subway builders. You don't need every expert there because at some point in the past they already got together and figured out how to make a subway; it doesn't need to be figured out from scratch again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you hire a designer their output is typically plans (drawings), calculation reports and specifications (rules and instructions for the builders). For a subway the client is usually the city and they’ll keep copies in their records.
During construction the builder will keep logs of their work and any changes needed due to site conditions, errors or improvements. Those too get kept by the client.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All plans are documented by who builds them because they need to send those plans to the construction teams, depending on whether the project is Design-Build, or Design-Bid-Build. </p>
<p>In the U.S.A. at least those records are kept by a local municipality and can be accessed by authorized personnel for later use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For massive infrastructure projects, the documentation has to be meticulous. For a number of reasons, but we know from past experience that if you build something huge and don't know every last metre of it, then it's going to bite you (or rather someone in 30 years) in the ass.</p>
<p>This is unlike building a house, for example, where you may have your architects drawings, but if the builder decides to make a change such as running a pipe along a different wall or making deeper foundations, that will probably never be mentioned anywhere except in a short conversation.</p></div>		</li>
