			<div class="markdown"><p>You've mixed up &quot;pinging&quot; with preignition. Pinging is actually a mild form of detonation. Most modern engines operate very near detonation all the time, going in and out of mild detonation as the computer adjusts the timing to optimize performance and efficiency. The &quot;ping&quot; is the structure of the engine resonating in reaction to pressure spikes caused by the detonation. The explosion of the detonation is like hitting your engine with a hammer; it will cause your engine to vibrate like a bell.</p>
<p>There is no ping with pre-ignition. Yes, the fuel-air mixture is ignited prior to the spark event, but there is no explosion. The mixture burns just like it would if the spark ignited it, but it's burning during the compression stroke, which causes extreme internal cylinder pressures and generates a tremendous amount of heat. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that an engine can run for a long time under mild--or even moderate--detonation. It will eventually begin to show signs of abnormal wear (piston crown pitting, piston skirt scuffing, broken ring lands, etc.), but detonation significant enough to cause instantaneous damage would be very hard to miss. Pre-ignition, on the other hand, can result in catastrophic engine failure after just a few engine revolutions, and you won't notice a thing until the engine starts puking parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually agree with what you had wrote. Pre ignition or advanced spark is pining and is the exactly the thing a knock sensor is looking for when advancing timing .  </p></div>		</li>
