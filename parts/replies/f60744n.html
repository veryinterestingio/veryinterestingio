			<div class="markdown"><p>In general it is thought that natural solar time is ideal. If you live on the western edge of your time zone, solar noon is slightly later than 12:00, whereas on the eastern edge of your time zone, solar noon is slightly earlier than 12:00. Most time zones are slightly skewed, such that the discrepancy between solar noon and 12:00 is bigger on the western edge. You can see the difference between solar time and standard time across the globe on this map:<a href="http://blog.poormansmath.net/images/SolarTimeVsStandardTime.png" target="_blank"> <a href="http://blog.poormansmath.net/images/SolarTimeVsStandardTime.png" target="_blank">http://blog.poormansmath.net/images/SolarTimeVsStandardTime.png</a></a></p>
<p>A lot of the research that we at SRBR consider most important is outlined in position paper: <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0748730419854197" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0748730419854197" target="_blank">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0748730419854197</a></a>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. That first link was very interesting. Having lived in Kununurra (in the green zone to the extreme NE of Western Australia) I can say it's strange to be on (or past) the edge of a time zone. The sun both rises and sets very early, and because it's in the tropics the seasonal variation in sunlit hours is very small (about 1hr total).</p>
<p>The border region in the extreme SE of the state operates on an <a href="https://greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/australia/western-australia/eucla/" target="_blank">unofficial 'border time</a>' halfway between the adjacent timezones (which differ by 1 1/2 hours).</p>
<p>Have you observed any west coast/east coast trend in acceptance of DST?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why? This looks like a strange coincidence. Noon on the clock is rarely the center of the time a person is awake, and different people wake up at different time on the clock.</p></div>		</li>
