<p>All viruses have a &quot;protein shell&quot;, the capsid. Its primary function is protecting the genome until it can be released into the host cell. There's different types of these capsid in terms of structure roughly divided into the terms &quot;helical&quot;, consisting of a polymer of few structures with highly variable length, &quot;icosahedral&quot;, consisting of 20 equilateral triangles and &quot;complex&quot; ones, that are, well, a bit more complex...</p>
<p>They <em>can</em> optionally have an &quot;envelope&quot;, a lipid membrane derived from the host cell, on top of that, altering the strategy used for infection of the given virus compared to viruses that don't have such a membrane.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking the only obligatory features of a virus is this capsid and the genome.</p>
<p>(I know that you are most likely aware of this, but I thought that that part of your comment was a bit unclear.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might have overestimated my likelihood of being aware of every relevant detail... my memory of helical capsids was that they weren't shell-like, but looking up tobacco mosaic virus and it appears the proteins form a hard structure that fully contains the genome.</p>
<p>I'm not so sure about influenza and ebola though, is it true to say they have &quot;shells&quot;? The influenza nucleoprotein does protect the genome so it is doing the part of the same thing as the capsid proteins, but it is not hard and it does not form a &quot;container&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, at the end of the day, it's kind of personal opinion of wether you would classify those as &quot;shells&quot;, as that term is not strictly defined.</p>
<p>By definition however, they would be classified as the capsid and, again, by definition, all viruses contain this protective &quot;coat&quot; (maybe a more fitting word for you?). Though I agree that this definition becomes a bit more &quot;fluid&quot; especially given the segmented nature of the Influenza genome, anyhow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the lipid membrane came about as regular evolution of some ancient virus. It's not necessarily down to external threats, it was just, for some scenarios a better suited strategy for the virus' reproduction.</p>
<p>The membrane isn't really about protecting the virus more; Actually, enveloped viruses are generally more susceptible to inactivation because the membrane is far more sensitive than the capsid itself.</p>
<p>This issue comes with the fact that the outer most boundary of a virus is the part that has to make contact with the host's cells to infect them. In naked viruses, it's proteins of the capsid itself; in enveloped ones it's proteins on its membrane.</p>
<p>Therefore, by disrupting the membrane, you have taken away the virion's (virus particle) mechanism to infect.</p>
<p>So, to summarize: It's not really about external threats, some classes of viruses are enveloped others simply aren't. They don't &quot;decide&quot; to spontaneously take some mebrane with them; the virus just uses the strategy, that its genome has evolved to use, as each strategy requires very specific genes to deploy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Icosahedron is a shape - its a polyhedron with 20 faces. Icosahedral simply refers to the shape of the virus. Viruses who have outer coats of proteins can take various shapes, including icosahedron, in contrast to viruses with outer coat of lipids and proteins (like the SARS-COV2 we're discussing here) which tend to approximate spheres. Pure (or nearly pure) protein coats can hold a shape while lipid bags without a structure anchoring it naturally becomes a sphere. For esample, dissociated cells in suspension from humans (or any vertibrates) often appear spherical, while they have different characteristic shapes in the different tissues they are part of.</p>
<p>I don't know anything about the pecentage you mention, so can't comment on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Richard Preston's books about Ebola have fascinating info about the sheer numbers of viruses in the environment as well as wonderful comparisons of their sizes to other small things.</p>
<p>Crisis in the Red Zone (2019), a book about the west African Ebola epidemic, is wonderfully timely in its depictions of how to stop the chain of infection. Survival sometimes requires that we do things that would not normally be considered things that normal humans do.</p></div>		</li>
