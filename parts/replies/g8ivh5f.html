			<div class="markdown"><p>With water, it’s a Clink! Sound. With Soda water it’s a Clack! Sound, because of the big bubbles, with 7up, it’s a sound in between because 7up has smaller bubbles than soda water does.</p>
<p>Edit.  Try it at home.  You’ll see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is “Soda Water” which is just carbonated water and then there are “sodas” which would be soda water a syrup, like Coke, Pepsi, sprite.... </p>
<p>Oh!  I just remembered, there’s a difference in Diet Coke and regular coke too.   It’s been to many years since I did it so I can’t recall which has a higher pitch. </p>
<p>Next time you are out with friends and they order different sodas in glasses, clink the glass with a quarter or a larger coins and you can hear the different sounds they make.  It’s cool.</p></div>		</li>
