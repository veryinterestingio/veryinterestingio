<p>Even single-celled organisms work together, sometimes in very complicated ways. That means one cell doesn't have to do everything.</p>

<p>Probably the most relatable example of this would be that slime and gunk you see growing in a drain or damp area that hasn't been cleaned for a while.
This is called a biofilm and is a complex web of proteins that are produced by different species to provide a safe area to grow, among other reasons. </p>
<p>The coolest example is probably that micro-organisms can actually share and swap DNA, even between species. This is actually one of the methods originally used to make GM crops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. In school you usually learn about one or two interdependent relationships. In the wild there's a complex ecosystem of cooperation and competition in nearly every microscopic environment. We think of the food chain/web as only happening at the level we can see. If we could see the microscopic world with our own eyes, we would realize how amazingly complex the &quot;food web&quot; around us really is.</p></div>		</li>
