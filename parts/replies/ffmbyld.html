			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about what the difference is between these two concepts. Eyes to nose is looking at the same subject. Eyes to the outside is looking at two different things, which your brain isn't capable of processing. What I mean by that is, notice that everything from your actual vision to your peripheral is one solid circle, no breaks. Splitting your eyes would require seeing &quot;two pictures&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who can move his eyes more or less independently, I can tell you that it has zero benefit.</p>
<p>My brain will focus on the image from one eye, so that stays crystal clear, but the other image becomes a blurry mess that my brain then tries to overlap into the crystal clear image, distorting everything.</p>
<p>It's very dumb.</p></div>		</li>
