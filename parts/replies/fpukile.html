			<div class="markdown"><p>Stay at home has me totally wrecked.  I‚Äôm about to just get any job just keep me on track.  The #1 thing that gets me up is the embarrassment of being late to something.  I used to schedule breakfast meetings with super important contacts so I‚Äôd get up early.     It‚Äôs hard af to manifest expectation when my life doesn‚Äôt require it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should really try to tackle that with a psychologist or therapist, this is gonna bite you in the ass more and more. You don‚Äôt have to jump out of bed, but your life and enjoyment of it should be decent enough for you to get up by yourself, alone, without any external motivations.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt like labels, but apart from ADHD which another commenter mentioned, depression is also a contestant. An important part of depression is the feeling of lack of control over your life, and not having an intrinsic motivation to do things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See it as the challenge in itself ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to wake up early but let‚Äôs challenge myself and see it as a game‚Äù.</p>
<p>The secret about success is automation. You need to automate the hard stuff : automate grit, automate learning, automate, motivation , automate risk taking.</p>
<p>In other words, you need one small action daily in each category . Like take 20 mins after lunch to listen to a podcast on a topic you don‚Äôt need for work. For motivation: listen to a podcast when you wake up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>same. &quot;getting shit together&quot; still doesn't seem to mean anything to me. intuition about making good life experiences is not an easy thing to craft.</p>
<p>while defaulting to resource accumulation is useful. i.e. making comfortable amount of money while absorbing as much information as possible, where to use either is more important than having them. and even if one understands that, it's easy to get stuck in to a groove and not really use those resources once you have them</p>
<p>edit: maybe there should be some sort of life planning service to shake you up every once in a while. they could arrange temp work for you in another field, or a trip to a new culture without touristy crap, etc. this'd probably be a thing once automation has picked up enough for most work to be non-essential.</p></div>		</li>
