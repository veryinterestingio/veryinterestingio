			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are pretty unique among apes in that birthing is difficult. Orangutans can give birth alone and quietly (assumed relatively painlessly). Other than birth everything is pushing our heads to be bigger, I'm not sure that evolution would have reversed the trend in the last 30k years because of birth difficulties. Unless the point is we overdid it in the first 70k years and are stabilizing now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>C sections are not overly caused by big heads. However, the reverse seems to be true. Particularly since doctors (and some patients) have been/currently are more inclined to perform a C section for health and convenience reasons. A baby with a big head who would not have otherwise made it, now exists in the world because of C sections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, why shrink the baby’s head and not widen the mother’s job bones? Not like evolution is actively choosing, but it seems like there would be fewer drawbacks to widening the hips as opposed to shrinking the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are have to think of it from the view of the offspring surviving, not the mother. If twins are born and one has a smaller head, it would be more likely to survive it, while a baby with big hips would be equally likely to survive as one with small hips.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The variety of hip sizes in women strongly points to it <em>not</em> being the limiting factor in fetal development.  There is a school of thought that something like pre-eclampsia is the fetus's attempt to get more of its waste processed, but with the downside of liver failure in the woman.  The ability to get wastes processed without being able to secrete pee and poop externally may be the limiting factor.</p>
<p>I think the size of a mature brain is unlikely to be related to any pressures on fetal development.</p></div>		</li>
