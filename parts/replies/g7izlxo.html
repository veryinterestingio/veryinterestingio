			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, too true. Having to deal with plastic in the dishwasher is a bloody ball-ache. It takes a lot longer to automatically dry, even after giving it a quick shake, than ceramic or wood. (I don't put wood in the dishwasher, tho: I have to hand-wash the little wooden boards and let them dry naturally on the rack)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually that would increase the rate of heat transfer (larger surface area) and in most circumstances cause the water to evaporate faster the correct answer has to do with the specific heat capacity of plastic being much lower than ceramic steel or glass thus while all the dishes in the dishwasher may reach the same temperature in the drying cycle, the plastic does not have enough stored thermal energy to evaporate the water and reaches the same temperature as the water (no heat transfer) before the water can evaporate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of surface the water comes in contact with isn't the evaporation surface though. If the texture causes the water to bead up more, there is less water exposed to the air compared to if that amount were spread out, so less evaporation surface. So texture + lack of thermal retention in the plastic both mean the water evaporates slower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, this is also because there is more mass in the other dishes, which retains more heat energy from the hot rinse water, which is transferred to the water still on the glass/dish/etc and evaporate it.</p>
<p>I fell this was implied in your reply, but I just wanted to make sure that the point was clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stop saying mass. It's not related to mass. A tupperwear container weighing 1 kilo still takes longer to dry than a glass bowl weighing 1 kilo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wash my dishes in cold water and the tupperware takes way longer to air dry. Thus, retaining heat from either the dishwasher cycle or the warm water can't be the primary answer since this phenomenon still occurs with cold water washing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it also has to do with thermal conductivity. Water vaporization takes energy, and that energy has to come from the environment. Low thermal conductivity of plastics hinders this energy transfer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemist here.  It it due to the hydrophobic (water hating) or hydrophilic (water loving) nature of the material. Because plastic doesn't like water, it beads. When water beads it takes more energy to evaporate. Because the surface of ceramics or glass loves water it spreads out.  Spreading out allows it to evaporate faster</p></div>		</li>
