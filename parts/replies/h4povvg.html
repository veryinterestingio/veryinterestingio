<p>Also, PCR tests don't take as long on their own. They're that long because either 1. There's too many samples. Or 2. There's not enough samples for a kit to be worth using. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual PCR test takes 90 minutes.  This is fixed whether you test one sample or 96.</p>
<p>Receiving, identifying, labeling, recording and preparing the samples to be tested takes 3 hours.  This can change if you have unlimited amounts of staff, equipment or samples.</p>
<p>Samples have to get from where they were taken to a lab.</p>
<p>So you can get a PCR result back inside a couple of hours in perfect circumstances but it will probably be closer to six for a quick run through.  Twenty four hours for a standard result and forty eight if something went wrong.</p>
<p>Big labs running 24/7 can shave time off cause they have no overnight downtime but they also end up snowed with samples so those can sit around for 18 hours waiting for an analyser slot cause no one stocks their labs based on &quot;What if we get a once in a century pandemic&quot; and once you're in one you find equipment a lot harder to source</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a PCR at our clinic, run by certified lab techs. Runs 4 samples at a time and takes an absolute maximum of 1hr. Will bail out earlier if the tests are positive. Someone asked cycle numbers - ours won’t go over 40 or so I’m pretty sure (maybe a couple more??) with cycles of around 90s each but would have to check the manual.  If positive over 36, I believe we label it “indeterminate” and either run the sample again or send to the big lab to run. Basically no samples grow live virus with a CT over that, so depending on the clinical scenario, we make decisions to retest at a later date or not.</p>
<p>Also, the key here is less about sensitivity but specificity. The rapid molecular tests are designed to err on the side of sensitivity (try to never miss a true case but need confirmatory tests because they’ll cross react with other things) while PCR is as specific and sensitive as we get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, for efficiency, they are generally run in full batches, so if your sample is just missed the cutoff of a full run, it might sit in the fridge for a few hours until there are enough to do a full run again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or shipping samples to a central processing point for testing. qPCR testing takes about 4 hours processing time from the moment the sample is opened, from RNA extraction through PCR cycles on the analysis machine. The rest is sample shipping, tracking, analysis and communication, the bulk of it being shipping or batching of samples.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What is the benefit of a rapid test? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also another dimension to consider: is the test being used as a medical diagnostic, or is it being used as a public health/social interaction measure?</p>
<p>For a medical diagnostic test, you tend to want the most accuracy and are willing to sacrifice a bit of speed to get it.  Your doctor basically needs to know what's going on with you, to guide treatment.</p>
<p>For a public health measure, you may want something that is less accurate, but is cheap and easy enough to administer often and everywhere.  If you miss 10-20% of positive cases, that's OK, because you're just going to do the same test to everyone in a couple of days, and live with some clusters developing, because you'll be knocking the virus's replication down 80% with every iteration (and hopefully the iterations will be faster than the virus's replication cycle because your test is cheap and fast).</p>
<p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6542/635" target="_blank">Using rapid tests as a public health measure is what Slovakia did as part of its strategy late last year</a>.  Unfortunately for the US, we never really adopted rapid tests and are using expensive PCR tests in the role of public health measure, which it isn't well suited for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Some companies rapid test every employee every few days or even every day. </p>
<p>Many speculated the white house or AF1 used rapid tests. Its not 100% accurate but when you test everyday you can still catch trends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To note, they were using the rapid test kind of wrong. It would be better to run the test over the <em>same</em> population, rather than against a whole bunch of one off visitors. With the high false negative rate, you have to do multiple iterations to eliminate cases, but that does not work if you are only testing a large fraction of people only once. Lots of misses in that case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plus, the 24 hours of delay in knowing whether someone can be  contagious might end up being worse than the 10% of false negatives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending where you are also how many tests are being completed, PCR tests don't necessarily take a long time either. Not instant of course, but I had a PCR test yesterday and received results in just under 12 hours. It all depends on test numbers and capacity.</p></div>		</li>
