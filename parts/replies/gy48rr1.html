			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin D3 sythensis is regulated by hormones in the skin. Simply put, when there’s a lot a vitamin D3 in the system, the body will stop producing vitamin D precursors. </p>
<p>There’s also regulation later in the process. Vitamin D synthesis is also down-regulated by the FGF23 protein acting on a transport protein that mediates bone growth, NPT2. When there’s a lot of new bone cells, FGF23 it will inhibit NPT2 to regulate the process.</p>
<p>So while it may be possible, it is extremely unlikely to develop a Vitamin D toxicity from sun exposure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have actually always wondered if there is also a need to have more skin exposed to the sun as well. I work alot outside, but I am never without pants or shirt. my legs are super white despite my face and arms being brown. is my vitamin d production and potentially any downstream effects such as the bone density in my legs or something, affected by the fact that only 2 spots on my body ever see sun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Synthesis is unregulated in skin that &quot;doesn't usually see the sun.&quot; So yes, your white bits generates more vitamin d than your brown bits. So for maximum production you need to expose the white bits to the sun. </p>
<p><strong>But</strong> you actually need very little vitamin D and it is toxic in large doses, resulting in kidney stones, bone pain, nausea, vomiting, and frequent urination. And since it is fat soluble and not water soluble, it stay in the body and isn't excreted in the urine.</p>
<p>US Public Health Dept. recommends 8 - 15 mins of sun exposuer a day to reach your needed vitamin D dose. So, if you work outside for more than 15 minutes you have already reached your max level, and your body will down regulate precursors so that you don't make any more vitamin d.</p>
<p>Wearing pants and a shirt also protects for UV radiation and decreases the risk of skin cancer.</p>
<p>TR/DL: if you are outside more that 15 mins you have reached your max D levels so there is no need to show more skin. Also, exposure to the sun the risk of skin cancer, therefore, plz keep your pants n shirt on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but then no interestingly. It turns out your tanning response is stronger than your need for vitamin d to the point that really extreme sun exposure can lead to paradoxically reduced vitamin d levels. Think surfers spending all day in tropical sun light. Fortunately that’s a rare extreme</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sunlight UVB hits skin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7-DHC already present in skin transforms into cholecalciferol (vitamin D3)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liver transforms it into calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If calcium low, parathyroid produces parathydroid hormone (PTH)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PTH makes kidney produce 1-alpha-hydroxylase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1-alpha-hydroxylase transforms calcidiol into calcitriol, its ACTIVE AND FINAL FORM! (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3)</p>
</li>
<li>Calcitriol makes calcium go up eventually by making bones release calcium and intestine absorb more calcium.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also get inactivated vitamin D from dietary sources, but the primary source is sunlight. Once ingested it goes to the liver first then the rest of the process is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do not need to expose yourself to the sun when taking vitamin D supplements. The form that is taken is usually some form of calciferol/ergocalciferol, that is, the precursor to active vitamin D, that is synthesized <em>after</em> sun exposure.</p>
<p>It still requires liver and kidney action to function however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that wearing sunscreen reduces the production of vitamin D? If so, is there an optimal amount of sun exposure without sunscreen, balancing the health implications of vitamin D, skin cancer, sun burns etc? Similarly,  is there an optimal SPF level (perhaps depending on exposure time) for the same considerations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes, but if you're out long enough to warrant sunscreen, you'll more than likely get enough Vitamin D. It'll be more beneficial if it's more regular (20 minutes a day versus none for a month then a beach vacation) but depending on your skin tone that may change. If you're worried, check the list of symptoms and if you're experiencing any see a doctor. If you're not and are still worried, you can get a test for $30-$40 to check your levels. It's a bit late now, but the work from home adjustments due to the pandemic had impact on a lot of people including me, so looking at how your life has changed over a few months would be valuable in evaluating if there's cause for concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sunscreen would decrease the production of Vitamin D. The higher the SPF and amount used would further decrease production. As for an optimal amount of sunlight, it depends on who you ask. Ask a Dermatologist, and they will say that zero sun exposure is ideal as the risks of sun exposure (skin cancer, aggressive premature aging) far outweigh the benefits. A Vitamin D3 supplement can prevent vitamin D deficiency without the risks associated with sun exposure.</p>
<p>The other (hidden) benefit of sunscreen is UVA protection. Basically you have two types of UV light, UVA and UVB. Both cause skin cancer and skin aging however only UVB is responsible for sunburns. UVA does not cause sunburn and as such is very hard to identify when being exposed to it. A great example of where this would matter is when the sun shines through windows. Glass reflects UVB light but lets UVA through. This is why you can be exposed to the sun through a window and not have to worry about getting burnt. However, the skin is still being exposed to UVA radiation that breaks down collagen and mutates DNA. A sunscreen provides full coverage against both.</p>
<p>If there's only one thing to take away, it would be to NEVER USE TANNING LOTIONS or low SPF sunscreens. These products absolutely destroy the skin as they only contain sunscreen filters that block UVB rays, letting you stay outside in the sun for longer than you otherwise would be able to without burning. While you may not be burning, you're still being exposed to UVA rays in quantities that would otherwise be impossible without getting 3rd degree burns, leading to skin cancer and aging down the line. Tanning beds apply the same concept in that they only emit UVA light to stimulate melanin production without burning.</p></div>		</li>
