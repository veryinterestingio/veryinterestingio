			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! As a mother of a baby born without surfactant, I know taking the first breath is more than mechanical. There’s a chemical component too (surfactant). Luckily for us, synthetic surfactant exist and she began to breathe on her own after given a dose. But still was intubated and stayed 8 days in the NICU. Never had any breathing issues since <knock on wood></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is surfactant to be applied extrauterine, in the same way that there are emergency lung maturation treatments, however in some countries these treatments cost a fortune, and I mean what a small house costs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really hope it's a serious question. </p>
<p>During the fetal period, we obtain the nutrients from the maternal-fetal circulation, our intestines remaining sterile (without bacteria growth), however at 4 months, meconium begins to form (a substance composed of dead cells, amniotic fluid, gastric secretions, etc.) In normal situations, meconium remains inside the body until the beginning of extrauterine life, however in situations of fetal stress (tachycardia, little amniotic fluid, pre-eclampsia, prolonged labor, etc.), the expulsion of meconium may occur. when this happens it is said that the baby pooped inside</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>completely correct, they are collapsed, it is thanks to the pressure change and the surfactant that they are insufflated </p>
<p>in cases where there is not enough pulmonary surfactant as in the case of neonatal acute respiratory syndrome they do inflate but not effectively and gas exchange is inefficient</p></div>		</li>
