			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had this issue (due to hearing problems) for years.<br />
Old TV’s,new TV’s,cheap,expensive,stereo,dolby,smart,surround etc..<br />
i’ve tried all the types and catchphrases and still have issues.<br />
I have to turn it up loud to distinguish the voices (and still need to concentrate to understand).   If it were all the same level at least half the problem would be solved (scene changes that blast suddenly +10 decibels higher).<br />
I thought SmartSound would work but it really doesn’t.<br />
I’ve been glancing around to find one that I can use wireless headphones with (without external device) for when it’s time to replace ours soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to the hardware. No matter which setting, the sound is being downmixed no matter what. It’s just a question of which device is doing it. A $50 Blu-ray player won’t do it as cleanly as a $200 receiver.</p>
<p>Also if you’re watching through tv speakers, check to make sure your tv sound is set to stereo and not simulated surround. Those surround DSP’s will throw the volume out of whack super quick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then you probably want an audio compressor/limiter somewhere in the signal chain. Some applications have one built in (like vlc on windows) but there are probably stand alone options for this by now for most platforms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mixed for dialogue on centre channel is the correct answer.  Discs may (should) also have a straight stereo mix which will suit stereo speakers better than 5.1, 3.1 or 2.1</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's amazing.  Viewing Interstellar at the cinema I thought it was a weird creative decision to increase the background noise so much in tense situations that I could only hear maybe one word in five the actors were saying. </p>
<p>Reluctantly watched it on DVD later and it was fine. </p>
<p>The screen/ room at that cinema was one of the smallest I've seen, even though it was a major chain maybe this was why!!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In these days of digital projection, many cinemas no longer employ dedicated, skilled projectionists but just press play instead.  Behind the screen of any proper cinema is the centre channel speaker, if the small screen didn't have a centre speaker (or it had been turned off for a PowerPoint presentation for a company or something dull), then playing the x.1 mix would sound shit, as you discovered.  If you get it again, walk out, demand your money back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be correct, but don't forget that (many) movies also have an insane dynamic loudness range. Unlike music or other types of audio which is often &quot;compressed&quot;. (ELI5: Movies often contain, intentionally, very loud parts, eg. for explosions etc.)</p>
<p>So if you turn down the volume because the explosions and whatever are too loud, you turn down everything, with the result that the dialogue is then too quiet.</p>
<p>Solution: Some audio players, but also TVs etc. have a &quot;smart volume&quot; or &quot;night watching&quot; setting which compresses (means: decreases the dynamics of) the sound. Which means, the difference between loud and quiet parts of a movie is then not as big. You can then set the volume of the movie so you can understand the dialogue, without the loud parts bringing down the house.</p></div>		</li>
