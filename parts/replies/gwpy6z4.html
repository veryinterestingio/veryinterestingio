			<div class="markdown"><p>Fermat's Last Theorem is so fascinating because it was originally written in 1637, but Andrew Wiles didn't prove it until 1994 using forms/areas of math that hadn't been discovered/invented yet when Fermat wrote the theorem down. How the hell did Fermat know that???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the more common belief is that Fermat believed he had a proof when he wrote it, and then later realized that it was wrong before publishing more details. That scenario isn't so unlikely considering that small exponents (like n=3) have relatively simple proofs that seem like they might work more generally but actually don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some things it's pretty straightforward to get an idea that &quot;yeah this is probably true&quot; without knowing at all how to prove it. See the Collatz Conjecture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually that one isn’t a super good example. There’s many forms where it’s true and forms where it isn’t, and the particular case in the Collatz Conjecture is right on the edge. For example, if you do 3n-1 instead of 3n+1, it’s false, and there’s no clear reason why they’d be different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that covers most things for most people.</p>
<p>almost everyone knows 1+1 is always 2 but how many can prove it? I could look at the digits of pi and correctly guess it's irrational but I sure as hell can't create a proof for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The maths gets super complicated, but what they're trying to say isn't necessarily! Let me try rephrase it.</p>
<p>You cant manually check an infinite number of equations for every possible solution. No matter how many you check, you'd (by definition) have infinitely more to check! So you need to work it out using logic. You have to be able to say &quot;if <em>statement X</em> is true, then I can show you that <em>statement Y</em> is true in every case also, by following some logic&quot;. And that logic is what mathematicians have to figure out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not trying to be dismissive, but I'm curious why this matters? Are these problems simply thought experiments by mathematicians? In the example you give (and others below), it seems it's more for mathematicians to play with and work at, than anything of value practically. Not making a value judgment (pun!), just making sure I'm understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our modern world is built upon the abstract problem solving of centuries ago.</p>
<p>Fourier's theorems gave us the ability to map between a time domain and a frequency domain. 300 years later, that suddenly now gives us the entirety of digital audio, antenna transmission, error correction, filtering, quantum mechanics, and so much more.</p>
<p>Galois's work in combining field and group theory 200 years ago gave us modern encryption, authentication, and showed important facts about algebra and geometry (such as certain equations being unsolvable, and certain shapes being unconstructable).</p>
<p>Turing's abstract algorithm solving machines gave us the foundations of computer science 90 years ago, built upon the foundations of the likes of Babbage and Lovelace, and Church. These people basically designed the first computers and wrote the first programs in papers and theories.</p>
<p>Lorentz' work on transformations in abstract mathematical spaces paved the way for modern physics through the likes of Einstein's Special+General Relativity and major breakthrough's in the previously-discovered Maxwell's Equations for electromagnetism.</p>
<p>Newton and Leibniz gave us calculus by studying how variables change over time, and calculus is fundamental to all of engineering, physics, economics, biology... basically everything.</p>
<p>Euler gave us so much it's hard to even begin. His works are at the cores of basically every branch of mathematics, science, and engineering today.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is a really short list, and I'm absolutely not read up on the history and applications of abstract mathematics, this is just what I've encountered in my life as a computer engineer. If anyone has any other examples please do share</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait the basis for TDMA and FDMA were theorized THEE HUNDRED YEARS AGO?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most obvious use for problems of number theory like fermats last theorem is cryptography.  Cryptography is heavily dependent on &quot;theoretical&quot; math, and solving problems like fermats last theorem can lead to surprising breakthroughs elsewhere.  Computing and physics is another one, as we reach the physical limits of &quot;simple&quot; circuits</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cryptography is heavily dependent on such math because cryptography needs to have no shortcuts in order to be secure.  You either know the password, or have to guess more times than there are stars/planets/atoms in the universe.</p>
<p>That is, if an encryption makes an assumption on how numbers work, and it's later proved that that assumption is false (that numbers don't work that way), then it allows cryptography cracker a significantly easier time because a 'cheatsheet formula' shortcut is found out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you give an example of this cryptography? Where could one learn more and study this aspect?</p>
<p>And to make sure I understand, is this cryptography in reference to secret codes (like the famous serial killer) or more in line with cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Currently attempting a bachelor in Mathematics but I honestly have very little knowledge on what or where zi would go with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of these problems find uses in different fields. Electronic cryptography -requires- maths tasks that are incredibly complex to solve to make the cryptography effective. Otherwise anyone with a powerful enough computer could brute force the answer relatively quickly.</p></div>		</li>
