			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting, 2% inflation helps central banks achieve their full employment target.</p>
<p>Workers don't like it when you cut their wages-- they're likely to quit. So when firms are downsizing, firms are much more likely to fire workers than reduce their pay.</p>
<p>If instead, we let everyone's wages depreciate a little, and develop a culture of gradual pay increases to keep up with mild inflation, firms can just not give workers a raise-- and it's the same as a pay cut. This keeps more people employed.</p>
<p>It is a little bit macabre, but it's true.</p>
<p>If we weren't so concerned about employment, we could in theory target lower or 0% inflation, and let spending increases be driven by increasing incomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct.</p>
<p>Full employment is the #2 mandate Congress hands to the Fed. But the Fed has a lot of leeway to pursue that, along with their mandate for stable prices, as they see fit.</p>
<p>And that makes sense. To avoid inflation or deflation, macroeconomic policy has to adjust with reference to the economy in more or less real-time. It's unrealistic to have Congress vote on how interest rates should change day-to-day.</p>
<p>The question we might want to consider is whether full employment is really the most important goal for the economy to achieve. Maybe the Fed is missing an important mandate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your 'cost of living' pay raise is less than inflation (as measured starting at the most recent of either last pay raise or when you first started work, and the effective date of the current 'cost of living' pay raise), then you received a pay cut, not a pay raise.</p>
<p>Joe gets a 2.5% raise. His last raise was two years ago. Inflation over the last two years was 3%. This means he effectively received a 0.5% pay cut.</p>
<p>Minimum wage in a given area should be equal to the poverty line at 30 hours per week. The poverty line should be tied to the effective inflation rate in a given area. The effective inflation rate in a given area should calculated in a way that takes into account the median housing rental price in the same given area.</p>
<p>I'd specifically define 'given area' to match census or congressional districts or something like that. You'd have different minimum wages based on actual cost of living.</p>
<p>This would incentivize companies to relocate to more rural locations since it'd be cheaper to hire their workforce there.</p>
<p>Okay, well I went off on a bit of a tangent there...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this have even more of a stratifying effect on society of very much having districts of have and have not? Effectively be a way to suppress minimum wages further and reduce choices and life options for people who depend on them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>central banks promote a controlled level of inflation to promote SPENDING.  Investment is one form of spending, but purchasing goods is actually best from their viewpoint.</p>
<p>they use monetary policy of establishing the overnight lending rate to promote saving by establishing a return on investment in excess of inflation.</p>
<p>The crucial catch is to avoid anyone hoarding greenbacks, Money on the sideline is the bane of capitalism.  spend it or invest it, but never sit on it.</p>
<p>Also, inflation is the antithesis of deflation, and deflation is the fastest way to end an empire.  so best to make sure it NEVER happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So can we have minor inflation for ever or does it cause issues down the road? If so, what kind of issues and what do we do about them?
Currencies that use very high prices for everyday items like Korean won or Swedish krona, is that a consequence of inflation or not related ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep, as long as the inflation is relatively predictable, prices and wage can all slowly adapt in a consistent predictable manner.  We get our nice little 3% cost of living raise each year, we arent deterred when the mcdonald dollar menu turns into the $1.29 menu.  </p>
<p>maybe sometime a few hundred years down the road we get tired of printing so many zeros and we split the currency.  but there are solutions to that too (though there are countries, such as Japan, who operate with a currency that is 1/100th of the US dollar)</p>
<p>Hyper inflation is where problems happen, when you need to be paid twice a day and run to the grocery store because the value of your cash is falling before you can even spend it.  Theres no way to adapt to that sort of change</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual size of the number doesn't matter. If the US measured everything in cents instead of dollars then all the numbers would be 100 times higher, but you would still have to do the same amount of work to buy the same amount of stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflation has a fairly small impact on spending, or consumption, when compared to investment, and more importantly the deflationary spiral really impacts investment primarily. </p>
<p>When a business considers an investment, they try to estimate the return on that investment. The return on the investment necessarily comes about later down the road, so it is in inflated or deflated dollars. This means that deflation can make investments that would have been profitable unprofitable, which means they won’t get made, which leads to more money sitting around in banks not moving, which exacerbates deflation.</p>
<p>Spending is affected by this somewhat, but not nearly as much as investment. People still have to eat and sleep and clothe themselves. It’s possible that they’ll hold off on unnecessary purchases during big transient spikes in deflation, but this is really not as concerning to central banks as the potential for effects on investment. If you think that deflation will continue at 1% forever, you’re still going to be taking vacations and that sort of thing - you won’t just not spend anything. But deflation will mean that certain investments that would have been made at 0% inflation won’t get made, and that’s bad.</p></div>		</li>
