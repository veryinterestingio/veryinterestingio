<p>Evolution works on the premise of ‘good enough to survive til reproduction’. </p>
<p>It’s not iterative software; constantly improving on its flaws from one generation to the next. It’s a bunch of random mutations and some work slightly better than others. </p>
<p>Not ‘perfection’.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, I could feel where it was in my body by where the pain was most intense so I knew it was moving along.  </p>
<p>Oh man, that was some terrible pain there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Close. Surviving is a part of it, but it must go along with chances of passing on genes either directly or indirectly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean sure but most people understand the general principle of evolution at this point, and its a pain in the arse to spend multiple sentences spelling out all the different ways that an organism becomes more likely to reproduce. So I'm going to pick which of increased survival and increased reproduction is more relevant to the particular mutation (or lack thereof) being discussed.</p></div>		</li>
