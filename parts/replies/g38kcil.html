			<div class="markdown"><p>Even relativly simple organisms tend to have light sensing locations that react to the presence or absence of photons. By placing an organism in an area with varrying light, we can note if the organism is drawn to one area over the other solely due to the light level.</p>
<p>While we cannot know what it &quot;sees&quot;, we know it can sense light and has preferences dependent on different environment cues.</p></div>		</li>

They don't have brains, they're just neurons reacting chemically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For most animals, the cellular structures they have in their eyes are analogous to ours, and similar enough that we can extrapolate their function. Dogs have fewer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell" target="_blank">cone cells</a> than humans, but more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell" target="_blank">rods</a>.</p>
<p>We back that up with empirical testing like you describe, and between the two have a very good idea of what the differences are in how our eyes work, respectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Philosophers sometimes call these &quot;the hard problem&quot; and &quot;the easy problem&quot; of consciousness, respectively.</p>
<p>The easy problem is still pretty hard, in the way that scientific investigation is usually hard.  Manageable, but difficult.</p>
<p>No one has any idea how to solve the hard problem, or even really what a solution would look like.</p></div>		</li>

<p>David Chalmers' &quot;The Conscious Mind&quot; is a highly regarded and fairly accessible book on the subject, if anyone is looking for that kind of thing.</p></div>		</li>
