			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re close enough it doesn’t sound like a crack either, it sounds like a ‘zzzttt’, almost like a transformer arcing, but louder and not drawn out. It’s a terrifying sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, caught this sound once about a decade ago.</p>
<p>Was sitting in the garage with the door open with my 1 year old trying to acclimate her to a storm. Being happy and smiling and making faces as thunder miles away would boom. Was just getting her to giggle and make a face when one would rumble in the distance. Then one struck the tree just down the street and freaked BOTH of us out. Certainly heard that pre 'zzzsttt' sound before the sharp crack.</p>
<p>Lesson kind of backfired. :(</p></div>		</li>
