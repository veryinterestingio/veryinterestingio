			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what the Parsons &amp; Geist paper is doing, i.e. looking at seismic catalogs and trying to assess whether there are real increases in rate. There are a couple of challenges with this. For example, you need to decluster the catalog, i.e. for large magnitude earthquakes, there will be a real increase in earthquakes (aftershocks) in the area of the main shock that decay through time, but this is not what we're after so we need to remove them. In reality, declustering catalogs is not an easy task and there are important nuances to how it is done. </p>
<p>The bigger challenge is actually figuring out what a true increase in rate would look like because there is randomness in the system. As a simple analogy, imagine that on a global scale there is a uniform distribution (i.e. a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxcar_function" target="_blank">boxcar</a>) of earthquakes of a given size such that there is an equal probability of any number between 5-15 earthquakes of that magnitude every year. Now, we don't know this is the distribution, all we can do is measure the number of earthquakes of that magnitude each year. So, if we measure earthquakes for 10 years and see a pattern in the number of this magnitude of earthquake each year like, 5, 6, 12, 7, 8, 10, 15, 14, 15, 13, it could easily appear that there is an increase in the rate about half way through our 10 year period, but this is just randomness. However, whether we recognized this as being a product of randomness would depend on whether we had correctly figured out what the underlying distribution was. In reality, earthquakes are much more complicated than this, but in essence, this is what those papers are doing, they're looking at catalogs of events and determining, at least based on our understanding of the statistics of earthquakes, that the distribution of events through time are indistinguishable from a random process. This is predicated on earthquakes behaving the way we think we do, but my ending point, is that without significantly longer time series of earthquakes, it's very hard to know for sure whether we're right or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Volcano geophysicist here. No, you should not worry about Yellowstone, and in particular you shouldn't worry about any of the crappy headlines you read about it unless a credible institution (probably Yellowstone Volcano Observatory or USGS) says there's a danger. It's highly unlikely to have a dangerous eruption during our lives.</p>
<p>Take those neurons focused on Yellowstone and devote them to climate change instead. It's also a huge hazard, but unlike Yellowstone it is definitely happening now and it's something we have control over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To the best of my knowledge, no. Yellowstone's magma chamber (molten and semi-molten rock) has been estimated to hold anywhere from 5-15%^<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/yellowstone-overdue-eruption-when-will-yellowstone-erupt?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products" target="_blank">1</a>, ^<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL059588" target="_blank">2</a> melt fraction. The following isn't perfect by any means, but hopefully it helps you picture what I'm about to describe more clearly. </p>
<p>Think of a slushy, a bunch of ice crystals moving like a fluid but they are each individual solids. As the slushy melts, liquid water forms at the edges of each of the individual ice crystals. Here, the ice crystals represent the molten rock, and the water represents the melt fraction. In order to extract the melt, the &quot;ice crystals&quot; have to move apart from one another far enough that the pockets of melt can connect (think of permeability), and rise to the surface. The melt fraction must therefore reach a critical point at which the repacking of solids allows the melt to ascend towards the surface. If there was 0% melt the solids would not be moved around (repacked) and so there would be a 0% chance of an eruption occurring, because there is 0% melt. Similarly, if there was 1% melt, the solids again would not be repacked enough to allow the melt to ascend towards the surface, and so on. The question then becomes, what is the critical point at which repacking of the solids will allow for the melt to ascend towards the surface? This critical point is actually anywhere from 25 - 50% melt. So, as Yellowstone's magma chamber only has 5-15% melt it seems extremely unlikely to erupt anytime in the near future. </p>
<p>While there may be other kinds of eruptions at Yellowstone, yet to come, (ie. steam eruptions, lava flows, etc.), there is evidence to suggest that activity is waning and may therefore never have another super eruption^<a href="https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/News/pr/2020/20-18.aspx" target="_blank">3</a></p></div>		</li>
