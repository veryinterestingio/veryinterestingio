			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes like when you start smoking marijuana you have the paranoia feeling, eventually you get over it. Mixing LSD/mushrooms with marijuana intensifies a trip because of the psychosis. That break/disconnection could be loss of time or forgetting where you're at. Sounds scary, but it happens and most of the time you laugh at yourself for getting caught up in your high.</p>
<p>You're from the UK. I know everyone rolling and going to raves, are doing way worse by taking molly and OTC novelty drugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I don't think I explained that very well. Psychosis is not analogous to being high or tripping. Being high or tripping can lead to altered perception or interpretation, such as feelings of euphoria, connectedness to others, experiencing vibrant colours or mild hallucinations like seeing patterns or 'breathing' walls or grass etc. Psychosis would be more along the lines of seeing bugs or animals when there are none, and feeling that these hallucinations (which you believe to be absolutely real) are going to kill you. Feeling of paranoia could be something like irrational fears that people want to harm you. </p>
<p>Also I don't live in the UK, I work in the AoD (alcohol and drug) sector in Australia</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I’ve experienced most drugs and while they can have a seemingly endless array of effects, I only recently started getting psychotic episodes from smoking green. I’ve had some brutal k holes in my time and i always enjoyed my bad trips, they felt more intense. I had a strong grip on reality so recovering from the intense hallucinations across all of my senses was easy. </p>
<p>I’ve believed I was a brick in a wall and “joined” with many other inanimate objects, gone on trips around the world on a sofa (feeling motion when there is none with intense visual hallucinations), been inside movies (very common if you leave a film on), become a star(in the sky).I’ve fallen into the earth, died and had various ailments ranging from lost limbs to deaf and blindness. I’ve had trips where I have experienced what I can only imagine born deaf and blind people dream (entirely tactile hallucinations, without sight or sound) and any number of paranoid experiences (fire and brimstone raining from the sky, people out to kill me, deals with demons etc). These are all like crazy thought experiments, similar to lucid dreaming, but with a palpable involvement from the “senses” and convincing emotional impact.</p>
<p>Psychosis is very different. That grip on reality that grounds you in the experience is not there. I don’t take any drugs any more, haven’t for about 5 years. If i smoke a joint I risk a psychotic episode and they are not fun. It’s not like a trip at all, you’re panicked, believe shit that isn’t real is real and not in a trippy way, in a very real way and this is only discovered after the episode. It’s indescribably real, the breadcrumbs you leave behind when tripping offer sanity. Psychotic episodes do not. Even with the knowledge of having taken drugs does not stop it. It gave me a new appreciation for the word “intense” and a greater appreciation of the struggle of people with more serious mental health conditions than I. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had true psychotic breaks mixing THC with high doses of MDMA that were <em>very</em> different from a normal trip - hallucinations out of nowhere (as opposed to distorted reality), hearing (and answering) voices, tactile hallucinations, grasping for objects that flat don't exist. I recognize this as true psychosis because I had a substance-induced psychotic break from a drug I was prescribed that lasted a week. Very different from a psychedelic trip. Shit is scary and I've learned not to fuck with THC, because it is <em>always</em> the trigger. (And yes, I know it was stupid to do this, no need to tell me.)</p>
<p>I've never known anyone to experience this from MJ alone, not saying it doesn't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, having some symptoms of psychosis isn't really the same as a psychotic break. Everyone gets mild hallucinations, and many people hear voices without developing psychosis (especially under the influence of psychedelics). A Psychotic break is a much more persistent and complete 'break' from reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me once when I got a little too high, I kept disconnecting from the present moment, unable to focus on any one or any thing (including my own thoughts) for what seemed like forever but in reality was about an hour.  Triggered an anxiety attack too as I had no idea what was going on!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I started smoking more it happened. I remember when I was smoking with a friend in 09, I had a nasty migraine. My friend is like hey I got some  mango diesel, I was like okay it will help with this migraine. We smoked out back, my chest got light as hell, my body was so numb, I got anxious like you said. We went inside I passed out on the floor of my living room. Needless to say it didnt not help the migraine, other strains have helped though. Another time was when I closed for the first time at BK, my manager and closer smoked some northern lights, when I was doing the dishes. My eyes felt like I was views everything through a fish eye lens, it freaks you out at first, but it's normal eventually it stops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Throwing cannabis and meth into the same sentence isn't right.  You're comparing apples to oranges.</p>
<p>The psychotic episodes experienced during meth usage are about 100 times worse than any minor anxiety and uncomfort which stems from cannabis usage.</p></div>		</li>
