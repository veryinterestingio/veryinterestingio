			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning that if a significant amount of dark matter was oscillating through our sun in this way, the gravitational effects of that movement would be seen in perturbations of orbits throughout our solar system. As far as I know, there are no such observed perturbations that would lend support to the idea that there is a significant amount of dark matter moving in our solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, depends HOW significant, and whether the flow of dark matter through the Sun was doing so isotropically or bulging in one direction or another. </p>
<p>But DM is very rarified in most of the estimations, which means that the amount expected to be in or near the sun is less than the uncertainty in our measurements of the Sun's mass anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, there is, on a much larger scale! </p>
<p>Recently the LMC was shown to be 10% of the mass of the Milky Way due to its orbital perturbations on stellar streams. This extra mass is dark matter.</p>

<p>Mass of the Milky Way: 1.5 Trillion solar masses.</p>

Evidence for an Intermediate-mass Milky Way from Gaia DR2 Halo Globular Cluster Motions. Astrophysical Journal, Volume 873, Issue 2, article id. 118, 13 pp.</a></p>
<p>Mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud: 25 Billion solar masses. </p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/473/1/1218/4111157#98965103" target="_blank">Laporte C, Gómez F, Besla G, Johnston K, Garavito-Camargo N. 2017.

<p>1.5 Trillion / 25 Billion = 60</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a theory that says the Sun's velocity through the galaxy and the Earth's path around the Sun should create a variation in the flux of dark matter observed passing through the Earth during the course of the year --i.e. as the Earth moved &quot;with&quot; and &quot;against&quot; the dark matter &quot;wind&quot; created by the Sun's passage through the galaxy's dark matter halo. However, so far we can't get a single confirmed dark matter sensor reading; thus no difference by time of year can be confirmed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then it remains inside the black hole like everything else.  </p>
<p>However black holes are simply impossibly small.  It is unbelievable hard to hit a black hole as matter that does not interact at all.  Generally matter falling into a black hole can discard its kinetic energy in collisions, and form an accretion disc.  Dark matter cannot.  If it doesn't get to 1.5 radius of the event horizon it doesn't hit the black hole, but instead escapes to infinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would remain inside... there was actually a nice YouTube video about a scientist wondering how much mass in black holes is from dark matter? To her surprise there was no scientific answer to that readily available. Well she did the work and it turns out, hardly any. As the Schwarzshield radius is actually very small (in cosmic dimensions) and dark matter would have to exactly hit it... any other path would move it away again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does dark matter interact with other dark matter? If so, would it be possible for two different bits of dark matter to collide at the centre of a gravitational force, reducing their kinetic energy? If that was something that was possible, then maybe if it happens enough, the momentum would be reduced enough to remain at the centre of say, a star or planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may, but what limited evidence we have seems to show that interactions aren't very strong. Observations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster" target="_blank">Bullet Cluster</a> collision showed that dark matter clumps moved faster than gas clouds post-collision-- implying that the dark matter clumps moved through each other much easier than normal matter gas could.</p>
<p>That being said, this is just one instance that may not definitively represent dark matter as a whole.</p></div>		</li>
