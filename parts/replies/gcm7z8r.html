			<div class="markdown"><p>I think about this in regards to artificial sweetener packets. They're like 99% dextrose (sugar) by weight.</p>
<p>It's because a lot of artificial sweeteners are in the ballpark of <em>several hundred times sweeter than sugar</em> so it's only about a grain's worth or so in each packet, the dextrose needs to be added to pad it out into a teaspoon's worth of powder.</p>
<p>Otherwise they would just be empty packets with an absolutely sickeningly sweet dust coasting on the inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitamins are probably safe to do this with, especially if they have a cut line but in general always check before doing this, especially with medications. Some pills can't be cut in half due to the contents, or being designed to release specific contents after a specific amount of time.</p></div>		</li>
