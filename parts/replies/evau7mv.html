<p>No you don't: I was curious about this and dissolved an old card in acetone. It came apart like, uh, baklava.</p>
<p>The chip was sealed in a small rubbery clear plastic blister beneath the contacts, as if they used a hot-glue gun. I assume another chemical could remove the plastic to reveal the chip-housing.</p>
<p>I certainly agree that you can't get at the chip without damaging the overall card, but the chip itself isn't hard to extract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI these packages are called COB or “Chip-on-Board”. The physical integrated circuit is attached to the PCB (or in this case the contact substrate) with an adhesive then “bonded” where  a machine uses hair-thin gold wire to connect the PCB pads to the contact on the IC, then is covered in potting compound. These also tend to be found in calculators, digital watches, LCD screens and other places where cost is limited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't you just use the contacts? Any way someone would interface with the chip would require plugging into it somehow. Does it have contacts other than the main ones? Why would someone even try to drill through them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't use the contact so that you would somehow get to the information inside without having to talk to the chip properly (giving it the right keys, answers to challenges...). There may be a contact to antennas in the card.</p></div>		</li>
