			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading this made me think of a very simple melody my dad would always play on his keyboard that he said was made for only me. I still know it by memory and can easily replicate it because it was so pronounced to me as a child and i have a musical background. I haven't talked to him in over 10 years but this is one of the few things he's done that's been embedded in me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard it explained that our brains like to follow predictable patterns, and when we correctly predict what will come next in a pattern, we get a small high (dopamine/endorphins?). So humans who want to make pleasing music will use the same tone and beat patterns we've all heard before in order to play on this facet of the human mind.</p>
<p>On the flip side, discordant music would be tone orders and beats that we cannot predict, so will have the opposite effect on our minds, making us disinterested in or even adverse to listening because we are not getting the high we get from familiar/predictable musical progression.</p></div>		</li>
