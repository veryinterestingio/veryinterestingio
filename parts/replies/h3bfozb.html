			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not even particularly close. Every micron of scratch depth would correspond to roughly a mile-deep valley. Any scratch distinctly visible to the human eye (not as refraction like the rainbow lights on a CD, but as a distinct tiny blemish) would have to be at least 250 or so microns in size, or around 40x deeper than Mt Everest is tall (on a relative basis).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/ejhomq/self_is_the_earth_really_smoother_and_rounder/" target="_blank">Apparently</a>, if the Earth were shrunk to the size of a billiard ball, it would be round enough to qualify as a regulation-sized ball (in other words, the &quot;bulge&quot; at the Equator is smaller than many people think), but it would not be quite smooth enough. It's close, though.</p></div>		</li>
