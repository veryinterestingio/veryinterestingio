We both went to bed at the same time, right after I picked up our dinner mess. I’m more intrigued than anything, and I really want to know why the sugar was everywhere lol (like did he just eat a spoonful of straight up sugar???)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I know sleep walking with targeted binging/eating is a specific type of sleep walking that is usually linked to high stress/anxiety in a persons life. It is not a 'normal' type of sleep walking. Might be worth looking into as it can cause health issues due to excessive eating.</p></div>		</li>
