			<div class="markdown"><p>There are organisms today that do not produce or depend on oxygen. They're called anaerobic organisms. Not only that, there are still organisms alive today that die when exposed to oxygen. These organisms are called obligate anaerobes. Oxygen causes damage by producing something called &quot;free radicals&quot; which are incredibly high energy molecules, that react with nearly everything in the cell, and cause huge amounts of damage if enough are present. </p>
<p>During this great extinction event, caused by oxygen and oxygen producing species, organisms evolved mechanisms to neutralize free radicals, such as catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. There are probably more, but those are the only ones that I remember off the top of my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, most of the prokaryotes before the GOE (Great Oxygenation Event) were anaerobic, i.e. they metabolised their food without oxygen. There are groups of extant bacteria which photosynthesise anaerobically, e.g.  green sulphur bacteria, Acidobacteria and Heliobacteria.</p>
<p>About 2.5Ga, prokaryotes called cyanobacteria began producing oxygen through aerobic photosynthesis, and the first widespread oxygen existed in the the atmosphere. The oxygen levels were kept low and consistent, as there was enough iron in the environment to react with it, resulting in the widespread BIF (Banded Iron Formations) that can be found across Western Australia and other ancient cratonic terranes. Once most of the iron had been oxidised, the oxygen had nowhere to go, and began to accumulate in the atmosphere and hydrosphere. This oxygen was toxic to the anaerobic bacteria in such vast quantities, so enormous numbers were killed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very well worded response however I’d dispute your story about Banded Iron Formations (BIFs) forming. </p>
<p>The majority of the world’s iron ore is sourced from BIFs in the Hamersley Province in Western Australia. These BIFs are 2-2.5 Billion years old, well prior to the oxidation event which you speak. These are formed as a result of density currents, precipitating iron from upwelling basinal fluids rich in Fe2+ and chert from ambient sea water. </p>
<p>The source of this iron is proposed to be hydrothermal muds deposited on the sides of submarine volcanoes, so photosynthesis would not have played a part in their deposition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is evidence that BIFs may be microbial in origin, but likely not from photosynthesis, rather <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep13803?proof=true&amp;draft=journal" target="_blank">photoferrotrophy</a>. In photoferrotrophy, the iron is directly oxidized by the microbes, without splitting water to form oxygen gas.</p></div>		</li>
