			<div class="markdown"><p>Losing muscle control on one side of my body (as well as a droop in my face and slurring my words) is one of the first symptoms I get before a migraine starts. Have had stroke questioned many times, even when I was a teenager. Now I know that’s what happens to me I can generally head it off in time, but wear a medical alert bracelet because after that stage I sometimes become completely unable to talk - i hear what people are saying and in my head I can form a response but when I try to say it nothing comes out! Dangerous when out and about, people think you’ve had a stroke and you can’t even tell them your name or who to call!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad I'm not the only one with these symptoms. I've always been worried it wasn't migraines I was having but mini-strokes.</p>
<p>I usually get a whole group of symptoms in a procession, sometimes overlaping and not always in the same order. Firstly I'll get a sparkly blob in the centre of my vision which will slowly grow outwards like a forest fire. The outside edge is sparkly, but the inner bit becomes a blind spot. Not black, but just, nothing, like the brain is trying to fill in the blanks. If I look at my hand my fingers would disappear or merge into a blob. This is usually the first sign, and if the sparkles start, I'll go home and sleep if I can.</p>
<p>Then I'll get tingling/numbness in one side of my body (left I think). Might start in my finger tips and radiate outward until my whole hand or arm feels like a big rubber lump that is also &quot;sparkly at the edges&quot;. </p>
<p>The speech problems feel like somebody is taking the words out of your brain, jumbling them up and putting them in your mouth. It is 100% what that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC2nC6NPYp4" target="_blank">reporter was experiencing</a> a few years back, and you can see the look in her face as she knows what she is trying to say is not what's coming out of her mouth. Sometimes it feels like every single word is on the tip of your tongue, but your brain can't find it so it just outputs random word fragments. </p>
<p>I distinctly remember it happening mid sentence as I was trying to tell someone I was having a migraine, it came out &quot;I think I'm having a miblone....a mlingus....head bad&quot; </p>
<p>This sometimes comes with general confusion as well - one time I was finishing up in the bath room and I couldn't figure out what the next steps were. I knew it involved the toilet paper, but I couldn't figure out where it was, what to do with it, how to stand up and flush, etc.. I just sat there for 5 minutes until my mental processes got in order a little bit.</p>
<p>Headaches themselves sometimes feel like a nail being driven into my scalp at their worst. Very localised, very painful.</p>
<p>Doctors always told me these were just bad migraines but for everyone else migraines just meant a headache. Some people in my family got the sparkly lights, but no one I know got the numbness, confusion, and &quot;heavy blurtations&quot;. It wasn't until I saw that reporter that I'd ever seen anybody go through the exact same thing and I accepted that they were just migraines.</p></div>		</li>
