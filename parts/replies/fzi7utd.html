			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really because the real technological gap here is the use of optical fibers, which are more expensive but not <em>crazy</em> expensive. Basically transmitting signals through electricity in metal works for a few meters, or hundreds of meters at most, while transmitting data through light in an optical fiber works for dozens of kilometers without repeaters.</p>
<p>Now, you can use optical fibers at home if you really want to, for your network for instance. There are also audio and even video cables that use optical fibers. The issue is that you need to convert electric signals into light and into electricity again, so it's a bit more expensive. And it's generally useless since nobody has a home that spans dozens of kilometers.</p>
<p>My point is that the analogy makes it sound like an institution like NASA has the technology to create insanely advanced copper cables that cost millions and transmit data over long distances. It's more that anyone can pay more and transmit data through light instead of electricity and the benefit will be an insanely longer range. Except we don't need that at home so it would make no sense to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh it's close. Even if you use optical, you won't get the same range as the undersea cables. At some point cash money just comes into play.</p>
<p>In defense of your stance though, NASA's real tech gap is not having atmosphere in the way of their telescopes which is not something you can just have at home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be because NASA points their telescopes at one spot for a long time and takes tens of thousands of pictures, and then digitally overlays them on top of one another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also because the Hubble is massive enough to capture details of galaxies billions of miles away while binoculars don't do much beyond a couple of miles or so across the earth. That's the actual analogy that applies here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hubble does have greater magnification and a wider aperture than consumer telescopes (this means more light reaches the &quot;camera&quot;) but you'd still be surprised at the difference between a single unedited image and the final product. Not only are they stacking thousands of images to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, but they are also assigning a false color palette to certain wavelengths of light, in a pretty much arbitrary manner.</p></div>		</li>
