			<div class="markdown"><p>This was very helpful! Do you mind expanding a bit?</p>
<p>How do you bore for oil hundreds of metres below the sea, how can people operate that drill at those depths and how does the driller know how much counter-pressure is exactly needed to stop the drilled oil from exploding into the ocean?</p>
<p>Once the hole has been drilled and the cork is inside, how does the oil get into the rig if the rig cannot be attached to the (valved?) cork? </p>
<p>How can the rig take all that oil on board, especially when it's coming through the pipes at such high pressure? And how is it stored, or does the oil tanker come like once a week to transport the exploits to shore?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you drill using 'mud'. During the planning stages, the exploration team estimate the reservoir pressure, and design a drilling plan to select  mudweight suitable for the expected pressure. Too much, and you risk fracturing the well bore leading to cave ins, pack offs and a lost drill bit. Too little, and you risk a loss of well control. Next you install a Blow Out Preventor at the well head. This is the last resort. Should an unexpected high pressure area be encountered, a 'kick', a BOP would use hydraulic rams to shear the pipe closed, thus preventing a well control incident. </p>
<p>Once the well is successfully drilled, and the well 'completed' ( that is, casing cemented in place, the internal pipe installed, and the bottom section installed with perforations to let oil in) and 'Christmas tree' is installed at the top, which allows pipes to be connected to let oil to either a rig or FPSO.   Oil isn't in a great underground lake, its stored in the pores between rock grains. There is a huge pressure differential between the reservoir and the surface, so the oil is naturally pushed up. Once pressure reduces, other methods are required to extract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great questions!</p>
<ol>
<li>How can people operate that drill at those depths?</li>
</ol>
<p>The drilling site of an oil rig is super deep, high pressured, cold, and scary. It sucks going down there, which is why we use submarines and cameras to monitor progress.</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you control the pressure?</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: Look at skushi08’s comment to this post for a more accurate answer.</p>
<p>This is further explained later.</p>
<ol>
<li>How is the rig attached to the valve?</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me rephrase: the oil rig is not attached to the valve in the same way as a wheel is attached to a car—it’s more like a pump at a gas station putting fuel into your car.</p>
<p>By making the connection flexible, it makes the cork much less likely to be torn away or broken. It then also allows the oil rig to float with the waves and not be pulled under water.</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you bring the oil on board?</li>
</ol>
<p>As the oil travels up the pipe, there are points along it to regulate the pressure (I think there’s like two or three?) that control the size of the tube. With those systems in place, the oil will arrive at the rig gently and will be instantly directed to the filtration system.</p>
<p>This is where the oil is separated from the rocks, dirt and mud so you can get crude oil.</p>
<p>Problem is, you can’t use crude oil. Crude oil is dirty, so you need to refine it to get the finished product.</p>
<ol>
<li>What happens next?</li>
</ol>
<p>The oil is then stored on board in big tanks. Those tanks are then put onto boats that take the oil to an oil refinery. There, the crude oil is turned into petroleum for our cars and factories, and natural gas for our cooking and heating.</p>
<p>Reminder, this is all happening over the course of many months</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an FYI, you absolutely apply counter pressure to prevent an influx from flowing on you. It’s not a bore hole size problem. In short that pressure you’re referencing is called “pore pressure”. For offshore wells especially you want your drilling fluid or mud to have a density that you’re, covering up, heavier than that pore pressure, ie the weight of the fluid column height is high enough that it keeps anything from flowing on you but not so high that you create small fractures in the rock down hole and lose mud into the formation. Bore hole size is usually more a concern in that larger hole takes more time (money) to drill, but you need to make sure the hole is large enough for data collection or production pipe that’ll give you your expected rates. </p>
<p>Also while drilling you’re definitely physically attached to the well head. Depending on the type of production facility you can be connected directly as well or you can be connected like the gas hose analogy. </p>
<p>To export the oil most offshore US facilities just pump it in pipelines back to shore. I think there’s like 2 FPSOs in the US that operate the way you describe where oil is stored then shipped back to shore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drilling rigs don't take oil. They set the well pipe and put stuff on top of it that a production rig can later hook up to. In the Gulf of Mexico there are hundreds of fixed productivity n platforms.</p></div>		</li>
