			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only can light be &quot;trapped&quot;, it is effectively how we study modern optics, using optical resonant cavities. </p>
<p>For the simplest cavity, look no further than your microwave. You essentially set up standing light waves inside the oven that cook your food.</p>
<p>This works exactly similar to how you set up standing waves in a string, both of whose ends are clamped. If you stop plucking the string at any moment, the wave will die out because reflection at both ends is not perfect. You can see a string wave slowly die out after successive reflections, but not light wave because of how quickly it happens for the latter. </p>
<p>(Edit: The comment above mine shows exactly how quickly!) </p>
<p>However, if you inject new waves by plucking the string at just the right frequency, you'll get standing string waves, or in oven's case, standing light waves. </p>

<p>Yes, that's why solar panels appear nearly black: they are reflecting much less light than is hitting them and are converting it to electricity instead.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Not an expert, but I think this is kind of what is done for high efficiency solar panels, except that instead of a box, its more like a coating on the solar panel that reflects light that bounced off once, back in.  Each time this happens though the wavelength of the light is increased, so the coating becomes less effective (the thickness of the coating affects what wavelengths of light it is best at reflecting).  You can add more of these coatings, but then each one is also reflecting/absorbing some initial light so its a trade-off.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most reflective material we have today has an efficiency of ~99.999%. That means 0.001% of light &quot;leaks&quot; from the system in the form of heat everytime the light is reflected.</p>
<p>If the box were a few feet in length the light would travel the distance of the box in  ~.000000003 seconds.</p>
<p>The light would be reflected hundreds of millions of times per second losing     0.001% each time resulting in our light completely dissipating in less than a fraction of a millisecond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why can't a surface be 100% reflective? Is it because tiny impurities or irregularities always remain with current manufacturing methods and when a photon hits those it gets absorbed?  </p>
<p>Also, kinda of topic but I remember reading in another askscience thread that when a photon is reflected (from a wall for example) , it's not the same photon that gets reflected but a &quot;new&quot; one with the exact same energy and wavelength as the incoming one had, is that true?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No even perfect metallic crystals will not have 100% reflectivity. It's because when a photon hits the crystal and is reflected it will transfer momentum to the crystal (yes photons have momentum even though they are massless). This momentum is carried by a &quot;collective excitation&quot; or quasiparticle called a phonon, basically a quantum of vibration. These vibrations take away a small fraction of the energy and are what we call heat. If the light didn't interact with the crystal vibrations it would not get reflected but pass straight through - it would be transparent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thermalisation (here and most everywhere) means that the particles eventually settle into a state of equilibrium, with the total energy of the whole system being shared amongst all the particles in some form of distribution, with a uniform temperature that maximises the entropy. In a gas, all the particles eventually bump into eachother enough times that the energy in the system becomes roughly evenly distributed. Photon thermalisation is the same, but you need to change what you mean by &quot;bump&quot; a little bit.</p></div>		</li>
