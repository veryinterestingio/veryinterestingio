			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  As an amateur radio enthusiast, I have communicated with the ISS many times.  You have to adjust the tuning of your equipment gradually as it passes overhead.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other problems, but you would definitely have to factor the Doppler effect in if you wanted to make cell phones work from the ISS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well not as cool as you probably think, at least in my case lol.</p>
<p>Very occasionally you can actually speak with an astronaut but I've never been that lucky.  It depends on many factors including whether any of those currently on board are licensed amateur radio operators.  When there is someone on board with the time to chat, it's mostly just them saying &quot;Hello, best wishes&quot; to people because there isn't a lot of time to chat as they fly across the sky at 17,000 mph.</p>
<p>It's much more common to communicate with other people back on Earth using signals relayed through equipment on the ISS.  I once sent a text message from South Florida to my dad in Illinois via the ISS.  It took very careful timing to send the message when both of us were under the ISS's quickly moving area of signal.</p>
<p>There is also a bulletin board, sort of a primitive forum where you can leave messages and then other people can retrieve them later, again you have to be quick about it.</p>
<p>Tldr - you can talk to equipment on the ISS pretty easily but chatting with a space man is unlikely </p>
<p>Edit - if any of this is interesting, it's free or very cheap to get an amateur radio license in most countries and the equipment you need is under $100.  There are tons of other fun nerdy things you can do with radio too.  Most areas have a local club that will be glad to introduce you to the hobby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t understand the Doppler effect, other than it makes sirens sound strange, Sheldon act strange and Bill Bailey stranger.
How does this affect the ISS?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The relative movement between two objects affects the percieved frequency of waves sent between them. That makes sound d ifferent since there are d ifferent frequencies.  So if you want it to sound understandable to the recievwr you have to take the relative speed in to account. </p>
<p>Exactly the same thing when transmitting data and other information. </p>
<p>With the iss we have the speed of its orbit, and distance from the sender/reciever. You have to compensate för this if you want to understand eachother when sending and recieving signals. Otherwise it will all be gibberish</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well just like Doppler makes train sirens or race car engines sound as if they have a higher pitch as they approach and a lower pitch as they speed away, it makes radio signals have a higher frequency as the ISS approaches and lower as it speeds away.  And the ISS is doing about 17,000 mph so it's a fairly big effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As something moves towards you, sound waves/radio waves reach you faster and more frequently than if both you and the sending object were stationary. Vice versa if the sending object is travelling away from you. You can imagine the difficulty introduced when the ISS is traveling thousands of miles per hour in orbit. I'm not familiar with this particular subject but I'd guess you'd have to actively adjust your broadcast frequency to maintain a steady channel of communication</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It turns out that you don't have to be at relativistic speeds to screw up a cell phone.  EM waves are affected by Doppler shift and the effect is calculated using the same formulas as audio Doppler.  In the worst case, If the ISS is moving at 17500 mph toward a cell tower, a cell phone operating in the 1900 MHz band will incur a Doppler shift of around 50KHz, which would be enough to prevent the cell tower from acquiring the signal.<br />
However, as the ISS passes directly above a tower, the velocity of the station wrt the tower is temporarily zero and so Doppler becomes zero as well, gradually increasing in the negative direction as the ISS moves away.</p></div>		</li>
