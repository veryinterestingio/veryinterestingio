			<div class="markdown"><p>No disrespect to Kary for his accomplishment with PCR, but like many other scientific discoveries, a lot of people were on the cusp of the discovery, Kary just beat them to it.  Just like Sanger Sequencing, next-Gen sequencing, just like CRISPR.  </p>
<p>I worked on the HGP in different capacities from ‘96-‘02 and am still in the genomics field.  The cost of sequencing a base has outpaced Moore’s law by A LOT.  From my experience, we wouldn’t have a sub $1000 genome today without the $2b+ price tag of the original project as that money provided the funding for the innovation of new sequencing machines, new sequencing chemistries, and new manufacturing techniques.  Not to mention the findings of the HGP not only surprised us and gave us answers we didn’t expect, but it gave a blueprint which was the launching pad for further ways to research the genome which has driven costs further down as the technology became more widespread.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number of genes in the human genome, or rather, how &quot;few&quot; there were compared to expectations.  The result was around 25,000, which is much fewer than people expected given the complexity of the human species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the number of genes was way lower than expected. it was thought, based on cellular complexity in humans, that about 100,000 genes would be discovered. it was way less than that (maybe 30-40,000 initially) and the number keeps dropping until nowadays i think it’s about 20,000 genes. The lower than expected number of genes revealed that the extra biological complexity was being generated in a way other than just adding more genes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a massive endeavor.  I was merely a cog in the machine, but what a machine it was!  The coolest aspect of the work was that you knew you were at the cutting edge of the tech and pushing it as far as you could.  Having icons like Francis Collins, James Watson (before he was rightly shamed out of the scientific community), George Church, John Sulston drop in on your meetings was surreal.  Bob Waterston was the lead at my center and while he doesn’t get the name recognition as the others was just as instrumental as the big guns - and one of the nicest, coolest, smartest guys you’ve ever met.  Being surrounded by all that brain power and vision was just a joy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>look up the book “The common thread” by John Sulston. it’s his autobiography that covered the public effort. Craig Venter’s is also relevant and from the Private effort’s perspective. I think both reveal a lot about their ethos and manner of working, while covering the challenges that had to be overcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer I was looking for.  Each step of a technological improvement is stepwise that builds on previous knowledge acquisition. In the 90s we didn’t quite know if and what algorithms we’d need to analyze and assemble billions of fragments. Nowadays we have AI algorithms that analyze, assemble and group data sets of hundreds of thousands to millions of individual points with 30 different characteristics each, for example.</p></div>		</li>

I see it happen sometimes that articles about someone 'inventing' a thing are featuring someone who improved the technology but definitely didnt invent it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The longer answer though isnt as clear cut. I believe the genome project used chain termination sequencing, which was a more evolved technique when the project began, it is however, slow and expensive.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the project a parallel method of shotgun sequencing really matured as a much faster cheaper alternative, and there was a bit of a race to complete a whole human genome.</p>
<p>You could make a case that since both methods were being developed separately at around the same time, that shotgun sequencing would have emerged regardless of the success of the human genome project.</p>
<p>Its kind of like the space race, obviously we had the scientific and technical ability to go to the moon, and our tech was developed in parallel with soviet tech designed to do the same thing, not built upon it.</p>
<p>The real question is, would it have developed as far and as fast without competition? Probably not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, it's a bit of the same issue as you see with computer hardware.</p>
<p>Yes, of you wait a year something better will come along. The next AMD CPU will have optimisations for server architecture, yes it'll mean a 10% improvement over today's offerings from AMD and Intel.<br />
Then again we can wait two years, and perhaps have a 21% improvement!</p>
<p>Sometimes you just gotta bite the bullet and commit to what's available at present day. It may turn out to be an overall bad investment, and it may not.</p></div>		</li>
