			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation! To add on this, OP if you are having panic attacks (I know the feeling), there’s a lot you can do to stave them off or at least reduce the effect. I don’t know if you’ve had them or just asking, but for anyone reading, there’s help. It takes practice, but there’s help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mindfulness works a bit for me, one technique (it sounds a bit silly but worth going through the motions see if it helps for you). Try and look around you and mentally name each thing you see and it's colour. white wall, red car, black road, ect ect and just keep going. not sure how it works, maybe it's just a distraction but it helps for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yessir/mam! I’m in therapy using the same practice. I’m new but it’s called ACT. It does work. It’s also about managing your expectations. When I feel one coming on, I start one of the exercises you mentioned. I don’t feel <em>great</em> afterwards, but I’m way better than I used to be. </p>
<p>Another great resource is The Confidence Gap and there’s an app for meditation called Ten Percent. They are giving away 6 months free for anyone in the medical field/first responders right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the conversation. Focusing on extures help me. When I fell like I’m sinking mg into an anxiety attack I go to my cat, close my eyes and focus on how his fur feels and then I try to describe it to myself and breath properly, with my chest and not with my belly</p></div>		</li>
