			<div class="markdown"><p>My 30 yr old boyfriend broke his hip during a hike. He fell quite a distance and his femur hit a rock, which caused his femur to uppercut his hip. Hip was cleanly fractured in 3 pieces and a fracture in his femur. They screwed him back together, but recovery was a bitch.</p></div>		</li>
