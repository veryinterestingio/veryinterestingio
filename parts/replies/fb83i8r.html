<p>That's more than half a football field.</p>
<p>Edit: American* football field. It's slightly less than half a European football/soccer field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of a book.  Not so large, it can easily fit on a typical nightstand. </p>
<p>Now tear out each page and lay them next to each other. Now you'd cover many rooms in paper.</p>
<p>This is because in a book, the surface area is stacked on top of itself, hundreds of times. Each sheet of paper is a new layer.</p>
<p>Does that help you visualize?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the most helpful example, but the surface area of the lungs is about a tennis court. Folded structures have larger surface areas. Like your small intestine its coiled up inside of you, but its (on average) 20ft long.</p>
<p>Not the best comparison but i hope it helps you understand. The charcoal are like your lungs, just on a MUCH smaller scale.</p>
<p>E: Why does everyone keep telling me about black lung? I dont get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a block of wood.. say it is a cubic foot.  Drill a hole in it with a bit that is 1/2&quot; in diameter.    The overall surface area has gone DOWN by just the size of 2 little 1/2&quot; diameter circles... but gone UP by the surface area of a cylinder.   Overall increase in surface area.   Now shrink that visualization down a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally it is included in toothpaste as an abrasive, it helps to scrape away the surface of your teeth (generally off-white to yellow in color) to reveal fresh enamel underneath (lighter-to white in color).</p>
<p>As a side note, that is not good for your teeth. Most teeth whiteners aren't good for your teeth in general. Enamel doesn't grow back.</p>
<p>Shampoo, I don't know, it probably has some legit reason, but I wouldn't put it past manufacturers to put it in there because people think it's good for them, much like antioxidants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is probably of limited use in either of those cases. You could maybe imagine circumstances where activated carbon in toothpaste or shampoo could help trap... something? But neither of those uses strike me as situations where there are large numbers of organic/aromatic impurities that you’re trying to remove. I think that is all more of a fad thing anyway — because activated carbon DOES trap stuff, it is often used to “detox” even though that often doesn’t mean anything really.</p></div>		</li>
