			<div class="markdown"><p>Good call! In this case however, the electronics were all designed to be kept in vacuum (potted and shrouded) Near the thruster body in order to shorten electrical paths and reduce inductive loss. Given the dampening structures between electronics housings and the rubber-like potting materials, sound would be very near zero for passengers using the system. The most telling sign you were even running the engines in space would be a super bright light and plasma plume radiating outwards. The 1khz scream of un-isolated inductors would drive a crew crazy, It was hard to run long tests in lab without ear protection and breaks from the room.</p></div>		</li>
