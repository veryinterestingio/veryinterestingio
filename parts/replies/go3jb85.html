			<div class="markdown"><p>“Otis Ray Redding Jr. (September 9, 1941 – December 10, 1967) was an American singer and songwriter. He is considered one of the greatest singers in the history of American popular music and a seminal artist in soul music and rhythm and blues. Redding's style of singing gained inspiration from the gospel music that preceded the genre. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ngl, smoke breaks can be very helpful in the short term. Taking a walk just doesn't have the same effect, though it's still helpful.  </p>
