			<div class="markdown"><p>I found a “mechanics exploit” one time playing Everquest 2 that effectively allowed item duplication. Basically, there were rare gems you could only get from killing bosses, so they were valuable. The gems were used to craft armor, which in turn was valuable, and the gem was consumed when the item was created.
There was a feature on one of the tradeskill questline items that when crafting had a chance to automatically complete the craft for you (it took a minute otherwise), and if you got that “Blessing”, it also let you keep all the crafting materials, in this case the rare gem.
So basically it was a lot of tedious time crafting for hours and every 5-15 minutes, I would get this blessing that triggered and completed the item and saved the rare gem. I made a lot of money that expansion selling rare gear until they eventually patched the item to no longer auto-complete your craft.</p>
<p>I maintain it wasn’t cheating, because it really was a grind to get the free item, but I felt pretty happy about discovering how to “exploit” the designed mechanics of the game for a while.</p>
<p>TL;DR: sometimes devs overlook how certain mechanics can function together and how players will take advantage of those things.</p></div>		</li>
