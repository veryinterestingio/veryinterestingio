			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s very helpful! So then, why do the plants need to sit in soil at all if their roots would just grow in water? (Not sure if I’m allowed to ask extra qs in the comments so I’ll delete if not allowed!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The soil contains micro nutrients and minerals the plant requires for survival.  It's possible to grow plants in only water if you can provide those micro nutrients/minerals through the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can, it's called hydroponics. Also there are many water based plants that grow just fine with no or very little soil. Giant kelp in California anker themselves to rocks on the sea floor but otherwise are just fine in the open ocean. Not quite the same but similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What most people don’t realize is that roots need three things nutrients, water and oxygen. Water logged soil loses the oxygen and hydro only works when the water is aerated or agitated enough to add oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soil is just a substrate that provides nutritiants to the roots and anchorage from falling over but if the nutritiants are controlled and the plant supported the soil doesn't really do anything. Hydroponics is actually better than growing in soil in a lot of cases as its more precisely controlled</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually incorrect.  </p>
<p>The bacteria are STILL present, but the bacteria require AIR to perform their infection, and when they are underwater there is no air available for the reactions to take place.  </p>
<p>You could place the root in sterilized soil and overwater it, and it would still rot...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source on that. Waterlogged soil doesnt have much air and anaerobic bacteria can cause a lot of rotting too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah assuming everything is sterilized nothing will rot, the plant will still die due to no oxygen but it won't rot</p>
<p>I mean look at the carboniferous period where nothing could eat the dead woods, causing it to keep piling up and eventually became coal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently started getting indoor plants, so I'm new.<br />
I have a fiddle leaf fig tree. A small one.<br />
I've put it in a large pot with no holes under the pot. Is this okay?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re going to have a much harder time controlling the amount of water in the soil than if there were a drainage hole in the pot. It’s possible to do without, yes, but can be difficult even for experienced gardeners. Considering how finicky Ficus tend to be, I would give yourself better odds with your new plant and consider repotting. You can also put it in a cheap plastic pot with plenty of holes and then put that whole thing inside your solid clay pot if aesthetics is the issue. Then just take out the inner pot to water. This can become cumbersome for big plants but is a popular technique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the excess water will end up going into the terracotta pot.<br />
And if there's too much water build up in the terracotta pot, that means I'm over-watering?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This type of pot is generally meant to be decorative and not the primary pot for a plant. Your best bet is to put the plant in the appropriate sized plastic garden center pot USING appropriate soil for house plants. Put this pot inside your pretty pot. I pull my plants out to water them in the sink, let them drain, then put them back in the pretty pot. You can size it so that you can have some rock underneath the plastic pot so you know your plant isn’t sitting in stagnant water. Remember to use a plastic house plant trivet under the decorative pot so you don’t get mold on your floor/counter/shelve. Even the glazed pots wick some water and you will end up with mold rings :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the type of pot. If it is a clay pot, then the hole is not compulsory. But if the pot is made of synthetic materials, a hole will be needed. That hole helps remove excess water and prevent clogging.</p></div>		</li>
