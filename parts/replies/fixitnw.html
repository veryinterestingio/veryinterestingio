			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that while &quot;dry&quot; is used in a number of ways including the legal ways listed above, there is also a degree of subjectivity.</p>
<p>Things like bitterness, salt, and sourness (acid) can &quot;balance out&quot; sugar to some degree, making things not feel as sweet. The classic example here is lemonade. Seems too sweet? Add more lemon juice and viola! The perception of cloying sweetness has been balanced off.</p>
<p>So in terms of what people may perceive as dry, regardless of rule of law, more acidic liquids lend themselves to being able to tolerate a higher sugar content before being characterized as &quot;off-dry&quot; or &quot;medium sweet&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>Example: If I had a liquid (water, say) with acid (lemon juice, say) in concentration of 20g/L, and sugar in the same mixture in a concentration of 16g/L, one might not register the amount of sugar in the substance as being very high.</p>
<p>However, if I have the same liquid with 75% less acid (5g/L) but the same amount of sugar (16g/L), the liquid would likely be perceived as being &quot;off-dry&quot;, or having an easily perceivable amount of sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good info. Winery worker here. What really gets me when doing tastings from other wineries is how wide the range of semi-sweet branding is. Some of them use it  as the next step above dry, and some use it one step down from dessert wine. It's a crap shoot, but luckily, tastings are just the place to work it out before buying :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certified Cicerone here (beer sommelier, more or less). In the beer world there’s a difference between IBUs(a quantitative amount of bitterness measured in parts per million of dissolved alpha acids in the beer) and perceived bitterness(a qualitative level of bitterness you actually taste when drinking the beer). The amount of dextrins(sugars too complex to come out of the beer through fermentation, as in, the yeast can’t eat it) among other residual sugars and other smaller factors will change your perceived bitterness of the beer. You can have a beer that is 100 IBUs and a beer with 30 IBUs and the 30IBU beer could have a higher perceived bitterness than the 100IBU beer because of the different levels of dissolved sugars in the different beers. I imagine what you are explaining is somewhat similar to this concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sourness doesn't cancel out sweetness. Thankfully because sour candies are the greatest. It's just a proportions thing. If you mix 1g of sugar in 10L of water, you're not going to taste that sugar. It's not like water cancels out sweetness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, hence the quotes around &quot;cancel out&quot;. Perhaps &quot;balance out&quot; is better terminology, and I will edit accordingly. Thank you for that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t cancel out sweetness, but in terms of balance, acid and sweetness go hand in hand— they affect how one or the other are perceived. I always think of them as an inverse index, where if I’m tasting, for example, the sugar over the acid, it means I need to add more acid to balance.  Not that you won’t taste the sugar, but that it won’t stick out as being an overbearing element of the whole.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but if you mix 100g of sugar in 1L of water you'd hardly be able to handle drinking it. Yet that's less than the percentage of sugar in Coca-cola and most people can drink that down easily. The acidity balances it out.</p></div>		</li>
