			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a more generous interpretation than I had haha, I just figured they thought fuel = gas you put in cars, if the sun is full of gas and on fire, why doesn’t it blow up like when you put fire in a can of gas? But after reading what you said now I’m not sure if that’s a correct interpretation and I’m just being mean thinking OP thought that</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your assumption is definitely the correct one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that the fusion is caused by the crazy high pressure and temperature in the core, and that is kind of self regulating. </p>
<p>If the the fusion speeds up the core expands, and that makes the fusion slow down. If the fusion slows down, then gravity contracts the core making it hotter and denser, increasing the fusion. So the fusion is held at a relatively stable rate based on how much mass is in the sun.</p>
<p>As compared to something like a fire on earth, where hotter temperatures tend to increase the reaction leading to even higher temperature, and that makes things flare quickly if there are enough reactants present (often fuel and oxygen).</p>
<p>Also worth noting that per volume, the sun doesn't actually make that much energy, it's just that it is so big that the energy adds up. Humans actually make more energy per volume that the core of the sun, which makes sense if you think about the fact that the core will take billions of years to get through it's fuel</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting estimation problem - radiated energy per volume and per kilogram for a human compared to a star.  Assume blackbody radiation from a 310 K human sized system into a 3 K environment.  Then repeat for a 6000 K sun sized system into the same environment.  I'll have to add it to next semester's class.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact gravity does such a good job stopping it from exploding outwards that the sun would collapse in on itself if it weren't for the radiation from fusion keeping it expanded like a balloon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does.  When I talk about fundamental forces in my classes I point out that gravity is by far the weakest interaction we know of, yet it plays an important role in the fate of the Universe.  On planets, chemical interactions (electromagnetic) are strong enough to balance against gravitational collapse.  Get enough mass, though, and you need thermal pressure from fusion to prevent the collapse.  Remove that pressure by shutting down fusion and gravity will pull things in until electron pressure stops it again.  Too much mass, and it requires neutron pressure via quantum mechanical interactions - Pauli exclusion.  Keep adding mass, and eventually nothing remains to stop the collapse.  Gravity wins and you get a black hole.</p>
<p>The weakest interaction leads to the most extreme phenomena in the Universe all because it has two things in its favor - infinite range and always attractive.</p></div>		</li>
