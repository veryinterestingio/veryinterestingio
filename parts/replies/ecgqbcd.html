			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! I can do this on demand, so I can seed a yawn in a crowd if a want to. I have learned to yawn with my mouth shut as well. </p>
<p>I'm a scuba diver, so it is very handy. I don't need to do the typical hold me nose and blow gently thing, I can just equalize on demand. I only ever need to do that move if I need a little more force to pop my ears. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I first learned how to do it as a kid, whenever we drove over the mountain pass to get to the other side of town, but it proved useful as a pilot, too.</p>
<p>Weirdly, I’ve also learned how to flex the opening between the paranasal cavity and the top of my throat.  Helps a lot if you’re trying to clear congestion from an upper respiratory infection or if you manage to cough mid-swallow and get a piece of food stuck up there, which is how I learned I could do it in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
