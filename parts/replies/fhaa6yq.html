			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk, he never said what painting. Something in Denver is all I know.</p>
<p>And the string to mount the frame was attached to the vertical members of the frame on the backside, which were made from wood which had the grain also moving vertically. The weight of the painting+frame split one of the members down the grain and it fell off</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Can these civil engineers, figure out why this chair fell based off of only the smell of the wood and the name of the man who last sat on it? Find out next week on, Structured-dy!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what’s being built. A road has a very short design life bc they’re always being ripped up for utilities and weatherproofing them would be very expensive. An average house is designed for about 50 years. Brooklyn Bridge and Empire State Building were designed to last much longer. I can’t say for sure because the upper limit I’ve typically seen is like 100 year design life, but I’m sure you could go beyond that. Both of those structures are all steel and concrete, so minimum you could get 100 years before they wear out, but they’re meticulously inspected and renovated, so could be up to like 500 (but don’t quote me on that). Could even be more if people really wanted to sink money into them. Often times though after that long of a period, the needs the structure was designed to serve have changed. For example, more congestion on a bridge like the Brooklyn, over the course of 500 years would probably just mean a new bridge entirely</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is a huge difference between American and European housing. American housing is almost always light build timber and so could have a life of 50 years whereas traditionally European houses are stone or brick. </p>
<p>Here in the UK, for instance, a traditional roof of slate or tile would be expected to last at a minimum 50 years and often double that whereas in the US many roofs have bitumin tiles which have to be renewed every 15 - 20 years. In the UK we would only use this type of roofing material on garden sheds.
Having said that in the immediate postsecond World War period, when there was a great shortage of housing, many ‘temporary’ houses were built that weren’t expected to last very long.</p>
<p>However there are more trends nowadays in Europe towards timber builds on the ground of cost and time efficiencies and climate change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Older buildings like that were typically over designed, since that was the only guarantee they would stay up in the first place. But yeah you could absolutely build structures to last for ages. If I wanted to build a structure that would last 3,000 years, I’d make a giant pyramid in the desert (sounds familiar hahah). Plus, it’s a static structure in a geographically stable area, so I’m not surprised it’s lasted as long as it has</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol you’d be surprised by some of the seemingly random things inspectors do. Even your example could give valuable feedback, like the spacing of floor joists and different floor layerings (which can impact the integrity of the aforementioned joists). So maybe.</p></div>		</li>
