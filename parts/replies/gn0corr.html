<p>I’d add that the important part is that the flood of hormones are your body trying to warn you and protect you (just like from a lion). The warning is ‘danger: more pain ahead if you don’t act.’
Do everything you can to support your mental health and wellbeing: find a mentor or counselor, find great team to join, volunteer doing something you care about, or even change your school/work/living situation to rid yourself of toxic people. They’re the lions in our world, and it’s ok to avoid them while you seek friendlier friends.</p></div>		</li>
