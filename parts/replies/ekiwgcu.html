			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is another reason as well, not sure though. Cold air shrinks and hot air expands. So at night when the water cools down, the air above ocean shrinks whereas the air above the sand expands which will be sucked towards the ocean; thus by causing a wind from the land to the ocean. Or may be I am wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water doesn't really change temperature much but the land changes a lot.  The convective cell does weaken or reverse at night but that is because the land gets cooler than the water.</p>
<p>The harder part to visualize is how the top of the cell works.  Imagine a thin column of air at any point.  The pressure at the bottom of the column comes from the mass of the entire column.  If the pressure is the same and the air is warmer, the column gets taller, if the air is cooler, the column gets shorter.  If a taller column is beside a shorter column, the air will spill from the top of the taller column to the top of the shorter column.  So if we start with two columns of air the same height and heat one, it will get taller and the top will spill onto the cooler one.  This will decrease the pressure at the bottom of the hot column and increase the pressure at the bottom of the cool column.  This in turn will cause air to flow from the cool surface to the hot surface.  That air heats and the cycle repeats...</p></div>		</li>
