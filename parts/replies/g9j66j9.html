			<div class="markdown"><p>Our life-cycle analysis (LCA) metric is to have a greater than 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions while meeting cost targets. Depending on our exact scenario, we achieve 60% or more. This report is available, published every so often by Argonne National Laboratory. At the final stage of combustion, biofuels burn similarly to fossil-derived fuels since hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons. The reduction in carbon intensity comes from the upstream accounting, assuming that the resource is either waste carbon (stranded, subject to decompose in a non-beneficial, non-energy way) or renewable carbon from plant matter. LCA is the field that applies this type of accounting, so this is not my expertise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are at bench- and engineering-scale continuous processing in a tubular reactor, so the process scale-up should be less challenging due to the simplicity of the reactor concept. Some engineering pieces (such as the pump) may get easier as the scale increases, though we expect there will be challenges and learning at the pilot and demo scales. Thermal integration specifically should improve at scale, since we are taking measurements on heat exchangers that are not perfectly insulated and have instruments and extra flanges/couplings conducting heat away. We build things for modularity and R&amp;D, but commercially this could all be welded with limited probes (T, P) and rigid industrial insulation.</p></div>		</li>
