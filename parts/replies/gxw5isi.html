			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered what would happen if I lost a lense in my eye. How did they get it out? Was it uncomfortable? Did they know the lense was in your eye when they started looking or were they checking just because you said you lost a lense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had one get pretty far behind my eye on a few occasions. Feels really weird. Not painful, but definitely not normal. In each instance I could see a little sliver of it peeking out from behind my eye so I was able to fish it out and back around to where it needed to be by massaging my closed eye and doing some improv eyeball gymnastics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's impossible. Take your eyelid and pull it open as far as you can. The impassable part is very close to the front of the eye and easily reachable. Nothing can get behind the eye</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Dr. had seen this before and pulled my eyelid out and probed in and it came right back around with the probe. The probe was like a small qtip he pushed up in there and just pulled it out. No muss, no fuss, no pain.</p></div>		</li>
