			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah UK countries only have the powers that have been devolved to them from Westminster (i.e. UK Government). This is usually stuff like health and education policy.
From my understanding, US states have far more powers to govern the laws inside their jurisdiction. The UK countries are mostly forced to keep in line with what Westminster legislates (even though the legal systems can be separate)</p></div>		</li>

On the England team though, could it be an acceptable exclusion where we all agree to call it the ‘England’ team despite it being a UK team ?</p></div>		</li>

<p>An Englishman has no social status as ‘English’, he only has British citizenship. As does a Scotsman, as much as the Scottish may dislike it.</p>

<p>This isn't really true. For example, Scots don't pay university tuition fees for Scottish universities, whereas English students do. Northern Irish citizens have an automatic right to reside in Ireland and claim Irish citizenship, whereas other Brits don't. England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland also have different laws, though typically those apply to anyone <em>in</em> the country, rather than citizens of that country.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't accurate. </p>
<p>These rules are based on <em>residency</em>, not nationality. An English person living in Scotland for 3 years would qualify for free tuition, while Scottish people who have moved to England wouldn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The separation between England and Scotland is relatively wide because they have distinct legal codes, so are like different states in a US context.</p>
<p>Wales and NI are also distinct, and have different legislation than England, but (I think, I'm NAL) based on more of the same underlying legal structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of countries work like that, at least partially. In Canada you pay &quot;in-province&quot; tuition at university if you grew up there, but have to pay a higher &quot;out of province&quot; rate if you go to a different one.</p>
<p>Isn't the Northern Irish thing more about ancestry than anything else? There is no &quot;Northern Irish citizenship&quot; as far as I know? Don't all Jews have the right to move to Israel? It doesn't mean that the Jewish neighbourhood down the road is a different country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite.
Part of the peacekeeping arrangement between the UK and Ireland was that everyone from NI has duel citizenship meaning they can choose to claim their Irish citizenship or their British one.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No, it's a consequence of the Good Friday Agreement, which decided which parts of Ireland (the island) would leave the UK and which would remain part of it. Anyone born in Northern Ireland or born to parents from Northern Ireland can claim Irish citizenship iirc.</p>
<p>The Jewish analogy isn't really accurate since you can't be born &quot;in Jewland&quot;, you'd be a citizen of the country you were born in.</p></div>		</li>
