			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be a fan of form follows function.</p>
<p>Example: I am a woman, and as a woman I hate trousers. Or skirts. Or basically any item. Have you ever seen a woman try to put something in the pocket of the trousers? Have you? Ask yourself why. Have you seen skirts with pockets? Barely any. If if so, weeeeeeell, lets say the dresses and skirts are not made to really carry anything in them. </p>
<p>So yes, I'd love to see &quot;form follows function&quot; more often. There are thousands of great examples all over the world where it works and works better than the other way round. It makes stuff more wholesome and more successful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And regarding the ELI5 question aspect of your comment:</p>
<p>we evolved from single-cell structures (no eyes) to single cell structures with one light sensitive spot, and then slowly to multi cell organisms that had one lens hole (eye, allowing for shillouette recognition), then doing some more advanced stuff and finally ending up at two eyes. But even though we were multi-cell organisms, which you argue automatically have symmetry, it wasn't like that, or rather the center of the symmetry would have been in the middle of one eye.</p>
<p>Here is an amazing video showing that:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. Lots of discussion about evolution and favorable phenotypes, but that's not the question here. The arrangement of the face is not a trait which is selected for, it is a direct result of embryonic developmental processes. </p>
<p>People who talk about the function of each organ and what it &quot;needs&quot; are just describing their own personal assumptions. Those are psuedo-scientific answers that are not grounded in an understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms at a cellular level.</p></div>		</li>
