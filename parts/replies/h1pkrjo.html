			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. When I slammed down on my tailbone while rollerskating, I could barely breathe, but boy could I scream. And every scream diminished the pain somewhat. Every time I stopped screaming the pain came back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did that when I was about 10. Me and my friend were “skating” (a pond had frozen over decently). I fell and hit my tailbone on a rock that protruded out of the ice. Boy, did I yell and roll around for a solid 15 minutes before I got the will to try and stand up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a bunkbed when I was fifteen. I’d swing myself over, bounce on the bottom mattress once, and land on the floor every time I wanted to get down. Once there was a wooden chair in the room, and bruised my tailbone by slamming down onto the top corner of the chair back after the bounce. Couldn’t sit right for a month, one of my teachers even laughed about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong but I think that's just the simple fact that you're distracting your brain from one issue to an activity you can focus on and thus, the pain receptors don't have front stage in your brain at that moment because you're giving all your energy into screaming and not feeling pain. I use a similar method but try to breathe through and feel the pain without letting it bother me. Just because it's uncomfortable doesn't mean I have to react to it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be willing to bet almost every culture has that in some form.</p>
<p>Shit is naturally considered gross to us and gross = bad. Talking is used to convey something of value but shit has no value. It's not that weird to think that every society would eventually come up with the word for shit talking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious. I'm italian and every mother here knows that, when a child get hurt, a kiss on the wounded part will reduce the pain. Do other countries have the same thing or a similar ritual?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks. I though it was only a local thing. Apparently all mothers around the world are the same</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do in Spain, but our cultures are very similar, anyway that's more related with placebo than to this, I guess. When I was a monitor in a camp we had a big jar with &quot;medicine&quot; written on it, everytime that some kid gets hurts we gave them medicine and 90% of the times the pain disappeared, only if it doesn't we took the situation more seriously</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But was it real medicine or a placebo?</p>
<p>Researchers have deomonstrated with pain placebos that for some that the placebo worked on, they reversed the benefit with naloxone, the opiate antagonist.  Meaning the body released it's endogenous drugs when it thought it was given drugs.  From a New Yorker article I could find it if anyone is interested.</p></div>		</li>
