			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I'm sure. Though the issue with this tends to be that we don't know with 100% certainty when those species were domesticated, and thus it's hard to know which fossils are from wild horses and which are from domesticated horses. Later horse remains we can tell because metal bridles wear on their teeth, but those leather and wood ones dont. Plus the earliest domestic horses didn't wear them. So we definitely have remains from the right period. It's just almost impossible to say for certain if those were the specific horses being domesticated.</p></div>		</li>
