			<div class="markdown"><p>I now realize that I put that incorrectly. I meant that if you stand on the surface of a fiery hot gas giant like Jupiter, all you'll see are fiery streaks of gas swirling all around you. So the night sky will be totally invisible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, well that simply depends on what you call the &quot;surface&quot; of Jupiter. Since there is no solid surface, the &quot;surface&quot; is some arbitrary point where you decide the gasses are thin enough that you're at the surface. Depending on where you draw that line, you may be deep in the Jupiter atmosphere, or you may be above it seeing no gasses at all.</p>
<p>But if you're covered in swirling gasses, it's <em>because</em> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter" target="_blank">the atmosphere</a>, not because there is no atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The temperature of Jupiter at its cloud tops would actually be quite cold. Far colder than Earth since it is so much further from the Sun.</p>
<p>As you get deeper the temperature would increase with the pressure of all that gas on top of you, but you will probably never really hit a “surface”. The gas just gets denser and denser until it becomes a liquid from the sheer pressure. No clear dividing line like the surface of the water on Earth. It’s a smooth transition from liquidy gas to gassy liquid.</p>
<p>Deep deep down below that ocean of high pressure liquified hydrogen you will (probably) eventually find a rocky core. But that is more akin to Earth’s iron core than to its surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that for some reason I'm not aware of the lack of atmosphere means that the night sky is just a blackish gray expanse, I will return and edit once I look into this</p>
<p>Edit:

I'm not sure for other planets but apparently the dust in the Martian atmosphere causes stars to be dimmer at night and if it's true that the cameras on the rovers have about human level acuity pictures of the Martian night sky look like you can't see much of anything, </p>
<p>it seems plenty of people disagree with this and believe that the stars would be much better then on earth but I'll trust the literal photographic evidence before some armchair scientists on quora</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably have this impression from pictures on the Moon. But you need to remember that all of those pictures are taken in the 'day', it's the very brightness of the moon that washes out the star, not the lack of atmosphere.  The view from the 'dark side' would be most impressive, with regards to stars visible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, fair enough, I didn't know about the dust, but at that point the dust is simply replacing the role of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Atmospheres definitely dim the stars. Without an atmosphere, the stars would be brighter, not a blackish gray.</p>
<p>From Pluto, which has no dust because its surface is nitrogen ice, the stars would be as bright as they are from the space shuttle. (Also the Sun would look like a large bright star, much smaller than our moon, though about 250 times brighter.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah fully I realise my mistake was just assuming from pics from the moon and mars and certain shots of space that the stars are somewhat enhanced by the atmosphere but clearly this was just my failure to think about how light and cameras work
God the stars from Pluto would probably be spectacular</p></div>		</li>
