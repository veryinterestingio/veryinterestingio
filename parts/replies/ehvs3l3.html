<p>How on earth could we find an infinite supply of seawater and move through it such that we could dump brine in our wake? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. You are correct. Most people have heard that water boils at 212F / 100C, but if you draw a partial vacuum, it will boil at a much lower temperature. Drawing a partial vacuum dramatically improves the efficiency.</p>
<p>That being said, water will also evaporate at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure, but...its slow.</p></div>		</li>
