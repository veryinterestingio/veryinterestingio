			<div class="markdown"><p>There is variation of &quot;saltiness&quot; in various parts of oceans and seas around the world. Where there are many freshwater sources (rivers etc) the salt level is lower (the Baltic Sea doesn't taste very salty).
In places where there is a lot of evaporation and not much fresh water it can be super salty (Hamelin Pool in Western Australia is hypersaline with around double the salinity of normal seawater <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamelin_Pool_Marine_Nature_Reserve" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamelin_Pool_Marine_Nature_Reserve</a> )</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's probably more likely due to strong currents in brakish waters and the shifting of the drafts from silt deposits</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that account for all the other factors though? I.e. increased shipping traffic near river mouths, more dangers from reefs and shoals etc.? Is the rate actually higher than would be expected due to those other factors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you can. Anything up to 8 parts per thousand is safe to drink because it is just below the salt osmolarity of your blood plasma. Anything more than that will cause you to dehydrate because your kidneys will excrete more water to get rid of the excess salt.</p>
<p>Most of the baltic is <a href="https://balticseaweed.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/allfucus_map.jpg" target="_blank">safe to drink</a> at least from a salinity standpoint. I wouldn't unless I had to though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If only the sodium is from rocks and not the chloride, what are the corresponding anions that gets dissolved alongside the sodium? Carbonates, sulfates and the like? And where do they go, if they don't end up in the sea, too? (And if they do, how comes that chloride is still the predominant anion in sea water?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the negative ionic parts of minerals are tetrahedrons of silica, which do get transported into the oceans, but as suspended load in the rivers rather than actually dissolved. For this reason they also don‚Äôt spread throughout the oceans, silica particles get dumped somewhere between the late stage of the river and the edge of the continental shelf (depending on particle size). There <em>is</em> also chlorine getting taken from rocks and moved into the oceans (chiefly from the breakdown of the mineral apatite and transport of dissolved chloride ions which result from this), though nothing like the amount of sodium being transported to the seas. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs important to remember that the ocean is not the final resting place for salts, it‚Äôs just a way-station before they are passed on to the oceanic crust or the sediments which coat the crust. The length of time before this happens depends upon the individual ion in question ‚Äî each one has its own cycle just like there is a water cycle and a carbon cycle.</p>
<p>This also explains why the balance of salts in seawater (which is the same pretty much everywhere in the oceans) is not simply a concentrated version of the river water which is supplied to the oceans. Although chloride ions are a fairly small part of the dissolved salts in all river inputs to the sea, chloride is indeed the most abundant negative ion of seawater like you say. This is because chloride ions are removed extremely slowly from the oceans; far slower than sodium ions, which which are constantly being supplied and removed at a fairly high rate.</p>
<p>So seawater is salty not only because it has dissolved salts going into it (mainly from rivers), but also because some of those salts tend to hang around for a long time before getting removed. Residence time is key to understanding chloride levels (and any other salts which are significantly different from the relative amount supplied to the seas).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Far slower?  Searching for residence times, I found one lecture slide with an outlier 4x difference (68 vs 260 My).  Most estimates seem within 2x (under 100 My for both).  But I didn't quickly find a recent literature source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May not necessarily be the correct answer, but I could guess it has something to do with solubility. Sulfates and carbonates form relatively insoluble compounds with divalent cations like magnesium and calcium (notable exception, MgSO4 is very soluble in water). This would allow for carbonate and sulfate to be sequestered in the crust as minerals, while chloride ions are left over as chloride compounds are almost all soluble in water (AgCl as the main exception). Similar situation with sulfides, sulfur forms slightly soluble compounds with divalent cations and relatively insoluble compounds with some common transition metals.</p></div>		</li>
