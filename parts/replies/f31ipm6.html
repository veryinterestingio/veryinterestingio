			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much.  I remember reading about the builders of the Parthenon had figured out that perfectly straight columns look funny so they made the bow out slightly in the middle.  The proportions had to be exact and the templates they used for the parts of the columns (they're constructed of stacked cylinders of stone) are still marked out on the floor.  The completed columns bulge ever so slightly but it's enough to make the columns look straight.  And this was done in the 440s BC.  Pretty remarkable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Start from a known point of one side of the tunnel, use the protractor and strong to measure distances and angles to calculate the other side of the tunnel, measure the angle between and start digging. While digging, continually measure the angle you are digging on to make sure that it is correct. In reality you would set control points in either side and as you are digging in order to keep measuring the correct angle. </p>
<p>In the surveying world a protractor is a theadolite and the piece of string is a tape measure. As long as you know one point's coordinate and an angle, you can measure the angle and distance to the next point and use trigonometry to calculate the coordinate of the next point. If you don't know a point's coordinate and an angle, you can make one up and it will still work it just won't be relative to anything else.</p>
<p>On the very basic level, surveying is measuring distances and angles, then using trigonometry to calculate the coordinates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They just built a tunnel in my city that was .75&quot; off center over 6 miles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>That first Hudson River tunnel gave sandhogs a new respect for
the dangers of compressed air, and it provided an indelible lesson for the first generation of American trade unionists. As Frank Johnson wrote in &quot;Eight Minutes to New York;' &quot;Caisson Disease and other appalling accidents first occurred long before the days of powerful unions and minimum wages. The tunnel pushed on, though hundreds of workers were to lose their lives to compressed air.&quot; With an immigrant population of four-and-a-half million entering each year, there was no shortage of available able bodied men. </p>
<p>Work on Haskins' tunnel was interrupted several times during its
course, but it was completely shut down in July 1880 when a terrible tragedy took place. In the world of sandhogs, disaster arrives quickly, and the scream of escaping air signals its arrival. Peter Woodland was in charge of a gang working on the thirty-third street tunnel. He knew the sound of a blowout, and he shouted &quot;Make for the lock&quot; when he heard the screech. Eight sandhogs reached the airlock; a ninth was crushed by a falling beam. Woodland closed the airlock door and stayed with nineteen men to die slowly in the rising water. The last thing the eight survivors saw through the airlock window was Woodland, waist deep in water. The men had stripped off their clothing in a vain attempt to stop the break and the onrush of water. Twenty men died, but eight were saved. Woodland became an instant hero.</p>
