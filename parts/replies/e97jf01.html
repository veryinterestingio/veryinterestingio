			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you don’t mind expanding on this a little: what did the senate look like going into the election? And how many of those 35 were democrats? I can see it’s currently 51/42/1 with 6 still being counted. </p>
<p>IE. What was the “worst/best case” for the republicans?</p>
<p>Edit: also it looks like D takes the house, my understanding is the house was majority R before the midterms? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The House has already flipped, last I checked there were 219 Ds which is just more than half of 435 (218 is a majority in the House). You’re correct it was previously run by a Republican majority. So that’s pretty significant even though the Senate won’t turn because the House is now one line of Democratic defense against unilateral action by a fully Republican Congress and presidency (to put it in simple terms - clearly even Republicans in Congress have had reservations about accepting some of Trump’s legislative agenda, given that he really doesn’t hold Republican values at heart).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia, the distribution before tonights election was 51/47/2 (Rep/Dem/Ind).  </p>
<p>Of the seats up for election, 9 were republican held, so a best case result would be 42/56/2.  There were very few seats that had a chance to flip, so expectations to get dem majority were low.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Republicans held the Senate with a 51 seat majority and a Republican Vice President that serves as tie breaker. </p>
<p>In this election the Republicans were defending 8 held seats and the Democrats were defending 23 seats (including the two Independents) </p>
<p>The Democratic path to victory would have required holding most of their seats and turning a couple.</p>
<p>It was a tough path for the Democrats to attempt. 10 seats they were defending were in States that Trump won in 2016.</p>
<p>Worst case for the Republicans would be loosing the Senate or even reaching 50/50. Best case would be keeping the numbers where they were or even picking up a couple seats to pad their majority, which will be the case.</p>
<p>To your edit, yes the Democrats were able to flip the House from the Republicans. As of now it looks like they will have a majority with about 230 of 435 seats</p></div>		</li>
