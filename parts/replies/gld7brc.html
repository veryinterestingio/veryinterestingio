			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, interesting. It doesn't happen to me often, but when it does, I always wonder what the heck it is that is causing it.</p>
<p>They say that it happens when someone is thinking of you, but of course, that's just some silly made up nonsense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's a nice idea but doesn't fit what we know about hearing and thinking so far!</p>
<p>One other cool detail - if ringing is caused by these little motor cells, sometimes they can kick up so much movement that it actually activates your ear backwards and ends up causing your eardrum to shake. This turns your ear into a tiny speaker, and if someone puts their ear against yours they'll hear the ringing too!</p>
<p>This is called 'objective tinnitus'. It's hilarious that, just like a real microphone, your ear can be a speaker if it's run backwards!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can be measured by an &quot;otoacoustic emissions&quot; test (OAE). We use this in our test battery to diagnose the source of one's hearing difficulties!</p>
<p>It is a very fascinating test that is literally listening to your ear to check for inner ear function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear a constant &quot;white noise&quot; sound and sometimes get a beep. I don't really mind the white noise but it is pretty &quot;loud&quot;. Is this &quot;sound&quot; also created in the same way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any sound that's happening without some outside source generating it is considered tinnitus. When people think of tinnitus they usually think of it as a high pitched ringing sound, but it can be low pitched as well. So it sounds like you're also experiencing tinnitus, but if you aren't exceptionally bothered by it then that's good because unfortunately there's not much that can be done to stop the tinnitus.</p></div>		</li>
