			<div class="markdown"><p>Most lubrication of machines in these industries are Silicone greases.  I cannot speak for water-submerged systems but by design they would have very good closed loop oil lubrication system if they use petroleum lubrication at all.</p>
<p>I did not work in a paper factory, I was a printer using large paper stock, which uses the same type of machines as the TP industry.  </p>
<p>Our lubrication use was very low.  </p>
<p>It is very unlikely you had large petroleum lubricant loss if you did not have elaborate recovery systems.</p>
<p>The rotation speeds and load of paper processing of any type is typically very low.  </p>
<p>The industry avoids petroleum lubricants when possible for the obvious contamination issue.  That is, a bunch of oil and grease on your TP is not very atractive.  </p>
<p>While large paper rolls of 1-3 meters across are very heavy, they're not that heavy in comparison to metal industry, and simple oil-impregnated babbit bearings are sufficient to the task.  </p>
<p>If you're an Industrial person, the issue with paper is fine consistency, not heavy capacity.  Paper rolls will just roll over you and crush your leg like a noodle, but compared to a steel roll they're fairly light.  A steel roll of similar size will turn your leg into a wet stain on the floor.  </p>
<p>That difference means there is not much petroleum use in the paper industry.  The temperatures and loads don't require polluting lubrication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in the papermaking industry as well and your temperature and rotational speed comments may be on target for printing but they are not right for papermaking.  Paper machines (especially modern tissue machines) run very - very - very fast, in the order of 1500-2000 meters per minute.  All this in a very hot and very wet environment.  I still would agree the petroleum use is pretty low.  And most modern paper mills are very environmentally friendly with closed - loop resources and even many product most (if not all and surplus) of their own power needs through boilers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right.  Paper stock manufacturing is very fast.  I did slower things like coating which means the media applied determines the speed.  But the size of the bearings and machines holding that stock is relatively large.  And you can slop as much grease and oil as you want across most metal stock but you just can't with paper stock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have 4 paper machines. Each one of them makes paper 3m wide at almost 2000m/min, 24/7.
The final roll is 2-3m wide, weights 2.5 tons and can have something like 40km of paper. </p>
<p>You are probably right that in comparison our lube use is low. But believe me, we have many high speed high weight rolls constantly  being pumped with grease. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Polluting lubrication” sounds like “dirty coal’s” second cousin lol </p>
<p>But on a serious note, large paper mills can consume large volumes of lubricants relative to other types of industries (100k gal / year / site is not uncommon). Smaller mills could use as little 2-3k gal / year. Size/throughput, type of equipment (as well as its age and condition), maintenance practices, etc all play a part in lubricant consumption.</p>
<p>For perspective, a site consuming 20k gal / year is considered a good size site. 100k gal / year is considered a very large site and anything 200k gal / year and above is considered a unicorn and every lubricant manufacturer competes strongly for them.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this info is for “finished lubricants” in the industrial sector i.e. hydraulic fluids, bearing and gear oils, greases, etc. There are other types of lubricants (such as process oils) and other sectors (such as automotive) that can use far more oil per site than these.</p></div>		</li>
