			<div class="markdown"><p>The implants used are actually meant for small dogs. In dogs they last for 6-12 months, while in ferrets they last for several years. No clue about cats (yet).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The adrenal gland issues are just for male ferrets, and from what I've heard it's still debatable whether or not surgically castrating really increases the chance for adrenal gland problems.</p>
<p>Female ferrets ussually stay in heat for the entire breeding season if not bred, which will usually lead to aplastic  anaemia. So you should either surgically/chemically spay (or rather castrate, as the entire reproductive organ is removed) a female ferrets, or breed her. Something some breeders do is keep 1 vasectomized male. He will still produce hormones, but is infertile. That way they can choose not to try for a litter with a female, but still breed that male to her, and that will bring her out of heat.</p></div>		</li>
