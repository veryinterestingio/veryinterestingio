			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only correct answer I’ve seen so far and it should be higher. Folate protection and Vitamin D synthesis are responsible for skin color variation. Skin cancer has nothing to do with it; skin cancer tends to occur later in life after reproductive years are over and therefore exerts little, if any, selective pressure. On the other hand, folate or vitamin d deficiencies during pregnancy or early childhood will screw kids up badly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat related but curious nevertheless. A few years ago I broke my foot while walking. I was living in a very cold and sun lacking country as opposed to my way warmer home city.
Before this I never even had a sprain and the doctors were baffled by this as I wasn’t into sports, didn’t have any condition and hadn’t done anything special.
Could it be that the lack of vitamin D made my bones so silly that they broke while... walking? Is that far-fetched?</p></div>		</li>
