			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a sonic boom; they’re going awfully fast right up until the end. Fun fact: The engine used for landing puts out more thrust than the rocket weighs at that point even at its lowest setting, which means the rocket can’t hover—it would just slow down and start rising again. So the ignition point has to be precisely timed so that the moment of zero vertical speed before it starts rising again is at the surface of the landing pad.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Famously the Space Shuttle would create two sonic booms as it glided in near a landing as the nose and tail separately created their own.</p>
<p>Edit: yes, really it is the shock wave catching up so you can hear it once the rockets go subsonic. A supersonic plane traveling horizontally over your head still makes a boom. A damn loud one too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong.  The booms are continuous for anything traveling supersonic - not just when they pass the sound barrier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I looked this up.  The boom is actually continuous above the speed of sound.  Decelerating through it doesn't create one - that's just when it stops.  Last paragraph in the intro here covers it</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_boom" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_boom" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_boom</a></a></p>
<p>And I hadn't heard of the shuttle's booms, but here's Falcon Heavy boosters making 3 each</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/HIhFAXGUfCs?t=368" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/HIhFAXGUfCs?t=368" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/HIhFAXGUfCs?t=368</a></a></p>
<p>“[The] first boom is from the aft end (engines),” said John Taylor, SpaceX’s Communications Director. “[The] second boom is from the landing legs at the widest point going up the side of the rocket. [The] third boom is from the fins near the forward end.”</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is completely wrong and a common misconception. Booms have nothing to do with decelerating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Famously the Space Shuttle would create two sonic booms as it glided in near a landing as the nose and tail separately created their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The landing boosters in the above video produce 3 sonic booms actually. I believe the shuttle also produced 3 in the same way, but they were generally only heard as 2 as 2 close ones merge together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>really it is the shock wave catching up so you can hear it once the rockets go subsonic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sonic booms travel independently from the rocket. The rocket doesn't have to go subsonic for the booms to reach you. If those rockets never lit their engines and cratered into the ground you'd still hear the sonic booms all the same.</p></div>		</li>
