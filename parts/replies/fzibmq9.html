			<div class="markdown"><p>That was fascinating, thanks! It's cool to watch a surgeon work - even with something as simple as tying stitches, their fingers are so fast and precise. When I try to tie a knot in a small piece of thread it takes me like...minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One trick for tying sewing thread is to loop it around the tip of your finger once, and the thread crosses itself over the pad of the finger, so then you can just press your thumb to it and roll it between your finger and thumb. Then pull it and it knots.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. Having just had said surgery earlier this month I'm having a serious internal debate if I really want to see the video.  Makes sense that the incision is where it is relative to the hernia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew this artist chick who watched her own surgery video. It had a profound influence on her art, with a definite &quot;before and after&quot; contrast between her pieces. Everything after became very... Organic, fluid, and red lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That made me ridiculously uncomfortable, but I had a morbid curiosity. The worst part was when he started fingering the hernia.</p></div>		</li>
