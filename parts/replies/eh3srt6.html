			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that this is not correct. The ion would have to bind to the channel to cause it's conformation to change and the kinetics of this would be too slow to allow rapid ion flow like in action potentials (considering every single ion has to make contact with the channel). Can you provide some references because your claim is super interesting if true. In voltage gated channels, the conformational change comes from the voltage and ions should flow down their gradient once the channel is opened. The reason sodium (which has smaller atomic radius than K+) does not flow down the gradient is because of water molecules that are associated with the Na+ ion. Essentially, because it is smaller, more water molecules form weak bonds around it than around a K+ ion. So when the Na+ flows down a channel, it has a larger H2O baggage than K+ so that does not fit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right, and the poster above you is partially right. I’d have to pull out the ol’ biochem book, but the spacing between the amino acid residues in a potassium ion channel are such that a sodium ion cannot form <strong>four</strong> (<em>Edit: 8, per /u/ccdy</em>) bonds, the number needed by the potassium ion, to pass through.</p>
<p>When “deciding” to go through the channel, the individual ion in question has to weigh its current entropy (<em>Edit: the correct term is enthalpy of hydration, again per /u/ccdy</em>) level in relation to water to what it will have when it goes through/out of the channel.</p>
<p>For potassium, the energy difference while going through the channel is minimal, but there’s a large gradient down which it is flowing which gives it “incentive” to flow down the gradient. </p>
<p>It takes more energy for sodium to go through the channel because it has to “shed” its water molecules but is only able to form 1-2 bonds at a time with the channel. It doesn’t want to take the journey because it’s not worth it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that sodium, being smaller and thus having a higher charge density, has a more negative enthalpy of hydration. This makes desolvation even more unfavourable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, in the human body for example, ion valency and anion switching is the key role for the membrane to permit the element passing through. Potassium 2ionchannel has a lower current and Sodium 3ion valent can actually cause the heart to create too much currency arrhythmic palpating if salinity content is too high. </p>
<p>Some membranes permit both, requiring ions from certain protein chains. But for most of the Na-K ’pump’ it’s 3Na to 2K which has covalent protein bonding anions for specific channel membranes. I believe the liver needs both elements in different ratios for different glycogen producing proteins. It’s pretty crazy how complex it can get. </p>
<p>Another example being patients with xeno transplants can develop indel mutations because different species require hyper acute ion bonds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the size relationship go the other way? I would expect a larger ion to have greater surface area for water binding. Or is ion charge density the more important parameter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sodium has a higher charge density as it is smaller, so its enthalpy of hydration is more negative. Qualitatively you can think of it as the negative bit of the dipole on each water molecule being able to approach closer to the positive charge of the ion. This means desolvation is more unfavourable. That’s one energy penalty that disfavours sodium binding in the channel. The size of the potassium channel pore adds another penalty: the carbonyl groups lining the pore are nicely able to coordinate to the larger potassium ion, but sodium is smaller and so it is less energetically favourable for sodium to enter the pore. The two effects add synergistically to produce the high selectivity observed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is slightly incorrect. The selectivity filter is not formed by a conformational change. The K+ ions moving down the pore make bonds with chemical groups in the channel's pore (carboxyl groups). A K+ ion is the right size to swap its coat of water molecules (hydration shell) for bonds with the pore. But a Na+ ion has a hydration shell the wrong size, hence it doesn't bond to the carboxyl groups and doesn't get through the pore. See Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, p. 410.</p></div>		</li>
