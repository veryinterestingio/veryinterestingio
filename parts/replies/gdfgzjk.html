			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't. Humans didn't evolve to sleep 8 hours all at once, we evolved to sleep when &amp; as often as we need to. Back before we had clocks and society was super integrated, people would go to bed whenever, sleep for a few hours, wake up for awhile, and go back to sleep whenever they were tired. This could include daytime naps as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Try meditating - it teaches you not to get caught up in your thoughts. I link to a great free guide <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6fyedk/what_is_the_most_depressing_truth_that_youve_had/dimd4q0/" target="_blank">in this old comment</a>.</p></div>		</li>
