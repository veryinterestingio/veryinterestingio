			<div class="markdown"><p>Why thank you!  Im glad someone got something out of it.  I tried to squeeze about a couple chapters of a textbook into one message.  Sorry for the length!</p>
<p>I’m really passionate about this stuff!  I’m actually an Exercise Physiologist and I work in Cardiology at the moment, but I’m honored by your question!  I work with so many amazing docs and nurses!  I’m currently working on getting into Dental School though because I’m also very passionate about maxillofacial surgery ?</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply!  I’m so glad it helped someone! ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh I remember working to get into dental school because I was really passionate about MF surgery. I’m in dental school now and I’ve given up pursuing that (at least for now). Good luck dear redditor, I hope you keep your motivation and your determination! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps a little, but walking is much more effective because it recruits more muscle fibers. This means more cross-sectional area, taking up more space, increasing compression on the vessels, giving a greater and more prolonged squeeze than just fidgeting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlikely.  Yes.  The odds are less than 50% on a long haul.  When you say “or impossible”, I disagree.  They certainly are possible.  I’ve had that patient before.</p>
<p>It’s still best to minimize risk even in otherwise healthy individuals. For long flights or road trips, it’s still recommended to get up from time to time.  And further to that point, you don’t always know if you have an underlying condition (which is probably what you mean by “pre-existing”).</p></div>		</li>
