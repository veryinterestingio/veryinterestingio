			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not a tautology; masculinity and male-ness are not exactly the same thing. Female voices can often sound quite “masculine.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right! This is the point I was trying to make. </p>
<p>It’s similar to how a trumped and a baritone horn can both play middle C....but you can tell the difference. </p>
