			<div class="markdown"><p>Both microalgae (single-celled free floating plants, also known as phytoplankton and microbial plankton) as well as macroalgae (kelp and other seaweeds) have the potential to create biofuels.  Much of the microalgae research and early production has been done on land, while macroalgae energy research is concentrated at sea.  Both forms are viable, but are still expensive. There is still more work to be done to make them effective and efficient fuel sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hoping you could expand on this further, last I remember the biggest hurdle was an economically worthwhile method of extraction. Has anyone made any decent strides to closing that gap on cost of extraction or is everyone still stuck on the basics ( centrifuge, screw press, and chemical extraction.)?</p>
<p>I know there were a few potential candidates such as ultrasonic cavitation, and origin clear's single step extraction method with the EMP, but I haven't been able to find anything as to what came of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure!  There have been strides made in some of the catalysis methods for extraction but I am not very familiar with them.  The MARINER program was focused on whether we can grow macroalgae at sea in quantity, harvest the algae, and get it back to shore safely and economically.  More on that here:  <a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/mariner" target="_blank"><a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/mariner" target="_blank">https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/mariner</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also be interested in Algae as a source of food as well. I grew up eating seaweed (I'm half japanese) and I was wondering if there was any research for this area of food production, with hopefully less impact on the land/water.</p></div>		</li>
