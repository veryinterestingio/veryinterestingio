			<div class="markdown"><p>While the rods and cones explanation is correct, nobody has brought up lateral inhibition yet, which plays a part as well.</p>
<p>The rods in your eyes are hardwired to a specific behaviour. If one rod is activated by a light stimulus (hit by light, sending a signal to your brain), the surrounding rods are inhibited directly by the one rod, which is activated and now less likely to send a signal to your brain. This increases contrast in normal settings, making things appear brighter by &quot;darkening&quot; the outline of the light source.</p>
<p>When you look at a bright star head on, the rods which would pick up the less bright star are inhibited, making the star disappear. Once you look slightly besides the star, there are less rods there, so the effect is not as pronounced and the less bright star does not get &quot;dimmed&quot; as much as before, making the star visible.</p>
<p>(Source: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_inhibition" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and my five your old biology degree. So if this is outdated information, please feel free to correct me.)</p></div>		</li>
