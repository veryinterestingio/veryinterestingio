			<div class="markdown"><p>correct, the follow up was at median 28 days and so the longer term efficacy of having received only 1 dose wasn't tested (and therefore could be waning):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These participants had a median follow-up time of 28 days (range: 1 to 108 days). The small, non-random sample and short median follow-up time limits the interpretation of these results. There appears to be some protection against COVID-19 disease following one dose; however, these data do not provide sufficient information about longer term protection beyond 28 days after a single dose.</p>

<p>the groups were also quite small at N=1000 on each side</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure if that’s where the question leads to but keep in mind the second shot is very important, if you infer that you can get away with a single shot. You want two shots because the second one will make the protection last much longer. First shot prepares the body and second shot strengthens the immune response</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very good point. Is there a time limit that you have to get the second shot or else it's like starting over? I know they recommend 21-28 days depending on the vaccine but not sure what the latest time you should get it would be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, when you exclude people who either already had the virus or contracted it within a few days of the first dose, the efficacy of the first dose alone appears to be about 89%.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a#history" target="_blank">UK green book</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the timing of cases accrued in the phase 3 study,
most the vaccine failures in the period between doses occurred shortly after vaccination,
suggesting that short term protection from dose 1 is very high from day 10 after
vaccination (Polack et al, 2020). Using data for those cases observed between day 15 and
21, efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 was estimated at 89% (95% CI 52-97%).

</blockquote>
<p>To understand what they mean about 'the timing of cases accrued' look at <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577" target="_blank">figure 3 of the BioNTech vaccine paper</a>, where you can see clearly the effect of the vaccine first dose from day 10 remains stable over time, showing that the first dose alone conveys substantial immunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks like the Moderna vaccine is also about 50% effective after 1-14 days, but a second dose is needed for long term immunity. </p>
<p>Edit: the real effectiveness looks to be 80%+ after one dose. The study included those who contacted covid or were infected in the first ~10 days it takes before the vaccine is effective in the 50% estimation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there data for these vaccines that says we need the second dose for long term immunity? Or is it best practice so that was what was fine in the trials and we really don’t know if the 2 dose is necessary?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Older vaccines (MMR, Smallpox, Polio, among others) were tested with both 1 and 2 doses and it was found that 2 doses consistently provides quite a bit extra immunity and makes the immunity last quite a bit longer.</p>
<p>Newer vaccines are generally only tested on a two-dose schedule, though the studies naturally collect some data that lets use determine information for a single dose. This secondary data is how we can see that the Pfizer vaccine is \~52%* effective with one dose and the Moderna vaccine is \~91%* effective with only one doses, though both have significantly larger confidence intervals than the data for 2 doses, which found 95% efficiency.</p>
<p>* It is worth noting that these numbers, due to the aforementioned secondary data, are not perfect and likely have significant unknowns added. Per other posts in this thread, the Pfizer is likely so much less efficient from 1 dose purely due to their random sampling having more people infected prior to the trial starting and not due to differences in the vaccine itself. Chances are very good both are about 90% effective with one dose and 95% with two, but the currently available data says otherwise - this would match with the difference the older vaccine tests showed for those vaccines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually the debate right now. The US is currently reserving the second dose. Biden just announced that they will switch to distributing all available doses with no reservation in expectation that future manufacturing will supply the second dose at the around the time it's supposed to be administered (if the second dose is a little late, that should not matter). The idea is to get as many shots into arms as fast as possible.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunity is a convenient descriptor, but it's not 100%.  When speaking of vaccines, we're looking to train the immune system to recognize a microbe as hostile and attack it immediately.  Even in an immune person, there will be <em>some</em> replication before the immune system gets its act in gear and kills the microbes that're using our body to reproduce.</p>
<p>Depending on how quickly the immune system recognizes and attacks the microbes, there could be some symptoms, and even transmission.  </p>
<p>For most vaccines that we consider successful, these will be minimal or nonexistent in the vast majority of people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. If you can achieve 50% immunity for millions of people instead of letting them sit on the shelf for weeks, that will definitely help. Especially if production keeps up with the shots being provided, then no one's second dose is late. Win win.</p></div>		</li>
