			<div class="markdown"><p>No not exactly. ACARS is a system to send messages and request data such as takeoff performance numbers and communicate via text with your dispatcher for weather products and rerouting planning. </p>
<p>You could use it to type out something like &quot;hey we have this item of the plane that just failed&quot; but it's not an automatic system diagnostic reporting tool like you are likening. It doesn't talk to the airplanes systems that way. It can give you automatic weather for stations you pass over but really it's a glorified text messaging system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, the internet qualifies as a glorified text messaging system too. It's all bytes under the turtles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that ACARS <em>could</em> be used for more cases if everyone agreed to do so. You mention text messaging, and funnily enough text messaging (GSM SMS) evolved in the same way. Someone noticed that there was a bunch of unused capacity in a control channel normally used to signal configuration messages between the cell tower and the phone. Hey why not use that bandwidth to send a string of characters between humans? Voila, text messaging was born. </p>
<p>So let’s make ACARS more useful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a telemetry system. Similar to a black box but not as resistant to damage. </p>
<p>Remote telemetry is more common now a days though. </p>
<p>The previous nuclear plant i worked at used a system for a black box for fighter jets. We bought it from L-3. It wasn’t physically hardened obviously, but it recorded millisecond data in the plant and allowed us to diagnose some weird issues.</p></div>		</li>
