			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth mentioning that since the RAM for a phone is embedded on the circuit board, there is a lot less real estate required.  Look at the chips on the RAM, it takes up a lot less space t han the whole RAM module.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also worth noting that this same logic applies to computer ram. The individual memory modules (the little black squares on the stick) each have increased over time. Back then a 512 MB stick of ram may have had 16 32 MB modules. Today, you can get a 16 GB stick with 16 1GB modules. Or even with server grade ECC memory, they make 32 GB and 64 GB sticks with 16 2 GB and 4 GB modules respectively.</p>
<p>Edit: The only reason they are all the &quot;same&quot; for desktop (as well as across laptops) is because of standardization. Companies like Dell, HP, etc. and even component manufacturers that make motherboards and what not, prefer to be able to sell their products to a standard. If there was no standard for RAM, motherboards and then computers in turn would cost way too high and no one would be able to afford them. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I resold it because there was no way I would need that much for my own PC</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A year ago I bought an extra stick for my Laptop. The same model name as the regular PC version only with an &quot;m&quot; appended and it had literally the same chips on a different size board. I knew they were essentially the same thing for Laptop and PC but I was still surprised just how similar they look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From r/hardwaresupportgore, I was expecting the worst. Yeah, they are different form factors of ram. DIMM and SODIMM</p>
<p>Also, on many laptops, ram sticks are inserted diagonally to save space </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, yeah, definitely. You can find laptops running basically full desktop-level CPUs and GPUs fairly easily. You do sometimes need to be careful about heat issues, though. Smaller form factor means less room for airflow and cooling, which can get bad quick.</p></div>		</li>
