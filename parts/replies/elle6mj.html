			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of websites do this. And usually these are the ones I am okay with. They generally just have a message that says they want to be supported, and please please disable it for us, we promise that we will be nice. They don't say &quot;you can't access us with an adblocker&quot; which is atrocious, and usually means I will just not visit the website instead.</p></div>		</li>
