<p>Jaw stretch, neck tendon stretch, or the remainder of a gestational mechanism. Maybe a reset for the facial and neck muscles. Could be related to the tics that some people exhibit. Certainly some people yawn more than others. </p>
<p>Maybe its the remainder of a signal/vocal mechanism: often there is a noise associated with yawning. Something neotenic perhaps, after all, and almost all mammals do it.</p>
<p>it might even be several causes. Or it could be the intersection of several mechanisms, which is why sometimes it happens, sometimes not. Sometimes I don't yawn when I am tired, sometimes I do.</p></div>		</li>
