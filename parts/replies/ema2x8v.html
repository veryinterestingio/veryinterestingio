			<div class="markdown"><p>You can. People are quite impressionable.

<p>This only works on some people though.</p>
<p>Just like the one drug seeker/back pain in a hospital I worked at, where the nurse forgot to actually put the opioid into the infusion bag.
The girl acted like she was having her greatest high and the back pain was gone.</p>
<p>This wouldn't have worked if she were already addicted to opioids though, and been going through withdrawals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha no probably not. You would likely get that feeling you get when you first feel alcohol start to effect you, (the tingles/slight dizziness/whatever that feels like for you) and then after a while your brain would realize nothing was coming and you'd go back to normal. That's happened to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In elementary school I decided to throw a big party at my house and my parents had a bar in the basement. They knew we'd inevitably get into it at some point so they filled a bunch of liquor bottles with water and planted them there. We all thought we were wasted and were acting really stupid all night after having drunk from the fake liquor (because what 11 year old knows what Vodka tastes like?) . There's definitely a placebo effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>reminds me of a comment about a guy who drank sparkling water to help quit beer because it had a similar mouthfeel which in turn reminded me of smokers who chew on something besides cigarettes.</p>
<p>Nonalcoholic beer has a tiny amount of alcohol (US standard is under 0.5% ABV) so maybe there's a reaction to that trace as well as or instead of other aspects of the drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there have been a number of psychological studies where they tricked people into thinking they were drinking alcohol when all the drinks were non-alcoholic; many people will act and feel drunk anyways.</p>
<p>IIRC this was in the game &quot;Persona 4&quot;</p></div>		</li>
