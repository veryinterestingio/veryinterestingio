			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the elaborate response! Now I have a clearer understanding of the whole thing. Apart from the “bad” political approach, isn’t there also a “bad” scientific practice? By that I mean not sharing proper data and countries using the vaccine regardless? Shouldn’t scientists in this countries oppose that kind of practice and try to use different vaccines? (I understand that the decision is political but probably some backlash from the scientific community)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vaccine itself was not deployed. It was a political image thing but it appears they are still doing phase 3. Will have to wait for the results from that, they'll show up when ready. Maybe Russia would use it with just internal reviews but not many other countries would accept not having data.</p></div>		</li>
