<p>Just get the fucking trampoline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I always had that problem with it too. Like it does a good job of demonstrating how an object travelling along a warped space can cause its trajectory to change or form an orbit but, as a demonstration of gravity itself, it falls short since it tries to show that things fall down because they fall down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good analogy for gravity, but it doesn't at all answer the question. The analogy doesn't forbid an object pushing up underneath the trampoline to block, dampen, or even reverse the effects of gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does answer the question. Space becomes curved by everything with mass and in 3 dimensions.  So if another huge sun-sized mass was placed near to a smaller mass, it would also curve space. For example Jupiter is curving space right now affecting Earth, regardless that the moon and Mars are closer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you can push an object to block it, but that won't change the fact that the trampoline is slanted. Like if it was a glass of water instead of a ball, the water inside would still start pouring out because it's at an angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity isn't an 'attractive force', it's the bending of space caused by matter (and energy). Thus, it's not that it 'works on a different plane', it <em>is</em> the 'physical plane' that we all exist on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>bending of space</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only of space, but of spacetime.</p>
<p>If you have something orbiting Earth, it's basically trying to fly straight, but the Earth bends spacetime around itself such that orbiting things behave as if on the trampoline. But they're actually going straight. An object in motion will remain in motion, and with virtually no air friction to slow you down, you just keep orbiting. However the effect of space being bent is actually rather minimal. You can check this by shining a laser right past the earth. It barely bends at all (although the night sky would look rather interesting if it did). The bending of time is what really keeps you in orbit and makes you fall. The photons of a laser would not experience time, that's why they don't fall towards the Earth as much as you do.</p>
<p>Unlike a photon, you are essentially falling through time. However, the Earth bends spacetime so that some of your motion through time gets translated into moving towards the Earth. When you're close to a very heavy object such as the Earth, you move slower through time because of this translation. If you were orbiting a black hole, this effect would be much more pronounced, because at that point a considerable fraction of your movement through time would be converted into moving towards the black hole.</p>
<p>Time also slows when you move really fast, because you're now doing to yourself what the Earth normally tries to do to you, but in reverse. You're moving faster through space so that you move slower through time. Because you always have to move at the speed of light in some direction. Most of the time you're simply moving at the speed of light through time, but any movement in space robs you of some of your speed falling through time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Matter affects TIME, and because of that, things fall. It's better just to watch the video. I hope a real 5Yo never asks me this, because I barely get it myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Veritasium recently did a video on this as well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRr1kaXKBsU" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRr1kaXKBsU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRr1kaXKBsU</a></a></p>
<p>I also watched some lectures on relativity before they became too advanced for me, but it turns out actually kind of difficult to tell if something is a force or not. The differences only manifest for really small, large, or elongated objects (because gravity will affect something nearer than further and you can measure the difference).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still indirectly having gravity cause gravity.  The only reason the clocks have different speeds is because gravity.  Then he infers gravity from the different speeds of clocks.  It's still a circular logic.</p></div>		</li>
