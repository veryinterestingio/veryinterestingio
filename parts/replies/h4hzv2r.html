			<div class="markdown"><p>Unintended mold is often a visual indicator that the item has been in the right environment for enough time to develop bacteria. The bacteria is generally not visible but can be more harmful for humans to ingest, so in some cases even if that unintended mold itself wouldn't hurt you, if it has grown it means more harmful bacteria has also had that opportunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere I had read that hard cheeses won't support toxic mold growth.  I've never been able to find any other source for this claim.  Does anyone know if there is any validity to this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>im not sure i ever heard this but i assume the claim has to do with the fact that hard cheeses are denser and more dry so its harder for the mold to inflitrate into the cheese. Its not uncommon for certain cheeses to develop mold on the moist exterior layer but that cannon penetrate into the cheese itself</p></div>		</li>
