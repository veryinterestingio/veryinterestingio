			<div class="markdown"><p>The V22 is technically both since it operates as a rotary wing and fixed wing depending on the angle of the rotors. There are also fixed rotor helicopters which operate more like a plane, like the new S-97. And even weirder things like a autogyro where the rotor is unpowered. </p>
<p>It's a fascinating part of aviation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not technically groundbreaking, but Burt somethingorother made a self-propelled glider. The propeller had spring pushing the blades into the nose-cone and only popped out when it was spinning. It was a really neat design.</p></div>		</li>
