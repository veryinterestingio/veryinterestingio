			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was common knowledge that vitamin D is <em>synthesized</em> with sunlight. I had no idea there are actually people who think that sunlight <em>carries</em> vitamin D.</p>
<p>I wish I could go back to five minutes ago when I was blissfully unaware of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, if as a kid you heard someone say the phrase “time to go soak up that vitamin D” you probably imagined it literally soaking through the skin and just didn’t think about it again unless it became relevant to you.</p>
<p>My version of this was that I legitimately believed chickens pooped eggs until the embarrassingly late age of 18 when I actually stopped and thought about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes for a pretty interesting watch, towards the end it talks about how sunlight+chlorophyll produces CoQ10 in the body. Makes me wonder if someday chlorophyll will be considered an essential nutrient.<a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-regenerate-coenzyme-q10-coq10-naturally/" target="_blank"><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-regenerate-coenzyme-q10-coq10-naturally/" target="_blank">https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-regenerate-coenzyme-q10-coq10-naturally/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, if sunscreen blocks all the UV light, then the last step of vitamin D synthesis will be halted. However, that's not the case in practice because 1) sunscreen doesn't block all UV light and 2) it doesn't last on the skin/is not used regularly enough to do that effect. There's a study that actually asked your same question and looked into it. They found out that no, not really it doesn't affect it so much because of the points I mentioned before. Gonna link the study in case you were interested to read it: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjd.17888" target="_blank">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjd.17888</a></p></div>		</li>
