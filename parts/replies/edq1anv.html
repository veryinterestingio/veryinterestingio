			<div class="markdown"><p>Blue stuff is blue because it reflects blue light. Green stuff reflects green light, etc. But there's another way to reflect light that doesn't involve color: texture. </p>
<p>You know how mirrors are really smooth and they reflect light exactly? No matter what color hits it, it will reflect that color? Well, rough stuff (like rough on a really tiny scale) works the opposite. Any color that hits it gets jumbled and the reflection gets all weird form bouncing around all the nooks and crannies. That mixes all the colors of light together to make white. </p>
<p>Plastic is really smooth on the outside, but when you bend it, it makes a bunch of microscopic cracks that make the surface rough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that mirrors actually have a green hue, meaning they actually absorb all colors more than green, or reflect green light the best. You can see this effect by setting up two mirrors facing each other so they reflect infinitely back on one another. The color of the reflections takes on a green hue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember hearing about this museum that was built where they made an incredible effort to create and use glass that had no green hue. It turned out really expensive but the lighting was identical to outside lighting. But as it turns out, since the artists had painted the paintings in glass-filtered light, the paintings' color balance was off in the museum, since the interior lighting was missing that very slight green hue :)</p>
<p>Unfortunately can't remember the name of the museum, since I just heard of it in a lecture, and google doesn't tell me anything :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing this is actually because glass has a bit of a green hue itself, due to iron oxide impurities. Same reason glass looks green if you look at it from the edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For standard back surface mirrors, this is true since light passes thru the glass before reflecting. But for optical elements where the mirror is on the front surface, this will not occur. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say different colors of light have different sizes and plastic is like swiss cheese up close. Some light cant fit in the little holes of plastic, some can. Stretching the plastic changes the size and shape of the holes and of the plastic. This changes what sizes of light that can and cant go in it, thus changing its color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Better than the top comment forsure, but I feel like talking in reference to &quot;holes&quot; is misleading. </p>
<p><a href="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42004-017-0004-9/MediaObjects/42004_2017_4_Fig1_HTML.jpg" target="_blank">Here is a slightly useful visual</a></p>
<p>The molecular chains in the plastic start out like a ball of spaghetti (clear), and when you pull on it (or bend it, heat it, etc.) you straighten some of that spaghetti ball out, which forms more ordered crystalline structures. When these structures are around the same size as the wavelength of visible light, they scatter it, making the material more opaque. </p></div>		</li>
