			<div class="markdown"><p>The recreation they blew up was based on the <del>1805</del> <em>1605</em> version - the one Guy Fawkes tried to blow up. What you probably have in mind is the current &quot;Palace of Westminster&quot; that houses both houses of parliament. This historic landmark was built ~1840-1870.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The House of Lords is actually just a single chamber inside of the Palace of Westminster which is a much larger building. For this recreation it looks small because they only recreated the House of Lords and the basement underneath it rather than model the entire Palace of Westminster which would've been a gargantuan task. Since the House of Lords was where the targets would be and all of the gunpowder would be in the basement beneath, they only needed to build those two to see how large the explosion would've been.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bear in mind the modern house of lords is not really anything like the one Fawkes had in his sights... IIRC in Fawkes' era it was a much more humble stone building, rather than the gothic fantasy that is there today.</p>
