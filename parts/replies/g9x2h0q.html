			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to piggyback on this, back in 2006 a group used sequence alignment of HERVs from throughout the human genome to reconstruct a consensus sequence of the ancestral retrovirus.  They were able to generate infectious retrovirus particles using the consensus sequence, and also showed some evidence that recombination between HERVs was still possible and could theoretically lead to viral reactivation in some individuals.</p>

<p>The study can be found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1665638/" target="_blank">here</a>, and is definitely worth reading!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV does integrate (hence the integrate strand transfer inhibitor drug class including dolutegravir and cabotegravir), but it doesn't typically infect germline cells.  However, there are some cases of altered cell tropism by using mechanisms besides CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4-mediated entry.  I saw a great talk on this at the NIH HRHR conference several years ago and I <em>really</em> wish I could remember the name of the PI who presented it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From OPs description; sort of.</p>
<p>All the instructions are present, but scattered throughout the human genome. It sounds like the researchers identified the individual pieces and used those to reconstruct the virus. It's a bit like an easter egg hunt for pieces of a jigsaw that you have to re-assemble.</p>
<p>As to how they got there, The human genome (and most other genomes for that matter) is actually able to edit and re-assemble itself, to some degree, using DNA sequences called <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/transposon" target="_blank">transposons</a>. These are themselves likely derived from ancient viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact - the reason why some cancer genes get activated? Thanks to &quot;on switches&quot; from some of these guys coded nearby - even if they're functionally dead, HERVs can still impact our health if positioned appropriately within our genome. [Did 4th year thesis project in uni on the inheritance of certain HERVs within families, as well as their presence in unrelated individuals from various ethnic backgrounds.] The 1000 genomes project is a great resource for raw genetic data if anyone is interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only changes to the germ line can be passed on to the next generation. This is true of all mutations that lead to new alleles in genomes as well as those caused by viral infections.</p>
<p>There's no reason why some of these artifacts couldn't predate sexual reproduction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to visualize, would it require gametes to be infected or just an early embryo to become fully saturated with the virus? Certain conditions would probably be more conducive to xenogenetic transfer in nature, very interesting to think about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally. That's what 'germ line' refers to. </p>
<p>I think it isn't as much about timing as about luck. A virus would have to infect a woman's eggs without causing infertility while infecting the surrounding tissues or destroying the egg.</p>
<p>With sperm I'm unclear if the virus would infect a specific sperm, it's seems more likely that the virus night infect the cells that make the sperm. Again in such a way that the virus only altered things enough to be noticable but not so much to ruin the sperm.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a lot about the infectious conditions which generate HERVs?</p></div>		</li>
