			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, CRISPR is actually the name of the genomic structure that holds the memory of these past infections. In and of itself it just allows cutting DNA more precisely than any other technique before, not quite completely freely but close enough.</p>
<p>The CRISPR array was discovered a while ago but it's only in 2007 that a team based in Quebec City at Université Laval (along with international collaborators) discovered it functioned as a bacterial adaptive immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the nobel prise is an antiquated organization that fails to recognize that discovery happens in group.</p>
<p>But really the prize was for adapting CRISPR for use in eukaryotes, not for discovering what it originally does. They people in Canada were robbed really but using it in mammalian cells is flashier for the media.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is that CRISPR functions as a system with a protein called Crisper Associated Protein (Cas), that recognizes the special CRISPR sequences in the genetic code.</p>
<p>CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats. That means that these repeating nucleotides are clustered together, regularly interspaced, and are palindromic (they can be read the same from both directions). The CRISPR sequences work as a sort of filing system to mark off regions of important genetic material so that the Cas protein can recognize the target sequences associated with the CRISPR sequences, and cut out at other sites with corresponding genetic material.</p>
<p>The CRISPR sequences act as the filing system /database of old viral genetic material in distinct areas of the bacteria’s genome!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the sequences in the bacterial genome identical to the ones in the pathogen's genome, or are the palindromes created by repeating and flipping the original sequence? I assume the spacers are strictly between the sequences and don't break single sequences into multiple pieces?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a table per say, it's a sequence in their genome of alternating repeats (identical structural dna) and spacers (memory sequences). </p>
<p>The CRISPR array is the region that contains these spacers and repeats and it gets transmitted with the rest of their genome upon division. Sometimes they loose the oldest spacers, but some organisms can keep 100s of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the memory sequences are the ones that should be destroyed, and those sequences are in their genome, why doesn't the bacteria destroy its own DNA? Does it have a protective mechanism to recognize it as its own? Or does it encode it in a way that isn't a copy of the sequence to be destroyed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This part is actually a bit of mystery. </p>
<p>We know how bacteria read the table, and we also know how to hijack this machinery, hack together our own version of the table, and inject it into other animals for genetic engineering purposes. </p>
<p>What we don’t really understand is how new data is selected and added to the table in the wild, which is a pretty necessary part of any adaptive immune system, which is what CRISPR is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I've tried to look into the details of how CRISPR/Cas9 works before but molecular bio isn't really my forte, and it's never really stuck with me for how it mechanistically works. I definitely never heard about this memory type thing you brought up which sounds cool. </p>
<p>I've primarily looked at Wikipedia though, which I think it sometimes written at a high level. Are there are sources that you know of that would help explain what you mentioned and/or how Crispr works?</p></div>		</li>
