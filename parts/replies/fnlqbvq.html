			<div class="markdown"><p>that is a really interesting piece of trivia to know. Is that entirely unrelated to a bullet's aero(hydro)dynamics? For instance, i can imagine faster bullets might typically be more pointed, whereas slower rounds would be the snubnose kind you tend to see in cop shows. But the longer, narrower, sharper bullet has a much larger surface area, which would matter (i imagine) when travelling through a more dense medium than air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 walks a tight line. It's important to get across an idea in an understandable way. But it's important not to mislead people and propagate misunderstandings, which commonly happens in pop science stuff.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think it's fine to use jargon so long as the jargon is explained as part of the response--that's called education, and is the point of the sub.</p>
<p>Additionally, every asker (and that includes people replying other than OP) has a different level of understanding already. Tuning responses to those levels enables the best transfer of knowledge. But, people at other levels will find it either inscrutable or childish.</p>
<p>Personally I hate the replies that take ELI5 too literally and obscure an explanation by insisting on childish language, like &quot;so these wiggly things wiggle along until mean old mister wall says, hey, you're not allowed here!&quot; It's a narrative you can follow, but it's not necessarily a good way to inform people.</p></div>		</li>
