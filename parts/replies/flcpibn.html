			<div class="markdown"><p>C-Reactive protein was measured with Wisconsin Sorting Card test-this measures cognitive flexibility, the masked Continuous Performance test-this measures attention, the Finger Tapping test-this measure psychomotor speed. </p>
<p>Lower concentrations of Tumor Necrosis Factor also predicted lower psychomotor performance in the Finger Tapping test in one study. </p>
<p>Higher levels of interleukin-6 are associated with psychomotor speed also. </p>
<p>I’d have to go through each individual study again to have a look at the length of time of depression, but these were for patients diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder.</p>
<p>I would like to say however, all of these results are tentative, they were based off four studies-there needs to be more research done in this area, but it is suspected that neuroinflammatory markers are associated with cognitive deficits in MDD. </p>
<p>MDD is also based on a spectrum, so it would be very hard to say either way if the length of time the person is suffering from MDD is related to the levels of neuroinflammation-there are so many factors that come into this. Their genetics, how the condition specifically presents in them, their immune response, the severity of the episode, their emotional response. So many factors, not exhaustive to that list. Length of time could have an effect, but someone could have the disorder quite severely for a shorter amount of time and show the same levels also. </p>
<p>My research unfortunately did not go into how to improve those deficits, or how the inflammation could be reversed, so I cant give you an educated answer on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I’m not going to send the paper because it has not been published, therefore not peer reviewed, it was done as part of an exercise for my course, but I can send you on the references. Just out at the moment so bare with me.</p></div>		</li>
