<p>Every fossil fuel burning plant which is replaced by something cleaner instantly increases the cleanliness of everything on the grid.</p>
<p>In short, if every power plant was coal, then your electric car is only really getting the benefits of points 2 and 3, so is only somewhat better than a gas burning car. But if you replace half of those power plants with wind/solar/nuclear/whatever, then instantly your electric car &quot;produces&quot; half as much pollution as before without you changing anything about the vehicle. While even a 100% conversion to clean energy would not improve the pollution output of a gasoline powered car.</p>
<p>Edit: An extra point as discussed below this post, is the centralization of sources of pollution. It wouldn't make sense to establish a soot-trap type device on the exhaust on millions of cars that necessitates cleaning every so often, but it makes a lot of sense to put such traps on the exhaust stacks for the ~2,200 (as of 2021) coal plants around the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is definitely true if you and your friend are both buying brand new cars. But if you opt for a used vehicle that is gas-powered I know there’s an amount of offset just by not buying a whole new car that’s built instead of something already existing. Not sure how to compare it though. I wonder what would happen if someone figured out how to electrify existing vehicles. I’m guessing that’s not gonna be feasible tho</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the point I made to my father recently.</p>
<p>On the day you buy it, the gasoline car is as efficient and clean as it will EVER be; and it will be for 20 years or more.</p>
<p>However, every time the grid gets cleaner, your electric car also gets cleaner. Every time inflation goes up more than your electricity cost; your car gets cheaper. </p>
<p>Fossil fuels are never going to get more efficient, much cleaner, or cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>another semi-related plus for electric cars is they have a fraction of the moving parts of a gas car.  that means FAR less repair and maintenance (this is why dealers have been hating on electric cars - they make a lot of their money from service)</p>
<p>so less wear and tear, less energy used</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In broad strokes this is true, but it's very likely that your EV will get less efficient too as the batteries and motors experience wear and tear, so to be perfectly accurate you have to take that into account. </p>
<p>The EV of course does still offset those losses in efficiency with the greening of the grid, while the fossil fuel vehicle just gets worse and worse.</p>
<p>Another point to add to that: as more and more vehicles move to electric, the less demand for gas there is, which means less gas being transported, which generally means less pollution as well as less wear and tear on the roads, and on largely unrecyclable truck tires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just pitching in a slightly more direct comparison for OP.</p>
<p>My Smart ED would give me between 70 and 85 miles for £1.20 of electricity, and I was on a premium energy supplier selling from renewable only electricity allocation.
YMMV, literally.</p>
<p>Petrol/Diesel is selling for £1.35/l here in the UK, so £1.20 would give me around 15 miles in a combustible engine smart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I find interesting is that so far we haven't. Most EVs that I've seen still conform to the &quot;box at the front for the engine, box in the middle for the people, box at the back for the luggage&quot; layout. </p>
<p>I can't remember the word for this, but there's a phenomenon when visual cues from previous engineering necessities persist even after the necessity has ceased.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you considered vehicle laws and passenger safety? </p>
<p>Pancake cars aren't exactly the most efficient use of space on a road, truck format front cabin is nowhere near as safe as mid cabin and rear cabin has inherently poor visibility of the road ahead, while still endangering the passenger in a rear-ended crash.</p>
<p>Car innovation has been happening all throughout history, there are hundreds of weirdly shaped and innovative designed cars that just didn't make the cut for a reliable, safe and daily use vehicle that could get the passenger from point A to point B. The mid cabin layout has survived through world wars and countless, rigorous tests. If any of the other possibilities were better, then you would have seen every car built in that layout instead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>2 - Large power plants are much more efficient than a car engine. If you burn 1000 gallons of gasoline at a powerplant and send it to 1,000 cars, you'll get more miles than if each car burned just one gallon of gasoline.</p>

<p>This is very important. While electric cars have other features that can help make them more efficient, this point gives them a big advantage that has nothing to do with the vehicle itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not just the power plant. It's that power plant plus electric motor is way way more efficient than just gasoline engines. A 1000-car-scale gasoline engine is still less efficient than 1000 electric motors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electric by far.* Electric cars are around 80%, gasoline is around 35%. Combustion engines lose massive of amounts of energy to heat. Gasoline must be burn and converted into heat then into motion. Electric motors are around 95% efficient so you just lose some to heat and friction.</p>
<p>*Assuming greenish energy. Pointless to burn coal and buy an EV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A sort-of oversimplified way to think about it is this:</p>
<p>Gasoline has ~3X the energy of the same amount of gasoline after it's been run through an inefficient generator to make electricity, but an EV is ~4X more efficient than a gas engine at turning that amount of energy in to road miles. So it's still a gain, even using an inefficient method of converting fossil fuels to electricity.</p>
<p>That's why that meme with the picture of the generator next to a Tesla supercharger is so ironic. You can put a gallon of gas in your car and go however many miles it goes on a gallon, or you can burn it into electricity and go like 44 miles in an EV. So even using that absurdly inefficient method you'd need a Prius to beat the efficiency.</p>
<p>When you take into account that very little electricity is generated using liquid fossil fuels because they use more efficient methods, and a gallon of gasoline you get at the pump that's been mixed with ethanol isn't as full of energy as the gallon of gas used in the lab to calculate this stuff, the gap gets wider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also generation, distribution, storage. You can produce electricity almost anywhere depending on the type of generation; no need to turn entire countries into unstable regions controlled by greedy puppet governments, generating wars and instability along with the energy. You don't need fleets of gigantic inefficient tankers and pipelines and all the infrastructure to support those things. You store energy in batteries as close or as far from the end user as you need to. No need to refine through several sub-products and to keep strategic reserves.</p>
<p>The geopolitics alone might be worth the switch.</p></div>		</li>
