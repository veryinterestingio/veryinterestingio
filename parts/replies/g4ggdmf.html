<p>At levels of initial intoxication, alcohol works as a vasodilator, causing blood vessels to relax and expand. However, at extremely high levels, alcohol works as a vasoconstrictor, causing veins to tighten and constrict. Both of these conditions can negatively affect your blood pressure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>headaches and the feeling of your heart beating like crazy when you’re hungover is a direct result of alcohol’s effects on your vascular system and blood pressure. some of it is dehydration, but sitting in water wouldn’t help you with that. i am no scientist but i would venture to guess that the water helps equalize your blood pressure and relaxes you which helps the feeling of a hangover go away.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>When cytokines get busy, the immune system begins firing, and that can cause inflammation. It also causes a host of other hangover-like symptoms: headaches, chills, fatigue, nausea, stomach upset. And cytokines can mess with memory formation, meaning they might also account for alcohol-related lapses in memory.</p>

<p>It's why the #1 thing to help with a hangover, is an NSAID.</p>
<p>So to OP's question, sitting in a cool body of water might reduce some of the inflammation also. Certainly not &quot;boom, hangover gone&quot; but I could imagine it would reduce symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Im 19 and can literally drink half a bottle of vodka and wake up feeling amazing the next day. I think I've maybe had a hangover once.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Please don’t take NSAIDs shortly after drinking alcohol. That’s a ticket to the ER for liver toxicity and lasting damage. Glutathione and toxic metabolites - it’s a thing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you trued replicating that with a bath at a simular temperature? </p>
<p>I'm guessing a pool might not help cause the chlorine and pool chemicals can just do a number on your skin and eyes. Too many variables to be a valid experiment unless it also works.</p>
<p>Cause floating and relaxing in cold potable water with sunlight and warm humid air might be doing a lot of different things for/to the body (except for hydration, which it wouldn't do).</p>
<p>Who knows. Could also just be a bacteria or some other microbial life in the water that cures a hangover. If thats the case, you might be onto a discovery of the century.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't drink anymore so I won't be able to test with a bath.</p>
<p>After reading the other posts, I am convinced it's just the relaxation brought on from being weightless and cooling off in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if it made you pee afterwards, it could be that you go trid of some of the toxins that way. As I understand it, when you're in cold water, blood vessels contract and body gets rid of 'extra' liquid by sending it through the kidneys. Now the next part I'm not sure about, but maybe more activity in the kidneys cleans up your system a bit and contributes to feeling better afterwards.</p></div>		</li>
