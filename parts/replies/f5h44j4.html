			<div class="markdown"><p>How would a wireless connection ever be better than a wired one? Sure, cables are limited by the laws of physics in the sense that copper wire has resistance and electricity can only flow at 280 million meters per second, but satellites use radio waves which travel at similar speeds, yet are much farther away and therefore it takes more time for the signal to reach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Always confused me because in apocalypse media they never try using the internet even when they have power, so I thought that's because the network is no longer available without people to keep up with it. </p>
<p>But, so if there was ever an apocalypse (zombie or more realistically nuclear or so), internet wouldn't be a problem as long as you have power and a connection?</p>
<p>Though, guess that doesn't make sense to me either. There must be something keeping the internet going. If everyone computer and network was just destroyed, would the internet not just be gone? Or is it hiding in the air and always accessible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The internet is the cables that connect everything AND the servers that contain the information. Even if you have electricity and a connection, that doesn't mean that all the servers are still operational. So if you have electricity and connect to the internet you might still have some stuff available, but you wouldn't know what is still on and what isn't anymore. If google servers are still on you could make a search, but if those are off (and other search engine) you would need to type the exact website which may or may not still be online, maybe internet rather useless. Of course all of this won't shut down immediatly, servers wil slowly shut down as they lose power or something break.</p>
<p>In addition, as time advance the cables without maintenance might start to break.</p></div>		</li>
