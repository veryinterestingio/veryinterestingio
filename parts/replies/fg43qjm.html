			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this. It's also worth mentioning you will burn fat in roughly the same order you put it on. That means if you've got a relatively skinny face but fat midsection, and then gain a bit more fat and it goes onto your face, when you start working out it'll go off your face before your midsection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure your explanation is correct, but the label is wrong. What you described is reverse order, not same order. First in last out (filo), not first in first out (fifo).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn’t lose the weight so much as it’ll change where the fat goes. This is something that happens with trans people who take cross-sex hormones. Fat location is one of the major differentiations between male and female body shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will just move somewhere else. With more estrogen, the fat will build more on your hips and chest. But you'll likely have the same amount of fat on you. Also that's a really lengthy process</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Officially, I'm going to say no. Genetics will still play a roll that you wont be able to overcome. Secondly, is it worth messing with your hormones to lose some fat on a specific area when you're still going to have to put in the effort to lose the fat? </p>
<p>Now if I were to speculate, at best I think that might help you target at least between upper and lower halves of your body, not specifically down to arm fat, belly fat, etc. And that target wouldnt be something drastic like 80/20. It would likely be a less than noticeable difference. But again, is it worth risking it when you still have to put on the work?</p></div>		</li>
