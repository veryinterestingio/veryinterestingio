<p>For example Iguanodon is not just a single species of dinosaurs, it is an entire genus of species, which probably had many different species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other thing I remember from my paleo courses, fossilization also has a bias for the number of a species....if your finding large numbers of a species, it possibly means there were a lot of them, they were probably grouped (herd animals) and lived in environs that would be conducive to fossilization....more app for modern day, but the species most likely to fossilize are those least likely to go extinct...so species in the past few in number were less likely to be fossilized....</p></div>		</li>
