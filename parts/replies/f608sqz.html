			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of oil or wax, could it also be that you've already smoothed out that part of the paper before the ink was properly flowing? So now the part you already scribbled on is too smooth to grab the ball and roll it, but a new place is fine.</p>
<p>Sometimes if a pen hasn't been working in a while I've had to scribble to get it working. If I scribble too long in the same spot it never works, but if I move to a few new spots it'll eventually start working... but not where I was originally scribbling/writing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The feels correct to me. The ball needs to overcome its own internal friction to start moving, for that it needs more friction between ball and paper than ball and pen.</p>
<p>Move the pen somewhere rougher, the ball will start moving again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a guess, but the golf-ball like texture might not make as smooth and even lines once the ball was moving. You'll have pockets where there's either more ink attached to the ball (filling the dimple) or where the dimpled part of the ball doesn't hit the paper with the same pressure as the non-dimpled part. It might look more like using a rolling stamp than a pen.</p>
<p>Also, sounds like the reason it takes a while to get moving is that it needs to overcome friction between the ink inside and the bits of pen that hold the ink and ball. The dimples on the golf ball-like ball would probably increase that friction as well as the friction in the paper, probably resulting in a net zero gain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely it would make the problem worse.  You would be creating a ball with &quot;speed bumps&quot; at each of the dimples which would resist rolling.  Picture a big 10 ft diameter ball with flat spots.  If you try pushing that on flat ground vs pushing a spherical ball, the ball with flat spots will be significantly harder to roll.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it would probably work better for friction, but it would be nearly impossible to manufacture tiny balls like that with even tinier dimples that are still round enough to work.</p>
<p>But maybe you could use actual golf balls, and just have a larger pen. It'll be the &quot;golf pen&quot;, opposite of the &quot;golf pencil&quot; known for being small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean this as a knock against you, but I find it fascinating some people don't think about the things they use. How did you imagine it worked, or did it just never once enter your mind? </p>
<p>Like if you were in a store, how would you make a decision on what type of pen to buy? You see ballpoint, rollerball, liquid, gel, felt, etc. Do you just randomly grab one?</p>
<p>Again, I don't mean this as an insult, I just am curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just always thought that &quot;ballpoint&quot; just meant that the tip didn't come to a sharp point but a rolled or blunted point if that makes sense. Basically I understand that the tip was shaped like a ball at the end, I just didn't realize it actually rolled. Also, I really don't handwrite much of anything. I do pretty much everything digitally. If I have pens at home, it's because they're my girlfriend's, not because I bought them lol. I could tell you how your computer or smartphone works, I just never thought about how a pen actually works nor did I ever have a need to care about the differences between pens. I've never actually gone &quot;pen shopping&quot; or bought a fancy pen before or anything.</p></div>		</li>
