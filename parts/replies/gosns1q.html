			<div class="markdown"><p>Flashbacks to this period. I was working as a field service tech for PC's and when you opened a PC in the era before the workplace smoking ban in an office which had smokers there was anything up to half an inch of fine ash covering every component of the system.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why diskettes were so unreliable as it acted as a fine abrasive on the mechanical elements of the system.</p>
<p>Semi amusing story - our sales guys convinced one company they should pay to have us clean the insides of their machines - which we did - in the following week about half their machines died as our actions basically pushed the fine ash into all the spots where it hadn't yet gotten to. They were less than amused....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can be said for EVERYTHING really.  Computers are essentially AIR-FLOW machines.  They are (usually) carefully designed to pull in cool air from the room, push it over the hot electronics, and exhaust it at the other side of the device.</p>
<p>This is very clear in computers (as there is a fan, and exit grates), but most electronics accomplish the same thing with passive means, where heat rises, pulling in cool air as it exits at the top.  </p>
<p>And THAT is why your electronics seem to &quot;gobble up&quot; all the dirt in the room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this was a bait so I looked it up myself, what the fuck how did I not know this? I mean it makes total sense when you read it, but wtf this is still wild to me.</p>
<p>To save any lazy people a google: &quot;losing weight&quot; means metabolizing the fatty triglycerides, which isn't news to anyone. But metabolizing the fat breaks it down into its base atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen through an oxidation process. 85% of those atoms are converted to CO2 and are exhaled, the other 15% becomes H2O</p>
<p>I'm not an expert on the subject at all since I just learned this was even a thing, but that's how I'm understanding it</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nah, now you're exaggerating. </p>
<p>Plants get their <em>carbon</em> from the air. But just like humans, plants are mostly water, and they get that from the ground. Even dried wood is only about 50% carbon, and living wood far less.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://web.extension.illinois.edu/askextension/thisQuestion.cfm?ThreadID=19549&amp;catID=192&amp;AskSiteID=87" target="_blank">Living trees, however, are very wet. In fact, although there can be great variation between tree species (and seasonally), a living tree may be made up of more than two thirds water by mass. Thus, a living tree is made up of 15-18% carbon, 9-10% hydrogen, and 65-75% oxygen by mass.&quot;</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Burning and decomposition are separate things.</p>
<p>When things like candle, wood, or gasoline burn, they react with oxygen. Oxygen from the air combines with carbon and hydrogen, and creates carbon dioxide and water vapor as exhaust.</p>
<p>Decomposition is when a molecule breaks into smaller parts without adding anything. That would produce soot.</p>
<p>&quot;It just dissipates&quot; doesn't sound very informative. Wax can't just evaporate and stay in the air indefinitely. It would fall and you would see it. Which can happen, butâ€¦</p>
<p>As a habitual candle user, common tea candles don't produce significant soot or deposit wax into an enclosed holder. So the answer is simply that candles burn like anything else does, and yes, we're inhaling the CO2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the interest of not confusing people â€” this is <em>one</em> meaning of the word decomposition. Often when we talk about decomposition we mean biological decomposition, like an apple core rotting away on the ground. That involves the action of living organisms eating the apple core, and hence most definitely involves stuff reacting with oxygen, and CO2 being produced.</p></div>		</li>
