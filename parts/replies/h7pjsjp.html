			<div class="markdown"><p>Can anyone explain this? How/why is it higher?:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the surface of the Red Sea is slightly higher in elevation than the Eastern Mediterranean, the canal serves as a tidal strait by which Red Sea water pours into the Mediterranean. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Mediterranean loses more water to evaporation than it gains through rivers flowing into it, this lowers the level a little bit. Water flows in through the straight of Gibraltar to try to even it out but since it's not instant there's still a bit of a gradient there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently 6+ species have crossed the Panama Canal. They’ve had 100+ years to cross those locks and it would have to be species that could survive in salt and fresh water. Tarpons are now being caught on the pacific side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Compare that to 300+ species that have crossed the Suez canal (according to another poster). So it's apparently about 50x harder to cross the Panama canal than the Suez canal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But Suez Canal has been open for 50 more years or 33% more time for species to cross over but it probably has more to do with being saltwater the whole time and no locks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The use of locks would probably prevent clogging the Suez canal too by necessitating the ships move more slowly through the canal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if you’re implying that ships just rock up to the Suez and drive through, if so, they can’t. They have to collect a pilot first, and then pass through. </p>
<p>Interesting bit of side history, during the Suez crisis when the Egyptian government seized the canal from its British and French owners, the Brits and Frenchies pulled out all their pilots in an attempt to block up the canal, but the soviets sent in pilots who learnt the canal in no time, kept it running, and then trained the Egyptians how to run it themselves.</p></div>		</li>
