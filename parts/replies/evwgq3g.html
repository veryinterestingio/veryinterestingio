			<div class="markdown"><p>Our lenses are suspended by fibrous strands (zonules) that act as ligaments, connecting the lens to the ciliary body (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliary_body#/media/File:Blausen_0390_EyeAnatomy_Sectional.png" target="_blank">image here</a>) . When the ciliary muscles are relaxed, the tension in the zonules increases which pulls on the lens and flattens it, allowing us to focus at a far away objects. When the ciliary muscles contract, the zonules slacken which allows the lens to thicken and take on more curved, convex shape that helps us focus on close up objects.</p>
<p>Conventional synthetic lens are not an exact replica of our natural lens and thus don't interact in the same way with the the ciliary body and zonules, so the same mechanism is not at play. Synthetic lenses usually include side structures, called haptics, to hold the lens in place within the capsular bag inside the eye. They are designed to be fixed with no rotation or anterior/posterior movement that could affect vision, preventing the ciliary muscles contractions/relaxations from producing the same effect as on our natural lenses.</p>
<p>However, as a result of advances in materials science, there is now accommodating synthetic lenses that are designed with haptics that take advantage of the ciliary muscles contractions. The haptics in accommodating lenses keep the lens securely in place and prevent any rotational movement, but are flexible in a way that allows the lens to move slightly forward upon contraction of the ciliary muscle. So it's not quite like our natural lenses where they are shaped into a different form by the contractions, but instead physically move forward to change focus.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to wear them for about 4 years when I was a teenager. I HATED those things. Had to wear them when I went to bed, and took them out in the morning.</p>
<p>I used a tiny suction cup that looked like a micropenis dildo to pop them off of my eye when I woke up.</p>
<p>Some mornings I would be suctioning my eye half asleep, only to find that the lens had snuck up to the top of my eyeball. I would have to 'pull' it down in order to get it out. I scratched my eyeball more than once doing that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ditto (and, when I got my PMD diagnosis, the doctor was actually kind of excited. It was so weird), but I couldn't handle the contacts at <em>all</em>.</p>
<p>I got cross-linking in the clinical trial in 2012. Both eyes stopped progressing. I can get to 20/20 in my right, 20/25-ish in my left with regular lenses, which I'm calling good enough. I miss not having smeared lights at night, though. Hard lenses just never stopped feeling like sand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be attributed to a few different things.  People who report seeing “static” in their visual field are recommended to have a visual field test done by an optometrist.  This is usually a 15- to 30-minute test that attempts to identify any areas of your central and peripheral vision that may be degrading.  If visual field loss is detected, a fundus exam (where the eye doctor shines a bright slit lamp onto your retina and inspects it) is needed to try to identify what’s going on.  It can be anything from an occluded vein in your retina, a retinal or vitreal detachment, macular degeneration, an ocular migraine, etc.</p></div>		</li>
