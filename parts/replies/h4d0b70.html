			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a butcher and I disagree with that part as well. Dry aging in a climate controlled walk-in is one thing, meat that has been cut and wrapped and sat on a shelf for too long is a different thing. That steak could have sat in someone's shopping cart for an hour before they decided not to buy it and left it in the potato chip aisle, then it was picked up by a courtesy clerk who probably barely felt it and decided it's still cold enough to sell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to safety concerns, supermarkets toss all perishables that have been in a cart, there’s no way of knowing how long it’s been out of temp and they aren’t worried about a $15 cut of meat when millions are on the line.</p>
<p>I saw a post a few weeks back where a power outage caused a supermarket cooler to go out of temp for about 20-30 minutes, they threw out thousands of dollars of cheese and meat, even though they were likely fine, corporations don’t like dealing with uncertainty</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think controlled aging works because once the outer layer begins to dry out it preserves the meat beneath. What you called the pellicle is retardant to rotting, as is keeping the lower temperature.   However the grayish meat at the grocery does not have that coating and the more exposed the surfaces are the more quickly rot takes and ruins the meat. It's not the appearance, it's the smell. That gray meat has an unmistakable odor that is extremely unappetizing.   Steer clear of gray grocery meat. It's a few days away from maggot food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The initial aging period has to do with rigor mortis. If you butcher and eat the meat before rigor mortis sets in then it'll be fine. Once rigor mortis happens, you have to let the meat set until the proteins responsible for it degrade enough for the muscle to relax, which usually takes 1-3 days.</p>
<p>Any aging beyond that point is just allowing extra softening and changes in flavor due to breakdown of proteins in the muscle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have no issues eating meat (although I would switch to artificial versions if convincing versions are created). Was ok with the natural &quot;rot process&quot; being talked about. All fine. </p>
<p>Somehow, my brain draws the line at &quot;rigor mortis&quot;. I'm currently disgusted and I'll have lunch soon. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't agree with the greenish-gray comment but the key point is that this is raw meat.  This is the dry aging process that allows the enzymes in the meat to begin to breakdown the tissues.  This tenderizes the meat while creating new flavor compounds.  The meat will get dehydrated to an extent which further concentrates flavor and alters texture.</p>
<p>A 30 day dry age will form a type of crust from overly dried meat/fat and potentially mold.  Depending on the mold this might be fine; white molds are usually acceptable where black molds are not.  A properly chilled, humidity controlled, and ventilated container will make the dry aging pretty easy and low risk.  Too much humidity or temperature and the meat can spoil quickly;  same with low ventilation.  The crust is removed and might be used in things that I haven't heard of but often discarded.  The meat after is a dark red that just looks like a richer cut than you started with.  Photo below shows trimming a rib roast after dry aging.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's lots of good stuff in what the top comment wrote, but he completely lost me when he said &quot;green&quot;.  Green indicates significant bacterial contamination and is likely enough to be completely unsafe to eat.  Grey or brown discoloration on red meat often has more to do with oxidization of the exterior and isn't caused by bacterial contamination at all.  Another aging that is often what you see in restaurants is 'dry aged&quot; which refers to a secondary controlled aging that dry's out the meat from the exterior and concentrate the flavor.  This can be safe but again needs the correct environment in terms of humidity/moisture and temperature.  You can definitely screw it up when trying to do it in a home fridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former cutter here, we clean shit like crazy. It's basic protocol to assume the consumer you're selling to/writing recipes for is preparing in the worst possible environment, with minimal air quality control and contaminated surfaces. Ground beef &quot;ages&quot;(oxidizes) faster than cuts due to extra air in the beef itself, and doesn't necessarily mean the meat has turned. That being said, because of the extra surface area in the ground beef, it is more likely to become contaminated more quickly than cuts. That combined with industry assumptions about consumers leads to warning labels and general rules about safe handling protocol. On a similar note, and not applying to the US and places with e. coli outbreak problems, unwashed eggs have a shelf life of about four months. The US meat and dairy industries need an overhaul to reach cleanliness levels reached in many european countries where raw ground meat dishes are widely consumed. You're totally right about it being mostly about temp control and possible contamination. There was another Tyson recall a couple days ago, i hope you and whoever else reads this is staying safe from the industry.</p></div>		</li>
