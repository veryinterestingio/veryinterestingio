			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. The color wheel and spectrum are both incomplete ways to discuss color <em>space</em>.</p>
<p>It's 3D and there are way too many ways to treat it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colour space is much more than three-dimensional.  We describe it as such only because our eyes can sense three bands.  Human vision covers the spectrum from something like 380&#8239;nm to 740&#8239;nm.  You could measure the light intensity of the wavelengths at 10&#8239;nm intervals, giving you 37-dimensional colour, and that still wouldn't be all the information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's arguable. I remember trying to synthesize a bunch of Wikipedia articles into something here and giving up.</p>
<p>However, I think at that point it's not so much color as doing a spectrum and power analysis of EM radiation.</p>
<p>My takeaway from that rabbit hole was that color is a human perceptual emergent property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't make sense. Human color perception is a function of the activity of 3 types of cones. Any color stimulus can be defined as a point in 3D space where the axes are, say, average firing rate of each cone type.</p>
<p>Or are you just saying that any color stimulus can be characterized using a chart of wavelength v power? Because that's true -- it just gets transformed at the retina.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey now, some of us with dueteronopia have no real problem seeing all the way out to ~800 nm. </p>
<p>Granted, it is bright as hell, but I only lost vision on my Ti Saph when I tuned it above 800. 780 was freaking bright as fuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, there are other color spaces according to CIE.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space</a></p>
<p>Just off the top of my head, Lab, HSV, CMYK, RGB. They don't all cover the same thing.</p>
<p>As someone else argued, it could be more. Either way, color is a very human-centric concept.</p></div>		</li>
