			<div class="markdown"><p>I have astigmatism, and, to counteract the misshapen cornea, there is a tiny weight in toric lenses.</p>
<p>This does not prevent them from sometimes dislodging and being irritating for hours on end, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My god, is that the reason why, when I pinch closed my eyelids too hard, only the toric lens comes loose?  I never made the connection...
I hate my left eye for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the weight is actually to orient the lens. Without an astigmatism correction, you could rotate the lens and it would still work the same. With the astigmatism correction, it needs to have a specific rotation to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The weight is to keep the lens sitting correctly on the cornea. If I rotate my lenses on top of my eyeball, my vision will obscure because the lens is no longer oriented correctly. This has happened several times and is typically what inspires me to suddenly inquire about Lasik.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree,  I have a slight astigmatism and I asked the eye doctor about it.   lenses can distort based on rotation since your lens is no longer exactly round.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I, too, have the football-shaped-eyeball and on mine there are two very, very small 'lines' near the outer rim of the lens. I asked the doc, and they allow the lens to ever-so-slightly flex in those locations, letting it closer match the shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, once the lenses is placed more less on the cornea it places itself in the right spot, sometimes I have to massage a little with the eye closed to assure full contact. As the cornea bulges out the lenses always stick in place, if I move it, it return to its place.</p>
<p>Having astigmatism is a bit of PITA cause I have to take special careful when putting them to be the alignment marks almost as vertical as possible. Maybe cause it is cause daily ones instead of those tailored perfectly for me, but I donâ€™t like lenses, only use them on few occasions where glasses are an nuisance (archery or with the reflex camera).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use daily torics, but never bother to align them when putting them in.  I just insert and blink a few times, and the lenses seat themselves. Dailies was the best decision I ever made.  I don't actually wear them daily, I'm just a desk jockey so glasses are fine, but putting in a fresh pair each time I do feels amazing.</p></div>		</li>
