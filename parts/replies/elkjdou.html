			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if it's just you -- I've heard similar sentiments expressed among European colleagues -- but personally this is one of the reasons I love the US and prefer it over Europe (I've lived in both places). People are just friendlier and more helpful in general in the US. Restaurant service is way better in the US than in France, from my experience. People try to sell you stuff all the time and sometimes they even try to swindle you with &quot;great deals&quot;. Business moves at a fast pace and there is generally way less unnecessary bureaucracy (at least as compared to France -- and if my colleagues are to be trusted it's just as bad in Germany). It has almost become a stereotype that American DMVs (motor vehicle departments, generally the responsibility of the local/state government) are slow and painful to visit... from my experience even they are more efficient than their French counterparts. And everyone really takes their jobs very seriously.</p>
<p>The best way I can explain it is that I there just seems to be a general optimism in the air. Perhaps that is just naive -- perhaps cynicism would be more justifiable in many cases -- and perhaps some of it is fake, but it does tend to perk you up! I do think that a sizeable fraction of the smiles are genuine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this shows the challenge to service workers - customers vary in their expectations and desire for &quot;service with a smile&quot;! Some have called the US the Mickey Mouse culture because of that enforced friendliness to strangers in service.  But as you note, those smiles can be contagious to customers, especially if it seems genuine and not forced or faked.   And yes, those smiles can be genuine when employees are selected and trained well, and treated well by their management, coworkers AND customers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question - it depends what you mean by &quot;work&quot;!  There is evidence that smiling induces more positive moods and performance evaluations (and tips) in customers, particularly if it appears genuine (deep acting).  But there is little evidence that it induces return business or more sales.<br />
I know what you mean about cross-national differences - and I've conducted research in different nations (specifically, Israel, Singapore, France, and US).  We find these &quot;service with a smile&quot; expectations with customers are pretty generally held, with France being slightly more likely to permit showing negative emotions, and French employees seeing surface acting as more of a choice and thus not as distressing.  I haven't done research in Russia or Germany, but I'm aware that emotional norms are quite different there, but when they are expected to interact with American customers they are supposed to &quot;turn on&quot; that smile, which may be more problematic given it is distinct from their socialization norms as a culture.<br />
