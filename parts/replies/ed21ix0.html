			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good answer and very true, but it is also important to note that you are made up of a lot of different types of cells, and not all of them respond exactly the same to different environmental conditions.  We are no-where near the technology to be able to 'freeze' different cells at different levels/paces.</p>
<p>Just to illustrate the difference in cells: You've heard of the &quot;Walking Ghost&quot; phase of radiation poisoning? (The point where someone feels fine after receiving a large/lethal dose of radiation, for a period of time after being exposed). That is because a lot of cells are hardy enough to withstand quite a bit of radiation, but certain ones (the rapidly dividing ones) generally die.  In several cases, the are the 'factories' that produce replacement cells, so you can keep going on the cells currently in circulation, but once they die out you have no replacements. </p>
<p>Now can you imagine trying to target 'rapidly reproducing cells' for a different course of freezing than the rest of the body? This is bone marrow, the lining of your intestine. </p>
<p>tl;dr: It isn't only that you may lose half the cells that will kill ya, but that the half you lose might be concentrated on certain types of cells that you <em>really</em> need to live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At that point aren't you better off just preserving  the CNS and growing a new body to put it in? </p>
<p>What they already have to do to cryogenicly store a body is crazy intrusive, and they are nowhere near a reversible process (just the problems with ice &amp; freezing evenly are massive). Somehow simutaniously freezing different parts differently? Seems pretty out there.</p>
<p>It may not even be possible to say, use different processes for the different layers of skin, or for marrow/bone/blood. So baring some crazy nanotech that does things on a cell-by-cell basis, you gotta find a process that somehow works for everything....</p></div>		</li>
