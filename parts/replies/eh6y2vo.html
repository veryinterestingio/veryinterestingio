			<div class="markdown"><p>It certainly depends on the game. Some games (presumeably cutting-edge or indie games) are still gonna be more or less ground up, but other games might be made using a framework/GUI built to help developers do all their work without any real coding whatsoever.
This is mostly speculation, as I’m not a game dev, but games like Minecraft are certainly ground-up, whereas others built on engines (like Skyrim/Fallout) would not be</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not what I meant. I meant ground-up as in starting without an established physics engine, i.e. opening a new text file and writing. Working with basic libraries is different than starting with Unreal Engine 4</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you state what you say is speculation, why do you state it as a fact? You might be spreading misinformation. I’m always curious why we tend to use language that conveys our opinions as fact, unintentionally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a game dev, but I’m a programmer and have some background knowledge. Not totally in the dark here. I’ve even made some game-related programs. I don’t, however, know much about what goes on in the studios of Bethesda, EA, Activision, etc. where it’s likely that they have enough infrastructure to build a game without much low-level coding</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct in principle, and it will vary widely from project to project, but I would be surprised to see any medium or large scale production have as little as 20% proprietary code. 70-80% seems more realistic. (Source: SWE for the last 20 yrs) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way less. The dependent libraries are massive, and most of the time we only need 1 or 2 things from them. </p>
<p>Take a look at Star Ruler 2 on GitHub. It uses it's own engine and is VERY tiny, if you exclude libraries.</p></div>		</li>
