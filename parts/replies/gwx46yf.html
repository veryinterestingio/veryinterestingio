			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an old wives tale that to test for a two-way mirror, touch it. If there's a gap, it's a real mirror. If your finger and its reflection touch, it's possibly a two-way mirror.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that just depends on which side the silver is on</p>
<p>&quot;two way&quot; mirrors are pretty easy to spot heuristically, and you can check just going right up against it and looking into it with your hands (or whatever you can use) blocking out the light in your room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tbh, if you aren't spotting your mirrors heuristically, just what the fuck are you doing with your life?! </p>
<p>the people say i'm a heuristic-aholic, one guy even asked me to stop, and i said no. those mirrors aren't going to heuristics themselves! </p>
<p>i doubt most people even know what that means, let alone how to heuristically spot a mirror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a one-way test (pun not intended). If you have a gap, then it can't be a two-way mirror, because a two-way mirror requires the reflective surface to be on the lit/mirror side.</p>
<p>However, the reverse isn't true...if there is no gap it *could* be a two-way mirror, but it might not be. </p>
<p>A company that makes these for a living has a handy guide to testing them: </p>

<p>Does this mean if you put glass flat against the reflective side of a 1-way mirror, you can turn it into a 2-way mirror? Because otherwise we've learned nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that makes sense, although the two way mirrors I've seen are pretty obvious. Also if you cup your hands around your face to block out room light you can usually see through them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Twice the thickness of the glass, yes. The reflective surface reflects the thickness of the glass, as well as the stain. What you see is: 1) real stain, 2) thickness of real glass, (here lies the reflective surface, but you dont see <em>it</em> you see what it reflects, which is...), 3) reflected glass thickness, 4) backside of the stain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When reflected of off a flat surface, the image of an object appears equidistant to the mirror as the object itself. So if you look in a mirror, your reflections will appear to be twice as far away from you as the mirror itself. Applying this to the stain, the distance from the stain to it's reflection will be twice the distance of the stain to the reflecting surface and that distance is just the thickness of the mirror so the distance from the stain to it's reflection would be twice the mirror's thickness.</p></div>		</li>
