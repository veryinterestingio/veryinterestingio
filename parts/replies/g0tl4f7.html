			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of immune responses. General and specific. Specific immune responses are the ones that are based on antigens where the body quickly recognizes a pathogen and attacks it before it can establish infection. General responses are those that don't require recognition of the pathogen such as swelling, fever, mucous secretion, coughing, sneezing, and certain immune reaponses. As I mentioned earlier children aren't as well versed in developing specific immune reaponses (most early immune responses are a direct result of antibodies and immune cells passed through the placenta or breast milk) this is why kids tend to have runny noses more often, their body is increasing mucus as a primary defense against potential pathogens. It also means that when they are infected their bodies tend to run more severe secondary responses, more fevers, aches, pains, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor, and this is based only on what my mother/grandmother have said; a fever is kinda your body pulling out all the stops, the nuclear option against a virus/bacterium. Whereas your immune system can fight an infection if it has intel on it. It gets this intel from previous infections. When you are older you have had a lot of infections previously so you don't have to resort to the nuclear option.</p>
<p>Please fact check, this is just what I was told growing up</p></div>		</li>
