			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer! Additional detail for clarification. Ticks overwinter in surface soil and the litter layer in forests. Consistent low temps lead to soil freezing that kills ticks. Same is true for other soil arthropod pests and soil-borne pathogens in all kinds of ecosystems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but ticks hitch rides a long way. You may kill all of the ones in your yard but a deer could carry them in from the woods and fields a mile away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an entomologist, just a soil ecologist, so take my answer with a grain of salt. I don’t think fleas have a seasonal life cycle and I don’t think they overwinter in soil. I think they overwinter on host species (other animals). Still affected by temperature, but their life strategy is to stay on something warm rather than burrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on your climate. In much of Canada truely cold temperatures preclude snowfall for instance. The coldest days are always exceptionally clear as the air is too cold to retain any significant moisture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lack of burning near our coastal ranch has the tick population out of control near us. The deer have so many on them that some are dying. I'm hoping Cal Fire does a controlled burn on our back 40 as they've talked about because it's a constant problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genuine question, does fire ecology have a significant effect on pest insect numbers? I'm partially interested for the sake of ecosystem health... </p>
<p>But, if i'm being honest, I mostly just want ticks, mozzies, &amp; wasps to die. If this &quot;extreme burnination&quot; technique is effective for wasps, I'm all for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually was given the idea generically by a landscaper who was advising on how to treat flower beds and last year’s dead plants.  He always said that his approach is to basically burn it all and dare it to grow back.  I am hopeful that this also would result in lots of tick and other arachnid deaths (live in western KY, home of the brown recluse).</p></div>		</li>
