			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a video once that did the math and basically proved if you start a successful one you can get quite wealthy, if you're tier 2 or 3 you can make a living, if you're 4 or 5 you can probably break even, everyone below that gets screwed.
If you think about 10,000ish people selling cookware, 1 is wealthy, about 30 are happy, about 700 are breaking even, and 9,000+ are losing money.</p></div>		</li>

<p>AND they are destroying relationships with their upline telling them to avoid anyone who doesn't support them. Join an MLM and become the person your friends and family actively avoid because they don't want to hear your stupid sales pitch again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds reasonable, but consider that many of those 9000 losers drop out and need to be replaced. Eventually far more than 90% of total participants will lose money. &quot;Churn&quot; is a huge issue even for those at the happy level. </p>
<p>One figure I saw <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_comments/trade-regulation-rule-disclosure-requirements-and-prohibitions-concerning-business-opportunities-ftc.r511993-00008%C2%A0/00008-57281.pdf" target="_blank">in this chapter of a book linked from ftc.gov</a> says 99.6% of MLM participants made zero profit or less during the year they were reviewed. Scroll down to p26 and the appendix for details/sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This. Their sales videos make it seem like you can make a killing by working hard and believing in yourself but the company HAS to know you are most likely going to lose every penny you put into it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick googling has <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-MLM-companies-legal-Shouldn%E2%80%99t-they-be-illegal-since-they%E2%80%99re-an-incarnation-of-the-pyramid-scheme" target="_blank">this answer</a> from Kasey Chang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To know why MLMs are legal, one must study what is a pyramid scheme, and what makes MLMs different from pyramid schemes, and that means going back to 1975, to a case called FTC vs. Koscot Interplanetary.</p>
<p>Koscot Interplanetary is a fancy name for a cosmetic company ran by &quot;Glenn Turner&quot;. You join the company by paying $2000, then you have to buy $5400 worth of cosmetics (supposedly for resale). However, you don't get paid for selling cosmetics. You get paid by recruiting others to also pay $2000+$5400 just like you did. The more you recruit, the better you got paid. FTC sued Koscot in 1976, calling it an &quot;entrepreneurial chain&quot;, and helped the court to formulate what became known as the Koscot Test</p>
<p>The Koscot test has four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) The participant makes a payment of money to the company;</li>
<li>2) In exchange of (1), the participant receives the right to sell a product (or service);</li>
<li>3) In exchange of (1), the participant receives compensation for recruiting others into the program;</li>
<li>4) The compensation (3) is unrelated to the sale of products (or services) (2) to the ultimate user.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, a pyramid scheme is basically a fraudulent business because it only pretends to sell things, but in reality is paying people for recruiting more people to pay into the business.</p>
<p>In 1979, FTC sued Amway, alleging Amway is a pyramid scheme based on the Koscot test as shown above. Amway fought back legally, claiming that it does NOT pay its affiliates for recruiting others into the network. It only pays on the SALES of recruited affiliates (some as commission to the person who recruited them for Amway, known as &quot;upline&quot;).</p>
<p>FTC, after prolonged argument with Amway, and after getting Amway to adopted a few new rules, conceded that the 3 new rules prove that Amway is NOT a pyramid scheme. The 3 rules became known as the Amway safeguard rules.</p>
<p>The Amway safeguard rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1) 10 retail customers required to get paid commission; if you don't sell to ten different people every month, you don't get paid multi-level commissions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2) 70% rule; you have to sell (or consume) at least 70% of what you ordered before you can order more</p>
</li>
<li>3) Buyback: guaranteed buyback of unused inventory for at least 90 days, for 90% of original price (i.e. no more than 10% restocking fee)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rule 1 is to enforce the existence of retail sales. While rule 2 and rule 3 are written to prevent &quot;inventory loading&quot; in which the uplink encourages downline to buy up inventory that the downline cannot possibly sell or consume, just so the upline can qualify for his/her commission.</p>
<p>Later cases such as Omnitrition, Burnlounge, and so on made minor clarifications (such as what is an &quot;ultimate user&quot;), but these are the big decisions. But the main point is MLM is legal, though CLOSELY RELATED to a pyramid scheme, with only minor differences.</p>
<p>Most MLMs then adopted Amway safeguard rules for themselves.</p>
<p>There are people out there, such as Robert Fitzpatrick, David Brear, and so on who believe that MLM <em>should</em> be illegal, and the differences between it and pyramid scheme is merely skin deep and the business model is fundamentally flawed and dangerous to participants. And they do have a bit of statistics to back them up, but there are also plenty of supporters of MLM that points to success of Amway, Nuskin, Herbalife, and other Fortune 500 companies that use the MLM model with success.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, MLM <em>is</em> legal, but it is in perpetual danger of slipping over the edge back into illegal if it cannot control its affiliates to do primarily retail instead of recruiting. And there are &quot;bad apples&quot; out there claiming to be MLM, but in reality is a pyramid scheme (barely disguised).</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that &quot;whether MLM is legal&quot; is completely separate from the question &quot;whether MLM is good for you&quot;.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you are saying is we can buy stock in amway as a group, driving the price up. Then we add new users and buy lots of stuff, then less than 90 days into the quarter ten thousands of us return the product and we dump the stock at the same time. Or a class action lawsuit on the 70%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the thorough answer! I never knew much about MLM’s, only that they are like pyramid schemes and seemed dodgy. I never really liked those type of companies and I’m glad I have a little bit more insight into how they work. I hope someone in political power finds the decency to stop these pyramid schemes because they only fuel poverty and cults imo.</p>
<p>Unrelated but r/antiMLM is a good subreddit to be on if you want to know what companies are MLM and they update it everyday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically a lot of them are pyramid scheme which are business models that are only successful by preying off their employees and constantly expanding, but thanks to the influence they wield in congress (see amway) they have managed to protect themselves from being classed that way.  </p>
<p>Look up the The Dream podcast for an interesting dig into the history and structure of MLMs, it was pretty fascinating how they have evolved, which ones are quasi legitimate businesses and which ones are straight up scams.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically by involving a product, they aren't a pyramid scheme.  </p>
<p>Unlike Social Security, which is the very definition of a pyramid scheme. But it's legal because the government can't be bothered to follow its own rules.</p></div>		</li>
