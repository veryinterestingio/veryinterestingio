			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question.  People are worried about COVID, get tested for COVID, come back negative, stay home until they feel better.  It may be somewhat artificial, but I bet there's some reduction because of the measures most of us have taken.</p>
<p>It is surprising to me to see such a reduction in influenza cases despite what seems like such a high number of COVID cases, and I think you're probably on to something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although many tests are for COVID only a large number of people in my small hospital are at least getting the multiplex Cepheid panel (we call it the FLUVID, but in addition to influenza A &amp; B, and SARS, it tests for RSV). There is also the massive Biofire multiplex panel which has dozens of viral targets including all mentioned with parainfluenzas, other Coronas, entero/rhino, and some fussy bacterial types like Bordetella and  Mycoplasma. The Biofire was in high use before this year and Cepheid was too, but it was just flu. </p>
<p>Anyway, my point is there are people who are getting panel testing from single specimens, and we have seen no flu. We have seen the occasional rhino/enterovirus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's surprising. Imagine if COVID-19 didn't exist, but one year we all decided to use masks at all times, close schools and most business places, stop traveling and cancelled most social gatherings, avoided public transportation and stood at our homes every day. Flu rates would drop massively.</p>
<p>I posted elsewhere in June that I expected flu rates to crater this season, and it's happening just as I expected, I would have been really surprised if it didn't.</p>
<p>What we really don't know is what will happen once the pandemic is gone. Will we see a rapid resurgence of the flu? Will it be even higher due to lack of vaccination and decreased immunity from past infections? Will it stay lower than usual due to the low starting numbers?</p>
<p>My bet is on a slow resurgence but with cases often being more serious due to fewer antibodies to recent strands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canad has been testing either above average, or at the top of the average range for for the 2020-2021 season, so it's not a lack of testing, and the percent positive is skating along 0%, vs 25% normally for this time of year</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Health departments are still doing influenza-like illness surveillance and there are dual covid/flu tests. There's no hiding flu in hospitals, nursing homes, and schools. We're not seeing flu because it is barely circulating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.  Pigs are often referred to as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702078/" target="_blank">&quot;mixing vessels&quot;</a>, which can be infected by variants that target both poultry and humans, resulting in reassortment of novel infectious strains.  While most of the evidence supports this, like most scientific matters there is still occasional debate on its importance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes and no-- pigs are often seen as a bridge between humans and birds. Bird flus typically can't jump straight into human without acquiring adaptive mutations in pigs or other animals. But when they do, they can be more deadly since human immune systems have never seen them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as others said, sort of. also there are hundreds of thousands viruses out there in animal that could be much more virulent than covid, even john oliver had a piece on this a week ago</p></div>		</li>
