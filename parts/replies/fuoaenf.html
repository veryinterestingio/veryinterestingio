			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you are joking though as you age you can’t be as abusive towards it which means hydrating as you drink and eating food, not mixing alcohol, taking supplements before going to sleep and the next day and so on. These are things you should do as a young person consuming alcohol but you can get away without doing it so. As you age your liver is older and is not as agile to be as forgiving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh for sure! Personally I'm trying this new kick of moderation, which has just manifested in not drinking at all (I actually suck moderation)</p>
<p>I drank far too much far too often for far too long and the tradeoff just isn't worth it anymore. </p>
<p>That being said, if I manage to get ahold of a young healthy liver I'll let you all know how it works!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Liver cloning is a very active topic of research. The current challenge, as I understand it, is the structure, but it may be possible in a few years, and quite probably in a decade, to get a completely new liver, grown from your own cells to avoid rejection risks.</p></div>		</li>
