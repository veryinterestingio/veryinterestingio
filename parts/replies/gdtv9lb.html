			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's fair actually. I'm an engineer by training (with a physics minor) so it's not something I ever really must account for or deal with, but it's fair to say that diamagnetism is no less important than any work I do, it's just an effect that is extremely isolated from any work I do and fairly isolated from lot of other areas of physics research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesâ€™t exactly have to be a magnet field, but it is said a powerful enough negative current will enable the attraction of things like water molecules and dirt via pushing away electrons in water to get the positive parts left to attract to the negative charge.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I should explain one thing: the movement of an electric field and the existence of a magnetic field are mathematically identical concepts, just as the movement of a magnetic field is mathematically equivalent to an electric field.  This subtle interplay sometimes blurs the lines between a &quot;current&quot; and a &quot;magnetic field&quot; as often they can be used interchangably in language (even if they imply different sources of the effect)</p>
<p>Now what you're describing is likely electrostatics.  When you apply enough negative charge to an area, you can induce &quot;dipoles&quot; (where electron clouds are repelled slightly from the source or charge and nuclei are slightly attracted, or vice versa with positive).  For most materials the induced dipole will generate and attractive force because the positive nuclei are now closer to the negative source than the electron cloud. This isn't magnetism but is a very common effect that can cause mild sticking between materials (most often seen in rubbers, think balloons, or oils but sometimes also water if you have enough static charge built up)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if i could get a unbelievable amount of electricity, i could basically pull anything with it? </p>
<p>And if i wanted to push it, all i would have to do is put the negative charge in the thing i want to push and then have the negative charges repel eachother.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So your saying it is only possible to use negative/positive electrical current to push/pull materials with a flowing electrons?</p>
<p>So because something like wood wants to hold on tightly to its electrons, your saying no matter how powerful the negative electric field is, it will never be able to push the electrons away from wood?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in wood, if the electrons were pushed from their molecules this would actually permanently alter the chemical state of the wood (it would burn, and this can cause a really cool lightning burn pattern in the wood under the right conditions).  Applying magnetism does actually inducing a temporary current (and therefore magnetism) in virtually all materials due to lorenz forces but in wood (a very good insulator) this is generally a very weak effect in comparison to electron spin alignments in the material (that cause diamagnetism).</p>
<p>Note: generally materials don't lose electrons when magnetic fields are applied: the electrons just form temporary spinning &quot;eddies&quot; of current that repel the applied magnetic field.  Under a massive, quickly applied magnetic field electrons could theorhetically be ripped from molecules of wood but again it would simply burn before forming a sustainable current (and you would no longer have wood).  The magnetic field required would also nneed to be relatively obscene to cause this (although I don't have exact numbers to give here)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You keep saying positive and negative electric current.  What do you mean by that?  Normal electricity comes from the electron.  It is either there or not.  And no matter what direction it goes it makes the same forces.</p></div>		</li>
