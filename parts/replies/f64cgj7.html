			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren’t ragas a lot more than scales though ?
If I’m not mistaken a raga is a combination of a scale, a time signature, and a set of rules about how certain notes should be played, rhythm patterns, the “mood” of the piece, etc...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this really does help. I don't have the musical terminology needed to describe what I mean, but here's an example in this song: if you skip to 0:19 you'll hear this pitch he's singing in, which you just don't hear in non-Celtic western music. It feels almost strange, but also appealing, and I can hear this same kind of pitch in Arabic music:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3nXku80y2Y" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3nXku80y2Y</a></p>
<p>There's also another phenomenon I've noticed in both Arabic and Celtic singers, which is where they do this kind of 'warbling' thing, where their voice drops and rises very quickly again. In Arabic music this is pretty obvious, for an example in Celtic music, check out the chorus in this song (go to 0:52), you'll see the singer lets her voice drop then picks it back up quickly. Again, you don't hear this so much in other western music:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I could be misinterpreting what you're saying, but what I think you're hearing in the first example is this:</p>
<p>If you're used to listening to western classical and pop music, you're used to hearing tunes that are either in major or minor keys.  And up until 0:19, all the notes the vocalist has sung have been notes in D minor.</p>
<p>But the song isn't in D minor, it's in D dorian.  Dorian is a mode--a type of scale--very similar to minor. Except in dorian the sixth degree of the scale is a half step higher than in minor--in this case, dorian has a B natural where minor would have a B flat.</p>
<p>You hear that B natural for the first time on the word &quot;corn,&quot; and it throws off your expectations.  It makes the line sound less classical and more folky, more bright and exotic than what you were expecting.</p>
<p>But it's still a normal note in the western tuning system.  You can still write it on a staff using standard notation and play it on a piano.  That's not the case with most of the notes in an Arabic maqam--they're out-of-tune (by western standards) quarter tones that can't be written on a staff without writing things like &quot;+12 cents&quot; above the staff.  You can't play those notes on a piano.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Also agree with what /u/CaptainAndy27 said.  You're also used to hearing dominant (V) chords in classical and pop music.  Even in minor keys, composers and songwriters usually borrow from the major to create or imply V chords, but there aren't any here.  This adds to the more-folky-less-classical sound you're hearing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Also with the d minor to C major shifts it creates an open parallel fifth a harmonic incident in which two notes a fifth apart with no mediant notes (d and a in the d minor chord) move the same distance at the same time in the same direction, in this case down a second to C and G, and then right back up to D and A. While there may not be any instruments in this song that literally play that drone that parallel motion can be felt. That kind of tonality was common in medieval plainchant, but became a musical fauxpas during the renaissance for western composers. That trend in thinking did not stick with the folk musicians particularly in the British Isles who continued to write music without any concern for western sensibilities of voice leading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all maqamat use microtones!  In fact, there is a maqam that is the same as major, and some that are natural and harmonic minor, and those are pretty common.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Arabic music was using major and minor before European music was.  Medieval European music relied primarily on the other modes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple things I'm picking up. One is that the harmony in Rocky Road to Dublin is a bit non-typical of Western classical music. In most Western music we put most of our harmonic tension between the IV chord or V chord and the I chord. Meaning if we are using a C major scale as our basis for our song (CDEFGABC) we would use the chords for the fourth and fifth notes (F and G) to bring tension and resolve to the root chord (C). In this song however, most of the tension and resolution comes from the C major chord going to the d minor chord. The song itself is in d minor (D E F G A Bb C) so the two chords we are talking about are the i chord (d minor) and the VII chord (C major). Most western music in d minor would raise the C to C# to create a major V chord (A major chord) to create tension, but this song uses the VII chord, which isn't used very often in western music.</p>
<p>As for the singing that you mentioned. You are right. Both celtic singers and arabic singers tend to use a lot of vocal movement in their singing. Those quick rises and falls would be called ornaments in western music. Things that a singer can add to the music to show off their singing ability. I'm not sure of the history of that style of singing and whether it would have been connected between the two cultures at some point. Probably not because I don't think the celts would have ever come into contact with any arabic peoples. The closest I could imagine that happening would be with the Spanish Moors but I think they invaded well after the celts had been pushed out of spain by the visigoths and romans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor historical note: it is speculated, with some credence, there was more Ireland/Hispania exchange than one would suspect. Sailing traders, and the Catholic connection post-Reformation, tends to fuel this thinking.</p>
<p>Which is to say: A slight infiltration of Andalusian musical influence into Irish folksong doesn't strike me as absurd on its face.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, as noted elsewhere, today when we say &quot;Celtic&quot; we generally mean Irish/Scottish...maybe sorta Welsh. But 2000 years ago the Celts were far more widespread, including in Iberia.</p></div>		</li>
