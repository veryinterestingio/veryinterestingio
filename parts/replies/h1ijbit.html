			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for taking the time to explain how massive the sun is.</p>
<p>I find that once students understand just how much more massive the sun is than everything else COMBINED, it clicks that so much stays in orbit around it.  The trick is getting that across.  As usual with space, scale is hard to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago, I was teaching a group of boy scouts about astronomy. There is a large sports complex in town and I ran some calculations to set the orbit of Pluto to the limits of the  complex (nearly a km if I recall) and scaled the planets accordingly. I had to use things like mustard and poppy seeds and peppercorns to represent the planets. Taking the time to &quot;walk&quot; the solar system  really drove home the scale of things. After we did this we went inside and uses a map to locate Alpha Centauri. It was a really fun demonstration to set up and helped me put things in perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t help when the globes you can get with a moon have the moon ridiculously close to the Earth.</p>
<p>Every model we try to make will either be massively out of scale or completely useful.</p>
<p>E.g. imagine a decent sized globe that’s 30 cm (1 foot) in diameter. The Moon would be 9 cm in diameter and placed 7.5 meters (25 feet) away.</p>
<p>If we want the entire thing to be a reasonable size (let’s say 1 meter or 3 feet 3 inches), Earth would be a sphere that’s 4 cm in diameter and the moon would barely be more than 1 cm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are probably lots of videos like this, but I show this one to the kids I have in class and it does a pretty good job of getting the distance scale into their heads in a way that's easy to visualize:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So true. Even knowing the facts and numbers it's still always hard to actually wrap your head around how large things in space are. Everything in our solar system seems so far spread out and huge, but then you think about other stars in our galaxy, then you think about our galaxy as a whole, then other galaxies, and it's both fascinating, but also seems impossible to truly grasp beyond just the numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What made that vastness finally click for me was the idea that you can supposedly <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/115672/you-could-fit-all-the-planets-between-the-earth-and-the-moon/" target="_blank">fit all the other planets in between</a>. Depending on which measurements you use it may or may not be true, but it still gives a good idea what orders of magnitude we're talking about.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Those two things aren't quite equivalent thanks to expansion. Signals can still reach something which is receeding faster than the speed of light. I think the actual limit is a small multiplier of c, something like 1.5-3. The trick is that your signal will be heading into expanding space so eventually it will be travelling faster than the speed of light relative to you as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this isn't a question, but it made me itchy in exactly the way that compels me to respond because I worry someone will read it and think the sun's gravity 'blinks on' when the sun forms. In reality, a distant object (far from the solar system, perhaps in the Andromeda galaxy for example) feels the gravity of the matter that will become the sun whether or not it's in a tight little ball or spread out. The force experienced by distant bodies changes continuously as the gas moves continuously as the matter that is not yet part of the star assembles to become the star. In a sense, the gravity from that matter always 'on' and present, it's just a changing distribution of matter makes for a changing experience of gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'd theoretically be a bit more than that as what's currently 4.5 billion light years away was closer when the sun was formed (due to the expansion of the universe). I don't know what that distance would be though, probably not significantly more than 4.5 billion light years (perhaps 5-6 billion light years as we'd currently observe the universe I'd guess).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The matter that forms the sun ignited 4.5billion years ago, however that matter was already there.</p>
<p>So that condensing ball of matter has been gravitationally influencing every other bit of matter since it formed after the big bang.</p>
<p>Unless you're a creationist, in which case the gravity from the sun may only be affecting things up to some 6000 light years from here...</p></div>		</li>
