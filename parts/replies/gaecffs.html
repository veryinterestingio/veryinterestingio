<p>There's also evidence that accessing a memory destroys or damages it, and it must be re-written.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember hearing an interview with a neurobiologist about this, and one question was: &quot;When we remember something, how likely is it that it's different than the actual event?&quot; and she answered &quot;100%&quot;.</p>
<p>Not that 100% of the memory is inaccurate, but that every memory has at least <em>some</em> inaccuracies. We can never remember anything perfectly (and the imperfections are always changing). </p>
<p>Fascinating stuff!</p>
<p>But back to my initial question: what actually happens to the electric signal of a thought that you don't retain? Does it just... disappear?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a crazy stat about your brain, which is you consciously only process around 0.001% of all info. Since your brain is constantly working from past info, it has to use that to predict the future. So stable things, e.g. lampposts, aren't processed in the same way as e.g. a ball is. But even then you can change things in an image without people realising, as the brain sees the new image and goes &quot;yeah, looks about right&quot;, so you don't process the changes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is probably way less than .001% considering the vast amount of quantum state information you are receiving, even ignoring all other input than light that you see,  from each individual photon that interacts with your eye. There is just so much information that constantly interacts with our bodies that it is absolutely incomprehensible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Always be weary of numbers like these. These often come from making assumptions thay are obviously wrong on quantities that cannot bye easily measured. In this case,  &quot;total information&quot; is such a nebulous, un- measured but assumed quantity. </p>
<p>Similar statements include the famous 10% usage claim, which is downright ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not specifically accurate though, otherwise you'd be able to remember what was happening when you last remembered that memory. What does happen is something called retroactive interference, where your current emotional state blends with the memory being accessed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder if this is why MDMA is so effective in treating PTSD. You remember the trauma while rolling, so the trauma memory is now also a memory of rolling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually how I know most of this stuff.  I read an article about using a memory-blocker to treat PTSD.  They'd give patients a substance that didn't stop them from accessing memories, but it inhibited the re-writing process. By having the patient remember the trauma repeatedly, the memory would get weaker and weaker, losing most of its emotional impact.</p></div>		</li>
