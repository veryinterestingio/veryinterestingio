			<div class="markdown"><p>A specialty running shop should be able to help you out, either by stocking/ordering a women's pair for you in the correct size or stocking/ordering a pair of men's shoes in width B (maybe widths are different in UK sizing but typically in American sizes a normal men's shoe is a D and a women's is a B.) Either way they should be able to help find something that works well for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to a proper running shop and they found me some that fit, there’s a lot less choice though! Although I ended up with Brooks which is a great brand and not too expensive so all good really</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the pain, the size that fits me (and my brick shaped feet) the best is an 11 EEE but that's pretty hard to find so sometimes I have to settle for something I don't like as much or a more standard 11.5 or 12.</p></div>		</li>
