			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify: the reason this pressure is needed is not similar to a chemical bomb. You want as much material as possible to get involved in the nuclear reaction, which means keeping it all in generally the same place. As an analogy, if you lit the corner of a piece of paper and immediately tore it in half, the other half of the paper wouldn't burn.</p>
<p>Without the tamper a lot of material simply gets blown away, instead of contributing to the detonation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example might be a steam boiler.  Heat up water and it evaporates.  Heat up water in an exposed space and it explodes.  </p>
<p>Maybe still similar with gunpowder, light I pound of it in a thin line and it will burn down the line.  Light a pound of it in a tube, and boom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those examples work for chemical explosions, not nuclear.</p>
<p>Nuclear detonation doesn't actually <em>need</em> confinement (whereas chemical explosions do), confinement in nuclear bombs merely decreases the amount of material required or increases efficiency.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core#Second_incident" target="_blank">If you put enough weapons-grade fissile material in one place, it will go boom, no matter what it is contained in.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And what's truly fascinating about this is we're talking thousandths of a second or less; just a speck of time to keep the bomb assembled to get a big enough explosion. </p>
<p>Another thing that sorta blew my layman's mind: when the primary detonates and the x-rays flood the bomb casing, the tamper ablates so violently that it's like a million rocket engines pointing inward; the acceleration of the tamper as it shrinks is kinda mind boggling (though no idea if I've phrased tat correctly!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want the best description in written literature of the process of a nuclear detonation, Tom Clancy's The Sum of All Fears (the three shakes chapter) has the best description of the sequence of a nuclear blast (a fizzle).  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then it becomes a better tamper. For the purposes of both containing the explosive force in order to make the explosion larger and to hold the fuel in close enough proximity to be used in the reaction. But now you also have to carry that extra weight on your plane. You already require as much mass of uranium as a football team (as far as I remember) for it to be fissile.</p></div>		</li>
