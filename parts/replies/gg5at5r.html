			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a balanced take. Thanks for posting. It gets tiring to see post after post of people saying &quot;greed, greed, greed&quot; with zero contemplation of how many people work for these companies. When Justin Trudeau was dealing with the SNC-Lavalin controversy here in Canada, he had to weigh the <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/5077066/snc-lavalin-ceo-job-losses/" target="_blank">cost of losing thousands of jobs</a>. I really wish all these black and white thinkers would stop being so loud.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was thinking of that too. Personally I'm pissed about what he did to do this. But like I get it. </p>
<p>It's a tightrope to walk and people will be reeeeing either way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was just gonna comment along these same lines. Very unbiased delivery of information. Easily could’ve taken either route and instead delivered both. </p>
<p>Now should the government take measures to protect both? Sure, and I wanna say at least in the U.S. it started off that way, difficult with lockdowns and safety precautions to save every business, and hopefully by the end of this, things can be done to at least relieve any financial burden this has put small business owners through. It’s an easy enough concept, delivery is probably a bit more complicated though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earnestly agree. </p>
<p>It’s fine to be liberal, but awfully disingenuous to apply your personal political leanings to something that begs for an objective answer. Sure, greed may be a factor, but pull your loathing for big companies out of the equation and make an effort to understand their value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to look at the data behind the matter. Lobbying data is <a href="https://www.quiverquant.com/lobbyingsearch/" target="_blank">publicly available</a>, and you can look into which issues are getting influenced by corporate money.</p>
<p>If a company spends $5M lobbying some piece of legislation, it's probably with the knowledge that they can expect a return on that investment. And it's likely (but not certain) that that return will come at the expense of the rest of us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to understand that this system is just geared in such a way that big companies tend to get a high proportion of political attention and government resources. I bet if we took the time we could make a pretty long list of &quot;rules&quot; in place in this system of ours that tends to produce the outcome OP is asking about. </p>
<p>It's a non-trivial constellation of rule structures and incentives. By &quot;rules&quot; I just mean any operating principle in place in our society -- so actual laws, but also guidelines, and social and psychological tendencies. So greed would be part of how I'm conceiving of &quot;rules&quot;, but also the pretty mundane observation that once a company reaches a certain size with a certain impact on the economy, it just attracts more attention than an isolated bakery on main street in some random town. There are &quot;rules&quot; we can and should eliminate or tweak, and others that in are place should probably stay in place because any practical alternative would be worse, and there are probably lots of new rules we should put in place. It's a complicated, dynamic, evolving system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Often politicians are smart people that don't keep the large sum of money they make in a bank account. They invest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would also add that a lot of middle class people, particularly older ones who vote, also have money in the stock market, as do banks and many state agencies.  If your net worth is more than the dollars in your pocket, there is a good chance that money is sitting in the stock market or housing market, so it's not crazy to want to keep those markets healthy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>. Along the good reasons, big companies participate more in the overall economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this true?<br />
For Germany at least I think combined the small and middle companies are doing way more business than the big ones.  </p>
<p>So if you save one big company but 100 small ones go bankrupt  this may be a bigger dent into the overall economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might be different depending on the different countries. I can't vouch for Germany, and to be honest, I would even struggle to provide meaningful data, as the subject is quite large and I don't know if we can actually see how many people work for large and or small companies.</p>
<p>It wouldn't help that the definition of a small or large company differ.</p>
<p>That being said, as I personnaly believe shomething SHOULD be done about the supremacy of big companies, I hope you are right and there are a lot of small companies in Germany (and that they survive). Maybe this practice will bleed here in Belgium as well ;-)</p></div>		</li>
