			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding onto this comment, since it's not a true 'answer', but something with which I hope to provide you (OP) a bit of further insight into the strange curiosity of numbers:</p>
<p>There are exactly as many even numbers as there are natural numbers. Strange, you might say - 1 is not an even number, but it is a natural number - surely there must then be less even numbers than natural numbers?  </p>
<p>But no. That's where it gets interesting. How do we prove that there are the same amount of two things? By pairing them up - if I have apples, and you have pears, we have the same amount if we can put one of your pears next to each of my apples and have 0 left over.  </p>
<p>So apply this to our numbers. I put 0 next to 0 - awesome. I put 1 next to 2. I put 2 next to 4, 3 next to 6, and so on and so on. For every natural number k, I have a single paired even number - 2k. Meanwhile, every even number n must by definition be two times some specific natural number, n = 2*k, which is its pairing.<br />
So we've made a one-to-one pairing between the natural numbers and the even numbers - there are just as many even numbers as there are natural numbers, despite being able to provide an infinite amount of natural numbers that aren't even.  </p>
<p>That's pretty cool when you think about it, isn't it?</p>
<p>In a very similar vein I could prove to you that there are just as many real numbers between 0 and 1 as between 0 and 2, and there are just as many points on a circle with radius 1 as on one with radius 2, despite the latter having a different circumference.</p>
<p>Edit: Small mistake in my wording</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see your point, but why is it that we can't say the set of all integers is a subset of the set of all rationals, but there are elements of the rationals that are not elements of the integers? Wouldn't that imply that their infinities are of different class?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it just weirdly formatted or did you mean to say that -1 is a natural number?
Also you are comparing even numbers to natural numbers, but you are forgetting that -2, -4 are even numbers, too.
To say that for every even number exist an natural number you would have to put it 1 to -2, 2 to 2, 3 to -4, 4 to 4. You would have to put an odd natural number for the negative even numbers, and even natural number to positive even numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>-1 is technically an integer and not a natural number, but your logic here is also the proof that the cardinality of the natural numbers is the same as that of the integers - or you could also say the integers are &quot;countably infinite&quot;. You're describing a way of counting them, where no matter what integer I give you you'll count to it eventually. The real numbers OTOH can't be counted. No matter how clever you are I'll be able to give you a number that you'll never count to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add this, the reason it may seem paradoxical is the idea of a total. There is no total.</p>
<p>When you assume a thing that is untrue (such as existence of a total), you get what is called a vacuous truth whereby every possible statement can logically follow. You just stumbled upon one and as this commenter points outs, there are others.</p></div>		</li>
