That's what led me to ask the question. Even by trial and error, it seems improbable that they would all come up with such a specific solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans have an instinct for learning language.</p>
<p>At the age of 2 years old, humans can learn 2 words an hour, with significant nuance and complexity, from just a single exposure to that word.</p>
<p>We do not receive nearly enough positive/negative feedback to acquire language purely from external learning (grammar in school is not fluency). There is a deep instinct there upon which the environment stimulates just enough to activate.</p>
<p>Nest building could be similar. But since these are not consciousness processes (like active learning), they are hard to understand consciously.</p></div>		</li>

I say programmed as 'instinct' to me more implies basic drives.</p></div>		</li>

Only birds that have genetic tendencies to express weaving behaviour have procreated successfully, and then there's learning, trial and error and experience on top of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends. I know nothing about the birds but there are things to consider what would Influence that </p>
<p>-is the nest acting as a display for females? If yes, then it could result in improvements over time. It also depends if females preferences change.</p>
<p>-does increased complexity/quality of the nest raise fitness of the individual. If yes, then it will improve over time until it reaches a point where a better nest doesn't increase the chances of survival.</p>
<p>-is complexity or quality of the nest limited by the bird itself? Is the intelligence of the bird too low to improve the nest, does the bird lack the necessary organs or appendages needed to improve the nest? If the limiting factor on nest complexity is the bird itself, and the nest doesn't impact survival past a certain point of complexity it is unlikely the nest actually <em>improves</em> as opposed to just changing.</p>
<p>Basically think about what is influencing the nest. It is also useful if there is any historical or fossils of the nests changing over time. We can see if it is random chance that the nest winds up complex due to evolution, or if there are trends.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a sad mental image of some top-skilled bird-dude making this intricate, well-engineered nest, but (oh no!) that particular style went out of fashion like two years ago and all the other birds are snickering behind his back because he looks like he's wearing JNCO jeans in 2018.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of birds maintain family relationships through multiple generations… the year-olds help care for the next spring’s babies, etc. and only mate themselves after a few years, so in those cases they’d have plenty of time to observe and learn.</p></div>		</li>
