			<div class="markdown"><p>People not washing their hands after using the restroom is a very easy way to spread something like that. It only takes a microscopic amount and a small amount of contact from kids playing or someone preparing food can spread it to many people very quickly, especially if it's asymptomatic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polio is also interesting because symptomatic (and severe) cases became more common when sanitation improved. </p>
<p>Polio has been endemic in much of the old world, going back millennia. Cases spiked in the 20th century because improved sewage networks, normalized handwashing, and related changes meant that people were no longer constantly exposed from baby-hood onwards. That's when children started to get severely sick after being exposed. </p>
<p>The fact that polio was initially perceived as a disease affecting middle- and upper-class children in rich countries also led to much of the investment in and public support for the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
