</blockquote>
<p>Or you know, just pull them up like you initially suggested.</p>
<p>Prime pollinators (like bee's) are on the verge of complete population collapse in nearly every ecosystem globally. Herbicides are one of the main culprits.</p>
<p>Better yet, focus on garden maintenance that prevents the weeds in the first instance. Some might sneak through anyway, so pull away. But there's no need for herbicides in the garden bed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We found a weed at the side of the office and every day I would spray it with the herbicide, but also give it tons of water to feed its accelerated growth. I got it to 5ft tall within a week or two</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, apparently clover (a dicot) used to be a very common lawn plant, along with the grasses we see today. It was much healthier for local invertebrate communities, both in the air and in the soil, and was much easier to spread and grow on your own . When weed-killers were first developed, Monsanto and others couldn’t find a way to kill other weeds while keeping clover alive, so there was a secret campaign to completely turn public opinion the other way and declare it a weed. That’s why the types of plants used for lawns are so limited to monocots. Since this happened, suburbs have seen a complete collapse in healthy soil ecology systems, that has cascaded upwards and led to low biodiversity in undeveloped areas adjacent to suburbs. This is also partially the reason why grains like amaranth and quinoa are not grown and developed in the USA, even though they are relatively healthier and easier to grow compared to wheat and corn. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some corrections.</p>
<p>The PR campaign against lawn clover was led by Scott's, not Monsanto (they didn't even exist when that campaign launched in the fifties). Lawns are no limited to monocots, they are limited to grass - monocots are a large family that include many plants considered weeds in a lawn. Suburbs have low biodiversity and poor soil health because a) construction companies used crappy fill because it's cheap, b) people take leaves and remove thatch, interrupting the ecological cycles because they don't want the mold, fungus, and insect pest that accompany what many consider a poor aesthetic, and c) people often plant non-native plants which do not support local flora and fauna.  Amaranth and quinoa ARE grown in the US and Canada, but the market demand is vastly larger for corn and wheat, so more people grow those crops.</p>
<p>Fun fact: did you know that corn is one of the healthiest crops in the world..... For your soil health? The amount of organic matter it adds to soil is quite high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing all that organic matter that corn adds to the soil it gains from the air?
So, why is corn so &quot;selfless&quot;, and I'm guessing other plants more &quot;selfish&quot; in this manner?</p></div>		</li>
