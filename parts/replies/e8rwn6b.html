			<div class="markdown"><p>If it helps, we do have the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite up right now as well. To a first order, it's sort of like Kepler over the whole sky (but only for 30 days at a time). It'll be nice for JWST to actually, you know, make it up there, but there's still space-based work going on.</p>
<p>Fun side thing I heard about, on one of the data releases, there was a challenge to see who could find the first planet. I believe that the winner sent back the first discovered planet in the data set later the same business day. They won a t-shirt and bragging rights, but was also a really neat demonstration of how the frameworks to search for planets had become optimized to carry out these searches quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there is still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsPStvGgNuk" target="_blank">TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite)</a> that launched this year and will be surveying many times more stars than Kepler ever did! So you have something to tide you over until James Webb launches (if it ever does...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>James Webb is more of a successor to Hubble than to Kepler, is it not? We have other telescopes (Some in space, some on the ground) for finding exoplanets. TESS and Gaia are still going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WFiRST is the closest successor to hubble. TESS is the closest successor to Kepler (also doing exoplanet studies with transit methods). Gaia is quite different from Kepler in its science goals and is largely used for precision astrometry (measuring positions of stars and galaxies) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>JWST is meant to be the successor to Hubble. WFIRST isn't going to be the high res images that Hubble provides so much.</p>
<p>And there's some planet work that can be done with Gaia, as astrometry can be used to find planets.</p></div>		</li>
