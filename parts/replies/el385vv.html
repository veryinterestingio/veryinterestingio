<p>It doesn't. It causes the energy of the electron to increase, which squishes the orbitals.</p>

<p>So in other words, we can indeed extend the periodic table - in theory - but it will lose much of its original purpose. As the patterns and periodicity die out, the next row will simply continue on past the noble gases and just extend off over to the right forever.</p>

<p>There have also been papers detailing how the periodic table may be extended, the most prominent of which is from Pekka Pyykkö, which extends it to element 172.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We're both right! The expression for the energy of an electron in a hydrogenic atom (which is trivially extended to all atoms with the idea of effective nuclear charge) is E = - m e⁴ Z²/(8ε²h²n²), which shows that the mass and energy both increase (in magnitude) when relativity gets involved and m = γm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not a useful expression. Mass exclusively refers to rest mass. &quot;Relativistic mass&quot; is an outdated concept that's more trouble than it's worth, and it is not Lorentz invariant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That equation is not relevant to super heavy atoms as it is a non relativistic expression. Such electrons are moving at very nearly the speed of light. In fact we don't have a closed form formula for the ground state of superheavies because the ground state is modified by the finite nuclear size.</p>
<p>For Z&lt;137, the expression is</p>
<ul>
<li>E = mc^(2)√(1-Z^(2)/137^(2))</li>
</ul>
<p>and for high Z, this is only an approximation. For more information on super heavy atom atomic structure, see here,</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You sound like you know what you’re talking about, so I have a question for you. We can’t actually detect electrons moving around the nucleus like in the classical model, right? They seem to just teleport around their orbital or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do the electrons feel the need to start traveling so fast? </p>
<p>I would assume that they naturally try to orbit the nucleus at a certain frequency and when the nucleus gets packed with protons, the electrons speed up to keep that same rate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just because the Coulomb force of the nucleus is very strong.</p></div>		</li>
