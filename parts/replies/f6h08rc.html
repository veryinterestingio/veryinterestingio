How do you select which information to use, how do you use it and when do you use it to hide the fact that the code was broken.  Large scale data analysis could reveal that the common link between compromised operations was the Enigma and that would mean it was broken, even with some obfuscation to provide excuses, a more rigorous analysis could show the linkage and show that the allies were too lucky.</p>
<p>That said, that's applying a modern data science lense to history.  At the time Data Science and computer science were just being created (and in fact contributed to breaking the machine) so other decision criteria were viewed as more probable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You use all of it. If you don't have a plausible alternative source for the intel, then you go away and invent a plausible source (validating the Enigma message in the process) which then allows you to take direct action.</p>
<p>Remember, the Brits were masters at deceiving the Germans (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat" target="_blank">Op Mincemeat</a> convincing the Germans to reinforce Greece whilst the Allies invaded Sicily). They had to assume there was a possibility the Germans were pushing dodgy intel over Enigma - you'd need to confirm the intel before potentially walking into a trap.</p></div>		</li>
