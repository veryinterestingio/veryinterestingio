			<div class="markdown"><p>Your description is interesting because I'd describe the feeling of my tic disorder quite differently.</p>
<p>To me, it doesn't quite feel like a &quot;misfire&quot; because it can be consciously delayed for at least a couple seconds. I'd describe it more like trying not to swallow or blink; a compulsive urge that rapidly builds until it can't be put off any longer.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's just a matter of severity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly!</p>
<p>Tics are weird.  I have those eye twitches where I know I can't do anything to stop them. And I have those other where I kind of &quot;feel&quot; my brain in the commands, but I just can't help doing it anyway...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For my tics, I can fight them (delay them) but only for so long. They can also be distracted by things like movies, videos or activities. However, it feels weird <em>not</em> doing them and I instantly do them when I realized I haven't done them in a while. Weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly how mine manifest, also if I’m stressed and have tasks at hand that make it unable to focus on not twitching then they become more prevalent. Interestingly, someone mentioning my tics or hearing about tics cause them to become difficult to resist doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your definition is more accurate to a tic than the original post. Tics are more psychogenic (having to do with the mind) than neurogenic (having to do with the brain and nerves).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some consist tics. They tend to come out when I am tired, especially in my legs (I assume its RLS). But it feels like a pressure build up that just hurts and hurts the more the pressure builds until finally I can't take it anymore and I kick. Sometimes a few times before I feel better. </p>
<p>Once it was on a red-eye flight and I was crying because I couldn't shake it no matter how much I tried and I couldn't really kick jammed into a tiny seat. </p>
<p>Same with all my other ones. Always a pressure build up until I can't take it anymore and I just HAVE to do it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I suffer from this quite a bit. Only in my left leg. An intense urge to lift my toes (to stretch my calf muscle) and kick. Happens about every other night and very often when I fly. Crossing my legs helps, as does having pressure / weight on my legs or feet, or leg exercise. Does that sound similar to your experiences at all?</p>
<p>I have been told it could be due to the low dose SSRI I have been taking for several years now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used the misfire as a description because that’s how my neurologist described it to me. They way you described it is definitely more along the lines of how it feels. Like currently the most noticeable tic is a very heavy blink that happens from time to time. If I’m conscious of it I can try to delay it but I can’t stop myself. It feels like I’m getting immensely anxious until it happens. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally on the same page.</p>
<p>&quot;Misfire&quot; just makes me think of a muscle spasm or seizure, haha.</p>
<p>I think part of what makes tics so obnoxious is that you have *some* control over them, but you're only delaying the inevitable if you try to stop them. Bastard's taunting me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you have excessive anxiety it’ll make your motor tics more prevalent.</p>

<p>hi could you message me- i want to know what medicines you took.....I suffer from the same things, been diagnosed with mild tourettes, have many spasms in my face and fingers, yell out loud and very weird things involuntarily. I wake up and feel so anxious and adrenaline filled.  This happens and is bad until I take my klonipin (sp).  Just seeing what they recommended you.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for all the help. Currently taking risperidone, clonipin, adderall, and duluxetine (sp). I feel agitated all the time, grit my teeth hard, yell out obscene things  at home. First thing I do when I wake up and get home from work is organize and clean. I feel so restless. </p>
<p>I also to be honest smoke weed pretty regularly for the past 4 years. I mean just about every freakin day. </p>
<p>I don’t know if this is stress or reaction to stress- it got worse 3 years ago after a dui crash and the subsequent hospitalization. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used Orap (motor tics) and citalopram (anxiety/depression). I can’t say how well it’ll work because they can only be used together in low dosages because they can negatively affect your heart in high dosages. However, just Orap may help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been taking chlonodine every day since I was 10 for tourettes, I'm not sure if it would help at all this late in the game but as a child I had it severe (motor, vocal, etc) along with hardcore OCD and since age ~18 you would never be able to tell I have it.</p>
<p>I think weed helps a lot too. Try getting it medical if nothing else seems to be helping you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Abilify is amazing for tics. If you get side effects from it, Geodon works well too. Tic disorders are often comorbid with ADHD and stimulants make tics worse; drugs like clonidine can treat both.</p>
<p>I'm prescribed benzos for Tourettes as well. Be careful with them, physical dependence is a given, but addiction can creep up on you. Only take them for therapeutic purposes and never start taking them for fun. If you have questions/want to talk about Tourettes and all the possible treatments, message me. /r/tourettes is also there for you.</p></div>		</li>
