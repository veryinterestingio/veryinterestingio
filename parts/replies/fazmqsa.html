			<div class="markdown"><p>Very uninformed question here, but are the fluids in your eyes shared with the cerebral spinal fluid? THC increases intraocular pressure right, could that have some potential use as a treatment if that is the case?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There’s two chambers in your eye. The anterior one which has circulating fluid. And the vitreous gel, which is permanent. </p>
<p>The CSF in the brain and spine doesn’t communicate with the eye, it just pushes on the optic nerve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude below is right in most cases.  CSF is around your optic nerves (not normally in your eyes as he stated).  Increases in intracranial pressure can manifest as a swollen optic nerve that is easily seen on exam in the eye clinic, due to the pressure your CSF transduces.  The CSF around the optic nerve is the same as in your brain and spinal cord.  For pseudotumor cerebri patients (Idiopathic intracranial hypertension aka IIH) we actually order a lumbar tap to measure the pressure that effecting the head/ eye.  We already have good meds to lower intracranial pressure (Diamox) though there are case-reports of Dronabinol being used in IIH.  I'm sure companies are working on that front.</p>

<p>There is a condition called an optic nerve pit, in which we believe CSF can escape from around the optic nerve and get under the retina causing a serous macular detachment.  So in this case, CSF is in your eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Your eyes contain what's called vitreous fluid, rather than cerebrospinalfluid. Theres no connection between the fluid chambers in the eyes and the CSF spaces.</p></div>		</li>
