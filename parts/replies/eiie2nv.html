			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way, decaying flesh is the result of a dead animal.  That means that the animal was either killed by a predator, killed by the environment, or died of natural causes.  It’s not important for the dead animal, but for those still alive around it.  It’s also not the smell that is a selected trait, but the detection of that smell.  Those animals who couldn’t detect the smell, would linger around an area in which a predator or environment could be potentially dangerous.  Also, by not detecting the smell, animals could potentially eat a rotten car as, resulting in sickness and/or death.  Therefore, not detecting smells is dangerous and has been selected as an evolutionarily important trait.</p></div>		</li>
