			<div class="markdown"><p>Women don’t have estrous cycles we have menstrual cycles. Estrous cycles are when animals go into heat and they happen once a year. Menstrual cycles happen monthly and the only mammals that have them are primates (including humans), bats and the elephant shrew. All other mammals have an estrous cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many animals have short (monthly) heat cycles, such as pigs, horses, donkeys, and cattle. </p>
<p>So it is not the time increments that distinguish a heat/estrus cycle from a menstrual cycle, but whether or not a female is willing to have sex when not in estrus or only during estrus. </p>
<p>Humans and other primates (etc.) will engage in sex even when there is no chance for fertilization, whereas animals such as the 'barnyard' ones named above, will only engage in reproductive behavior, when the female is in estrus/receptive to be fertilized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! What about dolphins? Either way, women don’t have estrous cycles lol. Here is another difference I found from Wikipedia:</p>
<p>“One difference is that animals that have estrous cycles resorb the endometrium if conception does not occur during that cycle. Animals that have menstrual cycles shed the endometrium through menstruation instead. Another difference is sexual activity.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a question better asked of your doctor.</p>
<p>But in general, frequency of sex is going to matter less than timing of sex relative to her fertility windows. If your wife has a very regular cycle, you could track this and time sex to increase or decrease your chances of conception (rhythm method of family planning; not recommended unless you're OK with a moderate &quot;failure&quot; rate). </p>
<p>If her cycles are somewhat irregular, increased general frequency would probably increase the odds of having sex coincident with her most fertile days/hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probability is a distribution, and you caught a tail.</p>
<p>The likelihood of that happening to any one specific person is tiny, but the likelihood that in a large population, it'll happen to someone is pretty high.</p></div>		</li>
