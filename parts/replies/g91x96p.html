			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh. Tell me about it. I have a boss who's not really my boss who yelled at me today telling me how I messed up and should have been thinking ahead about something I would have no way of knowing she wanted. I wanted to cry while talking to her. She sucks and yells at people all the time in a whiney, immature voice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally (if I were in that situation) would call them out on it.  I worked at an IT company, managed to work my way up the ranks for a few years  then got a new boss.  Whiney, bitchy piece of shit 35-yesr old single man.  He always got really loud when anything went wrong.  If he had computer problems or server issues (to put it simply), he came to me with such an attitude as if I wasn't doing my job.  I raised my voice back at him saying that I will make sure that it is taken care of, but &quot;I need you to leave my cubicle immediately so that I can do my job, please, [his name].  He said something along the lines of &quot;I own this wing, so I own this cubicle, and I can stand here all I want.&quot;  So he continued bitching about how hard he works and shit, and I sat there and listened, doing no work, and I glanced at the clock.  He bitched and moaned for TWELVE MINUTES.  I said &quot;[his name], if you don't give me a pay raise on the spot right now for making me listen to your rant, then I quit.&quot;  He said &quot;You know what?  You can't quit if you've been fired.&quot;  I responded with &quot;You can't fire me, because I just quit in my last sentence, since you won't give me a raise.&quot;  Immediately he started bitching again, as I packed up my personal laptop and other personal belongings into my backpack and left.  Walked right by him.  Got home to my wife and explained the situation, ended up getting another better paying job a week later after re-doing my resume for a few places.  You only get one life.  To not take risks is a risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've gotta say, coming from a high school kid back in the day who would choke up when a teacher got snippy with me, going into the Army to get numb to loud assholes berating you for stupid stuff, it feels good to be able to calmly reflect during an ass chewing; gather your thoughts, then unemotionally verbalize exactly what kind of ignorant, inbred, cocksucking mouth breathing sea sponge the deliverer of said ass chewing is while watching them get all butthurt. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could've been worse, man.
During my first job, I worked at a local thrift store that required one-on-one meetings with the boss.</p>
<p>Every single time I had my meeting, I just immediately started uncontrollably crying in front of the boss.</p>
<p>Every. Single. Freakin'. Time.</p>
<p>I'm such a mess.</p></div>		</li>
