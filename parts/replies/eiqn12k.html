			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, IgG class antibodies are capable of crossing the placenta. This can cause problems for the fetus if the mother has an antibody against an antigen present on the baby's red blood cells. </p>
<p>An example of this would be if the mother has Rh negative blood type and the fetus has Rh positive, or the D antigen present on the blood cell. In some cases a mother could develop an antibody against the D antigen if the fetus blood mixes with the mother's blood, which can happen during birth. If the mother had a second child with Rh positive blood the D antibodies she developed in the previous birth could attack the baby's red blood cells causing hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn. Which can cause miscarriages in the worst case scenario or the baby will be born with an anemia.</p>
<p>It is a fairly common case in pregnancies and the mothers are given Rhogam to suppress the antibodies to prevent this from happening.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took this in biology and always had a question that I never asked. Why does this only happen with Rh antigens/antibodies? Why doesn't it happen when, for example, the mother's blood type is O and the fetus's blood type is A? Wouldn't the mother have antibodies for both A and B?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It <em>can</em> happen with anti-A/B antibodies, but it's rare.  Mostly, anti-A/B antibodies are IgM type, which is too large to pass through the placenta, and fetal red blood cells express fewer AB antigens anyway.  O blood types are more likely to have IgG type anti-A/B antibodies, and other blood types can have IgG type anti-A/B antibodies; sometimes due to exposure later in life.</p>
<p>Ironically, rh-type hemolytic disease of the newborn can be prevented by having an A/B mismatch as well - the A/B antibodies kill the stray blood cells before the mother can have an immune response to the rh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, there’s some dude in Aus/NZ who has an antigen in his blood that prevents this exact thing from happening. Doctors discovered it when he donated blood one time. They basically told him “We want you to keep donating like clockwork. We can’t force you to do it, but it would save a ton of lives.” </p>
<p>Apparently it doesn’t take much, since they don’t even need a full blood transfusion; They just need that compound he produces in his plasma. So for every pint he donates, that gets split up into multiple treatments for expectant mothers who are suffering from this.</p>
<p>He’s donated every week for like 60 years, and has saved something like 2 million lives.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/11/health/james-harrison-blood-donor-retires-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">Just looked it up</a>. For being off the top of my head, I was damned close with my numbers. Every week for 60 years, and 2.4 million treatments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it's complicated, but it's so crazy to me that you can't pay someone appropriately for this. Giving him, say, $50k/yr for 60 years would add up to about $1 per treatment.</p>
<p>Imagine if he'd just declined to keep donating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually happened with me. I had an uncomplicated pregnancy with my daughter but had to receive a blood transfusion about 8 months later due to anemia, I am an RH neg and from the transfusion I received an antibody to the D and C antigens. I was unaware of this when I got pregnant with my son (different father than my daughter) 2 years later and the father passed the C antigen to my son. I was 17 weeks pregnant when my OB/GYN called me into the office for my blood work results and explained that my body was attacking my child. They gave me the option to abort which I declined and then gave me a list of complications that my child could endure during the pregnancy or be born with. The list went from missing or deformed limbs/organs to the fetus going into cardiac arrest in the womb. I was due Oct 10th and in the 3rd week of August they wanted to plan to take him in the 2nd week of September. Mind you this was almost 16 years ago so not as much research had been done on this type of situation as now. I refused to birth him any earlier than 2 to 3 weeks and they did an amniocentesis to make sure he would survive that long and to try to get ahead of any complications that could be seen from the amnio. It was a good thing I held my ground, I gave birth by C-Section 1 week early on Oct 3rd and the only thing wrong with my son at birth was severe jaundice. He had to be under the table light and the blanket on him constantly the first 3 days, I could only see him or hold him to feed him. Other than him being a typical teenager now he has been perfectly healthy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m afraid this is likely not the case in regards to hyperemesis. The factors underlying the immune system and pregnancy are massively complicated and still not understood fully. We do know that there is an element of immunosuppression that protects against maternal attack, and increases the mothers susceptibility to infections (this is why flu season is dangerous to a non immunised pregnant female - and can be up to 6 weeks postnatally too). </p>
<p>BetaHCG rapidly rises in the first 16 weeks or pregnancy and then plateaus, this matches the majority of hyperemesis issues. The molecule contains similar homology to thyroid stimulating hormone and can elicit a thyrotoxicosis like state, which can contribute to vomiting. </p>
<p>There is a likelihood that the BetaHCG can stimulate the chemoreceptors of the “vomiting centre” in the brain. Whilst infections such as urinary tract infections do cause symptoms such as vomiting, (as opposed to outside of pregnancy) and whilst these infections are more common in pregnancy, the immune component is not really related to the constant vomiting of early pregnancy. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this! </p>
<p>Not a medic but, after suffering through 4 pretty much hellish pregnancies (got heavenly kids though!) I undertook serious research to find out what on earth was happening in my body...</p>
<p>It gave me an element of control and peace through the situation when I understood it physiologically... it took away about 1 percent of the torment of hell, which was better than nothing!</p>

From <a href="http://www.helpher.org/blog/category/research/" target="_blank">http://www.helpher.org/blog/category/research/</a> : This study provides scientific evidence linking 2 genes, GDF15 and IGFBP7, to HG.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is close to true, but not 100%. The mother doesn’t actually get immunosuppressed, contrary to historical dogma (one of Sir Peter Medawar’s biggest mistakes). In fact, some inflammation at the fetomaternal interface is actually necessary for implantation, as well as eventual delivery (for instance, decidual NK cells promote angiogenesis that helps develop the blood vessels that feed the embryo). The progeny helps modulate what type of inflammation happens, but it’s only really the second trimester where there’s something more like true immune privilege around the developing fetus. We are still learning about exactly which signals control the switches in type of inflammation that occur, and the source of these signals; it’s a very cool field that has the potential to help a lot of people with currently unexplainable infertility in the future. </p>
<p>There’s also (poorly understood) microchimerism where some cells from the embryo starting at about 6 weeks if I remember correctly seed the mother and persist in her long term, helping tolerize her to offspring from the same father in the future. So it’s not even completely accurate to say that there’s a perfect barrier between the mother and embryo/fetus</p>
<p>Fun fact: the immunology of pregnancy weirdly parallels the immunology of a developing tumor. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oooh is this your field? I'm an immunology-adjacent biochemist (my thesis was about a mechanism of antigen presentation), and also currently pregnant. One thing I was discussing with my PI after my NIPT was whether cell free DNA from the fetus (which is detected by the NIPT) would trigger some sort of inflammation, and how the maternal immune system would deal with that. Do you happen to know anything about this? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Fetal DNA is hypomethylated and can activate TLR9. Interestingly, this hypomethylation also changes the activation status of many endogenous retroviruses and I've never really seen anything concrete on what this does in terms of the maternal immune system.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Another thing to look at is the release of mitochondrial DNA. This stuff is also not methylated so it can also activate TLR9. Mitochondrial DNA can also activate the cGAS/STING pathway depending on the context.</p></div>		</li>
