			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate a little further,  the chemical reactions are only able to generate small potential (voltage) differences.  There are no chemicals that would react and give a 10x larger potential.  So you don't have any other option other than to cascade cells. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that actually the case or is it just that the ones that would react like that are uneconomical or unsafe to use as electrical cells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Li+/Li couple is -3.05 V versus H2/2H+ (just a reference to compare against) and F2/2F- is 2.87V versus H2/2H+</p>
<p>So the largest voltage you could ever get with the elements we have is 2.87-(-3.05) = 5.92V</p>
<p>But attempting to assemble this cell would probably result in a number of explosions and flourine gas melting your face in whilst LiF just laughs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrochemical potentials are species dependent. Putting two species together that are very exothermic (thermite) does not equate to electrochemicalpotential (voltage). </p>
<p>Thermite for example is the oxidation of aluminum and reduction of iron oxide.</p>
<p>Oversimply:
Al3+ -&gt; Al is -1.662 V
Fe3+ -&gt; Fe is -0.447 V</p>
<p>Net is roughly +1.2V.</p>
<p>Super exothermic and violent reaction with only 1.2V.  The actually reaction will be different as it's not simply ions but the difference is not substantial, probably +/- 0.5V.</p>
<p>Potential is just the energy difference electrons experiance going from one species to the next. Some energy cannot be captured via a galvanic cell either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kind of like why a ladder has many steps.  Our legs can only go so high with each lift (just like a single chemical cell can), but if we put lifts in a row (cells in sequence), we can get up pretty high.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>120v battery, why not? Cell, no. We frequently call a single cell a &quot;battery&quot; but technically battery means one OR MORE cells attached together in a single package. So you take 33 lithium ion cells, which have a nominal voltage of 3.7 volts each, connect them in series, you get 122.1 volts. Though fully charged it's going to be 138.6 as a fully charged cell will have a 4.2 volt potential difference.</p></div>		</li>
