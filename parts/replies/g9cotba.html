			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially, Mike launches countermeasures, which are among other configurations, a great big cloud of strips of aluminized mylar (&quot;space&quot; blankets!), and hopefully, that makes the radar thinks it's trapped in that hall of mirrors from the Bruce Lee movie.</p>
<p>But it's a big cat-and-mouse game, so that's a major oversimplification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in theory, you could stay in “Fire Control” mode and not fire anything just to spook the pilot? </p>
<p>Does the pilot have a separate “missile away” detection system? Or does the pilot assume a missile is always underway once “Fire Control” is detected?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yup. Switching to FC mode is a pretty clear &quot;Hey fuckass, get out of my airspace&quot; message and is used as such on occasion when you really want to make a point.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Some aircraft do and can detect the exhaust plume of a launched missile or the special modes used by a missile's onboard radar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah interestingly in places where a 'no-fly-zone' is enforced by aircraft (which really is an 'only-we-can-fly-zone', they sometimes drop leaflets that effectively communicate the idea of 'if you lock onto us from the ground we will retaliate'</p>
<p>Here is an example.  To be clear I have NO IDEA what the not-english words say, nor is this an endorsement of any military group or military campaign, I was just looking for something like this.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just in theory, in practice!  Hotshot friendly fighter pilots do this to each quite often.</p>
<p>Supposedly, in the US, the Department of Defense had to issue inter-service instructions for how long these games could go on, due to pilots of rival services spending lots of time and fuel pretend-dogfighting each other.  They didn't forbid it outright, just said that you can circle each other once or something like that, and then you have to break off and get back to what you were supposed to be doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens all the time. Like every day. It’s called BFM (Basic Fighter Maneuvers). Pointy nose drivers don’t just go dogfight other jets randomly. BFM has a ton of training rules (speeds at the merge, altitude blocks, etc etc) that are briefed and followed every time.</p>
<p>The DoD has never, nor will they ever, issue something like this.</p></div>		</li>
