			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, this is basically the correct answer. The mics are less about getting a feed and more about getting the flag in the shot (though nobody at home gives a shit and the network bug is far more noticeable). I honestly think it's a holdover from the old days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the network bug don't show on other channels. A mic might, giving them free advertising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. We just refuse to let them use their own mics because it looks terrible for everyone’s shots. They all comply now. </p>
<p>They (the press, bloggers, etc) are either allowed to plug into our press box mult, or use the shotgun mic on their camera, but any microphone put on the podium gets removed, immediately. It’s a policy we created and is strictly enforced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! As long as someone understands audio signaling and distribution sets it up it's such a better way to do it. Tho, as someone pointed out, it's unfortunate that many camera guys don't know the difference between line level and mic level....:(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it’s not entirely about the flag. It’s about being held accountable. If it’s a venue A/V team that your network trusts it seems to be ok to take from their press box. I work for a large AV company and we generally only have our mics on the podium. It might be that we don’t allow other to up on the podium but usually it’s never too much of a fuss. I just know that when they see all the other reporters using the press box they generally use the press box. </p></div>		</li>
