			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of what you said, there is an effect called Rayleigh scattering. This effect causes a scattering of light in the atmosphere proportional to 1/(wavelength)</p>
<p>Meaning: The shorter the wavelength, the stronger the scattering. </p>
<p>This effect is the reason, why the sky is blue at a sunny day. The blue light (shortest visible wavelength) is scattered in the atmosphere away from the direct path to earth to where we happen to look at the blue sky. </p>
<p>Sunsets are red, because the blue parts are scattered away to make the sky blue somewhere else. </p>
<p>This effect is even stronger with UV to Soft X-Ray applications. But yea, at some point, the photons stop &quot;caring&quot; about molecules. Then you are at Gamma Radiation/ Hard X-Rays. </p>
<p>Also, at some window in the near-mid infrared, the light will be absorbed by the water in the air.</p></div>		</li>
