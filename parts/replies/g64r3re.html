			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're definitely correct, but I'd go even further and say it's like saying that a &quot;red car&quot; is better.  It's purely personal preference.</p>
<p>I find wagyu (and yes I've had very high-end stuff a small number of times) utterly disgusting.  Fatty and disgusting.</p>
<p>Give me a lean piece of rib eye fillet any day.  I know others disagree, and that's my point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's amazing for small slices and the like but if you want a big steak dinner it's the wrong choice.</p>

<p>That's the first time I've ever heard <em>anyone</em> say that and definitely hasn't been my experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he is referring to real Japanese Wagyu like an A5 grade, which are very delicious but too fatty for large pieces. American Wagyu and the likes are less fatty and great for large steaks and burgers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, I live in Japan and love steak, so I eat wagyu pretty regularly. Normal supermarket wagyu steaks (those are non-graded) already taste fantastic and are much more tender than most other beef in the normal supermarket category. A small (~90g) low level wagyu steak starts at around 6-7 USD equivalent.</p>
<p>The higher the grade, the more fat. A5 (most expensive) is so fatty, that some people think it tastes gross. For me, it's comparable to foie gras. You'll likely only want a small piece of that and eat something else as well.</p>
<p>Personally, I'd recommend slightly more expensive supermarket pieces (e.g. 16 usd for 120g) or lower level in the restaurant (A1-A2) if someone tries it for the first time.</p></div>		</li>
