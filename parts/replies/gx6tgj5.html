			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood Bank Guy is a pretty well known resource for students on the subject, and he has a good <a href="https://www.bbguy.org/2018/08/01/abo/" target="_blank">primer on ABO</a> testing. The straight forward, low-level answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When humans are born, we have no ABO antibodies of our own (we may have a few floating around from our mom, but we haven’t made any yet). As we start to live, within the first few months we are exposed to a multitude of bacteria both in the environment and in our digestive system. Some of those bacteria contain antigens that look “just like” human A and B antigens. As a result, by the time babies get to 3-6 months of age, they generally start making their own ABO antibodies</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is missing the point which is that we have ALREADY pre-formed antibodies against the other blood groups circulating in our blood. That’s why we react pretty immediately to an incorrect transfusion and take a few hours to days to react to a novel infection</p></div>		</li>
