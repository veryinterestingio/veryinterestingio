<p>It has nothing to do with tectonic plates except tangentially.</p>
<p>The term arose before airplanes existed.</p>
<p>The short explanation is, just look at this picture and understand that human beings have trouble breathing above 3,000 meters in altitude, and it gets worse the higher you get:</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Tibet_and_surrounding_areas_topographic_map.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Tibet_and_surrounding_areas_topographic_map.png</a></p>
<p>The long explanation is:</p>
<p>Before airplanes, the easiest way to get from central Asia south to central India was to ride east to the freaking Pacific and take a boat.</p>
<p>It is THAT isolated from central Asia.  (Less so from west Asia because the mountains and plateau only go so far west.)</p>
<p>And the reason it is isolated is the Tibetan plateau, whose southern edge is the Himalayan mountain range.  There's another mountain range west of them as well.</p>
<p>The whole area is so unbelievably inaccessible that it is actually easier to travel to the south pole than it is to get to the center of the Tibetan plateau.</p>
<p>It is huge, incredibly high in altitude, dry as the desert that it is, almost completely unpopulated, and surrounded by the highest walls on Earth.</p>
<p>Understand that these aren't just mountain ranges; they're walls.</p>
<p>We think of Mount Everest as the highest mountain in the world, and it is.  5 and a half miles high.</p>
<p>BUT.</p>
<p>That makes it sound like it rises 5 and a half miles above the ground around it.  And that is not the case.</p>
<p>The second highest mountain in the world is K2, which is over 800 miles away from Everest and in a different mountain range, but still connected to the Tibetan plateau.</p>
<p>And the whole area is so insanely high, so wall-like, that if you walked the 800+ miles from K2 to Everest, you would never walk below 13,000 feet, or 2.5 miles.</p>
<p>So you can draw a line across the north edge of the Indian subcontinent that is over 800 miles long and never once drops below 13,000 feet in altitude.  And it only gets that low a couple times.</p>
<p>Human beings have a tough time breathing anywhere above 10,000 feet in altitude because the air's thinner.  Airplanes fly higher than that, but they're sealed.  If there's an accident and they leak air, they fly down to 10,000 feet so everyone on board can breathe again; this is why they carry little oxygen masks and teach you how to use them.  People can live above 10,000 feet, and many do, but it’s where you start running into problems that get worse with every additional rise.</p>
<p>If you walked north from India and tried to reach central Asia, you would have to walk so high that you might need an oxygen mask all the time.</p>
<p>And those ranges and the Tibetan plateau are so large that you would have to keep walking at that altitude (or higher) for weeks.</p>
<p>I'm looking at a list of the 108 tallest mountains in the world.</p>
<p>You know how many are in Asia?</p>
<p>108.</p>
<p>You know how many are between India and central Asia?</p>
<p>108.</p>
<p>You have to look at a longer list than that to find any mountain in the world that can compete with the ones that divide the Indian subcontinent from the rest of Asia.</p>
<p>The Rocky Mountains?  The Alps?  The Andes?  None of them have a single mountain that competes with even the last mountain on that list, much less the first.</p>
<p>It is just insane.</p>
<p>It is an absolutely insane natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>Now imagine confronting that obstacle without the benefit of airplanes to fly over any part of it.</p>
<p>Even airplanes are leery of the area, because if they have engine trouble or medical trouble and need to land, there's no place to land.  It's a huge desert that sits at an altitude normal human beings cannot comfortably breathe at.  The only safe place to find shelter is somewhere else.  Everywhere else.  You'd have better odds landing on the ocean and having everyone get into life rafts than you would landing in the middle of the Tibetan plateau or the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It's just insane.</p>
<p>And so, early explorers discovered that insanity and said &quot;the hell with that&quot;.</p>
<p>They didn't even try to cross it.  Or the ones who did rarely survived.</p>
<p>They just went around it, and it turns out there aren't a lot of ways to do that by land because these mountain ranges and the Tibetan plateau are so ridiculously big, wide, and long.</p>
<p>And so, since to get there you basically have to take a ship, they called it a subcontinent.</p>
<p>It doesn't SEEM separated from Asia if you look at a normal map.  But if you look at a 3D map that has bumps and raised areas where the ground is higher, then you will immediately see the problem.</p>
<p>Now, all of that mountainous crap did arise from tectonic plate movement, but a lot of other things did as well, and none of those were anywhere near as dramatic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair there is a path through, but obviously you'd have to find it. I was born and lived above 3000 meters just fine. People can adjust to the altitude and make it through, but again they'd have to be aware of needing to so that and may just get sick and disheartened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What some users are saying only applies to a very small portion of the population. Most Nepalis don't live in those high altitudes. The altitude of the capital city Kathmandu, for example, is only 4,600 feet. It is less than some of the towns I've visited in Colorado. Additionally, a significant proportion live in the lowlands in the south, that are only a few hundred meters above sea level. Nepal basically goes from a few hundred meters above sea level to Mt. Everest in less than 200km. There is a wide variety of altitudes in the country, not just mountains like what most people think.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can live up there, but its not easy. Many of the natives have adapted to high altitudes, but anyone who visits from the lowlands is going to be tired out very very easily, or else they will take a few weeks to acclimate. Doing physical activity at high altitude without previously acclimating is very dangerous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This and also that the word continent isn’t very well defined and in most situations lumping all of Asia together isn’t really all the useful. </p>
<p>Also there are other situations where this happens. For example North America isn’t well defined and often people will subdivide out Central America.  Edit 2: got to thinking this didn’t really go towards the question. Are you asking why the word subcontinent is specifically used? Probably because in your other examples they are unambiguous already. For example if you say Central America then everyone knows what you are talking about, or sub-Saharan Africa. But we don’t have a better phrase to unambiguously describe the Indian subcontinent. </p>
<p>Edit: Just thinking, maybe we should be calling it the Florida Subcontinent.  Hahaha. </p></div>		</li>
