<p>Schistosomus reflexus (SR) is a rare and fatal congenital disorder. Primarily observed in ruminants, its defining features include spinal inversion, exposure of the abdominal viscera because of a fissure of the ventral abdominal wall, limb ankylosis, positioning of the limbs adjacent to the skull and, lung and diaphragm hypoplasia. </p>
<p>Variable components of SR include scoliosis, cleft sternum, exposure of thoracic viscera, and abnormalities of the digestive and urogenital systems. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tl;dr: the spine of the developing fetus is twisted backwards, which causes the internal organs to be exposed because the abdomen can't close. Some of the organs themselves can also be fucked up.</p>
<p>Edit: omphalocele is usually not this bad. It can be severe, but the spine is generally not bent backward the way it is in SR. It's a defect in the abdominal wall, where the internal organs can bulge out from the navel or even a larger opening in the same area. In most cases, thankfully, omphalocele can be surgically repaired.</p></div>		</li>
