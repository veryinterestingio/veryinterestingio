First is PCR, which is used to detect the “nucleic acids” meaning the genetic components (DNA or RNA) of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is an RNA virus. PCR is the test you are thinking of in which a swab of the nose is used to collect a sample. Samples could also be collected from the throat or lungs themselves for PCR. PCR tells us that viral RNA is there, but it does NOT tell us whether the virus is alive.  </p>
<p>The next test is virus isolation, which starts with a sample collected in a similar way.  In this case, however, the sample is used to try to grow the virus - not just detect its RNA.  This confirms that the virus was alive in the site where it was collected.</p>
<p>Finally, there is serology. This means testing the blood for antibodies. Antibodies tell us that the immune system has “seen” the virus and “decided” it’s dangerous, and so the immune system has taken action to defend the body by making antibodies. Antibodies confirm that at some point in the past (recent past or distant past) the body actively defended itself against the virus.<br />
It’s important to understand that a virus could be detected by PCR in the nose of a pet, but if the virus is dead, or if the virus is not well adapted to get into the cells of that kind of pet, the immune system never “sees” it as a threat. In that case, PCR might have been positive at some point, but serology remains negative.  </p>
<p>So, how do you get a nasal swab, or blood, from a tiger?  </p>
<p>In almost all cases, this requires general anesthesia. For that reason, caretakers of these special animals are very thoughtful about the decision to subject animals to testing.  In the case of the Bronx Zoo tiger, several big cats had been showing signs of illness.  For reasons of safety, only one of these ill animals was anesthetized for testing. That means that the other big cats may (or may not) have had the same results if tested.</p>
