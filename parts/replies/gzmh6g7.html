			<div class="markdown"><p>You said weather systems generally travel west to east are you sure you didnt get that backwards?</p>
<p>Red sky in morning sailor take warning would imply that a storm to the east of the observer would be moving west towards the observer not away from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, which would make the phrase;</p>
<p>Red sky in morning take delight red sky at night, warning.</p>
<p>The sun rises in the east so if you see a red sky in the morning then the storm should be east of you, between you and the sun.</p>
<p>If you see a red sky at night then the storm should be to the west between you and the sun again.</p>
<p>So if the phrase says red sky in the morning take warning/red sky at night, delight. Then i would assume that means the weather is moving east to west which makes sense to me since i expect the sun to heat the atmosphere up and create a high pressure zone and the sun moves east to west so why wouldnt that high pressure zone move in a similar way?</p>
<p>That makes sense right? The air to the east will heat up before the air to the west since the sun rises in the east so that will push the warming air towards the west? Cold air is more dense than warm air but warm air has more energy so id still expect the warm air to push west.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if a sailor sees red sky in the morning, it means a high pressure to the east of that sailor and low pressure to the west. Over the course of the day, the weather system, in this case, the low pressure, moves from west to east towards the sailor. Low pressure brings storms. Hence take warning.</p></div>		</li>
