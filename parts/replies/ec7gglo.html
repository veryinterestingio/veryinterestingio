			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/irwin.html" target="_blank">Here's some info</a> that makes for a decent starting point. The best known example is the California salamander, which comprises several &quot;species.&quot; The salamanders are distributed in a long oval across California. Nearby populations are capable of hybridizing, but at a certain point this no longer occurs. Pretty nifty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not an exact condition, it depends on which genes are inherited in the offspring. It's a game of chance. </p>
<p>In addition to being fertile, the hybrid also must be viable. There are animals that can become pregnant with a hybrid that doesn't make it full term due to defects, or dies immediately after birth. When you eliminate those animals from the equation, sometimes the only ones that are capable of living are also, by chance, infertile. Such is the case with your two examples. Other times, fertile, viable offspring result, and have the potential to continue breeding until eventually, a new species emerges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hybrid infertility comes about in different ways.  If things are too distantly related, then it's hard for the offspring to get a &quot;full set&quot; of genes because maybe they aren't divided up in the same way across the species.  Secondarily, you might get two incompatible genes.  So gene from species A does X, gene from species B does y, but if you happen to have both x and y happening you are infertile or dead.  Thirdly, because having crossbreed offspring can sometimes be a waste of resources because they just aren't going to be good at anything (imagine a hybrid between a bird that's a good flyer and a bird that's better on the ground, which is good at neither flying nor running), species can evolve particular checks that essentially sit on the egg and say &quot;eh, that sperm's not the right kind&quot; and don't let it fertilize.  Or other methods that basically check to keep hybrids from happening.</p>
<p>Because of this diversity of methods, sometimes closely related species can't crossbreed, and sometimes really distantly related species can.  </p></div>		</li>
