<p>“more than other common communications frequencies but still less than visible light” would be a more accurate description, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but that leaves room for misinterpretation. 5G frequencies (around 50GHz) can be about 10x higher than common WiFi frequencies (around 5GHz), but visible light <em>starts</em> at about 10,000x higher (400THz) than 5G. Light doesn’t start to become ionizing until up into the ultraviolet range, somewhere around 10PHz, or about 200,000 higher than 5G frequencies.</p>
<p>Yes, 5G is at a higher frequency than WiFi, but it’s still about two hundred thousand times <em>times</em> lower than when it would really matter.</p>
<p>Edit: As an analogy, let's say you have to drop a brick from 1 meter above your foot in order to break it. We'll say that's the amount of energy in an high ultraviolet photon. By comparison, 5GHz WiFi is like dropping a brick from the height of the thickness of a single human red blood cell. Well, 5G <em>is</em> 10x higher than that WiFi signal, but that's still about 1/20th of the thickness of a sheet of printer paper.</p>
<p>In other words, yeah, it's higher energy, but still so minuscule that you can ignore it unless you're sitting in a reflective box with a thousand watts of it being pumped in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't it also the case that they have to add more 5G towers because it was strong but only in a short radius?</p>
<p>I have the feeling it was a combination of &quot;Higher frequency than regular wifi&quot; + &quot;More towers&quot; that created the fear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious though, is it possible that a small amount of exposure over a really long time would still have noticeable effects? I saw a photo a while back of a tree growing really close to a streetlight. The light caused the closest patch of tree to not change colour during autumn (whereas the rest of the leaves did). I'm just wondering if there would be small effects like that on the plants and animals within the radius wi-fi is transmitted, if you stretched out the timeline over decades. Do you think nature will sense wi-fi and change/adapt because of it? In which case, the effects would still matter, in the grand scheme of things, right?</p>
<p>I read an article a while back about how FM radio waves have been shown in some small studies to affect some animals' sense of direction, relating to electromagnetic sensing. (Iirc) Do you think if FM waves can cause unpredicted effects like that, that wi-fi could as well?</p>
<p>(For the record, I am just curious about the science of it, I don't have enough information either way to say whether I think they're harmful or not. You seem like you have a decent grasp on how this stuff works.)</p>
<p>Edit: I don't know much about how 5G works, but if it's slightly stronger than wi-fi, technically the effects would be noticeable faster, correct?</p></div>		</li>
