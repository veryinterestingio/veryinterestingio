			<div class="markdown"><p>Depressed brains look different on an MRI, I think with much less activity in general. That could be related to it. </p>
<p>Depression also causes somatic pain (random body aches or severe pain for no actual reason) which are also not very well understood.</p>
<p>EDIT: instead of “for no actual reason” I should have said “for no other known reason”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have lost a ton of weight, and I tell you, every moment of exercise has been a chore because of my depression. I think of it like going to work, I don't like it, but I do it cause I need to live. With that mindset I have lost over 200 pounds and I am still going strong, I can breath easier, move more fluidly, and my general demeanor is much better, highly recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly it has been observed that the brain can show physical changes with patients that show some depressive symptoms. It certainly seems logical that changes could occur over time either through different regions experiencing different activity or possibly inflammation for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain is also directly connected to our gut via the vagus nerve so any disturbances in the microbiome can translate to and manifest in the brain as a chemical imbalance. So your diet and certain medication (antibiotics) may actually have a lot more to due with mental health than previously thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you care about research, I think the answer should be 'no one knows' beyond eating healthy and not to excess.  Exercise, though, is pretty well established as reducing depressive symptoms.  The gut/brain connection is getting a lot of hype right now, so be careful about specific claims and clickbait headlines.  I think the best supported advice at this point is eat healthy, exercise, and don't be obese. . .as a depression sufferer myself, all of those things are far easier said than done, but if you can give it a go for a few weeks, you'll most likely see an improvement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nutrition is obviously a massive subject but obviously cutting out the nasties like processed foods, sugar, and alcohol as a starting point on top of a balanced diet with lots of veg and fruit. However foods that specifically contain tryptophan are numerous but some examples <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan" target="_blank">here</a> under dietary sources.</p>
<p>If not taking SSRI’s and with medical consultation I would also recommend a supplement of 5-HTP daily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5-HTP as a supplement is actually not very effective at all if taken on its own.</p>
<p>5-HTP is converted to Serotonin by the enzyme AAAD (Aromatic L-amino Acid Decarboxylase). But when converting 5-HTP to Serotonin in the GI tract, it's broken down into inactive metabolites when it gets sent to your liver by monoamine oxidase.</p>
<p>If taking 5-HTP as a supplement, you should also be taking AAAD inhibitors. Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG) found in green tea extract is a natural AAAD inhibitor.</p>
<p>If you're going to be taking any supplements, L-Tryptophan would be preferred which is a precursor to 5-HTP, though the effect isn't as immediate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5htp and tyrosine compete for synthesis into serotonin and dopamine respectively due to limited decarboxylase. If someone only supplements one, the other will suffer. There's this whole timing and dosage thing that needs to be gotten right to not upset the other system via amino acid supplementation that's unique to the individual. </p>

<p>People always seem to be concerned about 5htp causing heart damage due to its 5htb activation which causes irregularities in the timing of your heart valves or something. </p>
<p>5htp did more good for me than any antidepressant ever did by far, but it's not without risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the time i drew the line that 100% me or someone else's phone was spying was when me and a 3 of my friends randomly got into this conversation somehow, and my phone was dead and not with me, another's was in another room, and there was one andoid and one iphone both on and in the room while we talked about fecal transplants</p>
<p>then about an hour later i opened my laptop and the first advertisement i see is for fecal transplant clinics </p>
<p>and i said &quot;okay there is like less than a 75% chance i am seeing fecal transplant ads on my laptops because of my own search history or that this is just a coincidence&quot;</p></div>		</li>
