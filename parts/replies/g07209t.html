			<div class="markdown"><p>So theoretically they should be launched from the top of mt Everest?</p>
<p>...and couldn't some sort of carrier take them high up in the atmosphere,  and then the rocket &quot;launches/start&quot; from an higher altitude? (..hmm now when i think about it SpaceXs &quot;landing&quot; rocket is kind of like that)</p>
<p>But what I'm looking for is a &quot;longer way&quot; - that don't use as much energy as going straight up fast as a bullet...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s been asked a lot of times and the answer is yes but no. Yes they would require less fuel to get in orbit but no it wouldn’t be more efficient because it would require much more fuel (not to mention the whole logistics hassle) to get the rocket to the Mount Everest.</p>
<p>But as you said, not only spacex but all launches are already made with multiple stage vehicles so the payload itself is technically already being launched from a higher level in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT ive been corrected. mt everest is at the same latitude as cape canaveral.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hard part about getting to orbit is not getting up, it's getting enough sideways speed that you don't come crashing down to earth again.  Essentially being in orbit means that you are moving sideways so fast that as you are falling back down to the earth, you keep missing it because you are moving out of the way so fast.  For most orbits (other than polar orbits), what is important is being near the equator because you can take advantage of the speed of the earth's rotation.  That's why the US launches from southern Florida and the ESA launches from French Guiana.  That's also why you launch heading east, and to prevent things that might go wrong from landing on people, launching from the east coast over the ocean is a good idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Everything makes sense when you put it like that... it's easy to just think that a rocket &quot;goes straight up in the sky&quot; and that they prefer Florida because &quot;they might have advantageous weather&quot;, or whatever... but i guess those rocket scientist are put some real thoughts behind their decisions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. </p>
<p>Yes, rockets don't shoot straight up. They <em>do</em> shoot straighter up than most people could shoot a rifle if they were trying to shoot straight up, and a lot of rockets start out straight and then change course (shortly) after launch. </p>
<p>Yes, they follow a calculated arc. </p>
<p>No, the &quot;slightest change&quot; is extremely unlikely to be a disaster. Slight changes are expected and launch systems designed to handle those changes. Wind happens fairly often on Earth. </p>
<p>One of ULAs big selling points is that their software can also recognize when slight changes don't happen or are even slighter than expected, and then use the fuel that saves to give their payload an extra boost if the customer has said they'd like to have one. This can massively increase the service life of interplanetary missions as they can save some of the fuel they were going to use to leave Earth to instead use on course corrections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone asked if they should be launched from Mt. Everest (theoretically), and the answers to that were very illuminating. So I have a question of my own...</p>
<p>What about a big slingshot type of system that yeets the rocket to a higher altitude? Again, theoretically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An actual slingshot wouldn't work for practical reasons, but there are ideas about using some kind of ground-based system that basically &quot;shoots&quot; a rocket out of a cannon/railgun-type launcher to give it a large initial speed boost.  Like the &quot;catapult&quot; booster systems they use for launching planes off of aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>This works better if you don't need to have people onboard, so you can accelerate it at really high rates without injuring or killing the pilots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(adding on)</p>
<p>Basically, they don't do it now because you still need lots of fuel, so the launch vehicle would still be very big, and catapulting something that big in any useful way would require such high G-forces that it would tear it apart.  Reinforcing the vehicle so that it could withstand the catapult forces would make it heavier, making it harder to launch, etc.</p>
<p>With a small enough satellite and long enough mag-rail, you could do it.  However, such a system would look suspiciously like a rapid-fire global nuke delivery device, so nobody has funded such a thing.</p>
<p>Instead, Amazon will build it, eventually, and everyone will embrace it as an innovation in global Prime shipping then be completely surprised when Jeff Bezos declares himself World Dictator For Life.  The world governments quickly concede vs. the prospect of nukes landing on their doorstep in under an hour.  There will initially be small bands of resistance fighters, but they are short-lived as Amazon threatens to cancel their Prime memberships.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't impart a lot of energy, the contraption is a complete waste.</p>
<p>If you do impart a lot of energy, 2 problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>All of that energy/acceleration is imparted over the length of the slingshot. This means a lot of g-forces, which means the entirety of your launch vehicle now has to be built to withstand even higher forces, making the rest of the spacecraft even heavier. This is especially problematic for human spaceflight because people can only withstand a limited amount of force.</li>
<li>All of that acceleration means you'll be going very fast very quickly. Aerodynamic resistance is proportional to the square of velocity. So the rocket would experience something similar to reentry heating at launch time.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are concepts to use a large linear motor (rail gun) in either a straight line or a circular ring to accelerate and help with the initial launch. However the scale that you would have to build is massive and very expensive. Also the acceleration required to make it worth it in such a short distance is more than humans can survive. 17000 mph is really really fast so a few hundred mph just isn't worth the effort, and thousands of mph would take a track that was miles long.</p></div>		</li>
