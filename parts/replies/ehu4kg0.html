			<div class="markdown"><p>Since I am a biologist, let me add this: There is no proof that changing the ratio of positive and negative ions has any effect on your health. Your body is more than a heap of ions and regulates itself pretty well most of the time. Same goes for most detox and cleansing scams (maybe with the exception of heavy metal contamination).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Since I'm a physicist, let me add this: if it were <strong>possible</strong> to change the ratio of positive to negative ions in your body by 1 part in a million, repulsive electrical forces of trillions of pounds would <strong>explosively rip your body to pieces</strong>, releasing an amount of energy equal to a really big truck bomb (30 tons TNT).  The explosion would level nearby buildings and leave a pretty substantial crater.  </p>
<p>Fortunately it's impossible.</p>
<p>(The math, abbreviated)</p>
<p>80 kg * 1% salts by weight / 30 .0g/mol = 27 mol of ions</p>
<p>27 <em> avogadro's number </em> electron charge = 2.5e6 C</p>
<p>1 part in a million = 2.5 C.  Treat as two equal charges an average of 0.1 meter away.</p>
<p>Coulomb's Law:</p>
<p>9e9 * (1.25 C)^2 / (.1 m)^2 = 1.4e12 N</p>
<p>Rough potential energy estimate:</p>
<p>9e9 * (1.25 C)^2 / (0.1 m) = 1.4e11 N = 30 tons TNT</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You'd produce an oscillating magnetic field, which you can also get from the transmitter system in an MRI machine.</p>
<p>If you turn that transmitter up all the way, overriding safety mechanisms if necessary, the induced electrical fields will become strong enough to cause some uncontrolled muscle contractions at first, if the field is very strong it can mess with the heartbeat and cause cardiac arrest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any moving magnetic field will induce a current in a conductor of a direction 90° to the direction of the magnetic field.</p>
<p>And since the reverse is also true, your body would have e it's own extremely tiny magnetic field, just from the electrical current through your nerves.</p>
<p>Btw if you move, you are also moving through the earth's magnetic field, (which would be the same as magnet moving around you).</p></div>		</li>
