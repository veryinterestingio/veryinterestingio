<li>I think the metriorhynchids are the most interesting excursion in body plan among crocodylomorphs. They were superficially similar to modern dolphins or killer whales, with tail fins and short, flipper-like limbs, while their closest relatives have a body plan similar to living gharials. Here's a link to a Scientific American article about them: <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/awesome-sea-going-crocodyliforms-of-mesozoic/" target="_blank"><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/awesome-sea-going-crocodyliforms-of-mesozoic/" target="_blank">https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/awesome-sea-going-crocodyliforms-of-mesozoic/</a></a></li>
<li>the myth that dinosaurs are the only interesting fossil groups</li>
<li>I suppose what drew me to paleontology was my interest in the huge diversity of animals on the planet today. After finding out that this is dwarfed by the diversity of extinct animals, I was hooked on paleontology. Also, I personally tend to be most interested in evolution over long time scales, and paleontology is the place to study this.</li>

<p>I suppose, studying ancient crocodiles, you've seen a lot of long time &quot;scales&quot;.</p>
<p>On that note , I recently read about something called lagerstatten which are areas of exceptionally well preserved fossils. I find these kind of amazing. Are there any lesser known examples you might have come across?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the myth that you can tell alligators from crocodiles based on the shape of the snout.  American alligators do, indeed, have broader snouts than some crocodiles, but some crocodiles have comparatively broad snouts (e.g. the mugger and Siamese crocodiles), and there are caimans with very narrow snouts.  And all bets are off when you include fossils.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Dental occlusion is a better way to tell, though zoo animals sometimes violate the rule.  Alligators have an overbite, and crocodiles have inter fingering dention - the lower teeth can be seen clearly when the jaws are closed.  (In captivity, the jaws sometimes grow in odd ways that make alligators mimic a crocodile-like occlusal pattern.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Both are derived from an ancestral condition that no longer exists.  The ancestor of crocodiles and alligators had a notch between the maxilla and premaxilla for reception of a large tooth on the lower jaw, but an overbite behind it.  Alligators lost the notch (it became a pit, though the side of the pit sometimes wears away with age in caimans), and crocodiles lost the overbite.</p></div>		</li>
