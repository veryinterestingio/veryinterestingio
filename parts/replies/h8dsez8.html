<p>I'm afraid that's not quite right. We have measures of physical connectivity of white matter (the &quot;wiring&quot; that connects brain regions) from MRI diffusion tensor imaging, and evidence of how information flows between regions from fMRI and EEG measures of &quot;functional connectivity&quot;. These are currently crude and not well understood, but they do exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the extra details on current brain imaging techniques. I lumped them all together in ‘indirect’ evidence category (as fMRI and EEG only shows functional association between area activity and task as I described), but perhaps that doesn’t do diffusion tensor MRI justice.</p>
<p>However, my understanding is that DTI, as a matter of principle, only images myelinated nerve tracts, which is only a minority of the estimated total connections in the brain. It does give us a lot of information about the overall structure of the brain’s connections, but still leaves much more details out, right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes for fMRI, EEG FC is perhaps slightly more nuanced because it can show us synchronisation of brain areas at particular neural frequencies, in and out of phase with each other. There are some inferences from this that go beyond basic associations such as &quot;area x was active at the same time as area y&quot;. </p>
<p>But similar to your point about DTI only telling us about myelinated tracts, EEG only arises from cortical pyramidal neurons in clusters that happen to be spacially aligned in the right way for the electrical signal to sum across neurons and make its way through the volume of the brain, skull and scalp to the electrodes. So it is a narrow-ish slice of brain activity, abstracted at least a couple of times before we analyse it! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a whole world of invasive methods though, most very well understood and developed in-vivo in animals, some used in-vivo in humans too. </p>
<p>For example, extra- and intra-cellular electrophysiology which can be used to resolve single neuron processes as well as population dynamics, across different populations on timescales much shorter than a single action potential. Direct imaging which is mostly microscopy with enough tech and power to resolve cells both structurally and functionally at the same time, even in 3D stacks. We can manipulate cells to shine on our cameras when they perform a certain process and then record videos of a whole population of cells interacting. Then there are also neural tracers that you can inject, they are then taken up by cells and projected either downstream (i.e. where the cell connects to) or upstream (i.e. what connected to that cell). This dyes the axons and dendrites so you can literally see the wiring of the brain.</p></div>		</li>
