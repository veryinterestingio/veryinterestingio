			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh you people are such a wonderful being, there is no way one can thank you enough for your services. You people work tirelessly, selflessly all the time, give your double best just to save a soul you hardly know. Yet you ask nothing in return, there is no feeling of pride and all of these you do it effortlessly day after day and again and whenever it is asked to you. There is nothing the world can do for you in comparison to what you do for us. I know you're out there working, working more than it is expected from you, working like your life is on it. Please take care of yourself. Have some bananas and milk for strength. We need you to be strong in a critical situation like this because we won't make it without you people.
I love you guys so much. Thank you for being there.</p></div>		</li>
