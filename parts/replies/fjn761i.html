			<div class="markdown"><p>We always test regardless of if you know your blood type or not.  You can still have immune reactions.  </p>
<p>In an emergency you will get O- because it's the universal donor, but it's a relatively scarce resource, so it's better to save it for people who need it, so if there is time, we will test your blood and give you something else instead.</p>
<p>To answer the question of how much blood, we run a test called a CBC or complete blood count. On that we can test your hemoglobin which ranges between 12-16 ish. When this number is low, it is associated with anemia, or lack of red blood cells.  The threshold to transfuse varies with institutions or practices but usually you transfuse for a hemoglobin less than 7 or 8, or active bleeding, or symptomatic anemia.  Transfusable blood does not come in whole blood, but something we call packed red blood cells, which is just red blood cells with a bit of citrate for anticlotting, and the blood serum removed (plasma, platelets, etc) which comes in an approximately 300mL bag.  One can roughly guess that receiving 1 unit of PRBC will increase hemoglobin by 1 point. So if your hemoblobin was 6, one would guess after a 2 unit transfusion, your hemoglobin would come up to 8ish.</p>

<p>In a civilian setting, there isn't any regulatory procedure, and I've met many people who are just flat out wrong and don't know their exact blood type. </p>
<p>It's much safer to assume you don't know their blood type and pump O-, than it is to take a delirious person at their word. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is TOTALLY a 100% nitpicky thing that doesn’t matter and I’m only saying it for general education purposes, but it’s actually type and screened, not type and crossed.</p>
<p>A type and screen checks what your blood type is (the “type”) and then looks (“screens”) to see if your blood has any antibodies against other antigens that are found on the surface of blood components. This is done using a general purpose test, you don’t need any donor blood to do it. One of the limitations is that it only checks for the most common antibodies. There’s still the possibility that you could have antibodies against something that wasn’t tested for.</p>
<p>A type and cross is when you have a patient’s blood and you have a specific unit of blood you’re thinking of giving them, and you check to see if they’re compatible with each other.</p>
<p>So the difference is that with a screen, you’re only looking at the recipient’s blood, whereas with a cross you’re looking at the recipient’s AND the donor’s blood together. You usually order a T&amp;C when you know there’s a very good chance the person might need blood, and you want the blood bank to have a specific unit set and ready to go so there’s no delays in getting the transfusion (say, before a high-risk surgery.) You get a T&amp;S when you may give a transfusion, but it’s something that could wait the hour or so it takes for the lab to cross-match the blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What youre describing is a crossmatch. An antibody screen is as u/maelmare explains below. </p>
<p>Most people do not have a positive antibody screen. A common cause of a positive antibody screen is having a history of blood transfusion or pregnancy. This happens when your immune system sees blood with a different antigenic make up than it's own and creates antibodies towards certain antigens that it itself does not have. It sees part of the donor blood as foreign and will 'protect' itself in case it sees that again. This is why it's extremely important to figure out if the patient has made an antibody, because if we dont and transfuse them with blood that is positive for that antigen, their immune system will try to destroy the donor blood causing a mess of potentially lethal results. </p>
<p>It's important to remember... O neg is the universal donor, yes, unless you have an antibody. ABORhD is the most basic of blood typing, but we have MANY other antigen systems on our red cells that can complicate transfusion. Most doctors and especially nurses are never taught this. Blood banking education for doctors and nurses is criminally poor. Thats why we as medical lab scientists exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a lab tech. This isn't my exact field but to the best of my knowledge: </p>
<p>Basically there are many antibodies in every blood stream. There are the primary blood types, A, AB, B, and O. Then there are positive and negative of each which are related to the RH antibody. If you are negative for RH and RH-positive cells are introduced, your antibodies will seek and destroy those cells. </p>
<p>In addition to those, there are many other antigens on every cell that can react the same way, don't quote me but I believe learning in lab tech school that there are 30-40 other antigens to screen for to make sure there is no rejection of cells, be it blood or organs from a donor.</p>
<p>This is why the most likely kidney/lung/liver or what have you donations come from a genetic relative, they are most likely to share an exact antibody match to yours.</p></div>		</li>
