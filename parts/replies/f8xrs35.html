<p>Honestly you should say, this is a very speculative hypothesis in theoretical physics that is all but the mainstream standard model.  </p>
<p>It could be that way, but it's all but certain. Standard model is the total energy of the universe is constant and has always been the same since big bang. Where that came from, we have no idea.</p>
