			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory maybe. But men generally have much, much less hair- both shorter in length and fewer in number of working follicles, thanks to the horror that is male pattern baldness.</p>
<p>When your hair is only a few cm long the oils and sebum from your scalp do a great job of keeping things in good shape, so you don't notice or cares much if your shampoo is overly harsh.</p>
<p>But if you want hair that is both long AND healthy you need to start taking better care of it or the stands will dry out and break off. So &quot;women's&quot; shampoos and conditioners will generally have higher quality ingredients and additives to combat breakage and the abuse styling puts on your hair. I say generally bc capitalism.... There's a lot of shitty shampoo that is targeted at women that is 100% marketing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using female shampoo and razors, especially the razors are often much better since they're made for use on much more area (legs) and more sensitive skin. And they barely cost more than men's :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im calling call bullshit on the razors being better. The actual blades are identical between male and female. The only diffence is design and marketing. Female razors tend to have plastic safety guards and extra lubricants around the blades, and usually have curved &amp; contoured handles, where men's are simpler because of masculine design language and the need for more precision &amp; control with the blade. A lot of men's razors have fold away lubricants because it gets in the way of making a clean straight edge when you're trimming your facial hair.</p>
<p>Female cosmetics &amp; hygiene products cost more because our society says women need to spend time and money focusing on their appearance. Period. The actual products are usually exactly the same &amp; just marketed as being higher quality. Or, in some cases like deodorants and anti-perspirants, the female version can actually contain less of the active ingredients and come in smaller volumes yet still cost more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank about that for a second... Women's hair styling is more expensive. Clothes are more expensive. The have jewelry they wear. Their shoes are more expensive. Their body products are more expensive. They have to use hygiene products. They sometimes get railroaded at the dealership or car repair shops. PLUS they get paid less... What a load of crap! How do y'all even have money for food and rent?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Men's are more for greasy and dandruff-prone hair because most men have short but thick hair while women tend to have longer hair which is prone to damage, so their shampoos are more about gentle cleansing and damage prevention/repair. Head&amp;shoulders would fuck up my damaged hair for example. Bf has long hair and i buy him women's hair products because his hair is very thin and prone to breakage and regular  men's shampoos dried it out too much.
Really they are about what kind of hair they are for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It becomes rough to the touch, the ends split in two, it usually occurs from heat styling, bleaching and dyeing but even long hair getting rubbed against your clothes and being exposed to the elements can damage it a little, that's why long hair needs more care than short hair. I bleached my hair so much once, it literaly broke off at shoulder length it became so weak</p></div>		</li>
