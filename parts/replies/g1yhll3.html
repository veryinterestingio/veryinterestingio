<p>Frisson, that tingly feeling you get from listening to music sometimes, is our body responding to certain sounds or images. It sometimes comes with a pleasurable mindstate, piloerectiin (goose bumps) or pupil dilation (your pupils getting wider). </p>
<p>the physical feeling stems from your nerves and the mental feeling stems from your reward system in your brain. Frisson may be triggered in a different kind of way from person to person, or may even be absent. However, it usually happens when listening to music or someone speak, and the music/speech differs from your expectations in a pleasurable way.</p>
<p>The feeling is quite short (up to a few seconds at most) and usually comes up slowly and moves like a wave through your body.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always wondered what triggered this feeling. This seems to nail it for me. An example for me is that Charlie Chaplin speech in The Great Dictator movie that’s on YouTube with titles like “Greatest Speech EVER!!”</p>
<p>I was drawn in by the clickbait and the speech starts off really slow, boring and monotonous and I immediately thought “this is boring AF” and my expectations dropped really low. But as I continue to listen it starts gaining rhythm and momentum like a great song. Then the part comes where he’s really animated and really loud and pouring his heart out and every hair was standing on end with chills all over my body. </p>
<p>The speech kinda reminds me of Bohemian Rhapsody. It builds and builds and then starts slamming. </p>
<p>This speech was in the movies in 1940. About 2 years before America entered the war. After this speech Chaplin gave he was essentially ran out the United States. He was accused of being an Anti-American communist sympathizer. He’s in good company though for that era. A bunch of intelligent and great men in the U.S. were labeled as UnAmerican pinkos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was written by OP then I'd agree, but given this was taken from Wikipedia, I think it's entirely reasonable to use &quot;piloerection&quot; in place of &quot;goosebumps&quot; in that context. There's a reasonable argument to be made that OP should have condensed the wikipedia article into plain language for the sake of &quot;ELI5&quot; though.</p></div>		</li>
