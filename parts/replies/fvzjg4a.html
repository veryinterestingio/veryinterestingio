			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah of course, <em>nothing dies of old age</em>. I forgot to consider that ‘old age’ is a loose term that doesn’t even really mean anything specific. Now I feel silly. Haha</p>
<p>Great breakdown of info, thank you!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that in a clinical sense, nothing &quot;dies of old age&quot;</p>
<p>That's not to say aging isn't a thing. Oxidative stress for example, is thought to be one of the causes of aging (i.e. the oxygen that sustains you also slowly &quot;kills&quot; you. Or more accurately reduces cell function to the inevitable point of death)</p>
<p>I can't say 100% what the mechanism is, but it would appear that over time a lot of cells degenerate, for whatever reason</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah. If you lived long enough, you'd eventually die of &quot;organs too weak too function due to permanent wear-out,&quot; so to speak. E.g., congestive heart failure. That's about as close to legitimately &quot;dying of old age&quot; as you can get.  While you might list a specific outcome on the COD, the issue's rather moot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this mean that COVID-19, which reduces blood oxygen concentration in some asymptomatic patients (I.E. happy hypoxia) could theoretically extend lifespan by reducing oxidative stress on the body?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some trees, particularly fruit trees and other small/fast-growing species, actually have remarkably short lifespans - under 50 years, with some even being under 20 (<a href="https://www.gardenguides.com/12617467-life-span-of-tree-species.html" target="_blank">source A</a>, <a href="https://leafnetworkaz.org/resources/LEARN/Tree%20Life%20Span.pdf" target="_blank">source B</a> - not super scientific sources, but what I could find easily). Peach trees in particular are apparently extremely short-lived.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to grow back yard peaches. The tree takes 3 - 4 year to really start producing, goes great guns for maybe three years, then enters a rapid decline where the fruit get smaller and less numerous. By year ten orchard trees are destroyed (to make room for a different crop), and in home orchards fungal disease eventually causes fruiting to stop completely, followed by the tree's death within a year or two. All tree fruits in the rose family, including apple, pear, plum, etc. suffer a similar fate. The exception is Asian pears, which follow the same cycle but over a 20 - 25 year cycle instead of 8.</p>
<p>Totally worth it, though. The taste of a tree-ripened peach compared to store-bought, is very much like the difference between backyard tomatoes and the mealy things the grocery sells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some maples are notoriously short-lived, I seem to recall Norway maples typically make it to about 40 years, silver maples have a &quot;useful&quot; lifespan of about 50 years.</p>
<p>But manage to root a cutting, it'll probably grow just fine. How many times you could repeat that? I don't know. Anecdotally, some plants seem to show changes after multiple &quot;photocopies&quot; are handed down, others not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some varieties have been maintained as cuttings for thousands of years with no discernible decrease in vigor. However they can become more vulnerable to disease because they are not evolving in tandem with their pathogens anymore. I'm sure there is some natural rate of mutation happening, but since more cuttings are easy to make, any that don't perform well are probably not used to propagate more trees. Consequently there is some level of natural selection happening, which will prevent the buildup of major deleterious mutations. If you deliberately kept the same line going I imagine there eventually would be problems, but it might be a long time before they were noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting fact as well is, that by cutting trees you can keep them young. Some old hedges around towns and across borders are still alive and visible as wide trees with a lot of branches, although that species itself would not get so old. Continuous care and cutting every year since hundreds of years kept them alive</p></div>		</li>
