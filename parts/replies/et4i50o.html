			<div class="markdown"><p>The mountain I grew up on had one of these. It was always easy to tell when a ski school had just finished its session because you'd be riding up the lift and it'd come to a stop 4 times from all the people falling while getting on at normal speed. (They'd often slow it down for a school so they could learn)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, we had a control panel next to where to attendant stood that would slow and even stop it. Where I worked we had midnight skiing sessions on the weekends which were fun to work because of all the drunk people. They were also stressful to work because of all the drunk people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best was when you were getting on a lift with a buddy and they ate shit getting on. The attendant would stop the lift sometimes while you were like 5 feet in the air, while your buddy is getting back to his feet. Perfect distance to softly mutter &quot;you idiot&quot; while safely far enough away from any reprecussions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of my favourite runs in France are served by really long old 2-seater lifts that really move, and as they lead to black runs or off-piste the lift attendants often just leave it to the presumed confident skiers/boarders to sort themselves out. One of them in particular has quite a high chair at the pickup so if youâ€™re not ready for it it whacks you right in the back of the knee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the mountain bike park I ride at (converted defunct ski mountain) they've replaced half the lifts with bike carriers. You have to have one guy get inside the lift circle and one outside, walk along with the carriage as it comes in to get your bike on properly, then catch the next lift. Attendants pull your bike off at the top. If you make a small mistake loading an attendant will jog out and fix it for you, but at least once a season I see the lift get stopped for some poor sap who couldn't get it done in time.</p></div>		</li>
