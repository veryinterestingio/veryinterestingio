			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly one year ago I had a couple of months of this. After an episode in which I was stuck on a moving train and felt like I couldn't breathe and had a panic attack (a short one, I hopped down at the next station, not mine, and walked home in the freezing cold instead of in the hot train, that kept me occupied and distracted from the anxiety somehow).</p>
<p>After that time it would happen that one moment I was having a good time with friends and the next would be &quot;damn what if I had a panic attack right now, that would suck!&quot; aaaaand down we go cya brain.</p>
<p>It took a lot of mental restrain, research on the causes and self control to get out of that cycle and never get into agoraphobia. Focusing on slow breathing, realizing my brain was actually misfiring, and all that jazz. </p>
<p>I feel like I was extremely lucky with that.</p>
<p>But it's also past now, so to reassure anyone struggling with this: talk to an expert, you'll get better in no time with some exercise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah dude I let the cycle get so bad I was having a panic attack every couple hours that became full blown agoraphobia and evening seeing another person in front of me was enough to scare me to break me down to violent shakes from so much adrenaline coursing through me. Took months of mental practice to not be scared of a stiff breeze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once you've had one, it's so hard to not be afraid of when/if it might happen again, which just perpetuates the whole process. </p></div>		</li>
