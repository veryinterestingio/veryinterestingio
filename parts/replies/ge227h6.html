			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also been suggested that there has been quite a bit of subsequent migration between the land masses using stepping stone islands that would hide a lot of the ancient vicariance signal you’re suggesting <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2009.00300.x" target="_blank">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2009.00300.x</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually a lot of interesting examples of species linking the Indian and Madagascan fauna. One that comes to my mind is a fairly recently discovered frog grouped, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasikabatrachus" target="_blank">purple frogs</a>. But if you dig a little bit deeper you will surely find a lot more and like the beetle example that That_Biology_Guy gave they are all likely specialized species with some cool gimmick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They crossed over from mainland Africa after Madagascar was already a separate island.  The paper by Poux et al. that I linked above estimates that lemurs arrived between 50 and 60 million years ago (so probably quite soon after splitting from their sister group, the lorises and galagos).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've just now added <em>Scoliopsis</em> into a presentation about South America and the GABI in reference to India as another continent/island.  I came back to this comment specifically to get the name of the beetle and I feel like I should cite you lol.</p></div>		</li>
