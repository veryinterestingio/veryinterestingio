Objectively speaking, any sort of loading or progress bar is going to slow down whatever it is you're doing, because you're requiring the computer to do whatever work is taking enough time that a loading bar feels necessary, <em>plus</em> the work of displaying and updating a loading bar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an ideal progress bar, 0 to 10% should take same time as 90% to 100% by any reasonable definition of progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd argue that for a definition of progress that is &quot;the number of tasks in this job divided by the total number of tasks required to complete the job&quot; is a reasonable definition of progress, but if your steps take different amounts of time to complete, then the last 10 task could take more time than the first 10.</p>
<p>I'd agree that ideally, every percentage should be a percentage of the time it should take, and intuitively this makes sense to us as humans, but computers aren't humans, they're rocks we've shoved lightning into in order to trick them into thinking. They don't have any concept of how long something will take unless we explicitly spell it out.</p>
<p>Moreover, because a computer today is multipurpose it can be impossible to realistically ascertain how much time even each individual step will take, much less the total amount of time you're going to spend doing something.</p>
<p>Take a simple download: In theory, this should be the simplest progress bar: your computer is taking instructions on what a file should look like and writing that down. It should know how big the file is and how fast it can write that information, so it should know how much time that will take, right?</p>
<p>But now assume that you're on a shared network gigabit connection but your roommates start watching netflix and playing WoW and doing a bunch of other stuff that is bandwidth intensive; suddenly you've got some fraction of the download speed you had a second ago.</p>
<p>Now take that, and apply it to any unexpected task that could take up any resource in your computer, including things like switching hard drive sector to find unallocated bits to write (and writing the instruction to skip to the next sector to continue reading) or loading the data into RAM to process the next instructions when there is already a bunch of RAM being used, so it has to process those instructions then pull the rest from disk (or from the server again) once it's done, and repeat that...</p>
<p>It's a wonder we get any accuracy, when the system is that complex.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, progress bars were made so that users would have an indication that the computer was still processing the task assigned, and hadn't hung up or stopped working. In that regard, the spinning cursor is the best way of doing that, since it isn't specific.</p></div>		</li>
