<p>Sleep Myths: you can get too much sleep</p>

<p>Does this mean that &quot;oversleeping&quot; isn't a thing? It says <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3010336/" target="_blank">here</a> that oversleeping can increase mortality risk, but maybe I'm interpreting something wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Study seems to be generalized and makes a point that factors leading to higher mortality still need to be identified, e.g. &quot;oversleepers&quot; suffer higher mortality but they do not know why and it may not be because of sleep length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading a study that stated that a good portion of oversleepers had underlying medical issues which caused the need to sleep. Over time, these medical issue arise which cause high mortality. </p>
<p>I think the study was dealing with diabetes or hypertension. But it’s been awhile since I’ve read it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any information on how to determine the best amount of sleep for a person? I've had nights where I slept 8-9 hours and felt drowsy and lethargic all day, and nights where I got 4-5 and woke up ready to go with no negative effects. Is there some science-backed method of narrowing down through specific observations what the optimal amount is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my personal experiments with my own body, it's the amount of darkness I get in night (ie my visual cortex is off/dormant) that determines how refreshed I feel the next day; it's about 9 or 10 hours for me. So even if I sleep only say 7 hours but i stay/lie in bed with lights off (screens - phone say off), simply staring the  ceiling, I still feel as refreshed as I may get 9 hours solid sleep. Also my body tells when it's done with sleep, usually if I do heavy learning the previous day, the brain seem to do all post processing/number crunching in the night sleep - once this is done, it signals body to wake up. If i'm not learning much in a day, probably I am ok to wake up with less say 8 hours sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interested in that as well. I tend to sleep significantly less than the suggested amount (normally 6.5 hours/night) and I would really like to know if that is just habitual or if it is actually my rythm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>although alcohol may be effective in sleep induction, it impairs sleep during the second half of the night and can lead to a reduction in overall sleep time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>alcohol may affect the normal production of chemicals in the body that trigger sleepiness when you’ve been awake for a long time, and subside once you’ve had enough sleep. After drinking, production of adenosine (a sleep-inducing chemical in the brain) is increased, allowing for a fast onset of sleep. But it subsides as quickly as it came, making you more likely to wake up before you’re truly rested.  </p>
<p>people get lower-quality sleep following alcohol is that it blocks  REM sleep  </p>
<p>makes you more prone to  snoring and sleep apnea.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the same count for benzodiazepines? Although alcohol has a broader interaction with the body than on mainly the GABA receptors, there is overlap in how they work. We often give benzo's to aid in sleep, but does that actually help for sleep quality?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/swincandle has a great summary of why alcohol can decrease quality of sleep. I just wanted to add that alcohol also inhibits the hormone <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/aldosterone" target="_blank">Aldosterone</a> which is in charge of conserving water while you are sleeping (and therefor fasting). Inhibition of this hormone can lead to more frequent trips to the restroom during the night!</p></div>		</li>
