			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple analogy:</p>
<p>Imagine a door with a very simple cylinder lock. Someone could break that door open with a lock pick.</p>
<p>Now we use the same door but lock it using a simple chain. The lock pick will be of no use now, but a saw can cut the chain.</p>
<p>Both the lock and the chain are a way to prevent someone from entering, but both require a different tool to break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes, good analogy.  To further it, you could also lock that door by putting an anvil in front of it. Or welding it shut.  Or gluing it.  Or putting a wedge under the door.  There is no one solution that will open all of these.  It is impossible.</p></div>		</li>
