			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I had a bottle of wine from 1973, a couple months ago we opened it and everyone got to try some. Frankly I couldn't tell you if it was better than the $8 bottles we get at Costco. I wish I sold it as it was worth about $450. Have a bunch of bottles from the 90's and probably sell them instead of trying them for novelty's sake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its why I'm not afraid to admit I really enjoy wines I find for $5 or less. I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means, but, while an expensive wine may be more deeply complex, and deceptivly delicious, I also enjoy the cheaper, similarly delicious varieties I find while doing my weekly grocery shop, or adventurous outing. There's nothing wrong with liking a cheap wine if it gives you the happys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only purchased good bottles of wine a few times on online auctions. Each time I reached out to the vineyard where it originated it from and asked for recipes or food that would pair well with their wine. They usually are happy to respond. It has never led to a disappointing experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember watching a wine yt video recently because I was trying to learn about wine and at one point the wine expert made the comment that great higher priced wines are wasted on people without wine experiences as they don't know what they are tasting and what to look for. It seemed like he was advocating starting with more affordable wine, experience the variations, find out what you like or don't like, and start building up your palate before jumping into higher priced wines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked with a guy who had been into high end wine and trained his pallette to appreciate the differences in expensive wines. Out of practice he would top out around $30-50 a bottle as there wasn't a point to anything more expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have taught many beginners wine over the years and 100% agree. Hell, I had that experience too. When I started average wines seemed complex and interesting, and as i matured and tasted more wines and was drilled in tasting techniques by somms, my palate sort of naturally evolved to much more complex and expensive wines (as they often had the most going on). Cheaper wines, while easy to drink, I honestly began to find a bit boring. I often try and share complex and pricier bottles with inexperienced tasters so they can get an idea, and usually they say “oh that’s kinda nice I guess”. But as they mature in their tasting ability I notice them gravitating more and more towards those wines. Only problem is of course my palate has now completely exceeded my modest bank account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pro tip: read the description or tasting review of a higher end booze before drinking it, so you know how it’s supposed to taste. That actually influences how you perceive it. (For most people)</p>
<p>I mean, there’s a diminishing rate of return on the cost of that drink, but with a little education, it can be enjoyable to sip a “higher end” glass of wine.</p>
<p>Or just stick to less expensive stuff. No shame in drinking what you like; I like $10 bourbon barrel 13 crimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was friends with a wine expert. She was in sales but sold to the restaurants and had to be able to educate people on the product as part of her job. </p>
<p>She told me that price point is more about marketing than taste and other than super cheap wine, like the 3 dollar bottles most people cant tell the difference in blind tatse tests. And if they're told a 30 dollar wine is a 300 dollar vintage wine they'll believe it. And you can reverse it too and say something crazy expensive is cheap.</p>
<p>Now that being said that doesnt mean an older wine has no reason to be more expensive. You also have to take I to account the years put into keeping and caring for the wine properly before its released.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, given that professional exams literally include a blind tasting element (which increases in difficulty as the level of qualification increases), from personal experience it's very possible to nail down a variety, likely region, age range etc if you're actually actively training to do so. Like every skill it's all about putting in the time and effort, when I was working in retail and sampling numerously different wines per day and getting my qualifications my palate was a lot better than now when I don't get as much or as frequent exposure to different wines as I used to get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher priced wine is more expensive due to its exclusivity, and not because of taste. Most expensive bottles are made from a very specific crop/location of grapes, some of which the vines are over 100 years old. The cheaper stuff is usually outsourced grapes, and mass produced from crops that are all over the country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely not true, apart from a handful of highly sought after wines, which would be expensive anyway under the following criteria.</p>
<p>Not all vines are the same. You talk about 100 year old vines. These vines are very low yielding because of their age, but have roots deep into the earth to extract nutrients (possibly their own roots, possibly anti-phyloxerra roots grafted on). Low yields = more expensive and also higher quality.</p>
<p>Just a simple thing like the age of the vines can make a big difference in the yield per hectare and thus the amount of money that can be made at a given sale price.</p>
<p>Add on to that the severity of the sorting (i.e. how many % are lost to keep quality high by chucking out lower quality grapes), the cost of picking/sorting by hand rather than machine, the cost of oak barrels rather than concrete/steel - oak is only &quot;new&quot; once, each subsequent usage has less effect on flavour - and so on. Different oenological interventions all have costs and thus the bottles all have different starting costs, irrespective of how desirable the label is.</p>
