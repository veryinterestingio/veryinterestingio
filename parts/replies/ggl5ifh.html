			<div class="markdown"><p>Hang on, how does that work? I only know up to electrons absorbing photons to change energy levels, so if I'm way off already because it's a plasma with no intact atoms, stop me now</p>
<p>If an atom has an electron at energy level X and a photon with energy Y comes in, the electron will absorb it and jump to energy level X+Y, if the atom has an appropriate orbital empty. Right? And the electron can drop down to its ground state of X by emitting a photon of energy Y. Also right? </p>
<p>I assume this process can't be 100% efficient, and some energy is converted to or from heat at some point, but the available orbitals dictate what specific photon can be absorbed and the same one reemitted for any atom the photon encounters, doesn't it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll always have some broadening and re-emission at not-exactly the same frequency. For example if the atom is moving, the doppler effect will shift the absorption line.  For example consider if I have two atoms moving towards each other really quickly. One is in an excited state, with an energy of X and the other is in the ground state. Imagine the excited atom relaxes and emits a photon towards the ground state atom From the excited atoms perspective it emits a photon with an energy of X. From the ground state atoms perspective, the light is doppler shifted to have a slightly higher energy than X so it can't be absorbed.</p>
<p>This is just one process of many that causes the energies of photons to spread out when it's in thermal equilibrium with a gas. You also have collisional broadening + a gazillion other processes that probably none of us have heard of. The important thing is that in thermal equilibrium the light will always take on a blackbody spectrum with enough scattering events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overall this answer is quite good, although assigning the answer to broadening does mask some of the fundamentals here.</p>
<p>If you look at the spectrum of a single atom of iron, it has sharp transitions. Once you've put a bunch of iron atoms together to form a piece of solid iron (and heated it up enough to have it emit light), you have something which has a smooth emission spectrum which looks like a blackbody emission. Doppler broadening can't explain this, as iron atoms don't move all that fast, even when heated up hot enough to emit light. To explain the blackbody spectrum would also require a crazy broadening hypothesis which wouldn't explain why hot iron has such a similar spectrum to hot nickel, hot chrome, hot manganese... etc.</p>
<p>When bonds are being formed, the atomic orbitals which are involved in emission get swapped out for molecular orbital with different energy levels, some higher, some lower. More bonds, more orbitals, each which have their own energy level. Eventually, you mash enough orbitals together that you no longer have individual levels, but instead a conglomerate known as an energy band. Stars have a band structure due to an enormous number of hot hydrogen atoms which have formed a bonded plasma which has energy levels at every possible wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but say you have three levels with energies, X, X + Y, X + Y + Z. You can have a photons with energy level (Y + Z) absorbed so the electron at X goes to (X + Y + Z). Some will be re-emitted at (Y + Z), but others can just emit just Z and drop to (X + Y) and later emit Y and drop to X. Combine that with the random direction of emission and you can see how some photons at (Y + Z) are converted to two photons of different wavelengths, thus dimming one wavelength selectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have the right idea for the most part. As others have mentioned, there are some practical details which slightly change the energy of the emitted photon or cause it to be split between multiple photons. Heat losses aren't really a thing in quantum mechanics world as they are in normal mechanics, but there are equivalents.</p>
<p>However, what u/SirHerald says works even if all photons coming in and out have the exact same energy. Think of a four-way road junction, with us at the opposite exit from a sun, and an absorbing atom / electron at the center. The sun emits photons through the junction towards us. They arrive at the middle and those with the right energy will be absorbed by the atom/electron. Photons with other energies pass through directly to us.</p>
<p>When the atom/electron reemits the absorbed photons, it spreads them out equally among all four exits, so only a quarter continue on to us. We still see all of unabsorbed photons, so there will be fewer fewer photons at those energies. This is how we get absorption spectra. If you went to one of the two exits at right angles (and there were no suns on the other side), you would see reflection / reemission spectra, with extra photons at the absorption energies.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woildnt a simpler explanation be that when absorped photons are re-emitted they aren't all re-emitted in the same wavelength? Thus decreasing the intensity of that wavelength?</p></div>		</li>
