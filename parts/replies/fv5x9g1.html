			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a little bit to this great answer. Inbreeding in most animal species is not as large a problem compared to humans because most wild animal species are quite diverse genetically. Humans had a genetic bottleneck about 70,000 years ago, which is not that long on an evolutionary scale. It is estimated that there were only about 10,000 humans alive at that point. So the genetic diversity decreased sharply and has not had too much time to recover (only about 3000 generations since then). This means that background prevalence of genetic disorders in a human population is higher than that of a species that has not had a bottleneck in a few hundred thousand years. You get the opposite effect with something like domesticated dogs, where certain breeds are inbred significantly to keep a pure breed and will have a plethora of genetic defects that are difficult to remove from the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were many regional bottlenecks but the climate in Africa was fairly stable. So for example, the ice age wiped out almost everyone living in Europe, but then the survivors mixed with new migrants that came north from Africa to prevent the kind of bottleneck you're describing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please note that the bottleneck 70kya happened in those populations that went &quot;Out of Africa&quot;. What I'm trying to say is that the bottleneck did not happen in all human populations, but rather in the ancestors of the human lineages that migrated away from the continent (which arguably comprises many of the human populations today, but not all)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's how we can trace back the paths that humans took to settle in the entire world. The more genetic diversity a human population has, the closer to the &quot;out of Africa&quot; event it is. We can then retrieve the human population that migrates the latest (lowest genetic diversity, a population in South America I think to remember), and the human population the closest to our ancestors in Africa (highest genetic diversity, I don't remember in which African population it is).</p>
<p>edit: when I say &quot;migrates the latest&quot;, it's inaccurate. What I mean is, the population that encountered the highest numbers of bottleneck events. Meaning, population A migrates, a population B from population A less representative of the genetic diversity of A migrates, then a population C from population B less representative of the genetic diversity of B migrates, etc etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And there is also the fact that OoA humans crossbred with Neanderthals and Denisovans, to the point it remains in our genomes.</p>
<p>We are one populous monkey with low diversity, after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you mean &quot;risk of mutation from inbreeding&quot;. The mutation rate stays the same. I think you mean &quot;risk of congenital diseases&quot;.</p>
<p>The bottleneck effect describes the lost of genetic diversity when a population size becomes smaller. Not the fact that &quot;they go away after a few generations&quot;.</p>
<p>You're spot on about the risk regarding diseases. Basically, the less genetic diversity there is in a population, the less this population can adapt to changing environment.</p></div>		</li>
