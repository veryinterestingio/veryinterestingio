			<div class="markdown"><p>You and OP /u/LifeOnMarsden will find Paul Veyne's book <em>Did the Greeks Believe their Myth?</em> interesting. It's not the easiest book to digest, and Veyne does wander everywhere and making the title of his book seems to be less relevant. However it does make some interesting points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Believing in a god, like we today believe in one, is an anachronistic concept to be utilized in understanding the Greeks. </li>
<li>Belief in gods at the time is closer to a &quot;belief&quot; in events occurred in history nowadays: you believe, for example, that Franklin et al wrote declaration of independence, Lincoln outlawed slavery, US liberated countries in WW II, etc. You don't necessarily read the primary sources or investigate it further, but people pass down those stories to you (family, education).</li>
<li>Those stories make up a certain idea, e.g. US has a long history of liberalism and democracy. Greek gods were seen as actors in this making of history when people wanted to make sense the idea of their society at that time.</li>

<p>Lincoln, aside of being a historical figure is also a human representation of the forces in the nation that fought against slavery and sacrificed in the process. Just like a god would be. He is treated similarly to a god: with great reverence, following his teachings, statues and temples.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He outlawed it in the states that seceded.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Funny that you say that, because if you've ever been to washinton DC there is an absolutely massive statue of Lincoln. The first time I saw it, it honestly made me think of some sort of shrine to a greek or roman god. The building even looks like a pantheon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been argued that most Greek people weren't super invested in the idea that the gods physically existed. Like, when aphrodite convinces helen to run away with Paris, the audience was aware that aphrodite was kind of a symbol of Helen's lust, not necessarily a literal physical hot woman.</p>
<p>Plenty of religions that believes in gods don't imagine them as just people with lots of power that live in the sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I've always thought about it is that things like lust were the &quot;physical&quot; representations of those gods. Helen's lust was from Aphrodite because Aphrodite was the god of love and, by extension, lust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's probably a closer version. Like, the god &quot;Exists,&quot; but in an ethereal godly sense. The physical ramifications don't take the shape of dudes on a mountain, but in the way people are influenced by them.</p>
<p>When you consider the subconscious wasn't widely accepted until the 20th century, the fact that ancient laypeople thought that wide swings in emotion were caused by the influence of some unknowable force isn't that ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure there was some of that after many years of civilization.  It's kind of like alchemy and the philosopher's stone.  The idea of it started out as an actual physical thing.  But then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher's_stone#Interpretations" target="_blank">some later scholars</a> would describe searching for the philosopher's stone as an abstract inward journey toward enlightenment/understanding.</p>
<p>In short, the foundations of their belief system didn't jive well in the observations of their modern era.  So to preserve belief, they'd redefine the foundations to something more abstract and applicable to their time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much how I learned it in AP English then later Classics classes.</p>
<p>Also, what was new to me was the idea that most of the layperson's knowledge of specific Greek myths is from literary works like Homer, Avid, and the surviving tragedies that have as much in common to superhero movies as they do to actual religious texts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Believing in ancient gods is objectively no more ludicrous than believing in most of the precepts of Christianity or Judaism. No religion can be &quot;proved&quot;. But those who have had personal spiritual experiences decide to believe in their perceptions of what has occurred. </p>
<p>That being said, the actual religion of the ancient Greeks was a lot more complex and subtle than just &quot;humanoids atop Olympus.&quot; The gods were felt to be directly interacting with humans in a variety of ways in their daily lives. If you look at the cult practice rather than the mythology, you will see a populace deeply engaged with the spiritual forces around them - the myths are simply the sacred stories that give insight into the nature of the gods, not necessarily meant to be taken literally.</p></div>		</li>
