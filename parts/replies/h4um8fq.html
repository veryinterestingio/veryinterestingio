			<div class="markdown"><p>My old roommate did this. Explained to me what he'd do if he knew he couldn't make it back with rebreathing co2. Dude would bring like 8 tanks, a scooter, drysuit and go like a mile into ginnie springs. He was fucking nuts. Maybe cavern diving would be cool but that stuff is beyond me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i saw some dudes diving there when me and the lady went camping. i'm a pretty damn certified diver, but i wouldn't do it. dad did it once, and said he'd never do it again...this dude's been through advanced torture resistance training, all sorts of SF shit, tons of deployments, etc...if he noped out, i might as well just not waste the time</p></div>		</li>
