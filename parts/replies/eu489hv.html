			<div class="markdown"><p>Noble metal just means it resists oxidation under normal surface conditions. It doesn’t mean it can’t ever form chemical bonds with anything. Within the crust, chemical, temperature and pressure conditions can be vastly different from at the surface. </p>
<p>Your description is not how gold deposits are formed. Cooling bodies are subject to chemical interactions and mineralisation, not just density constraints. The last remaining parts of a magma (not slag) body to crystallise form minerals which are important for other ore metals (lithium, platinum, rare Earths), but not gold. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and plenty of things, given the right conditions. </p>
<p>I can see the logical jump that’s been made - how things can separate out based upon density...and maybe something to do with the way the Earth’s core formed and a load of gold was sequestered into it when that happened (fun fact: much of rhe gold in the Earth’s crust is thwre because it was delivered by meteorites during the late heavy bonbardment, after the core had already formed)....but the whole reason gold and any other element went into the core in the firsr place is because it was soluble with the most abundant element that was sinking towards the centre of gravity - iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, just.... no. That's not how gold deposits form at all. Nickel and PGE deposits form in this way in ultramafic cumulate deposits, and very rarely <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287297258_Occurrence_of_native_gold_and_gold-silver_alloy_in_the_olivine_gabbro_of_layered_cumulate_sequence_of_Naga_Hills_ophiolite_India" target="_blank">gold can exist in native form contained within sulphide phases</a> in cumulates but not anywhere close to a 'layer of pure gold'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect and a simple google search would have told you so. Gold is not deposited in layers like sediment. Molten rock is not slag.</p>
<p>Gold does not easily form compounds with other elements but it is often found trapped in sulphide minerals like arsenopyrite, which have to be crushed and processed to remove the gold.</p></div>		</li>
