<p>And if not and it withstands all of that - let's figure out what it's made of because we have never been able to design something to withstand it all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And also, at that point it’s basically not our problem, because we’ll never come up with that <em>can</em> destroy. If it were capable of killing our planet, it would not have waited this long to do so - plenty of things to hitch a ride on that are not astronauts. Don’t worry about what you can’t change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you to a point, however I don't think we can say with complete certainty it would have happened already if it could.</p>
<p>That's sorta like saying &quot;oh we're cool if there were some worldwide pandemic causing viral strain, we would have encountered it.&quot; -any time between 1353(black death) and 2019 (covid)</p>
<p>The reasoning in statements like these is far too inductive to prove, and is only true until it's not- given the scale of unknowns we can't rule it out.</p>
<p>I agree with you if it were a common stance thing, an organism surviving re-entry, or autoclaving, would have happened already.  But we literally can't be confident that it isn't just a 1/1,000,000(000,000..ect) chance of a scenario like that, and it has simply not happened. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Think about the size of the first covid molecule compared to the planet Earth. We had no idea about it until every factor aligned, and now the world is in lockdown. Now expand that thinking to the entire universe, and instead of a pandemic causing molecule, it's a miraculously autoclave resistant cell. It's not on our radar until every factor aligns, and there's exponentially a fucktillion more factors given the size of all of reality in the universe. </p>
