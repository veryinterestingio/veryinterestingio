			<div class="markdown"><p>The Phoenix area is going through something where I think landlords are price gouging renters, the top news story these days is explaining renters rights. Rents aren't going up by a hundred or even a couple hundred on lease renewal it's going up by a thousand or even more. Landlords are seeing this and trying to take advantage of ignorance to kick lower income renters out. People on month to month leases are scrambling to find new housing. This is cycling quickly down the chain forcing thousands to either downsize or move further out of the city when many don't have the funds required to suddenly pay moving costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh I agree. I don't know why it's OK for housing to be an investment. It's like imagine someone buying up all the water and driving up prices of water or food as an investment opportunity. Investing in housing also does nothing for the economy as a whole as that money largely stays parked and never moves.</p>
<p>Such a huge part of the population is now invested in property that anytime anyone talks about increasing supply all the people who already own property fight it tooth and nail to stop any potential drop in the valuations of the property they already own.</p>
<p>It's going to hurt a lot of property investors but supply needs to increase to make it actually affordable for future generations. The price of property should not always be going up at a rate that's like 4-5x inflation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only partly true. I'm Ireland at the moment there is a major housing shortage, and house prices have gone up accordingly. However renting as an alternative is not an option, there simply isn't any available.</p>
<p>Obviously this is all supply and demand, but governments need to step in when the commodity is critical. And they aren't in Ireland. We're at crisis levels</p>
<p>Other countries may differ but rental shortages often go alongside buying shortages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is just that politicians have houses they plan to sell one day, and don't plan to sell water or toilet paper.</p>
<p>This is a law advantaging them behind false made up blurry arguments: &quot;it's not sudden enough&quot;, so housing crisis is not sudden but toilet paper crisis is, &quot;price is not increased enough&quot; so 100 times increase for a house is ok but 4 times increase for gas is not. &quot;It's not a critical good&quot; so toilet paper is a critical good but houses are not.</p>
<p>None of these argument have been defined, they are totally open to their interpretation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh fuck off blaming these nefarious politicians for everything. Fact is raising prices during a crisis is objectively and obviously wrong while capping real estate prices because there is a national housing shortage would have widespread rippling effects on the market that wouldn’t really solve the underlining issue. If there were an obvious solution to housing, you would see it being implemented a lot more often by politicians since it would make them instantly very popular. </p>
<p>You are right that the answer to OP’s question is not so straight forward, but you can do better than justifying it with “because politicians=BAD”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obvious solutions to housing in California include relaxing the building codes, allowing more sprawl, and cutting the costs for permits and other government fees. This would cause a 6-figure price drop. Contractors want to build but they aren't allowed to and when they are allowed to it's extra expensive due to extra regulations and fees. </p>
<p>Another obvious solution is to ban rent control, like Massachusetts did. Rent control reduces mobility and while it helps the first round of renters it screws everyone behind them.</p>
<p>And you have to take on the NIMBYs. Obvious, but not easy.</p>
<p>Harder solutions include better funding for elders who are on a fixed budget when the housing market surpasses them. 50% of homeless are over the age of 50. </p>
<p>And creating better programs to help mental health sufferers and addicted people. Many of them are entitled to services they can't access because they don't have a mailing address.</p></div>		</li>
