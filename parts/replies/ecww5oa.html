			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, there's no easy answer, since there's any number of reasons why someone would be 'stressed out' and why they would be continuously stressed out. </p>
<p>Actual mental illness will likely do better with therapy and drugs.</p>
<p>Real life stress management is a skill that needs to be built up over time.</p>
<p>Maybe stress is internal, such as anxiety over factors that are not fully within your control, so meditation or self help into a 'not gonna give a fuck' attitude to preserve mental energy for things that one can influence. </p>
<p>Maybe a career change, return to education, cutting off contact with people who cause stress.</p>
<p>Maybe it's finding a job that pays more or it's paring down spending so saving is more possible. </p>
<p>However, the reality is that continued and chronic stress creates real life health, psychological, emotional, and even financial and social and familial consequences and it's something we all deal with on some level. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick google found that glucagon is the hormone that converts glycogen into glucose and prevents glucose levels from dropping too low in the blood stream. So it could be part of this system.</p>
<p>So yes I was thinking about the glucagon/glycogen feedback system.</p></div>		</li>
