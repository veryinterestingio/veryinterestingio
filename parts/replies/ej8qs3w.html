			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just not true.  Proteases break down proteins, stomach acid has no where near a low enough pH to meaningfully break down proteins.  The stomach releases a few proteases, but again, not nearly as important as pancreatic proteases.  Response to a meal causes your stomach to reduce secretion of acid, not increase it.  Food does buffer the pH in the stomach bu this doesn't cause more secretion of acid, because CCK is inhibiting acid production.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No...you’re misinformed. Or at the very least have an incomplete understanding. It’s not a complete digestion of the protein, it’s more mechanical...denaturation, and only the first stage of protein digestion. Breaks everything down info smaller bits for the pancreatic enzymes to digest fully in the small intestine. Acid secretion stops when the pH stops raising, which also signals for gastric emptying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Denaturation isn't &quot;breaking down a protein,&quot;  and gastric emptying is much more controlled by hormones than pH.  Also, the step in the stomach is not important to protein digestion - you can bypass the stomach with few ill effects as long as the food is introduced slowly enough.  </p>
<p>Any physiological process is complex and has a huge number of parts.  But what is the biggest controller of gastric emptying?  CCK.  </p></div>		</li>
