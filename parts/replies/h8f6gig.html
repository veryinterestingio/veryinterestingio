			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, all the other variants are out there, they just aren't on the news.
There's a site which is collecting and providing genetic information for all of it here-

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  </p>
<p>Because mutations are random, and not all of them result in something worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but they really don't name variants unless they're variants of interest - that is, the mutations cause some combination of increased transmissibility, increased resistance to monoclonal antibodies, or vaccine resistance.  I'm sure there's probably other criteria they can use, but that's the ones I see reported on on most variants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So along those lines, would it be possible to get a variant that was extremely mild, purposefully give it to people, and would those antibodies offer even some minimal protection against harsher variants?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like how named hurricanes can dominate the news while in-between names don't get much attention. For example, Katrina/Rita/Wilma in 2005 had a bunch of other named storms in between.</p></div>		</li>
