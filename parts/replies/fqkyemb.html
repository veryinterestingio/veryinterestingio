			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but an object with the mass and speed necessary to do that and not burn up in the atmosphere would probably vaporize the atmosphere or blast it away. And the odds of coming that close and not making contact with the planet itself but scraping the city off its surface is infinitesimally small.</p>
<p>You're asking a pitcher to scrape a stamp off a moving baseball with another baseball without altering eithers course barely at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory yes, in practice no: other things would happen that cause more trouble than just scrapping a city. But if, for example, we were talking about a moon based metropolis, then this could happen exactly as you describe, yes.</p></div>		</li>
