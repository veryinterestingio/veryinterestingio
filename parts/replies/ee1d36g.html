			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not guaranteed that you will choke, but it is much easier to do so, especially if you're very weak/tired/have a muscular disorder, very old or very young. Babies especially don't have the muscle control to consistently pull it off, but they don't have to since their larynxes are much higher in their throats, which allows for much less risk of inhaling food/liquid than in older children and adults, and the epiglottis is longer and more flexible and essentially seals off the nasal airway from the mouth and upper esophagus so they can breathe while nursing. </p>
<p>Children develop this muscle control over time, but are still at an elevated risk of choking while younger which is likely when most of us were (rightfully) first given this warning. It's not necessarily true for healthy adults, although there is still a small risk, but it's a valid precaution for others. </p></div>		</li>
