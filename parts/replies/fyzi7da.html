The US is at least unabashedly imperial for 99% of stuff(liters of cola being the major exception people will encounter), whereas the UK uses imperial sometimes and metric other times. And then they drive on the left hand side of the road.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canada is kinda liked that.</p>
<p>Anything small, we'll use imperial (we say a few inches away, not centimeters). Anything big we switch to metric (car speeds are in kph, not miles). The older you go, the more imperial they'll use.</p>
<p>Unlike the UK, however, we don't use esoteric, archaic units like stones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People often say this, but the US has very valid reasons for all of the ways in which it deviates from the rest of the world. Stated more correctly, it's actually that the rest of the world deviated away from the US. As far as I know there aren't any major standards like this where there was just a very clear consensus one way and then we went the other. The reality is more like the story told with the Gregorian calendar -- different countries found themselves on different sides of the fence, and very slowly converged over time.</p>
<p>It just so happens that by the time the rest of the world got together on the Metric system, the US had already well established itself in Imperial, and was a large enough trading power that it didn't really suffer from the difference. There was certainly a pretty major cost to undertake to transition, and with no obvious tangible benefits (other than the slightly more intuitive nature of the metric system) it's a pretty tough thing to tell every manufacturer of every product everywhere to coordinate a large-scale and costly conversion. Unlike a smaller and more tightly interlocked country where using a different system of measurements makes it difficult to trade with all of your allies and neighbors, the US doesn't feel very much pain there.</p>
<p>I should also note that legally speaking, the Metric system is the primary system of measurement in the US. We use it for everything that matters (science and engineering). The only time we use imperial is for things where it doesn't actually matter that much (distances, wood, temperature scales, conversation, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's currently 13 days difference between the Gregorian and Julian calenders as they've drifted further apart.</p>
<p>The difference comes from the years divisible by 100 (and not 400) not being a leap year in the Gregorian calendar. They'll drift to 14 days from 1st March 2100. The last change was 28th February 1900. There wasn't a drift 20 years ago because 2000 was a leap year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was kind of the opposite, actually—people went to bed on the 15th (or whatever) and woke up on the 27th (and they were pissed because landlords still charged a full month's rent!) So it'd be more like, &quot;Sorry I'm 12 days late boss; traffic was a bitch.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, wait; I guess that's what you're saying. I'm a leave this up though, so everyone can laugh at how stupid I am and also for the hopefully-not-apocryphal detail about rents.</p></div>		</li>
