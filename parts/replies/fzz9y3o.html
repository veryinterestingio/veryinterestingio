			<div class="markdown"><p>We don’t <del>know</del> <em>have safety data to support doing that</em>. It is probably not a good idea. </p>
<p><em>For instance</em>, The second dose of <del>all of</del> the <em>Moderna</em> COVID vaccine had more severe reactions than the first dose. </p>
<p>However, and most importantly, we don’t have data on <del>it</del> <em>switching Covid vaccines mid stream, or taking different forms</em>, so no one can tell you it has been proven safe. It might not kill you, but for instance, one of the patients treated with the second dose of the high dose of the Moderna vaccine ran a fever of 103. You probably don’t want something like that to happen.</p>
<p>If you start a 2 shot regimen<del>t</del>, you should get both of the same. You should probably not get another vaccine unless you test negative for antibodies later. (Doctors can do this for other vaccines too—they wear off then they give you a booster)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually there weren’t really any severe reactions to the current version of the Moderna vaccine. In the first clinical trials they were looking at the effect of different dosage levels of the RNA. In the highest dosage level, 3 people did experience a “severe” reaction. I looked into it and one of the “severe” reactions was that the guy was feverish and nauseous for one day and then fine. But they got rid of that highest dosage level for their covid vaccine, they’re not using it any more. For the dosage level they are now using, the worst reaction has been redness at the injection site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that the patient who ran the high fever and passed out after the second Moderna dose received a earlier version of the vaccine that created a stronger immune response than necessary. The vaccine they are using now is milder. That man also said he would take the vaccine again knowing how sick he felt for a couple days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a risk of severe immunogenicity if you take one and then the other. You’d want to do a safety clinical trial of the combination to look at doses, order and delay between the doses. This would be complicated by the fact that most of the vaccines require one or two boosters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the modern “vaccine “ is not a vaccine like all of the other vaccines that we use.  </p>
<p>The moderna “vaccine “ is a genetic engineering treatment that forces some of your cells to produce a vaccine.   </p>
<p>That might be why there were a few bad reactions with high multiple doses:  too many cells making vaccine and not enough making whatever they were making before...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that the people receiving the highest doses got fevers indicates that their body was reacting to an external threat, the spike protein in this case. It means that it was very effective at causing an immune response, maybe too effective for the highest doses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this isn't why people would have an adverse reaction. Moderna's vaccine encodes a gene but does not alter host genes and disappears within 2 days so it's a little misleading to call it a genetic engineering treatment. The quantity of mRNA delivered is also minuscule compared to what cells would be able to translate without toxicity. The reaction comes from the adjuvant, which is a different form of RNA included in the RNA product that looks to the body like viral RNA and makes cells think that they're infected. Some people have stronger immune responses to adjuvants than others, which is why we see a range of minor complications for most vaccines, including Moderna's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you seen the concern about what kind of medium the mRNA is being hosted in?  People on antivirals who have HIV end up nuking the vaccine from all of the antivirals in their plasma.  So hosting the vaccine on something that won't be destroyed by that is key.</p></div>		</li>
