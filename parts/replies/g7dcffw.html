<p>Melanin can’t produce cool colours like blue and green</p>

<p>The lack of melanin in the iris causes people to have blue or green eyes. Normally, the light scattering out is blue in color but gets absorbed by melanin so only brown light makes it out. When there is less melanin, you can get green eyes. Very low levels of melanin allows blue light to be scattered out rather than absorbed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melanin protects the eye from sunlight, so a lighter eye colour makes the eye able to collect more light, but also makes bright light hurt faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why some people's eyes seem to change color depending on the color of the sky, source of light and what they're wearing? The lack of melanin allows a wider range of colors to show?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The iris doesn't produce light on its own. It can only reflect and scatter back a portion of the colored light from the environment.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the environment has a cooler (more blue) color temperature, their eyes will looks more blue. Likewise if the environment was warmer or if the reflected color is from what they are wearing, their eyes would reflect that.</p>
<p>Melanin in the eye absorbs most the color and only lets through orange/red colors (brown is a dark orange/red color).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Lighter colors reflect light more than darker colors which absorb it. So a green shirt on a blue-eyed person might make their eyes look green.</p></div>		</li>
