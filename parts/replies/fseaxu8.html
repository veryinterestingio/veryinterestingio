			<div class="markdown"><p>Read up a little on EMDR. It's kinda weird, but truly fascinating. (Anecdotal info: I had this done to me for PTSD. Walking in I kept thinking, &quot;This is total horseshit and won't help a damned thing.&quot; But it actually did. Shocked the shit outta me.)</p>
<p>&quot;Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing is a form of psychotherapy developed by Francine Shapiro in the 1990s in which the person being treated is asked to recall distressing images; the therapist then directs the patient in one type of bilateral sensory input, such as side-to-side eye movements or hand tapping.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the general idea is &quot;priming&quot;. If you want to engage a particular region of your brain, you need an activation cascade to reach it somehow. Looking in particular spots might be a way to generate such a cascade.</p>
<p>The diagram is known in the <a href="http://www.nlpu.com/Articles/artic14.htm" target="_blank">NLP community</a> but is there any merit to it ? The linked article provides sources and specific claims such as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dilts' recordings tended to confirm other tests which showed that lateralization of eye movements accompanied brain activity during different cognitive tasks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you'll note that most of the sources are from the 70s, 80s at most. Does this hold up in the modern research on cognition ?</p>
<p>I think a lot of people would say no, especially since NLP is considered a pseudoscience by most researchers on the topic. First argument being, the main claim relies on a conception of left/right brain dichotomy that is way more muddy than people in the 70's thought. And pretty variable between individual as well.</p>
<p>This is a common thread for NLP : a bunch of speculative reasoning that sort of made sense at the time, but mostly disproved or at least greatly humbled as new data came in.</p>
<p>Buuuuut there is nonetheless definitely a link between <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-016-0639-2" target="_blank">eye movement and a lot of cognitive tasks</a>. And the modern interpretation is somewhat more interesting IMO. A growing amount of evidence suggests that most of the brain's storage, retrieval and processing of information is done in terms of space. </p>
<p>Notably, the Nobel winning discovery of grid neurons, which encode very literally a map of the place you are traversing. This is for literal space, but what i'm trying to say is that every mental concept is stored this way, in a geometrical space.</p>
<p>For example </p>
<blockquote>
<p>when listening to a description of a house, the listener’s gaze position on a blank screen moves up when the description proceeds from the ground floor to higher floors, showing that internal inspection of a mental image triggers eye movements in the external visual space</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are not just thinking abstractly about the house you are hearing about, you are looking at it as you would if it was in front of you.</p>
<p>Don't know if I'm conveying this correctly, but there is a link somewhere and it might be a reflection of deeper ways in which our brain works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolute speculation but this may be something similar to how people tend to bite their tongue when performing motor tasks that require a lot of concentration and control. The idea being that a stimulus in a certain brain region may branch out and help activate nearby regions, even if they are primarily associated with different tasks/sensory inputs.</p>
<p>Absolutely wild speculation: there could be a connection to REM sleep, the phase in our sleep cycle where the brain produces the most vivid (visual) dreams.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem too far fetched to me that an activation of the muscles around the eyeballs will lead to some sort of response/activation in visual cortical regions, too. After all, movement of those muscles does have an immediate effect on what information is received through the eyes: change of focus, movement of the visual scene, change of perspective. The brain definetly has to integrate that interplay of information between muscle and visual stimulus, otherwise, it wouldn't be able to make sense of what one is seeing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This must be a completely different &quot;NLP&quot; than the neurolinguistic programming I'm familiar with. The NLP I know is a therapy modality based on working out and prioritizing core needs and determining an effective strategy to getting your core needs met.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For something that has no &quot;real merit&quot;, eyes sure do go up for remembering visual things an awful lot.  I don't know if scientists have found a <em>use</em> for it, but it seems to be a thing that actually happens.  I don't know what would qualify as &quot;merit&quot; in this case.</p>
<p>That we are looking away from distracting stimulus when we look up makes sense when we're outside, but if that were really what we were doing, you would expect people to look any old place where there was the least to look at, since that's an assessment of &quot;right now&quot;, rather than an evolutionary trait.  But even sitting here at my computer, where there is quite a bit to look at above my computer, if I try and see my front door in my head, my eyes go up.</p>
<p>There's no getting around the argument &quot;you've prepped yourself to look up by thinking about it first&quot;.  All I can say is anytime I've asked friends to try a weird experiment with me, their eyes have gone up when I ask them to see their front door, or remember anything visually, every single time I've tried it.  Which has been maybe 25 questions and like 4 people, and I didn't tell them what I was looking for (I have some patient friends).  Maybe if I increased the number of trials by an order of magnitude or two there would be some variation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why is it to the right when we’re trying to recall things? I remember reading that when people are trying to imagine something they look up and to the left.</p>
<p>You can try it on others. Just ask some, “what colour is your house?” and then ask others, “What would your house look like if it was green?” for example. Most tend to look right for recall and left for imagination. It’s definitely not infallible but it can be one way to test if people are fibbing.</p></div>		</li>
