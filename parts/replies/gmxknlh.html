Part of that will relate to what we learn in time about the duration of protection that our current vaccines provide. Plus, the emergence of variants have dramatically increased the likelihood that we may need different vaccines than what we have now at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Flu is a good example of thinking globally about vaccines with different timelines and patterns in different part of the world. We choose the composition of the annual flu vaccine in the Northern Hemisphere, for example, based on what is circulating in the Southern Hemisphere during its flu season several months earlier. That analogy might not hold up exactly for the long-term future of COVID vaccines, but it gives us a framework for thinking about rapidly modifying, producing, and delivering vaccines against a moving viral target.</p>
<p>To be clear, none of these long-term considerations change the importance of getting vaccinated now with the current vaccines when you have the opportunity.</p></div>		</li>
