			<div class="markdown"><p>The second is correct; the gravitational force you feel at some point toward the center of the earth, is the same as the gravitational force you would feel at the surface of a smaller planet, consisting of everything within the earth that was at a lower radius than you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the first sentence is &quot;wrong&quot; because the field does not uniformly lessen due to the changing density within earth. When you get close to the core, its true that you don't feel the gravitational pull of the crust. But the core is denser, and being closer to the denser part is enough to outweigh that in this case, so theres actually a brief rise. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>or to look at it another way; If you were to strip away the earth's crust and mantle, leaving only the inner and outer core as a much smaller planet. Standing on the surface of that planet, you would feel heavier than you do on earth, which is surprising, and only possible because the core is much denser than earth as a whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an excellent point that I'd genuinely overlooked: there <em>could be</em> ranges of radius in which the gravity actually <em>increases</em> with decreasing radius by reason of the increase in <em>density</em> with decreasing radius.</p>
<p>But certainly the <em>trend</em> is decrease of gravitational field, beginning with <em>g</em> at the surface and ending as 0 at the centre. And for there to be a <em>reversal</em> of the trend the rate of change of density with R would have to be pretty steep: it would take ρ(R) &lt; M(R)/2πR^3 (or density less than ⅔ of the <em>mean</em> density interior to that point) ... it's a matter of geological data whether that actually occurs anywhere inside or on the Earth or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The conclusion is not quite true IMO: you would indeed be effectively under the influence of less mass, but you would also be closer to the center of gravity, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! certainly! ... thats what I've <em>said</em>. Inside the Earth at radius R (less than Earth-radius, therefore - yes - closer to the centre) ... and the gravity would be as though all the planet at the radius <em>greater than</em> what you were at had <em>just vanished</em>, and all that remained was what was enclosed by a sphere of the radius you were at ... &amp; you were standing on it.</p></div>		</li>
