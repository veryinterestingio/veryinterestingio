			<div class="markdown"><p>The big thing that comes from this is that, people who are buying cheap 4K tvs just want something good enough (they might not even care its 4K). Not many people are buying 4K monitors without a good reason, so companies are not going to make too many lower quality ones because the people in the market want to pay more for a better product. everyone else will buy a 1080/1440p monitor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Love my 1440p Pixio PX275h monitors. The high color gamut and 95Hz refresh rate is a good compromise between the super gamer TN panels with bad colors and the more pedestrian IPS panels with only 60Hz refresh.</p>
<p>I think 1440p is just right for a ~27&quot; class monitor. I think 4K is really still a little too fine at that size and viewing distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are sitting 2-3 meters away from a widescreen 4k tv vs less than 1 meter with a PC monitor. At that distance, the difference in picture detail is tolerable. Refresh rates are really important if you're into competitive gaming at which you should invest in a proper monitor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing you will most easily notice is response rate.</p>
<p>Gaming and lots of PC applications require very low response rates.  Hook up your TV to your HDMI out on your PC.  Now move the mouse, or open your favorite text editor and type.  If you can, have the monitor hooked up right next to the TV. </p>
<p>A TV dosen't need a low response time.  It just needs to ensure sound in synced with the picture.  You won't notice a video be played 1 second after initially being loaded and processed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but most TVs with good dynamic range and response time cost as much as monitors would at that size. OP was thinking about cheap tvs, where $400 can get you a 27 inch monitor or a 55 inch tv. When you only look at tvs that are comparable to monitors, the price makes sense - the most recent NU8000 model costs $700 at 55 inches and would only be a mid-range monitor if not for its size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just one reason they are inferior (yes I'm biased) but even some high end console gamers will buy monitors for this reason.  Cable style is no longer an issue thanks to HDMI (and some previously shared styles).</p>
<p>Most noticable in fast action fighting games.  As single player games can just increase the acceptable button push time frame to accommodate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is also why part of why your smartphone is very expensive, despite having barely 7 inches of screen.  </p>
<p>Even on a fancy phone it is probably &quot;only&quot; 1080p, but pixel density is sky-high.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>What?   High end phones virtually all are nearly 4k pixel count.  They have been higher than 1080p for several years....  </p>
<p>IPhones generally have been an exception and have trailed on screen resolutions,  but they're not behind as much anymore.</p></div>		</li>
