			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, this checks out with my experience. So to prevent getting them so frequently, I would want to find different methods of doing my job that utilize different muscle groups instead of doing it the same way every time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that is a creative way to exercise different muscles. You can get or do self-massage depending on where you get knots most frequently. Hot/cold ice packs work for many people - daily meditations and taking regular breaks during the day also helps relax the body. </p>
<p>For labor intense jobs, having a warm up and cool down ritual may also help your body acclimate and adapt quicker. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Japan there is something called Radio Taiso that is played every morning and people all over japan stretch and warm up every morning before working. I remember when I lived there for a few years I would drive by the skyscrapers and business buildings and everyone would be outside either in the front or the back stretching. They even do it in all the schools.</p>
<p>The US used to do this back in the 20’s but it faded out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>have you tried massages?  (Try a few different places).  When I massage someone with a knot in their back, by pressing firmly with my thumb until I massage it away, it fees like it can disappear.</p>
<p>I always thought of it like the muscle is clenching itself up (like a fist) and this causes a chain reaction of further tensing itself up. so you have to push a thumb in there, to open it, then it relaxes.</p>
<p>depending on where your body it is you can try massaging yourself through massage balls (to use between you and the floor when lying on them) etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who constantly gets knots, this feels great (the constant, firm pressure) and I can feel the knot relax, but they always come back within a couple of hours. My masseuse told me that it’s best to slowly work the knot to the end of the muscle to fully release it. I also try to go see her monthly for preventative measures, and this definitely helps. I have a bit of scoliosis, though, so maybe not everyone really needs this level of maintenance.</p></div>		</li>
