<p>Yes, but those terms in the context of atoms bonding to each other are <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/dipole.html" target="_blank"><strong>electric</strong> dipoles</a>. We're talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_magnet#/media/File:VFPt_cylindrical_magnet_thumb.svg" target="_blank"><strong>magnetic</strong> dipoles</a> here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, to permanently magnetize something, it needs to be a transition element, and it needs to be a metal.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Transition elements have lots of non-bonding electrons in the d-orbitals that can align to a magnetic field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metals have a crystal lattice structure that can hold onto a magnetic moment.</p>
</li>
<li>Being metals, their electrons typically described as working together/are in a &quot;soup&quot;, which also helps with magnetization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steak is none of those things (mainly made of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Hydrogen, Sulfur), and what's more likely to happen is that you'll magnetize the iron that's in the blood of the steak!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can. But most materials only respond very weakly to external magnetic fields, and are unable to sustain a net magnetization after the external field has been removed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>> Each electron fundamentally has its own intrinsic dipole moment.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Wait. Doesn't dipole imply plus and minus? Isn't electron only minus? Or does &quot;dipole moment&quot; mean something other than a magnet dipole in a classical sense?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>(Although I know that no monopole magnets exist.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm talking about <strong>magnetic</strong> dipole moments, not electric dipole moments.</p>
<p>What you're describing as &quot;plus and minus&quot; is an electric dipole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that the electron might have an electric dipole moment. This is actually of great interest for fundamental particle physics and fundamental symmetries, and there are several experiments now trying to measure it. There was a recent experiment that set the upper limit at 1.1 x 10^-29 e cm, which is so small that, if the electron were blown up to the size of the earth, we're still talking charge separation on the order of atomic size. The standard model of particle physics predicts and electron EDM on the order of 10^-38 e cm, but there are several other particle physics models that predict it close to the limit we are at right now, and measuring it could lend credence to those theories!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, there are no magnetic monopoles, only electric monopoles, i.e. electrically charged particles. You can create an electric dipole by separating some positive and negative charge. In this case the fields lines leave one end of the dipole (the plus charge) and curve back into the other end (the minus charge).</p>
<p>You can a similar magnetic field configuration with a small electric-current carrying loop. The fields line leave from one end, curve back and enter the other end. </p>
<p>In pictures, the first image is the electric dipole and the second the magnetic dipole:</p>
