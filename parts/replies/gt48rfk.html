			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think it’s the difference between annoyance pain and actual pain. I work in a factory, and I’m constantly banging my elbows and hands on metal edges. It hurts, but not that much. It sure is annoying though, which tends to make me angry. However, when I had kidney stones, it just fucking hurt. It was nothing I did, and nothing I could do, so it was all just pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is more related to surface-level pain vs internal pain.</p>
<p>Surface pain we usually are able to do something about it, including fighting whoever's inflicting it (anger), so it stands to reason that evolution would select for that kind of reaction.</p>
<p>Internal pain we can't really do much about so it's rather useless to get angry. Instead it would make sense for evolution to select a &quot;begging&quot; response, to try and get help from others (seeing as we are a social species) - including obtaining food and water when you're in so much pain that it leaves you incapacitated.</p></div>		</li>
