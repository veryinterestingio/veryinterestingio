			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in a part of the UK where we have almost annual summer droughts so we would have to borrow from wetter areas. One year we almost went to stand pipes though. We have to be a tad careful with our water here but just cause it rains a lot does not always mean a lot of usable water</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an estimate that around 30% of all our water in the UK is lost to leakages and inefficiencies and kind of because we are usually okay except in major droughts, it never gets fixed. It's easier for the water companies to just pump 30% more water into the system to make up for demand.</p>
<p>Unfortunately when there is a drought this is why we can easily end up with hosepipe bans very quickly because suddenly we can't be so profligate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats not entirely true. Leaks are always getting fixed, but the water networks are pressurised systems of pipework that, in some cases, can be 50-60 years old (or even older). Leaks slowly start to occur, but the replacement rate is only just enough to keep up. Most of the leakage that occurs isnt big bursts or pipework that is easily identifiable, its slow seepage that occurs at joints etc. that builds up over time.  </p>
<p>There is also a quite significant proportion of customer pipes (those running under your drive) that leak, which is why water companies really want you to be on a meter - because then it gives you encouragement to actually fix them. The amount of leakge that comes from these can be close to 50% in some areas of all lost water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one focuses on the energy though as it's small. Many people don't understand water conservation very well. For example, if your indoor water gets treated and discharged to a creek or river (very common), it doesn't have a significant effect on water supply to use less indoor water. Outdoor water use is a different matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i imagine the energy savings are rather negligible though!? I mean, no reason to waste, but if youre going to cut back I imagine saving water to save energy is near the bottom of the list. as long as were not talking about heated water ofc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Very dependent on where the water is coming from and where it is going. If the water is coming from an artesian well and being disposed of on the grass, then it uses no energy at all. If your water is being pumped from another state and treated at the local treatment plant using Reverse Osmosis before going down the drain to the Wastewater Treatment Plant, then the footprint is actually quite significant. </p>
<p>In California, <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43200.pdf" target="_blank">as much as 19% of the stateâ€™s electricity
consumption is for pumping, treating, collecting, and discharging water and wastewater.</a></p>
<p>So, depending on where you live and what you do with it, your water-energy footprint can be very significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, the cases you are referring to are cases that are not relevant to the topic at hand though. For the UK, and other wet regions, this does not apply. The way they threat water in northern Europe is by shining an UV light through it, and that's pretty much it. It does not require energy even worth mentioning. </p>
<p>California on the other hand struggles with their water supply, if you've ever been to the UK, or Northern Europe you'll know, they dont.</p></div>		</li>
