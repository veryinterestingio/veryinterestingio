			<div class="markdown"><p>The magnetic properties of materials are driven by the alignment of dipoles in the atomic structure.  You can &quot;demagnetize&quot; a &quot;permanent&quot; magnetic by overheating it.  Soft magnetic materials help shape magnetic fields in motors and electronic devices.  When you operate a soft magnetic material at too high a temperature, it no longer provides the additional shaping.  We have been developing new alloys and processes for soft magnetic materials in the &quot;nanocrystalline&quot; class of soft magnets and have a patent on an alloy that operates at 300C with the same electrical losses as a conventional alloy that tops out at 150C. - Cheryl</p></div>		</li>
