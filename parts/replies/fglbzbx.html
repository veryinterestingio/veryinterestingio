			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely a grooming stimulus in most mammals but then I wonder about things like fish enjoying it, animals that (as far as we know) don't really go in for social touch? Maybe fish cuddle but we just don't see it :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a few videos of fish offering physical contact with humans. I think that for longer lived species there's probably a good deal of social interactions in their lives so it wouldn't be surprising if it transferred to humans. </p>
<p>We just know so little about fish social behaviour, I think some of them would surprise us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try &quot;ear nougies&quot; for dogs with larger, pendulous ears. You (gently) rub your knuckles inside their ears. Can put my Dane in a trance doing that.</p>
<p>Usual caveats about making sure that you know the dog well, and proceed gently, etc.  but I've never met a dog that didn't like it.</p></div>		</li>
