			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an attempt to market gasoline engines that worked like Diesel engines, with compression, that were extremely efficient some years back. Never took off. I wonder if the torque was improved...</p>
<p>Smokey Yanick built an engine 40 years ago that worked on mostly vaporizing gas prior to injection, had three cylinders, got 250 HP and 250 ft/lbs of torque, while getting 50mpg. Never took off either. No one was interested.</p>
<p>I swear the car industry can be dumb as fuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The torque is more intense because diesel engines have longer strokes so the piston is creating more pressure creating a more powerful combustion. Gasoline and air can only be compressed so far before you'll have misfires. In a diesel engine you can theoretically compress it as hard as the materials can handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pistons have a longer stroke, and they ignite due to compression - which means when it does ignite the force in the piston is much greater.</p>
<p>Think of it like squeezing a spring. A Diesel engine is a thicker harder to push spring down, but when it does release it has a lot more energy per push. Great for heavy loads.</p>
<p>The downside is you can't squeeze and release them fast like you can petrols thinner easier to push springs. So smaller faster springs (higher RPM) are good for faster vehicles (more power at higher RPMs).</p>
<p>Petrol is more explosive so you can get more overall power from an engine (by burning more of it faster), but it's not as impactful.</p>
<p>Another comparison might be an impact drill vs a higher RPM dremel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diesel can start gelling from -15 to -20Â° Fahrenheit, which is upwards (downwards?) of -28Â° Celsius. Some additives this can prevent gelling until temps of -40Â° F/C, but not all.</p>
<p>It gets down to -30-40Â° C here (Western Canada) in January pretty regularly, so many people who drive diesel vehicles either have heated garages or simply can't drive. We had busses regularly not be able to pick up out of town kids during bad days in school, but the town kids still had to go because we basically all lived within walking distance of the school anyway ðŸ˜ª</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>And to put some context to that by way of a comparison, a typical diesel engine in an average road car might have a peak torque figure at somewhere around 1500-1800rpm. Electric motors can produce 100% of their rated torque at 0RPM.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Electric motors are pretty much better in every way so long as you can supply the needed energy. Unfortunately that energy supply is a non trivial problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have driven a BMW i3  for almost 3 years.  The torque is so addicting even though it has a relatively weak high-end HP.  In layman's terms it's good off the line but not so great at passing at 80mph.  Perfectly ok for a mostly city car.</p></div>		</li>
