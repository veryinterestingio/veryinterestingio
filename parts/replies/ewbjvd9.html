<p>Is there a way to convince the skin stuff to sloooow down, buddy, and make it take its time and use the expensive stuff? Don't worry, we're good for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing with the bigger holes is youve not only lost some skin, youve lost the lovely scaffholding that goes inside the finger and generally under the skin/inside the tissue all over your body. These cells, little fibrous bits of material and such all work to add a good deal of structure. When you are injured and these stay mostly intact your body just puts back in the squishy bits around the scaffholding present, and patches little holes in the scaffhold using whats present as a guide. The scaffhold cells and fibres all have little surface markers that encourage healing to follow a nice ordered pattern and make normal looking typical skin with good architecture.</p>
<p>If the hole is so big the scaffhold is all ruined then your body has no choice but to fill the gap with a generalised mix of fibrous scaffhold and squishy material since it has no way of knowing what is meant to go where. This isnt really well organised skin and wont follow the nice pattern of the surrounding stuff. It's not so much the speed that's the problem here, its that we have lost the scaffhold, like the supporting skeleton of a house. Replacing the wallpaper or even the drywall is impossible if the supporting beams have all fallen down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to preventing scars, yes there is. There are medications that slow down the little builder bots (fibroblasts mostly) that come in to patch up skin. It works pretty well, but the medication is pretty bad for you, since your body needs those fibroblasts moving around to do a lot of different things. So it's only really used when the scars would really cause problems. People who've had eye surgery will often be prescribed scar-prevention eyedrops for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. Two factors that lead to scars are inflammation and loss of moisture. You want to keep the place where the scar is forming free from infection and well hydrated. After a skin biopsy, for example, the instructions include gently washing with soap an water after 24 hours, then keeping it covered with petroleum jelly. The ointment keeps water from leaving the skin. Another way to do keep moisture there is with silicone patches or ointment, which are marketed for scar prevention and even (some) reduction in the appearance of existing scars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do a really nice job of breaking this stuff down. Thank you. How do deer regrow antlers from scratch every time they lose them and then grow to the right size? Are stem cells, hox and epigenetic factors responsible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I didn't know much about deer antlers, but after a little search, it seems most things with antlers don't shed them. In these cases, the antlers are bone that grows like a limb, and are covered in keratin, same stuff hair is made of - basically they're extensions of their skulls.</p>
<p>Some north American pronghorn deer are the exception to this, but their antlers are made totally of keratin, no bone. So the shedding is the same process as hair shedding. Their horns are even made by follicles, Judy like hair, except arranged differently.</p>
<p>That said, as far as I'm aware hair follicles do use stem cells to keep regenerating themselves, since a chunk of follicle is lost every time you lose a hair. These are specific hair follicle stem cells though - they can only become a limited amount of things. I'd imagine pronghorn horns work the same.</p>
<p>HOX is a family of 'transcription factor' genes (let's say TF). There's lots of different types of TFs, but they (to my knowledge) all work in similar ways. Basically, they're master on-off switches for a whole bunch of other genes. Say I'm a cell, and I need to turn on all the genes to do with wiggling more. There might be a 'wiggling more' TF gene. This gene has the instructions for a little machine which will scan my DNA for a particular code that labels all the 'wiggle more' genes. When it finds this code, it'll latch on, and recruit all the machines that read DNA to make sure the gene gets read. This means if I want to turn on all the wiggle more genes, all I have to do is turn on the wiggle more TF, and make tons of that machine. It'll label the rest.</p>
<p>TFs are used allll over the place. A lot of the time we don't have great understanding of what they do, because they seem to do different things in different situations. HOXA1 is involved in the development of the part of the brain that links up to the spine. But it also seems to be in charge of ear shape, and it may have jobs in adulthood.</p>
<p>Which is to say, yes there will be some TFs involved. Maybe even a HOX gene.</p>
<p>Similarly, epigenetics are involved in absolutely everything. Epigenetics is a more fine-tuned way of turn on or off gene activity. It's still a young field of research, so there's a lot we don't understand about it, though. It's basically a series of tags all along DNA. If genes are recipes, and transcription factors are bookmarks, then epigenetic tags are like notes scribbled in the margins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the nifty explanation of scientific terms. It really helps.  But I think deer do shed antlers and it is pretty intriguing: “The annual loss and swift regrowth of antlers in the buck deer is one of the most intriguing phenomena in the mammalian world, and some experts think that studying it may shed light on the possibility of regenerating human organs.</p>
<p>“No other mammal can naturally regenerate any lost organ, let alone anything as large and complex as an antler,” wrote the authors of a 2005 article in The Journal of Anatomy. The antlers of a 440-pound adult red deer, for example, may weigh as much as 66 pounds but take only three months to grow.”</p>
