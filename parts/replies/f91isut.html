			<div class="markdown"><p>I had incredible shoulder pain after my 3rd C-section, I thought I was having a heart attack or an embolism, but nope, just gas trapped in my abdomen from the surgery. And I was on massive painkillers, but the shoulder pain was still so incredibly bad I could hardly sleep or hold my baby. It suuuuuuucked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an abdominal surgery a couple years back to remove a mass on my ovary. The worst part of recovery was the shoulder pain the first night. Felt like someone took a knife and dug it into the muscle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a laparoscopy back in July to remove a migrated Mirena and that air irritating that nerve in my shoulder was some of the most extreme pain I've ever had in my life. My husband drove 40 minutes both ways at 3 AM to go get me my prescription pain meds it was so bad. I was wailing and was in more pain than actually birthing a baby naturally. I hated that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was my understanding that the chief reason for using CO2 was that it isn't flammable (vs minimizing nitrogen).  Really hard to use electrocautery with pure O2 being pumped into a belly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is - but. If it were simply about minimizing fire we could use air right? </p>
<p>CO2 allows for the most absorptive gas while not using O2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only reason to use pure O2 instead of just air would be to minimize nitrogen. And O2 would be a terrible idea because of fire risk. Hence, CO2 is used because it eliminates fire risk and is nitrogen-free, thus quickly absorbed.</p></div>		</li>
