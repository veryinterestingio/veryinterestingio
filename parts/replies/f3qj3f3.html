			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually not all there is to it. To oversimplify things, bacterial cell membranes are made of lipids — in ELI5 language, oils. So regular old soap shreds apart bacteria (and certain other microorganisms) by the same mechanism that it removes oil from your skin. Normal soap is actually just as effective at killing surface bacteria as &quot;antibacterial&quot; soap, which is really just a marketing ploy.</p>
<p>EDIT: Lots of (better educated) people in the responses below are disputing this explanation, so don't take my word for it. In theory it's at least partially correct, but in practice it sounds like either the &quot;normal&quot; soap that you buy at the store isn't strong enough to have this effect, the average person doesn't wash their hands thoroughly enough to have this effect, or some combination of both. And apparently not <em>all</em> bacteria is vulnerable to the effect I described here. I'm not a microbiologist, just repeating explanations I heard from doctors a long time ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how do you kill the bacteria and/or remove the oil if you don't have any soap?  For example, you are on the show Survivor and want to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom, especially since wiping is iffy with leaves.  Is there a good way to remove the bacteria and clean your hands?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol? That’s the active ingredient in hand sanitizer</p>
<p>If you’re not on Survivor but want to kill bacteria, there’s also bleach, hydrogen peroxide, silver, copper, etc. All of these need adequate contact time with the bacteria to kill them. If you spray/wipe the contaminated object (hands, countertop, toys) but don’t let it sit long enough, then not all bacteria will be killed. I think you need to let cleaners like these sit approx 10min before wiping away. For alcohol, you have to let it dry off, don’t wipe it. </p>
<p>Just FYI- there’s a difference between SANITIZING/DISNFECTING and CLEANING. Most ppl conflate the two. Sanitizing will kill the bacteria. It won’t necessarily clean away dirt. Cleaning will remove dirt, but doesn’t mean it will kill bacteria (some of it will be removed). </p>
<p>Examples:
Sanitizing:
Use hand sanitizer on muddy hands. Bacteria is killed; hands still look dirty</p>
<p>Cleaning:
Wipe floor with paper towel and water. The floor looks clean (no dirt), but it can be ridden with E. coli, salmonella, herpes (herpes can survive days on a hard surface! But it’s a virus, not bacterium). My roommate used to “clean” like this, but he was just moving around dirt IMO</p>
<p>Triclosan is the active ingredient in hand soaps. It’s GRAS, but there’s been some research indicating it’s not. Plus, bacteria are developing resistance as most ppl buy antibacterial soap not realizing that normal soap is just as good- so long as you wash for long enough (like with any antibacterial soap). Triclosan’s used in hand soaps, body and face washes, mouthwash, containers, toothpaste so watch out for it. </p>
<p>Lots of ppl concerned about toxins in cleaners (ie moms, ppl w compromised immune systems) will use natural alternatives that are just as good at killing bacteria as bleach. Hydrogen peroxide at a high concentration (a lot stronger than the OTC 3%) can cause burns. After it oxidizes, it turns into water and oxygen. H2O2 is highly reactive, forming radicals, which can kill cells. Not exactly sure how silver and copper work (I believe the cell membrane is infiltrated), but nanosilver is used to line water bottles and other containers. Some ppl use a special toxin-free silver cleaning spray to kill bacteria AND viruses (MRSA, salmonella, strep, HIV, etc). I know Berkey Water sells it on their website to clean out their water purifiers. As a kid, I used to use colloidal silver internally (tastes like water and super gentle) and topically. Others use copper containers to kill bacteria in water (has to sit overnight). This won’t purify the water (ie filter out debris, remove meds/pesticides etc), but it will kill bacteria in the water, like G. lambia (which causes giardia). Apparently if you cook with/drink water from copper utensils/containers, you do have to be mindful of how too much copper can leach zinc from your body and take extra zinc. If using silver/copper internally, there’s a chance of heavy metal buildup/toxicity so I would consult a health professional if you go that route. Again, I’m no expert, just sharing what I’ve learned over the years. </p>
<p>Some ppl say honey has antibacterial properties. Same with castor oil, lauric acid in coconut oil, but these are messy and usually used internally. They can kill surface bacteria, but I believe bleach, triclosan, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, silver are more effective</p>
<p>Or heat. Heat denatures proteins, aka breaks them down and kills cells. This is important as there’s a difference between sanitizing something (ie killing bacteria) and simply cleaning/disinfecting it (removing dirt/grime and most surface bacteria). Heat will SANITIZE something, but may still need to be cleaned (ie water from a lake still needs to be filtered to remove debris even though it’s been boiled). You can wipe your muddy hands with hand wipes and CLEAN them (remove dirt), but you’ll still have some bacteria. You can sanitize a stainless steel instrument (ie knife), but you’ll likely want to remove the soot (dirt) before using it. </p>
<p>So if I were out in the wilderness, I’d make sure I have alcohol (which of course I’d bring along lol- just make sure it doesn’t have other goodies like sugar in it) and a way to make fire so I can kill off bacteria. Those two most ppl have when in the wilderness (camping) and will effectively kill bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a question for a survivalist. :P IIRC soap is just fat + lye, so if you could find a reliable source for those two ingredients out in the wild you might be able to make some. But then (again, IIRC), lye is pretty caustic, so I don't know how safe it would be to try to handle it out in the wilderness without some sort of protective equipment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this is true, although I'm not a microbiologist. I think you'll kill a very small per cent of the bacterial load in the time you take to wash your hands with regular soap. The contact time with the soap is too short to disrupt the peptidoglycan/lipid membrane.</p>
<p>I think the previous answer is more accurate for your average person washing their hands. Unless the wash contains an antimicrobial like clorohexidine and you really scrub like a surgery Team during prep you are really just decreasing the bacterial load on your hands by stripping the oils they live in. Most of the time this seems to be adequate to prevent contamination/transmission. </p>
<p>This may be different for gram negative bacteria and coliforms, which presumably are the most important to get rid of after going to the toilet. Maybe they do die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh, in microbio we learned that regular soap typically isn’t strong enough to actually lyse the bacteria and that the “antibacterial” action is pretty much just from washing the oils away off the skin.</p>
<p>Regular soap also does nothing or very little to directly destroy viruses or other pathogens even though some of those have phospholipid outer membranes just like bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regular soap mechanically removes the bacteria from your hands and not much killing. In healthcare, we generally avoid antimicrobial soaps as it is a contributing factor for resistance and normal soap is just as good</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct.  The whole shredding bacteria thing is bs.  I work for a very large producer of soap and if we’re not careful we have large batches of soap contaminated with GNR easily.  They live happily in soap, shampoo, etc.</p></div>		</li>
