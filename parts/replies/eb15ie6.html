<p>Here are a couple quick youtube videos I found in case anyone else wants to see them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I'll point out in case anyone else is watching that second video before their first coffee of the day:</p>
<p>It's a million <em>pounds</em> of TNT. Which, assuming the US uses imperial, is half a kiloton or about 1/40 of the Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki. Or 1/50,000th the yield of the B41 three-stage bomb the US previously had in service.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the case of a pile of TNT the detonation would propagate through the pile in several hundred ms and the initial fireball would be considerably cooler than the equivalent sized nuclear fireball.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are assuming 1 point of ignition. You could detonate the 27 million 1-cubic-meter blocks of TNT all at the exact same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could do, but you would need 27 million detonators and 27 million exact same lengths of firing cable then a suitable firing device capable of initiating it all. </p>
<p>But it would be a problem to try and detonate it from one point, I've seen far, far smaller demolitions where they have been prepared incorrectly and the shockwave from initiating via a single point has thrown other elements of the demolition clear.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... you've accepted the idea of 27 million cubic meter blocks of TNT, but you're stuck on the idea of detonating them all at the same time?</p>
<p>You don't need to do it with firing cable.  Just get 27 million networked devices that can sync their clocks via network.  Or, let each device detonate 4 blocks and you need than 6.75 million of them. Then, once they are synced, they can decide when to detonate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TNT detonates in response to the shock wave produced by the detonator. The shockwave produced by other TNT exploding would work just as well. by detonating a network of points along the outside of a spherical arrangement of TNT the shockwave moving inward would detonate the rest without blowing it outward first.  </p></div>		</li>
