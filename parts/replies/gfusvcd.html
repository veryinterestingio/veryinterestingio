			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Base is super similar. There are some differences tho that effects your skin.  Both can have lots of extra ingredients.
Most hand soap may be too harsh for the rest of your body.. especially face.. and dry out your skin or potentially irritate it. </p>
<p>You can probably get a basic body soap and use it for hands and shampoo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've been using a large bottle of shower gel as a handwash (that my partner bought by mistake) for most of the year and have only just reached the halfway mark recently. It seems to work even better than actual handwash in that only a tiny amount is needed for a really good lather. Smells lovely, too!</p></div>		</li>
