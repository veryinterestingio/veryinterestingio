			<div class="markdown"><p>They've eaten them forever. They've grown the immunities in <del>their liver</del> their guts that help them eat them and prevent infections. Not only that, but humans haven't had to survive on their kill alone for a long time. We've always cooked our meats because it was healthier for us, and now if we were to eat raw meat, it wouldn't be healthy for us, especially with things like parasites, bacteria, and other nasty things that would be living in raw flesh, especially after any length of time of the meat just sitting there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't we?  Steak tar tar is raw beef, oysters are raw, so is most sushi.  Granted it's all very fresh but that's seafood and beef, I can't imagine goat or anything else would be all that bad.  There's a delicacy in the phillipines that's eating a raw fertilized egg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this is wrong. Animals eat raw animal meat because their bacterial flora is developed to handle it, aka they don't get infections we would because their gut is specialized for it. The liver doesn't do shit about gut bacteria.</p>
<p>Man also hasn't &quot;always cooked our meat.&quot; Humans have existed well before they figured out how to utilize fire. There really isn't much more explanation necessary than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The immunities in their liver? Raw meat isn't toxic, it harbors harmful bacteria and parasites. And animals are at risk from these the same way humans are, generally speaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was little, my mom would give me a chunk of raw ground beef as a treat for helping carry in the groceries. I still can't help myself and take a piece when I am putting my own groceries away as an adult. I figure I've been doing this roughly 2 times a month for 40 years. Can't remember ever getting sick, and with some salt it is so delicious. Whenever I do it in front of non-family members though, people get pretty concerned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People seem to get really concerned and treat general rules of thumb as if it’s life or death. Case in point the poster in this thread stating that eating raw chicken ‘will’ kill you. They also seem to propagate these falsehoods with some amount of vigour. Attempts at nuance are discarded, it’s sad, and odd.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However also keep in mind there are a lot of things animals can eat that humans can't, such as raw meat from fresh kills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can, and do, eat raw meat. What's dangerous about it isn't some toxin or so, but rather the risk of parasites and other diseases, which is a risk that exists for other animals too.</p></div>		</li>
