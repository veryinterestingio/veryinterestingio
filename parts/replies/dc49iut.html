			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this answer because it logically clarifies why dividing by zero is undefined, vs.  examples with food where I just think: well obviously if you divide a chocolate bar by 0 you just don't divide it and therefore still have one chocolate bar.  </p>
<p>Thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. And I thought if you divide it into 0 equal parts, I pictured cutting it all crazy like where no parts are equal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on this outside of ELI5. Since we define a function to be continuous if lim as x -&gt; a of f(x) is equal to f(a) for all a in the domain of f(x). We can look at the function f(x) = 1/x. </p>
<p>We can then look to see if the lim of f(x) approaching from the right and left like you showed, as lim x -&gt; 0 from the left approaches -infinity and positive infinity from the right we can say that the limit does not exist since the limit from the right and left don't equal each other. Thus f(x) is discontinuous at f(0), hence f(0) has a hole in the graph at x=0 and undefined. </p></div>		</li>
