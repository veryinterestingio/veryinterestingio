			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s more the fact that the idea of any state variable essentially goes away. </p>
<p>Nothing can be causally related and no information or energy or anything at all can be exchanged so our physics fails to accurately describe anything within, due to special relativity. I don’t see how we can describe anything where interactions are gone</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. But if there are no interactions and everything's smushed into a non-dimensional point, there's probably no movement either. Doesn't that imply that it could be considered to be at standstill? I'm just wondering if it would possible to assume that there is absolutely zero heat, as the total absence from heat would mean the total standstill?</p>
<p>As for information being lost, I've read an interesting article about the information being stored on the event horizon due to infinite redshifting. So like a giant map of everything that's entered the black hole. I think it wasn't a very scientific article, but the idea somewhat makes sense. The question for me would be if that information would be released with hawking radiation too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kind of like this answer because it makes me think that while the energy inside the black hole is immense, the fact that force carriers are unable to leave the black hole basically makes that energy irrelevant to external systems, effectively meaning  that the temperature inside is irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and even more impactful nearly all information that entered, which was/is a major problem in cosmology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like how you worded that response, actually. It reminds me of the physicists who explored quantum physics first. They mostly all abhorred what the evidence was pointing towards. Mostly because it pointed away from a deterministic understanding of physics, and against the commonly accepted Newtonian model. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha thanks! I think it's never wrong to stay open minded, as long as you respect the likeliest answer until you can disprove it.<br />
For some reason I don't want to accept the speed of light as a total maximum. Not that I expect myself or anyone else to actually prove it, but I can't get rid of that thought.<br />
It wouldn't be the first time we (humanity) thought to have reached 'the end', only to find out it's actually far from it. Maybe I just wanna yell 'called it' if that happens in my lifetime...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I’m mistaken but temperature is a measure of molecular kinetic energy. If the molecules are compressed into a singularly there would be no motion or kinetic energy therefore temperature would be 0k right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically a singularity by definition cannot be a compound object. It's a point mass. There is no average kinetic energy amongst constituent particles because there are no constituent particles.</p></div>		</li>
