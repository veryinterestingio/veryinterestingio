<p>So the console does 2 checks, if the gun is seeing light and when it saw the light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. I presume with multiple ducks the white dot would alternate between the ducks. So if you pull the trigger and it senses white then it knows what duck was lit up.
I just shot at the white ceiling and won many times.</p></div>		</li>
