			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask a follow up question?</p>
<p>How is it that some nerves can be re-attached and heal, but larger spinal injuries leave a personal paralyzed? Is it just the complexity of the CNS vs a nerve of, say, a finger?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, yes. The complexity of the structure impacts it's ability to recover. You can think of a single nerve to the tip of the  finger as a piece of wet spaghetti, and the spinal cord as millions  of wet noodles. You cut them in half--its next to impossible to line all of those up perfectly again.  It also has to do with the mechanism of the injury. When you transect a nerve, it has a hard time regrowing back to where it was before. However, if you reconnect the two ends, it is more likely to find the &quot;right&quot; path back to the structure it was innervating. Even, then the recovery is far from guaranteed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I’m late to the game but I can answer this! It’s not necessarily the complexity, it’s what part of the nerve gets damaged. Our spinal cord is the hub for all of the sensory and motor nerves to travel between the brain and the body. Thus, the soma/cell body of the neurons are in the spinal cord. This is the part of the neuron that holds the nucleus, and is essentially the “brain” of each neuron. So if you hurt the spinal cord and kill a neuron at the soma/cell body, you kill it forever. A neuron with a damaged cell body cannot regrow, like a human with a dead brain cannot heal. But between the spinal cord and the rest of the body are the axons of the neurons, which are big tails that send information from the cell body all the way down the neuron towards the cell body of the next neuron. Because the axon doesn’t hold the main functioning control (nucleus/brain) of the neuron, it can heal, like other broken things in your body. So if you damage the axons in your leg, you could eventually learn to walk again, but if you damage the cell bodies in your spinal cord, not so much. This is especially true because there is only one major nerve that travels between your spinal cord and legs, so there is nothing to compensate if it gets damaged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. When they sew veins and arteries, do they ensure the blood can flow through those veins and arteries?</p>
<p>From what I understand, these vessels are basically hollow cylindrical tubes. How do people sew together a cylindrical shaped tube to ensure blood flow and healing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes--if there's no blood flow, the amputated tissue will die. </p>
<p>I'm not quite sure what you mean by the second question. Here's a SFW youtube video with some basics of vascular anastomoses. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eQ0sB0waGA" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eQ0sB0waGA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eQ0sB0waGA</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. The sewing technique for cylindrical tubes was what I was looking for and this answers my question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great vid (I wonder if anyone actually had to use bulldog clips for real?!) but there’s obviously still tiny holes between the stitches. Presumably the stitches are small enough that the blood will clot and fill the holes as with an injury? Also how do you ensure that no air gets into the bloodstream when you release the clamps either side of the cut? Do you squeeze the air out first before releasing the clamps or is this a non-issue really?</p></div>		</li>
