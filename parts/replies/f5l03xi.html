			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yhN85l.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> is a decent chord progression guideline to follow/break if you’re writing songs yourself and hate the <a href="https://youtu.be/oOlDewpCfZQ" target="_blank">four chords</a>. It worked pretty well for the past few hundred years (not including the weird stuff *cough Schöneberg etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%E2%80%93V%E2%80%93vi%E2%80%93IV_progression" target="_blank">I–V–vi–IV</a></p>
<p>The progression (order) can be different, but those four chords are the sucrose of the music world. We just happen to like them. Not all of the examples they use follow the exact progression.</p>
<p>A decade before Axis of Awesome, we had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM" target="_blank">Rob Paravonian complaining about this progression and Pachelbel</a> on early Youtube.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed a few incorrect points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in a different video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I</a> they use a guitar and so the &quot;chords&quot; equal where one hand holds the strings for example.</p>
<p>All the songs use the same 4 chords but the other hand does things differently depending on the song. But that first hand also switches between the 4 chords with different timing or maybe a different order.</p>
<p>That gets more complicated to explain for the keyboard player (I have no idea if he thinks its more or less complicated) but it's the same concept, he uses keys to match the &quot;chords&quot; used by the guitar player.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The N^6 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_chord" target="_blank">Neapolitan chord</a>. The Fr+6 is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_sixth_chord" target="_blank">French Augmented sixth chord</a>.</p>
<p>They were codified as replacements for the IV (or ii), which typically precede the standard V - I resolutions.</p></div>		</li>
