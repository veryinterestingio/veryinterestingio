			<div class="markdown"><p>Router: Creates a self contained &quot;room&quot; where people can talk without conversation cross over. Can also pass specific conversations out to other &quot;rooms&quot; for specific recipients.</p>
<p>Switch: Connects people in the &quot;room&quot; created by the router for private conversations.</p>
<p>Hub: Tells everyone it knows everything it hears in the &quot;room&quot; it occupies.</p>
<p>Modem: Takes something from one language and translates it to a language understood in the &quot;rooms&quot; it connects to.</p>
<p>Bridge: Connects two &quot;rooms&quot; together as if they're not separate places.</p>
<p>Gateway: The &quot;doorway&quot; that the router uses to facilitate conversations to other rooms.</p>
<p>Wireless Access Point (WAP or AP): Tells everyone it knows everything it hears using telepathy. Like a hub but not really</p>
<p>As mentioned in your edit a consumer level &quot;router&quot; contains a router, switch, and WAP working together for convenience. Professional hardware can separate them out into individual hardware devices or virtualize the mentioned devices and then some into a single appliance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If two people scream at the same time, they both have to roll a D20 and wait that long before they can try and scream again. If they roll the same number, rinse/repeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect for ELI5.  If you want to get more technical, replace &quot;room&quot; with &quot;network&quot;.<br />
Also a WAP is creates a shared open-air room by shouting messages in all directions over the air instead of handing messages to people (hub/switch/router).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;room,&quot; in my context, is the broadcast domain that the router produces. The only time I stray from this analogy is the hub; in the context of a hub it's &quot;room&quot; is whatever occupies it's collision domain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP’s comment required a great deal of prerequisite technical knowledge. </p>
<p>When I took computer networking in college, back in the Stone Age (lol), they used a door-hallway-home-neighborhood-country analogy. I’d slightly amend GP’s choices - something like:</p>
<p>a switch is a room where people only have private conversations, </p>
<p>a hub is a room where people only shout to each other, </p>
<p>a gateway is a hallway linking rooms in a house</p>
<p>a router is stairs linking hallways (in home use, in a house, but There Are Exceptions),</p>
<p>a bridge links houses in a neighborhood (There Are Exceptions)</p>
<p>And in this story, all people (computers that aren’t pieces of the above list) must be in a room</p>
<p>This conveys that a room (hub/switch) doesn’t really know about the wider world, and you need to relay up and then relay down to reach another person. </p>
<p>But this is ELI5. For a five year old, this model is reasonably robust.</p>
<p>Then VPNs are people in one room being treated like they’re magically inside another room, somewhere else; so if one room had snacks but only for people in the room, the VPN is that person in a different room getting permission to the snacks without moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah maybe it's just because I have some small experience with networking, but I found the non-analogy comment a lot easier to understand than all these analogy ones.</p>
<p>Maybe I overestimate the general public, but I don't think that PCs, network traffic, broadcasting messages, etc. are super-complicated concepts. Like, they're not technical in the way that, say, physics or mathematics are, ya know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To extrapolate just a bit with Router and Switch...a router will route traffic based on IP address. A Switch routes traffic based on MAC address.  A MAC address is a hard coded identifier on every piece of hardware from the factory.</p>
<p>Now this part isn't ELI5 but a switch routes traffic at layer 2, the data layer in the OSI model.  A router routes traffic at layer 3, the network layer in the OSI model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are effectively routers. &quot;Layer 3 switch&quot; is a marketing/historical term.</p>
<p>Basically what happened is that routers did all their work in software, while switches did all their work in hardware. Then manufacturers started making switch hardware that could also route packets at L3, just like a router. But since those companies were making switches, and they wanted to market them as switches, and &quot;router&quot; sounded like a huge expensive CPU-driven behemoth while they had a sleeker hardware-driven device, they started calling them L3 switches.</p>
<p>If you have an L3 switch, and you're using the L2 and L3 features, then it's acting as both a switch and a router. If you only use the L3 features then it's a router, and if you only use the L2 features then it's a switch.</p></div>		</li>
