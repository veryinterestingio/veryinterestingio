			<div class="markdown"><p>But as discussed in that link, there's some debate about whether that feature is even a significant contributor of phenotypic variation, and plenty of researchers think that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy201098" target="_blank">the unique patterns of aritifical selection in dogs is more than enough to account for the variation that exists</a>.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Artificial selection has transformed many animals (and plants) to similar degrees as dogs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider goldfish - originally a drab Asian Carp shaped like any other small fish - now have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfish#Varieties" target="_blank">wide range of shapes, sizes, and colors that look nothing alike</a></li>
<li>Consider turkeys - originally a flying bird - bred to be too fat to fly.</li>
<li>Consider Corn - <a href="https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/08/09/ancient-corn-genome-unlock-secrets-crop-diversity-adaptation/" target="_blank">originally small bunches of seeds that looked more like a stalk of wheat</a></li>
<li>Or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs" target="_blank">Aurochs - the 7-foot-tall horned ancestors of cows</a> </li>
<li>or <a href="https://www.thehappychickencoop.com/silkie-chicken/" target="_blank">Silkie Chickens that look more like a furry pokemon</a> than their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl" target="_blank">red junglefowl ancestor</a></li>
<li>or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_oleracea" target="_blank">cauliflower, broccoli, brussel sprouts, kohlrabi, &quot;tree cabbages&quot;, kale, and cabbage</a> - all the same species bred by people for different foods</li>
<li>Does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar" target="_blank">this pig</a> look anything like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig" target="_blank">this pig</a> that humans bred from the former one?</li>
</ul>
<p>And circling back to OP's question of cats....</p>
<p>Considering that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felid_hybrid#Domestic_%C3%97_wild_hybridization" target="_blank">domestic cats can breed with Asian leopard cats,  Margays, fishing cats, caracals, oncilla, and other similar species</a>, if people chose to do so, they could breed a much broader range of cat-like hybrids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetic plasticity aside, dogs have such a variety of body types because we've bred them that way.</p>
<p>People have been using dogs to do work for thousands of years, and depending on the type of work we wanted them to do, we bred them to have bodies which went along with that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cats are too small to do any work, and the one thing we always wanted them to do, which is kill rodents, they were already perfectly suited to do.  So no selective breeding was ever needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really a valid comparison, those are all different species. They’re all feline species, but they wouldn’t be able to produce fertile offspring with a common house cat. All breeds of dogs today are still in fact a single species, and can generally still freely crossbreed and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Genetic plasticity&quot; is not really a term in evolutionary biology and phenotypic plasticity is an entirely different concept that describes changes due to environmental influences rather than genetic change, so it doesn't apply in the case of the diversity of dog breeds.</p>
<p>What you're describing instead seems to be something more like &quot;evolvability.&quot; I'm not sure a single selective breeding experiment is good evidence of that, though, particularly since it's not even in a very closely related species. Most plants and animals will respond very dramatically to selective breeding. In fact, the fox study you mentioned is commonly discussed as an example of a much broader pattern in the way selection affects a whole suite of traits together through developmental patterning, rather than something specific to canines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're pretty similar. 2.5 billion bases <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000181335.3" target="_blank">for cats</a> and 2.4 billion bases <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000002285.3" target="_blank">for dogs</a>, give or take.</p>
<p>Evolvability would have more to do with how genes tend to act in dogs compared to cats. The idea is that something about the way development genes work in dogs makes it so that similar amounts of genetic change can lead to more phenotypic change in dogs, at least for some traits that humans have exploited.</p>
<p>It also seems possible that the original gene pool that dogs were selected from just carried more genetic variation than the one cats derive from.</p></div>		</li>
