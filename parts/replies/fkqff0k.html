			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worse because its really contagious and it hits older people and people who have other illnesses really hard.  SARS and MERS are more lethal but far less contagious.  </p>
<p>What makes Covid so bad is that it can spread via people who hardly seem sick at all.</p>
<p>Look at the way it's jumped around the planet so fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's highly infectious and it's sneaky, some people can transmit it when they're not very sick, so you sometimes cant tell if someone is infected.  It's can be a stealth transmitter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For multiple reasons. It's a novel virus meaning people are highly unlikely to have immunity to it, we have no vaccines for prevention, it has a high rate of transmission, varying symptoms, lots of asymptomatic carriers and causes complications in elderly and immunocompromised people.</p></div>		</li>
