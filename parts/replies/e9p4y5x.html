			<div class="markdown"><p>Superconducting qubits are popular for two reasons mainly: They are relatively easy to implement experimentally, and there exists good schemes for control and readout. While these are not trivial benefits, current superconducting qubit technology also has two crucial drawbacks: They have relatively short coherence time and they are very large physically. This makes them essentially useless in highly scaled quantum computers (probably above 1000 qubits). Currently, it is assumed that at least 1 million qubits are needed to achieve a useful quantum computer. This is way out of reach for superconducting qubits.</p>
<p>Spin qubits appear to solve the issue of scalability due to their small size, but interconnects will instead dominate chip area, so physical scalability remains challenging. Moreover, spin qubits have no currently demonstrated implementation of control schemes, and their experimental coherence times appear short.</p>
<p>To solve the issue of coherence time, experts that I've talked to consider the use of topologically protected states necessary. For this, Majorana fermions are the most promising candidates. There are also promising light-based quantum computers which have the benefit of allowing very sophisticated error correction schemes, reducing the need for high number of qubits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi working with quantum dot spin qubits personally, we have single qubit control and measurement at greater than 99% fidelity reported and coherence time is on the order of ms, (which is better than superconducting qubits) the biggest problems at the moment are 2 qubit gate fidelity and the need for additional ancilla qubits in error correction architectures. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, what are the primary challenges facing qdot spin qubits right now? I thought that the main issue was multiple qubit connectivity? </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd love to see a source for that one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This review article is a bit old, but it's still a relatively good overview: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0928" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0928</a></p>
<p>On page 39, they estimate the number of qubits needed to make a computer which can run Shor's algorithm at a useful scale is of order 100 million.  On the other hand, in principle, you can run specific types of calculations on machines with 50-100 qubits which cannot be simulated on our current classical computers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I am aware of arxiv, however I only read papers posted there if they are recommended to me (or I found link to them on Twitter, Hacker News, Reddit etc.). Should I just browse it and decide to read papers based on abstracts or are there some online places specialised in recommending interesting papers?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I personally feel like browsing through arxiv based on abstracts is similar to going through /new on reddit, you can hit up a lot of interesting things if you're willing to slog through a lot of less interesting things, but it definitely needs a certain mindset (eg. patience).  If you have a specific topic in mind though, it can definitely be a good strategy.</p>
<p>I'm not sure of a specialized source just for interesting papers, the sources you already posted are where I usually get my recommended links from as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think for popular news media, the best is Quanta - I typically find that their popular articles are the best. You can also set up a Google alert for the phrase &quot;Quantum Computing&quot; and have it delivered every week - that's what I do! Browsing the arXiv is hard and tedious, but it is the way that researchers communicate with each other. </p></div>		</li>
