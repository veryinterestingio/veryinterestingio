			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be out of the loop a bit because I've been slacking on my music production, but I feel like the loudness war has dwindled quite a bit. There was a time from 2010-2016, when Big Room House was all the rage and everyone was like &quot;-3dB RMS or it's trash!&quot;, but I feel like now it doesn't matter as long as the result sounds good and is loud enough to comfortably listen to on most devices. </p>
<p>Obviously music being too quiet is a problem, and less dynamics subjectively sounds better than more dynamics, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? Has it dwindled a bit these past years? Good. I still have nightmares of that 2008-2012 era where the YouTube HD version sounded better than the CD one :C</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, standards introduced by the streaming providers along with settings in the apps to normalize volumes across multiple selections make it not as important to labels for their mixes to be &quot;louder.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Probably the biggest difference in the music industry between now and then.</p></div>		</li>
