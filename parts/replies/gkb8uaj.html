			<div class="markdown"><p>Sub-Eli5. If  there’s always bitcoin being sent and received, with verifiers of the transaction also receiving Bitcoin, why is  it still valuable? Won’t the amount of Bitcoin in ‘circulation’ only rise, and such the value falls? Or is that approx. 10 minute interval to generate Bitcoin enough to keep the value steady by itself?</p></div>		</li>

<p>So probably that would help in keeping this in check.</p></div>		</li>
