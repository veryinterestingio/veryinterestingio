<p>So you travel to your polling location on the Monday to vote on the Tuesday.</p>
<p>You couldn't hold it on Saturday because you might need the day to travel back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Election day is a bit of a misnomer. It's not the only day to vote, it's just the last day (in 34 states). You can vote pretty much any day for 2-3 weeks prior to election day, depending on the state, and that includes weekends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely depends on the state. For NC, I voted like 2.5 weeks ago. I was out, near a voting location, and there wasn't a long line. So me and my BF decided to stop in and vote. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is an important disclaimer - I don't understand why my state of New York requires everyone to vote on a workday.. (not counting absentee ballots that require you to have good reason to vote by mail) </p></div>		</li>
