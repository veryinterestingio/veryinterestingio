			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two more stars in that system right? If one of those stars are nearer to their end and become red giants, couldn't they fuel the red dwarf enough to make its mass a little bit more? Or will it go the other way around and the red dwarf will lose its mass to one of the other bigger stars</p></div>		</li>

It's possible that it picks up gas from them as they die, but it may be too diffuse by the time it's expanded that far out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 25,000 years or so, yes. But only for ~10,000 years, then it will be Ross 248 that will be closest. Then Gliese 445, then Alpha Centauri again. There is a great graphic showing all of this here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars_and_brown_dwarfs#/media/File:Near-stars-past-future-en.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars_and_brown_dwarfs#/media/File:Near-stars-past-future-en.svg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!</p>
<p>In approximately 25,000 years, Alpha Centauri AB will be closer to the Sun than Proxima. The entire system is approaching us and will reach 3.1 light years away in 30,000 years. When it does, Proxima will be further away than the binary pair.</p>
<p>Ross 248 will swing by to 2.9 light years in 37,000 years and will be  the closest approach in the next 50,000 years.</p></div>		</li>
