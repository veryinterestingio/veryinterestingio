			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have hard science on it, but as a distiller, I make sure to thoroughly stir all batches I make before proofing. If I measure a sample from 400kg of distillate before stirring it, I'll get a different answer than what I get after a stir. Typically I'll pull samples from the bottom of a tank, and stirring will raise the proof, since the alcohol migrates upward. This occurs within hours, with a sample proof change of a few units.</p></div>		</li>
