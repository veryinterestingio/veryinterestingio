			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons why is that the gold standard makes it really difficult to react to economic crises. When on the gold standard, during times of recessions and depressions, people will tend to hold onto gold instead of dollars. Since they're not spending it into the economy, it somewhat prolongs recessions/depressions.  </p>
<p>When you're on the modern age fiat system, you're just tweaking interest rates so people will spend $ to invest and grow out of the recession/depression. A lot of people think this gives the states and banks too much power, but it's one of the best ways to corral the economy when shit hits the fan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not. Who would be the ones forbidding it? </p>
<p>It’s not like there’s a global central bank that makes countries use fiat currency, it’s just the gold standard is known to be terrible monetary policy. There’s a lot of other great posts that explain why countries need to be able to have controlled inflation in order to keep a strong economy, so I won’t try to explain it here, but if you link your currency to the value of something that is entirely controlled by the market your economy becomes extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in that market and then you lose that necessary control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forbidden is the wrong word--you can freely trade gold just like every other commodity except stuff like uranium. </p>
<p>Countries just no longer make their currency redeemable specifically for gold--it's now just a general claim on all economic activity in that country since most countries for tax purposes mandate transactions take place in some quantity of currency (there are exceptions--eg you can buy a company with stock but even that has to be marked in some quantity of currency)</p></div>		</li>

I know Europe was hoping to have a stronger currency by the formation of the European Union and establishing the Euro and China's economy has been steadily growing for the past two decades but the Yuan is nothing close to the value of the American Dollar, but I remember reading that the International Monetary Fund was trying to mix their global reserve to further diversify its currencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, doesn't China have 2 currencies? One that it uses for no other reason than international trading, and the currency the people actually use, which is at a different rate than the Yuan? One of the main reasons international markets are more reluctant to rely on trade in Yuan. China can play both sides in manipulating it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if keeping 1/100 of the gold lump was a good strategy, how is keeping 1/110 of the gold lump suddenly a bad strategy? Sure you lost some claim on the gold, but that seems to me like a sunken cost as there is nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>Or is it the fear that the BB could at some point be only 1/200 of the gold lump?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because over time that money is basically worthless. This is what inflation is. When inflation is high, people tend to put their money into things with higher returns to avoid their money losing value, which also stimulates the overall economy. When inflation is low, people tend to hoard their money in low to no yield ways (shoving cash under the mattress) because there is no risk to it. Their money will be worth the same at a later date. The more that gets hoarded away, the less there is in circulation and the less that gets spent in the economy, driving it all down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I don't get is, weren't bank savings accounts supposed to take care of this? You could hoard money, but as long as you hoarded it into a bank account, it got lended out. It sure that we're doing double duty.</p>
<p>Nowadays people just hoard land. I think it was better when they just hoarded gold, because they didn't tie up valuable land resources.</p></div>		</li>
