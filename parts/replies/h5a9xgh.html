<p>Sex is determined by a difference in the egg.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember reading somewhere that in lizards the temperature of egg determines sex, how does that work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have an Enzym, which converts one sex hormone in another. And how fast the enzyme works, depends on the temperature. </p>
<p>It my be active at 20-26°C and convert the male sex Hormon into the female one. So eggs with an temperature below 26°C will be female. But if you go above the 26°C, the Enzym will stop working (or work very slow) and a male will hatch.</p>
<p>This is one part which is researched, there may be other key parts which are not yet discovered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems like a really poor adaptation doesn't it? Basically to get a 50/50 ratio the species is required to live somewhere where the median temperature is exactly at that setpoint and then hope the temperature is normally distributed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is currently not fully understood but it seems that the aromatase the enzyme that converts male-sex hormone androgens to female estrogens likely has a temperature sensitive adaptation (mutation?) that alters its activity in different temperatures. Basically, the enzyme works better in certain temperatures making the conversion from male to female hormones more efficient.<br />
However, more research is needed to truly understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's uncertain how the mechanism for TSD (Temperature-dependent Sex Determination) works exactly, but it's probably enzyme related.</p>
<p>Why are we sure it's an enzyme? Because there are two forms of TSD.</p>
<p>Pattern I TSD there is a temperature differential. Below a certain temperature it's always males, and above it it's always females.*</p>
<p>Pattern II produces males at a certain temperature band, but outside it produces females.</p>
<p>This is consistent with enzyme and temperature-related enzyme inhibition/activation.</p>
<p>Note that there are also transitional animals (mainly lizards) that have both sex chromosomes AND TSD (and to make it even more complicated, some of them are XY and some of them are ZW). In these animals there are XX and XY males (but females are always XX) or there are ZZ and ZW females, but males are always ZZ. Meaning that there are sex chromosomes in X and Z that are triggered at certain temperatures, but Y and W chromosomes that always trigger regardless of temperature.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>*Except in Tuataras where males are produced at high temperatures. Tuataras are also a very weird. They might look like lizards, but they're their unique thing. As different from lizards as lizards are from snakes).</p></div>		</li>
