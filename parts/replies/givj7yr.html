			<div class="markdown"><p>The mythbusters <a href="https://mythresults.com/episode65" target="_blank">tested this</a>: They only got a lighter to explode from heat when it became hot enough to actually melt the plastic. </p>
<p>The reason for this is that butane gas is relatively easy to keep as a liquid, even at temperatures above the boiling point of water. That said, a damaged or faulty lighter can of course explode under heat - or one filled with propane gas, which can also be kept as a pressurized liquid, but needs a much higher pressure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had it happen to me once, it wasn't so much of an explosion as it was the lighter breaking apart and spreading burning fuel all over my arm.  </p>
<p>I can still pretty vividly remember looking at my entire forearm being on fire and going &quot;Hmm, that isn't right&quot; before I remembered the whole &quot;Stop, Drop, and Roll&quot; thing and promptly fell on my arm.</p></div>		</li>

The whole table was basically ashes and we found broken lighter pieces around it. It was surreal. Didn't touch the house at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's designed not to because of the struts I mentioned. But yes, without those, there would be problems. A lighter is filled with highly combustible gas under high pressure. Putting it in the hot sun strains the plastic by increasing the interior pressure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If that's what it does to a lighter, think of what it does to a child or pet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine it's not so much the pressure pushing out as the ease with which you could put pressure on the middle of the lighter and smash the plastic, without that middle support being there.</p></div>		</li>
