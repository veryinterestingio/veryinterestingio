			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't find our control specs for our products (I wouldn't share anyway), but I know we operate in an ISO Class 4 Cleanroom environment and it complies with ISO 14644-1/2. All wetted components (those that touch the fluids use in processing chips) are electropolished (zapped in acid baths to pull chromium to the surface and smooth all imperfections out) and ultrasonically cleaned in DI water (we shoot sound waves to remove the tiny dirt in very very very clean water). Whatever the specs are we don't have issues meeting them. Our yield rate (good products) is around 89% (which is awful considering the price of this stuff) and it's mostly performance related.</p></div>		</li>
