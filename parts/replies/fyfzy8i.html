			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been told that low carb/keto diets are not good for diabetics, but personally I swerved myself from having o depend on insulin because of an ultra low carb diet.  There’s nothing you are excluding from your daily needs with a complex, low carb protocol.  The “uppity” low carb diets have you eat a broad mixture of healthy fat (salmon, avocados, coconut oil) and lots of leafy greens, nuts, etc.  </p>
<p>My dumdum friend that I got on the diet I was on though, just ate cheese, fried eggs, bacon and while he lost weight, was wondering why he didn’t feel so great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keto diets can be dangerous for a diabetic person. The whole point of keto diets is to increase your ketone levels and that by itself isn't a bad thing. But combined with the higher than average blood sugar of a diabetic person can go into acidosis and having experienced that myself, definitely not an experience I'd recommend...</p>
<p>Now this means that if you're diabetic and your blood sugar is <em>perfectly</em> under control, then yeah keto could benefit you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be a protective effect in malaria, however I will not comment on COV-2. We still know waaay too little to make any claims. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Low glucose levels can be achieved through fasting or ketosis and it appears that this will ward off malaria. Malaria apparently recurs in famine victims as a result of refeeding.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want a more in depth and rigorous exploration I'd like to recommend the This Week in Virology and Immune podcasts. They are hosted by a PhD who brings on guests who are experts in the field. They can get a bit technical for the layperson but imo they are an amazing source of information for people who can't or don't want to read academic papers</p></div>		</li>
