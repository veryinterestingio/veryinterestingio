			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Not all unions are the same.</p>
<p>Some of them are basically divisive and weak shills who have corrupted to the corporates. While others are staunchly working class and fight for their members.</p>
<p>But generally, having union support will improve worker conditions.</p>
<p>Everything from minimum wage, paid parental leave, working hours and the weekend are brought to you by the collective bargaining power of unions.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>Minimum wage isn't a direct result of collective bargaining of unions. It's an indirect result of political lobbying with unions as a contributor.</li>
<li>Paid parental leave is very rare in the US even among unionized workforces. In other countries, it's the because of legal requirements. </li>
<li>The modern concept of a 40 hour 5 day work week and a 2 day weekend largely comes from Henry Ford and his realization that if you give employees some time off, they need to spend money to fill that time. Unions had less to do with it than you'd think. </li>
</ul>
<p>Often, unions are a great thing. They've made huge strides for worker safety and fair pay. But many also have major faults, and they usually fall far short of achieving their stated objectives</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unions were the driving factor behind many of the legislative changes in Western Europe. Paid vacations, 5 day workweek, paid sick leave, reduced hours etc.</p>
<p>When unions gained enough momentum to force these things into their agreements, it could actually be a way to weaken the unions to write the changes into law, since it meant the benefits would be available also to non-union members. Instead of risking even more workers unionizing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience is with a large, powerful union. They seemed to do a lot to help people who were fired get their job back (even those who deserved to be fired), and pressuring people who weren't union members to become dues paying members.</p>
<p>To be fair, the place I worked paid well for anybody in a driving position, much better than those of us in the warehouse, and that high pay was greatly attributable to the union.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great example of how people forgot about why unions are useful to have.  Once a union has fought the battles and got its workers decent pay and conditions, people only see the union dues and the few edge cases the union still has to fight, and thinks, &quot;what is this union actually doing for me?&quot;  Workers having a union is like a country having an army.  It's expensive, and sometimes gets involved in questionable actions, but simply having it means that your country can stay out of wars.</p></div>		</li>
