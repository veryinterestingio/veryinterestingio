<p>There is just not ELI5 for this, if leading researchers on the field are not even sure I doubt any reddit professional could come up with an evidence based answer, there just isn't. Pain is weird man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I left it, going into a big commercial gym as a personal trainer means you gotta abide by a lot of broscience. Made worse by the fact that those made of facts are mainly used in your sales pitch (aspect that is quite the focus of the gym), got burned out and left the field altogether. Moving into IT now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, one of the few things we know (physical therapist here) is that manual therapy/massage/stretching acts mainly on a neurophysiological level, decreasing the excitability of stretch and pain receptors in the muscle (which form synapses into the spine). No source here but if you research anything about evidence based management of muscoloskeletal conditions.</p>
<p>TLDR: no clear answer, seems to be mainly about neurophysiological modulation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does this fall under &quot;muscle knot&quot; then?</p>
<p>About a few years ago I had a personal trainer.  He was adamant about rolling out my calves using a foam roller.  Explained that my calves were &quot;so knotted up&quot; that it caused me to not be able to jog.  Same with some parts of my thighs.  He also explained it's going to &quot;hurt like a son of a bitch&quot; and to power through it.  I agreed because fuck it why not.</p>
<p>I was met with the most excruciating pain I have ever felt in my life.  It was like he was kneeding baseballs in my calves and parts of my thighs.  I could feel the balls shift around and each time it moved from one side of the roller to the next I was gritting my teeth from how painful it was.</p>
<p>Eventually it was all rolled out and I was done for the day.  The next day I came to the gym, it was like I was given a pair of new legs.  I could actually jog for a long period.</p>
<p>To this day I never understood why this worked.  Hope someone can provide some insight on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely guarding or hyperactive muscle that when pressure was applied to the tissue caused inhibition (shutting it down). Most results seen with FRs are neuromuscular in nature as you most likely did not actually alter the physiological state of your muscle tissue overnight.</p></div>		</li>
