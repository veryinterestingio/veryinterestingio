			<div class="markdown"><p>To better understand the Moon Illusion, you first have to recognize that our experience of the world is quite literally, not equal to actual physical world around us. While the brain does its best to put together all the stimuli into a consistent perception, it doesn’t always get it right. </p>
<p>Our brains use these background rules called “Heuristics” to piece together our perception. The one being messed with in the moon illusion is the human brains heuristic dealing with the Horizon. </p>
<p>We use the horizon line to determine not only depth, but also size. Example - two men appear in front of you, the exact same size to your eyes. One however is farther in the distance (nearer to the horizon line), so your brain will tell you that the man in the distance must be larger if you they appear the same visual size.</p>
<p>You also experience this effect with mountains and other large landmarks for which our brains just don’t have a point of reference. Our brains try to do the same thing with the example above, but without a point of reference the heuristic backfires. Our brains see the moon near the horizon and assumes it must be either enormous or very close since there is not a reference point for depth for something so large/far away.</p></div>		</li>
