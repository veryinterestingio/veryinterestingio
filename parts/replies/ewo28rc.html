			<div class="markdown"><p>Citation needed, but i remember reading that a company has a patent to selling doses under 1mg as it is much more effective. So it's cheaper to buy larger pills and split them up. Ever since I've been taking under 1mg I have been falling asleep much more easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My son is on the spectrum and had a great deal of difficulty falling asleep (this is often co-morbid with autism).  We dealt with him being out of bed constantly until after 10 or 11 every night.  My wife read about melatonin and I thought we'd try 1mg chewable. I was aware of the placebo effect so I never told him what it was or what it was for.  He went to bed as usual and for the first time in his life was asleep immediately.  There is no placebo effect here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, melatonin doesn't actually help me sleep at all, but it makes me tired and sleepy in the evening in a way that I don't hate the idea of going to bed. Without it, I feel way too active and the thought of having to go to bed and lay there awake &quot;too early&quot; pisses me off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, my quality of sleep doesn't change, and I'll wake up just as easily (and I'll usually wake up 4 times to pee anyway).</p>
<p>But without melatonin I'm lying awake for hours just waiting to fall asleep. My mind isn't very active, I'll daydream about mundane stuff sometimes, or just focus on my breathing. I just feel wired in a weird way, like I've got runner's high.</p>
<p>I'll easily be awake for 28-36 hours before I get sleepy. Some days I get sleepy in the afternoon, some days I finally get sleepy at 4am, and some days I accidentally pull an all nighter, lying down just staring at my eyelids, feeling physically fatigued but not sleepy, waiting for sleep, only to hear my alarm and drag myself off to work. </p>
<p>I can be exhausted, I can be fatigued, I can be tired, lethargic and listless, but for me none of those feelings are the same as sleepy/drowsy, and if I'm not sleepy, I can't seem to drift off no matter how hard I focus on proper sleep hygiene methods. </p>
<p>Melatonin makes me drowsy within 20 minutes, and as long as my room is dark and quiet, I fall asleep. </p>
<p>I have a suspected circadian rhythm disorder, my mum has ISWVD and my dad is narcoleptic, my sleep study was inconclusive but my actigraph was irregular so my neurologist prescribed melatonin in the meantime and recommended I get another sleep study when I've got some other health stuff under control.</p></div>		</li>
