			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Ventilation of the fire building is done in a coordinated effort with the attack. </p>
<p>Either vertical(cutting a hole in the roof) or horizontally  (taking out windows and doors) </p>
<p>So, In an ideal world (perfect scenario) the first arriving engine company would stretch their line to the source of the fire, the next due company would likely split the crew and start a search, while the other half begins venting the room of origin. Doing that gives somewhere for the smoke and steam to go.</p>
<p>Now, it may temporarily increase the fire size of done a bit early, but, if your attack crew is in place and or just about to put water on the fire, it’s not a big deal. </p>
<p>Having said that, if the fire is already self vented, game on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't have active fire suppression happening, then yes, suffocate. But once the hoses are charged and putting water on the fire you want to vent everything out for a number of reasons already listed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't home for it, because I was out for Christmas Eve but I lived on the 11th floor of an apartment building and one of the neighbors had a fire.    </p>
<p>Fortunately,  no one was hurt.  The design of the building (apartment doors shut automatically, concrete walls, etc) and the firefighting efforts kept the fire contained to that apartment, but people were complaining about the windows, water, etc.  I'm not sure exactly how they expected the firefighters to do their job without water and venting the fire.  A few of the adjacent apartments had smoke/water damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with an operation at a remote site that doesn’t have access to firefighting. E do have equipment and basic training on how to handle hoses and so forth, but don’t have trained firefighters to go in and fight the fire from the inside. As such, our current strategy is to break the windows and pour in as much water as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally if it’s contained to a single room, you’d want to just take out a single window and leave everything else be. The steam conversion will help put it out. </p>
<p>Beyond that, yeah, about the only option you have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually used to have our own fire brigade, with training to wear turnout and the scba and do searches, but the current leadership is too risk adverse for that. That was mostly when we had a retired firefighter on staff. </p>
<p>And yeah, the current plan is to keep things as confined as possible.</p></div>		</li>
