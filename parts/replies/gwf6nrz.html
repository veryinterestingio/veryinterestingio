			<div class="markdown"><p>And that only fixes it to make Matthew work... Luke still has Jesus being born in 6 AD. The census in Luke takes place 9 years after Herod’s death. </p>
<p>So there’s no way to square a system where Matthew and Luke’s story are both true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know if &quot;now called&quot; is appropriate, &quot;also called&quot; probably more neutral?  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree now called is not right. Tons of people (myself included) think needlessly changing the naming convention that’s been going for like 1000 years is stupid. You can see disagreements in Reddit threads when a title uses one or the other people always argue in the comments</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LOL sounds like a damn headache. I'm not sure I care either way. I don't want to see pitch forks and torches when I say &quot;AD&quot; on one day, and &quot;CE&quot; the next cuz I <em>truly</em> don't think about it lol, bigger problems occupy my very limited perceptions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My history degree writing requirements were always to use CE/BCE. It’s not a Chicago Style requirement (apparently I’ve been lied to!) so sounds like “now called” is in fact, incorrect.</p></div>		</li>
