			<div class="markdown"><p>Both, in a way. This is why this Gamestop thing is so infuriating to the folks who don't understand it. </p>
<p>The clearing house isn't in the business to underwrite the risk of any transaction. It is a trusted &quot;middle party&quot; and the &quot;record keeper&quot;. In normal circumstances, they only require the broker to put up a small percentage of the transaction amount (like a security deposit) to execute the ownership transfer. This makes things work very fast (an absolute requirement given the number of trades handled per second). </p>
<p>However, if something is very unusual, say the clearing house believes that there are too many trades with a lot of price volatility, they can require that the broker increase the &quot;security deposit&quot; from the broker representing buyers before they will register the transaction. </p>
<p>In the GameStop craziness. they did so with little notification and essentially said &quot;full payment upfront&quot;, this puts the broker in a difficult situation of finding a LOT of cash that they did not expect they needed. Stock trades have T+2 and I believe option trades settle in one day - so this makes a big difference to the broker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhh so is that why Robinhood had to raise a lot of money recently? Since they didn't have enough cash to cover all the transactions. Referring to the article below</p>
