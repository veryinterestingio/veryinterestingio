			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that DNA viruses <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2427051/" target="_blank">often have</a> a few uracyls in their DNA genome so denoting their U by a T might loose some information. It doesn't seem the converse phenomenon exists in RNA viruses. For SARSCoV2 the main information we are loosing are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26958916" target="_blank">the secondary structures</a> eg. the one causing the ribosomal frameshift, those between each ORF pairing with the 5UTR causing the subgenomic mRNA, and many more in the 5 and 3UTR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone who is curious why thymine is used instead of uracil, it is to make detection of incorrect base pairs easier. Cytosine regularly deaminates into uracil through a very simple <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/DesaminierungCtoU.png/275px-DesaminierungCtoU.png" target="_blank">reaction</a>. So if your body detects a uracil, that’s a pretty clear sign that something is wrong with your DNA. </p>
<p>Viruses don’t usually have regulatory mechanisms (as far as I’m aware), so they can’t detect any problems with their genomes. Using uracil can be more energy efficient, so it makes sense as to why you might observe this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because the &quot;deoxy&quot; refers to the ribose sugar, and the nucleotide is a separate entity. So that's why it would be DNA over DRA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Deoxyribose is one word. Nucleic Acid are the other two words. Therefore DNA. Even though Deoxyribonucleic is also one word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To explain, it is important to know that a strand of DNA or RNA are made up of &quot;bases&quot; that have three parts: the base (the A, T, C, G, or U), the sugar, and the phosphates that bind one sugar to the next. The base can be imagined to go at a 90 degree angle to the phosphate/sugar backbone.</p>
<p>P/S/P/S/P/S/P....</p>
<p>In DNA, that sugar is deoxyribose. In RNA, it is ribose. (Those are just names.) They're the same except that 1 carbon in the ribose ring is changed from having a hydroxyl to a hydrogen in deoxyribose (i.e., ribose without an oxygen). That changes the stability of the resulting molecule. </p>
<p>As far as the Nucleic and Acid parts, they were called &quot;nucleic&quot; because they were originally found by isolating cellular nuclei (the part where the genome is and where mRNA is made), and the acid is because this is chemically an acid.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That makes me wonder, which part is an acid? We often refer to A, T, C, G as the nitrogenous bases (I'm assuming the sugar-phosphate backbone is neutral?).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Back in the olden days there may not be strict guidelines on the nomanclature as we currently have since the international chemistry/biology union largely standardises the naming conventions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemically synthesized RNA is remarkably stable, you can leave it at
RT for many weeks without significant degradation. Of course, DNA is stable under such conditions for decades or centuries. But the experimentalist’s problems with RNA stability come exclusively from RNase contamination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I come from a biased view on this, synthesizing sgRNA of around 100nt. Depending on the length of the oligo and the method of purification, you can get RNA that is fairly stable at RT in nuclease-free water for a while. Certain modifications on the backbone and phosphate linkages can confer greater stability than unmodified RNA. HPLC purification with TFF desalting versus, for instance, a crude plate-based ethanol extraction purification method, and what kind of deprotection scheme you use, will give you RNA that may or may not have -amine salt contamination that can promote RNA chain cleavage. In a therapeutic context, how much degradation are you willing to allow?</p></div>		</li>
