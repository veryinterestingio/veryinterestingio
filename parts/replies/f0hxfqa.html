<p>Of course, speculators drive up the price on any hint of potential supply restrictions,</p>

<p>This.  I want to believe that allot of pricing for things; especially stocks and such, are done by robots/ai. Theese things are very perceptive to news reports saying how bad things are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are doing it by algorithms with very little human interaction, the average stock is held for less than a 25 seconds, currency is under like 35 seconds. They are amazing at exploiting small arbitrage opportunities that people are basically incapable of doing since it has to be recognized immediately and acted on. The chance can be very fleeting. Itâ€™s a giant farce really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quant algo's are still written by humans. Ultimately, price speculation is about psychology, which is why assets almost never trade at fair values for long periods of time. </p>
<p>Market making on the other hand, was greatly advanced by the internet, ai, and tech in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer:  more than 5% of worldwide capacity has been taken offline with the attack.  It's for that reason: supply and demand. Less of something, demand goes up, price goes up with a fungible commodity.</p>
<p>Ignore the Zerohedge libertarian conspiracy fever dream crap below. Advocating a return to the (inherently deflationary) gold standard of the 1800s ignores the history of panics and crashes in that era pretty evident in any economic history book. These same folks were predicting hyperinflation every year after the great recession and look where we are.</p>
<p>If you want a nice chuckle about what happens to the rubes that buy into this stuff look up Peter Schiff's fund returns\reviews or the &quot;Mish buys a basket of miners&quot; from mish shedlock's blog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That post is batshit insane. I wish I had it handy but there was a great expalation somewhere on why the gold standard needed to be abandoned. The same people scream about the national deficit too. It's crazy that the current administration campaigned on both of those.</p></div>		</li>
