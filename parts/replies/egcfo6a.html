			<div class="markdown"><p>Conservation of vorticity (how much a parcel of water rotates) is a super important concept in physical oceanography. The reason it is useful is because parcels of water rotate for two reasons: because they’re actually spinning around in a vortex (like an ocean version of a weather system) AND because they rotate along with the whole planet. The combination of the two has to remain constant (conserved) but the amount that goes into fluid velocity versus Planetary spinning can change. As a result, currents become more or less spinny as they go from a low latitude (earth rotates really quickly at the equator in absolute speed) to high latitudes (earth doesn’t rotate at all at the north and south poles. The cool patterns in the link I showed above are due to this conservation of vorticity concept!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, any chance you could explain how Ekman currents work in a way that makes sense.  I got assigned to teach an introductory class on ocean science because I know about the biology and chemistry in it, but I have no idea how to explain ekman short of it's &quot;magic&quot;.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you're feeling particularly merciful, I'd also like to understand the conveyor belt circulation of deep and surface currents a bit better, specifically the part that causes upwelling to feed those surface currents to replace the water that sinks in the artic/Antarctic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On Ekman: </p>
<p>Winds blow along the surface ocean, which begins to drive a surface current. This surface current is ~45 degrees to the right of the wind (in the Northern Hemisphere) due to friction and the rotation of the Earth. As this surface layer begins to trickle along, it starts pushing on the &quot;layer&quot; below it (these layers differ in their densities). Again due to friction and rotation, this layer flows a bit more to the right and a bit more slowly at that. As you keep going down into depth (100s of meters), you eventually reach a point where the water is flowing directly opposite of the surface and at a very diminished rate, again due to all this friction and rotation business.</p>
<p>If you were to sum the full column of rotating moving liquid, you would find that on average, water moves directly perpendicular to the wind (Ekman transport). This is applicable in coastal upwelling systems, such as California. During the summer, winds tend to flow toward the equator along the coastline, so this Ekman transport pumps water directly off the coastline. The water that replaces this is deep, cold, nutrient-enriched waters related to the &quot;conveyer belt&quot; circulation you mentioned. This Ekman transport mechanism is also very important to the equatorial oceans, which I'd be happy to dig deeper into if you're interested (as this involved wind stress curl). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add that Ekman transport isn't only important for coastal and equatorial upwelling, it's also the process that sets up the great ocean gyres by piling up water in the center of the gyres and setting up a pressure gradient!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not Op, but: in the northern hemisphere, when wind moves water, the water is deflected slightly to the right. This is due to the Coriolis effect. Now think of the Ekman spiral diagram. That top &quot;layer&quot; of water bring moved by the wind pulls on the layer below it, moving it along with it, but to a lesser degree (this the slightly shorter vector arrow). It is also deflected to the right. That second layer does the same thing to the third layer below it, and so on and so forth. Eventually, you reach a point where the direction of Ekman transport is opposite to the wind direction. If you add all the vectors of the spiral together, the net direction of movement is 90° to the right (in the northern hemisphere--it's to the left in the southern). This has implications for coastal upwelling and eddies, for example.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% on your second question, but here's how I understand it: water in the poles freezes, which increases salinity (because just The pure water freezes into ice). The increased salinity causes that water to sink because density is increased. Something has to move to replace the sinking water, so currents move warmer water in, which subsequently cools, freezes, and the conveyor belt perpetuates.</p>
<p>If the ice caps melted, this could cause the circulation to slow or cease, since the influx of fresh water would affect the salinity at the poles.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is not quite the right way to think about it. You need some source of mechanical energy to actually move the waters, and we've learned in the last couple decades that the conveyor belt is actually &quot;pulled&quot; by winds in the Southern Ocean and mixing in the deep ocean. The density changes that you're talking about also play a role in shaping the structure in magnitude of the circulation but they can't drive a circulation on their own (at least not in equilibrium).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP and not an expert, but I did TA a climate course so i can at least take a stab at an explanation.</p>
<p>Think about wind blowing across the ocean in the northern hemisphere. The wind pushes the surface water, but because Earth is a rotating sphere the Coriolis effect pushes that water a bit to the right of the wind direction (and left if you are in the southern hemisphere). That moving water pushes the water below it, which is also bent due to the Coriolis effect. The strength of the &quot;push&quot; gets weaker as you get deeper because of losses to friction, all of which adds up to a spiraling pattern of water direction as you move deeper. If you add up the forces across that whole spiral you end up with net transport 90 degrees to the right of the wind direction. Ie, magic!</p>
<p>ETA: Upwelling is also (partially) driven by wind. As big as the oceans are, you get a bit of piling up of water where wind blows across the water and onto shore, and a compensating drop on the other side. The pressure is lower where there is less water so deep water flows upward following that lower pressure. You can make this happen at a small scale by pouring some milk into a cup of coffee and then blowing on the surface. The milk will rise where you are blowing a low point into the liquid, because of that same sort of pressure difference. Oceans have some extra complications with salt and temperature and nutrients on top of that, but that's the main reason for upwelling as far as I understand it.</p></div>		</li>
