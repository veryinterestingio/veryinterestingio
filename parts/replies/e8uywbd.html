			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This a major reason cancer is so prevalent now. Evolution can't select against cancer genes, because by the time they affect you, you've probably already reproduced and passed those genes on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: didn’t think my comment would get noticed but I suppose my studies were more or less, smoking weed and making inferences based on what I heard in classes (high school curriculum). Nonetheless, I am much further interested in it than I used to be and will actual do some proper research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>That's a big one. People that lived before modern society, and even some people that live in not as advanced societies, have/had almost half as long lifespans. I think in the 1800s, people were theorized to normally have lifespans of around 40-50 years? And before that, the oldest you could get was 30. Things like cancer becoming so common the older you get, the appearance of older people (their white hair, wrinkled skin, and over-all slower movements), etc are all by-products of society's advancements of technology and healthcare.</del></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. That number comes from the average age, which was affected by the huge infant mortality rate. Once you lived to around 8, you life expectancy could be easily into your 60s, and it wasn't uncommon for someone to live to 70 or 80.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I just got done sleeping 12 hours and it felt horrible upon waking, for my heart. The maximum I have slept was 16 hours on a weekend, years ago. I do regular weight training to possibly combat the long sleeping and any other sedentary-ness in hopes to lower any cardiovascular problems, as well as eat healthy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really, try to not only do weight training. It does next to nothing for your cardio vascular system.
You need to raise your pulse significantly to help with that.
If you are at a gym and they have a woodway runnie thingie I highly recommend that one, it keeps at your pace  constantly. Also after 15 Minutes on that thing you’ll be done and have had a considerably higher pulse than you’ll ever reach weight training.</p>
<p>For reference, I’ve been doing cardio and weight training for quite some time (a few years at least) and my pulse rarely spikes over 130 while weight training but is constantly over 120 up to the 190 mark when doing intense calisthenics and running on said woodway thing keeps me at a nice 160 pace for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I did forget to mention there is cardio on the side, sometimes HIIT. Mainly at a caloric maintain atm as well. Cheers! - Edit: It also matters on how hard your lifting, or fast, and with what amount of intensity, regarding heart rate. I can get a good amount of cardio in some workouts by going light weight, quicker, and less resting, in a sort of cycle. That machine also sounds great, thank you for the recommendation! </p></div>		</li>
