<p>Amusing as that is, it makes no sense.  The human body has three holes (left nostril, right nostril, mouth) leading to the... um... &quot;hole in the ground&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it’s the hose analogy: Voltage is like the water pressure, current is the actual flow of water. You can have a little water at high pressure, or a lot of water at low pressure, the amount of water at the end can be the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically its the amount of work done by the water at the end which is the same (not something you normally care about with water). High pressure/low flow means less water comes out the end.</p></div>		</li>
