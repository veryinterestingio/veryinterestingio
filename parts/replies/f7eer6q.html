			<div class="markdown"><p>Could we make a vacuum balloon that floats at the top of the atmosphere? Obviously unlike a helium balloon it won't be an elastic material held open by gas pressure... it will be an inelastic structured held open AGAINST external pressure with an internal vacuum. Near the top of the atmosphere the external pressure will be minimal so you don't need that much structural rigidity or strength... just enough to hold it's form. Is there any material suitable for this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP was asking about orbiting debris, not floating debris. </p>
<p>Also there is no naturally occurring type of rock that is less dense than any naturally occurring gas to my knowledge, even if you had an atmosphere of sulfur hexafluoride, you couldn't float pumice on it until you were well above atmospheric pressure on earth, at which point the rocks would likely be below a cloud layer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe this is possible with any known examples of rock and gas and at the same time, it's not really very interesting when the frame for the question was Saturn's Rings (orbital systems). &quot;Couldn't you have X floating (held up by normal forces) on top of Y?&quot; is more of a geology question and the only answer is &quot;the layers will tend to organize densest to least dense&quot;. This is an extremely different kind of arrangement than a ring system and they wouldn't really even co-exist in any interesting way (the rock, fluids, and gases that were &quot;floating around on top of&quot; one another could never be anywhere near any kind of ring system, it would cease to exist rapidly and just become part of the body).</p></div>		</li>
