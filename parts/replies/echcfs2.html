			<div class="markdown"><p>Its interesting how we have this sense of ourselves. It is similar to &quot;phantom limb pain&quot; that amputees can get. The brain kept an awareness of the missing body part and doesn't always realize it's gone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg... and my arm... even my fingers. The body I've lost... the comrades I've lost... won't stop hurting... It's like they're all still there. You feel it, too, don't you? I'm gonna make them give back our past.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why the last time I fell out of bed was because my half of my pillow was hanging off the bed. I rolled over thinking there was more and banged my head on a chair as it hit the ground. </p>
<p>Never made that mistake again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I got my very small kitten it insisted on sleeping with me and under the blanket. I was so afraid to roll over and make kitty pancake but apparently there was zero issue and I'm a somewhat moving sleeper, I turn around 20 times an hour it feels like. But I also sleep like a stone but brain is still doing it's thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We did this with our first kid as an infant. Not a good idea, I think we were just desperate new parents trying to keep her from crying, she's nearly 10 and very much alive. Anyway, I was SO afraid of rolling on to her I would wake up with every single roll I made. I got used to it but it took me a long time to sleep right again after that. It felt like every time I went to move an alarm would go off in my brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I co-slept with all my kids. Never smashed any of them. In fact, when my sleepy body would say &quot;roll&quot;, my sleep brain would say &quot;no bruh, move the baby&quot;.</p>
<p>I love snuggling with littles.</p>
<p>Worst thing that ever happened was my daughter rolled off the bed at 3-4 months old, landed on the carpet and went back to sleep. When I woke up, I panicked because I couldn't find the baby.</p></div>		</li>
