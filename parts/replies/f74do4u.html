<p>If you could magically remove one out of 10^17 electrons on Earth the resulting tiny imbalance in electric charge would be sufficient to make Earth explode - against the gravitational attraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this conclusion does not stay the same as you increase the fraction of electrons you remove, because the potential energy from the electrostatic repulsion of the electrons itself gravitates, and gravity increases nonlinearly in strength as one reaches high enough energy densities. Long before you reach the point of removing all the electrons you end up with <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/140/" target="_blank">the Earth collapsing to a black hole</a>.</p>
<p>For a small lump of protons their gravity has no chance of winning over electromagnetism, but for a large enough lump it does win, even without without any opposite charges present.</p>
<p>This isn't very relevant in the real universe, as it's practically impossible to isolate and concentrate charges to this level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I noticed in that xkcd (relevant as always) is that Randall doesn't really address the proton earth. Would this have the same result as the electron moon? What happens when you combine the two ex-satellites of black hole-y-ness (like does the charge difference neutralise?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's addressed briefly in footnote 4 - the proton-earth would be absorbed into the electron-moon black hole, neutralizing some of the charge. However the amount neutralized would be insignificant, as the proton is about 2000 times more massive than an electron while carrying the same charge, thus the electron moon would have <em>significantly</em> greater charge than the proton earth, leading it to dominate their interactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating. Can you explain why gravity increases non-linearly in that scenario? Much appreciated!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but; Energy will also deform space, and result in gravitational attraction, not just mass. </p>
<p>Therefore, as you increase the number of protons, gravitational force increases due to two components; the mass of the protons, and the potential energy tied up in having two (or in this case, many) positive charges in close proximity. For a sufficiently large positive charge density, you're going to exceed the threshold limit and end up with a black hole.</p>
<p>A pretty useful discussion here is actually an <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/140/" target="_blank">XKCD what-if</a> article.</p>
<p>Although, at a cursory glance, I'd expect that increase to still be linear, since the coulomb force has the same general form as the gravitational force equation. That said, this is all already outside my area of expertise, so there may be another factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious about the calculations for the removing electrons bit--we create imbalances of trillions of electrons every day every time we use electricity, and although it definitely gives us energy we can harness, I don't understand how making the earth negatively charged by that little would cause it to explode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>we're not removing electrons from earth by using electricity.  electricity is simply  shifting around where the electrons are by messing with electric potentials, aka voltage.</p>
<p>also it's not 10^17 electrons, it's one out of <em>every</em> 10^17 electrons.  considering there are on the order of 10^50 atoms on earth, that would mean 10^33 electrons, which is a significantly larger number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>those numbers are so unfathomably large, it gives me shivers to think about; i love watching videos describing very large numbers like Graham's number and TREE-3, i really feel like my whole worldview is expanding, i get the same feeling from watching things that try to illustrate the vastness of space as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth has about as many neutrons as protons, and as many electrons as protons. Based on the mass of Earth it has about 1.8*10^(51) of each. We remove 1 in 10^(17), or 1.8*10^(34), giving it a total net charge of Q=2.9*10^15 C. What happens to a clump of 10^17 protons, neutrons, and electrons on the surface where one electron is removed? Its gravitational force is still mg = 3.3 nN downwards, but now it feels an electrostatic force of qQ/(4 pi eps_0 r^2) = 102 nN upwards, a factor 30 larger. It will rapidly shoot upwards - just like all other matter with the same imbalance. Earth explodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I initially misread it as &quot;removing one of the 10^17 electrons&quot;, and I was thinking there's no way that removing a single electron from the planet could cause it to explode.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I want to say he meant that if you dislocated that many electrons that means you'd have repelling electronic forces and that would cause the explosion.</p></div>		</li>
