			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I've heard strength coaches say that testing grip is the best way to test for systemic/CNS fatigue. If it drops severely, it's time to train lighter. </p>
<p>Also, they say strength peaks some time in the afternoon for most people because your nervous system is most awake. This is despite the fact that testosterone actually tends to peak in the morning. Obviously this will all change if you tend to wake up later in the day or have other peculiarities.</p></div>		</li>
