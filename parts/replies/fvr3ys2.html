			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't CAR-T a little different than the scenario proposed by OP, since it involves infusion of engineered T-cells into a patient, as opposed to infecting a patient directly with a curative virus? </p>
<p>So cool that you're working in gene therapy, such a fascinating field!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to scroll too far for this. CAR-T is amazing! Iâ€™m a clinical research nurse working mainly with Juno but we did just get a phase 3 Kymriah trial (second line SOC auto vs CAR-T) which is super cool. I believe it is truly the future of cancer therapy.</p></div>		</li>
