			<div class="markdown"><p>Chinese people buying luxury brands in America is very common for pretty much those reasons. Sometimes counterfeit goods will even make their way into retail stores in China when people manage to pass off really good fakes as legit for returns, or shitty employees try to swap something for a fake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a story I read before when an Apple store was put up in China. Workers there thought that they were really working in an Apple store. The products they were selling really looked like legit ones, too. It turns out that everything, including the store itself, is a fake.</p></div>		</li>

Likely happens with literally anything else of value that can be forged</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a big difference between these cars and the other fakes being discussed in this thread. Those cars aren't intended to be exact replicas of the real thing and they aren't intended to fool the buyer into thinking they're getting a legit name brand car. They just have designs that are heavily inspired by known cars.</p></div>		</li>
