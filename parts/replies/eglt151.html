			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I’ve watched many families get torn apart due to disabled children. It can be very expensive.  A family friend had a baby with a smooth brain and it was about 750,000 dollars a year for his care and that’s in Canada. He passed away when he was 6 and it was really hard on them. But he never moved past the mental abilities of a 6 month old baby. He couldn’t eat or move, and grew very very fast. He was the size of a 10 year old when he passed away.</p>
<p>If I found out I was going to have a severely disabled child, I’d abort. Not because I wouldn’t love it, but because I have no support system outside of my partner. My family would be a disaster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. My youngest sister has DS. She's fairly high functioning on the typical scale for those with DS and is currently living in her own with roommates and occasional support staff. She works, is literate and is 100% her own person. But she is still a LOT of work for my parents who were thankfully quite young when they had her. Her mental health isn't great (people who make platitudes about &quot;happy DS kids&quot; make me want to kick something because she is a grumpy butthead at least 60% of the time) and her current level of independence requires quite a lot of support and management from other people. She has been my mom's full time job since her birth and she'll never get to retire. When my parents get too old to manage her care, it'll be on me. I'll be the one responsible for her finances, living situation, etc. People who get on their high horses about abortion are often the same ones who happily cut other public services and supports. And they are really blissfully ignorant about the army of support staff and programs and management required to make people's lives fulfilling and the high level of education and finances it takes to navigate the labyrinth of services and funding. That's what you're signing up for and you should at least be able to go into it with open eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would abort if it was my decision. Because even the high functioning person's w/ downs suffer from terrible depression. Some say it's because they realiae they are different and will never have the life of a non downs person. There was a good documentary a few years ago and the parents made the decision to have the baby and later said they were in no way prepared for how bad and frustrating it would be. They didn't come out and say It but they obviously regretted that decision. </p></div>		</li>
