Yes, there is a lobby for pizza. (IIRC they wanted to increase the amount of tomato sauce on a given slice of pizza to a cup(!) rather than 2 tablespoons so that it would be considered a vegetable). Yes, I know it's a fruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally, a packaging engineer I can talk to! Listen, bub. We need to have a serious discussion about cereal packaging. I've always wanted to hand someone in the industry a box of cereal and ask them to open it without having it explode in the kitchen and leaving debris in a 6 mile radius. I mean come on dude, ZIPLOC THAT SHIT PLEASE!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My company doesn't make cereal but it is possible to do something similar to what you want. The problem? Money.</p>
<p>Cereal bags in a box is a low cost technology that's been around for a long time. Both the materials (variable cost) and the machines that make them. When cereal was big 1950s-1980s, big cereal companies bought a lot of machines that they still use, or if they've bought newer machines they made them backwards compatible. It would take a large investment to upgrade all of the machines so that every plant making flakes can make the same bag throughout the country.</p>
<p>On top of that, cereal is a declining business. Be it Atkins, growing awareness of simple carbs or avacado and toast (my favorite), people eat less cereal. So as a company, the leaders are looking at a shrinking market and going &quot;Why should we spend more money on equipment and plastic bags so a some people would be less frustrated? They will continue to buy our cereal and we can just milk this baby and work on the next granola bar.&quot; There is no incentive for companies to invest in the change because fewer people are wanting cereal and it's not because of the lack of a zipper.</p>
<p>Edit: To be clear, the machines I reference take rolls of film and make them into bags, filling them and sealing them at the same time. The machines do not make the plastic or the rolls of plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer! Making popcorn earlier gave me the idea to post this and the bags I made didn’t have the metallic side to them so I was curious if the turnout would be different. I have always wanted to try it but it just made me feel weird because of the giant letters that say “THIS SIDE UP” and “THIS SIDE DOWN”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a point of reference, at least 30 years ago (and probably closer to 40) my dad used to take popcorn kernels (that you get in jars) and pour them into a small brown paper bag (I don't remember if he put any oil or anything in there, I don't recall that but maybe I didn't see him do that), fold the top down and pop them in the microwave.</p></div>		</li>

Her equally bat shit crazy sister in law has convinced her that microwave popcorn bags will somehow give you cancer because they are full of &quot;toxins&quot;.  I fear that one day my wife will be equally as crazy as them, hopefully i'll be dead by then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a point of reference I used to put Wesson oil in a big pot, pour kernels from the jar into the pot, turn it on high and keep shaking the pot until they stopped popping. Once I didn’t think I had enough oil so I went to the neighbors to borrow a cup of oil, and didn’t realize I’d already turned the stove on. When I got back the oil was on fire, and the cupboard door was opened above the pot. I calmly took the lid off using a cooking glove, and poured two containers of Morton’s salt on it because somewhere I learned you don’t put water on oil fires. The paint on the cupboard door had melty burn marks on it for years. I still can’t believe I handled it so matter of factly and I was home alone at 9 years old (or less). </p>
<p>The only thing my mother said was: now we need more salt. </p>
<p>So much of that story wouldn’t happen in 2019. Do people even borrow a cup of any cooking ingredient from the neighbors anymore? Do young kids pick up on fire details simply by living anymore? </p>
<p>My kids did because we played with fire in various ways for science fun. The neighbors really did NOT like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understood it from a science show that addressed this many years ago: They aren't metallic in the way that those hot pocket sleeves had a grey metallic looking sheet on the inside, but rather the paper has fine metallic strands woven into it. (I'm going to have to make some so I can tear into the bag looking for invisible metal strands, while trying to not look insane.)</p>
<p>Maybe our new resident popcorn expert u/sedknieper can explain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not strands but very small aluminum particles. Look up aluminum metallization for flexible packaging. It is a common method used in potato chip bags that make them look silver on the inside. Popcorn susceptors are similar but less aluminum is deposited. You can't see the particles, very small. The particles are deposited into a plastic film that is glued to the paper</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, TIL. I always thought the butter was on one side and by popping with that side up, it would melt into the popcorn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The butter is on the metallic side, and you actually want it on the bottom. The oil heats up and acts as one medium for heat transfer. Once the kernel pops, it will rest on top of the unpopped kernels, as it is so much less dense.</p>
<p>The action of popping combined with simmering in the oil helps to ensure relatively consistent coverage of the popcorn with the oil/butter.</p></div>		</li>
