			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. But it says that by clicking a link or hitting accept, then you are agreeing to being tracked. Are you tracked even if you don't hit the accept button, if you already clicked a link just to get to their site?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nobody is answering your question. </p>
<p>When I set up GDPR consent on client websites, I do it so that <em>no cookies are set until the user consents</em>. If they do not consent, no cookies are set. But indeed, many websites do not take this approach.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Personally, if the warning is ignorable I just ignore it.  If it's one of those modals that coves the entire page I hit my &quot;Back&quot; button while muttering &quot;Good by-ee!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EU privacy/data protection laws are a bit complicated.</p>
<p>The websites are allowed to do some tracking of you without your permission (although you have <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/" target="_blank">several rights over it</a>) - but only the tracking that is essential to make the website work for you.</p>
<p>Under the old version of the law, websites just needed to tell you they were doing lots of tracking of you. The idea behind the law was that websites would be shamed into only doing the &quot;essential&quot; tracking (which they didn't need to tell you about), as the big &quot;we're tracking you&quot; warnings would put people off. That didn't work - many big websites just pretended they needed the &quot;silly cookie notification&quot; for any cookie, not just the unnecessary tracking one.</p>
<p>Under the latest version of the law the websites need you to &quot;accept&quot; actively the unnecessary tracking, and also need a &quot;reject&quot; button. The websites aren't allowed to make consent to tracking you a condition of using their service. I.e. they can't say &quot;if you want to visit our website you have to accept us tracking you.&quot;</p>
<p>Many websites ignore this. But EU law is based on proportionality; just because something is illegal doesn't mean it will be enforced - the data protection authorities will be starting with the biggest names and working their way down. Hoping to encourage people to follow the law, rather than punish them for not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm curious if <code>history.go(-1);</code> would be a legally satisfiable implementation of the reject button.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact:</p>
<p>I once had a client that demanded we'll use one of these on their website. The problem was that their website didn't use cookies, so it was completely unnecessary. But they insisted.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, you need to use cookies in order to track if people have accepted cookies. So that was the only use of cookies on the site.</p>
<p>This is a global chain that I can pretty much can guarantee you know of.</p></div>		</li>
