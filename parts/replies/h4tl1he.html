			<div class="markdown"><p>This was very informative. Thank you!<br />
Two things are left for me to understand though:<br />
a) mustn't there be some part that's above water..? will they exchange parts of the beams then?<br />
b) wood gains cracks due to expanding and shrinking when soaked in water / drying -&gt; wouldn't that break the beams over time, too? How does that not matter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They crack from drying, when they are constantly in water they never dry out. Even the part above the water line would stay wet because the lower part seeps in water and it spreads inside the wood, itâ€™s the same as roots absorbing water and raising it to the branches and leaves when the tree was alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also see where things sometimes go wrong. In Amsterdam the recent trend is to dig a basement under your 100 years old house. As you're digging, the poles might get too exposed to air, dry out and start rotting. Hence they keep the water there as much as possible. </p>
<p>A friend of mine had that particular case a few houses down his street. The builders were muppets</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A: If there are parts above the water line that are exposed to air then it will start rotting, but air can't get to it if it's fully encased. Foundation repair can take many different and specialized forms, I don't know enough to say something useful. </p>
<p>B: Idk the material properties well enough.</p>
<p>The maintained water level is a contentious issue in the Netherlands and vital for a lot of our infrastructure and agriculture. Nature, farmers and homeowners often have different priorities as to what levers in the Dutch water management system need pulling. </p>
<p>Some more trivia: We have separate elections to elect 'Waterboards' that govern some aspects of the system. These waterboards are some of the earliest recorded 'democratic' institutions in the Netherlands. You need only look at the history of floods in the Netherlands to understand why these organisations were necessary even before we considered ourselves a 'people'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The oxygen content of the water is too low to oxidize (or rot) the wood. As long as the wood remains in the water and away from oxygen, it won't rot very quickly. On the other hand, keeping wood dry will preserve it as well. However, the constant wetting process above ground is enough to breed fungi which help in decomposing the wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that in their attempts to get extra land from the sea, people have pumped out way too much water in Amsterdam and other cities in the Netherlands. This causes the rods to rot and the buildings to tilt.
But yes. Generally, wood doesn't decompose under water (hence why so many sunken ships have been conserved for centuries). It needs air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former hardhat diver, here.</p>
<p>Worked pile replacement at Lake Union Drydock (b. 1919). As a point of fact, in cold, fresh water, and silt, the piles only rot out in the splash zone. Basically, the area of the pile that is the air/water line, as it moves throughout the life of the pile.</p>
<p>The yard crew would bring in 25 or so foot I-beams, and span the gap across the pile(s) to be worked on, and use 3-ton chainfalls to pick the dock over the pile(s).</p>
<p>I then went down with a fucking gutless hydraulic chainsaw and tried to make a straight cut at about four feet underwater.</p>
<p>Remove the stub pile, replace stub with new, lagbolt a steel jacket to it, and off you go.</p>
<p>We were replacing the original piles in ongoing sections, in 2006.</p>
<p>They were still at it in 2018, when I was back there on a boat.</p>
<p>The job could be done with bronze age tech, and a properly motivated crew, slowly, but it could be done.</p></div>		</li>
