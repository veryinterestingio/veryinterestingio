			<div class="markdown"><p>A big thing that needs to be considered is that manufacturers engineer out as much cost and energy needed to produce any given product. This can directly translate to the physical properties your product has, such as surface tension or thermal expansion. </p>
<p>Therefore, if you're making ceramic plates, you will probably use any material that has a decent enough tensile strength to prevent breaks or chips, but that's probably it. Most ceramics have good thermal properties and I doubt anyone would really care about surface contact issues for a plate. </p>
<p>For bath tiles, this is probably a major concern for consumers, and therefore manufacturers. So the type of casting or post-cast surface treatments can be wildly different for a plate made of the same exact compound as the bath tile considered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree about the term “porcelain” and its liberal usage. True usage of the term would signify a higher firing point than most other clays - your dinnerware was most likely glaze fired to vitrification (full hardness) at about 2350 degrees F. If the tiles are a true porcelain, they would be fired to the same temp. However, even if that is the case, that does not mean that the glaze was fired to that temp. </p>
<p>Commonly, tile glazes are fired to lower temps because there is a wider availability of predictable colors at lower ranges. The consequence is that the glazes tend to be “softer” than their higher fire counterparts. I don’t know if that consistency might be what causes the difference.</p></div>		</li>
