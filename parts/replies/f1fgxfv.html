			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to say &quot;harmonics&quot; but  you beat me to it. To add to it, the harmonics of plucking a string will be vastly different than hammering it or drawing a bow against it. Hence a different sound. Very basically, the string will vibrate much differently depending on how it is played. Also, the attenuation will be different. I can hit a note on a piano, or hit it repeatedly, but for each there is an intense thump and then the string vibrates and attenuates to still - or stop making any sound. If I draw a bow then the introduction is less jarring and the note is played for a longer duration and the act of drawing the bow in a different direction has a different attenuation and restart then a piano or a pluck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer OP. There is no such thing as hearing only one note. No human has ever heard a pure note. Any note has a fundamental which is the predominant pitch but you're also hearing many other notes. If you were to play a simple instrument in a cave or cathedral you could actually pick out the fifth of the fundamental clearly when it bounces back to you. There are many other tones as well which we barely hear but the brain does process them. Different instruments emphasize different overtones and that is why notes have timbre. It's really quite wonderful. Synthesizers manipulate this to make a &quot;piano&quot; sound and a &quot;harmonica&quot; sound and a &quot;marimba&quot; sound by changing the overtones electronically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not if it came as a wave through the air. If it were somehow drilled into your bone maybe? Or straight into your nervous system somehow with electrodes in some laboratory experiment. It is interesting conceptually but I can't imagine a note with no timbre is interesting or desirable to hear.</p></div>		</li>
