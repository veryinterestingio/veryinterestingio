			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember that my optician didn't notice/suspect anything until I came in to get my sight re-evaluated for the third time in two years (used to get headaches due to my eye-muscles having to compensate for focus). He then thought something was up and sent me to a private practician eye specialist (free healthcare, yay) across the street who more or less could &quot;see a bulge&quot; on my cornea which could be keratoconus. However, she couldn't diagnose me without some specific test-machine which they only have at the hospital where I live. My point is that it took several years (and several people) before it actually was confirmed for me, which goes to show that it is not necessarily easily spotted by opticians and that advanced equipment which your local doctor might not have is required to diagnose it properly. </p>
<p>It is probably worthwhile to have it checked by actual medical specialists if you have only been at  a commercial optician, or at least mention the possibility if your vision is changing rapidly at a young age.</p></div>		</li>
