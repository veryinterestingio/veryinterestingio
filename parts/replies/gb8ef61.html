			<div class="markdown"><p>You can be charged with attempted murder by stabbing a corpse you thought was alive. We learned this in bioethics. The story goes a son couldn’t take his mother being abused by their father or stepfather any longer, so one night he decides he’s gonna finally do it. He goes in the room, puts a pillow over his head, and stabs him in the heart killing him instantly. The son comes out of the room to find his mother drinking coffee in the kitchen and he confesses what he’s done. Mom says, “Honey, I poisoned your fathers evening scotch. He’s been dead in our bed for hours.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Toronto, 2013, there was a case where a cop shot someone, killed them, and was found guilty of attempted murder.</p>
<p>The reason is that the person who got shot was armed and dangerous, and the cop was justified in his initial three shots.  After the person was already bleeding on the ground, the cop shot him another six times.  Autopsy determined one of the first three shots killed him almost instantly, so the other six were completely unwarranted and constituted attempted murder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting; I’m in the UK and my brother in law used to be part of our polices armed response unit (sort of like SWAT but the impression I get is that they’re a lot better trained) and he says that if they’re ever in a position where they have to pull the trigger at all, their intention has to be to shoot to kill, attempting to disable someone by shooting them non-fatally just doesn’t factor in to their rules of engagement. </p>
<p>Apparently the reasoning is they’re literally only going out when the police have a really reasonable suspicion the suspects are armed or it’s a hostage/counterterrorism situation, in those situations a guy with a gun becomes much more dangerous if he’s just wounded, allegedly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charged? Plausible. Convicted? Improbable.</p>
<p>IANAL but mens rea (guilty mind/criminal intent) is one factor of a crime. Actus reus (guilty act/criminal harm) is the other half. Stabbing corpse with the (inaccurate) knowledge that you are stabbing a living body does not have the same result from the criminal act itself. Desecration of a corpse is the more likely conviction but it would be a fascinating case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the arteries in the neck are under a LOT of pressure.  They have to be--the critical organ that uses 10% of the body's metabolism for basic function is a full foot over the pumping organ.  (that's also part of why head wounds bleed a lot.)  The usual way to cut a throat fatally is a slash across the arteries.. which then spray blood in a wave until pressure equalizes a bit.  If your throat was cut from behind, the attacker probably pulled your head up some to make a cleaner target area.. and your blood sprays up.  So if there's a bloodspray on the ceiling, it strongly indicates that there was blood pressure are a fairly high level when the throat was cut, likely from behind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, blood splatter can get everywhere. It can be from arterial spurts (body's own blood pressure, not as likely for a ceiling shot) or from the movement of the killer (swinging the weapon around that has blood on it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit of an exaggeration.  If the artery is completely cut, blood will go about as high as the top of the head, but a smaller cut can send it much farther.  Also, the knife will carry some with it, so a swinging stroke can throw a pattern across the wall.  There are people who study those patterns, and they can tell quite a lot from them.</p></div>		</li>
