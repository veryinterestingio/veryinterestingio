			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works trauma in the field, there have been two times total Iâ€™ve seen a significant volume exit via the mouth or nose - one was a suicide by .38 to the head and the other was an aortic dissection. Both of these scenes had a medic directing us to work a patient, so most of the blood starts rolling out during CPR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, seen that too.
As a student nurse saw a Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  blow, not only did his abdomen swell ridiculously fast, blood was pouring out of his mouth and nose, faster than the suction could work. The guy was awake whilst drowning on his own blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, that would be one way you could see it. Was it a shot through the mouth? The carotid runs pretty close to the inside of the pharynx, so if they aimed a little to the side, they could definitely be coughing up lots of blood</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>spitting up blood I think is a Hong Kong cinema trope. </p>
<p>A cheap and easy way to show damage caused by a supernaturally strong kung fu kick to the stomach is to have the actor keep a blood capsule in his cheek and dribble some out.</p>
<p>Like in Star Trek, instead of modeling expensive hull damage they shoot sparks out of the control panels</p></div>		</li>
