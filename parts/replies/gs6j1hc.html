<p>Short version, and not so ELI5 anymore: The motor proteins (myosin molecules - the people in the boats) need energy (in the form of ATP) to do the whole cycle of &quot;bind to actin, pull, release from actin, reset so they can bind again&quot;, and exercise depletes the local stores of ATP within the muscle. (Oh yeah, actin would be the &quot;ropes&quot; in this analogy, BTW) And stores of other molecules that can be rapidly used to make more ATP, like glycogen, also get depleted, plus you might also not be getting enough oxygen to make as much ATP as necessary. </p>
<p>This whole process is also controlled by changes in calcium levels - calcium is released from special reservoirs in response to nerve signals to make the cell contract. When this happens over and over, you get accumulation of metabolic wastes (IIRC no one really thinks lactic acid is the big culprit, though), and the levels of various molecules needed to control the process don't have time to return to normal. This interferes with calcium release.</p>
<p>It's theoretically possible for the nerves sending the signals to fire so much they'll lose the ability to trigger full-strength contraction and need time to recover, but AFAIK that's very rarely the limiting factor. The metabolic stuff and regulation of calcium release are a much bigger deal. </p>
<p>And while the whole structural arrangement of actin, myosin and a bunch of other proteins that hold them in an organized way <em>can</em> get damaged by very strenuous exercise, it's not really the cause of the trembling. (Again, AFAIK. We're getting pretty far from my area of expertise.)</p></div>		</li>
