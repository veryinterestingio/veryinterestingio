			<div class="markdown"><p>How does chronic pain relate to those stresses? While I find general stresses obviously easier to control, my chronic pain is what I have noticed shows in my facial features and aging the most. I'm not sure which comes first though.....the effects of the pain or the depression it causes in lack of having any quality of life. I guess my question is, would antidepressants help in this kind of a situation? Because I've noticed some major memory loss over the last year or so (47F)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are infinite stresses in life which chronic pain can stem from. Narrowing down your particular stresses would be a great start. Every form of “chronic pain” has underlying factors. Underlying factors can range from things you do in your day to day life, your work, your hobbies, your diet, your environment, and genetics. Depression is a tricky beast to deal with and everybody has a different experience because your chemical response is typically extremely unique. Antidepressant certainly may help you manage depression but personally I did not want to become dependent on medication to control my emotions. I honestly found a series of YouTube videos that helped change my life tremendously about eight to ten years ago, I will try to find the link and post it here. Just remember that the most remarkable and advanced piece of technology that exists in the entire universe is simply the human being itself. Our minds are powerful beyond belief</p></div>		</li>
