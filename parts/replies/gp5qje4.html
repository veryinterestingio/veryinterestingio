<p>There are a LOT more forces involved in car tires due to the amount of energy, you just don't have that in a bicycle. </p>
<p>Centrifugal force and aerodynamics are going to reduce the contact patch of the tire more and more the faster you go. </p>

<p>Seriously, nothing has gotten me more into physics than cars .... </p>
<p>cars ... not even once. </p>
<p>I don't know why I need to calculate the amount of stretch a tire will do at a specific speed and temperature but just the fact that I know I could makes me jiggly. I don't, but I could LOL</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me the engineering is best part of racing.  All the ingenuity that goes into getting an F1 (or any car) ready for the track is insane. Not to mention the engineering behind safety is top level. Just look at romain grosjean’s crash last year. He walked away after his car ripped open into a fire ball after hitting a wall at 140mph.</p></div>		</li>

Even if the rider is incapable of breaking traction under acceleration,  I think most of us were more than capable of skidding a bike under braking, even as children. Brakes win races in motorsport.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true, it's an entirely common misconception. It's an equal and opposite force to centripetal force, and a 10 second Google search shows this.</p>
<p>Its &quot;fictitious&quot; description just means it can only be seen in a non-intertial frame of reference. Centripetal force <em>doesn't</em> show up where centrifugal force does, but the wording in physics does not literally mean that the force isn't literally real. It just is that inertial frames of reference are considered the &quot;default&quot; frame of reference, and is just as arbitrary as deciding what charge should be positive or what direction is &quot;positive y,&quot; for example. </p>
<p>This is furthered by the fact that many people would agree gravity is a force, despite the fact that it is labeled a fictitious force. If you agree that inertial forces don't exist, and want to be pedantically correct in the most pointless and arguable of ways, then you have to stop saying gravity is a force and find a new way to describe those interactions that is both less understandable and useful than just accepting both exist and are valid in their descriptions. </p>
<p>TL;DR it's as real a force as centripetal force, you just need the frame of reference for it and a desire to not be uselessly pedantic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thought around it iirc is that the bumps from the road going through your body soak up X amount of watts, by having a bit more cushion in the tyres you might spend Y more watts but it’s still smaller than the amount of watts that was previously spent vibrating your frame and body as you rolled over the road. </p>
<p>That’s why as well as tyres getting thicker, pressure has also dropped. I used to run 120psi on good advice now I go as low as 80</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! The biggest source of resistance in flat road cycling is not gravity or friction but drag, so becoming more aerodynamic is about reducing frontal CdA. Time trialists seek to improve their watts/CdA (see their incredibly aggressive aero position, teardrop helmets, etc.) while hill climbers seek to improve their watts/kg (as gravity becomes the overwhelming force on a hill).</p>
<p>That said, thinner tires are important to a point. It used to be in vogue to ride on tires skinnier than 21mm, but the standard has increased from 23 to 25 and in some cases even 28 as this actually allows the tire to sit more flush with the profile of the wheel/wheel well, reducing CdA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different kinds of friction. Yes, the bike tire needs friction against the road to move, however you don't want a high amount of rolling friction (which larger tires have), as well as other downsides like increased weight/drag</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Friction was the wrong word for him to use in that context. He should have used 'rolling resistance'.
Basically it's the amount of forward energy that the tire absorbs as it's deformed at the contact patch. For bicycles the amount of power the rider can put down will practically never exceed the friction between the road and the tire. In that case skinny tires are advantageous because it reduces the size of the contact patch. Skinnier tires are usually inflated to a higher pressure. Further reducing the size of the contact patch and reducing rolling resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you're correct but there is a breakpoint at which skinnier/more inflated tires actually contribute to more rolling resistance.</p>
<p>The contact patches on a 23c tire, for example, will elongate on the axis that the tire rolls and create a larger contact patch than a 25c tire under the same load. The 25c tire will have a wider contact patch but smaller in area.</p>
<p>Also on rollers or perfectly smooth surface, increasing the tire pressure will correspond with lower rolling resistance but as soon as you add any sort of roughness to the surface there is a point at which increasing the tire pressure will increase rolling resistance. The rate at which the rolling resistance increases after this point in relation to pressure is much steeper than the rate that it decreases before this point. So being conservative on the low side will likely result in a lower rolling resistance. The reason for this is the tire stops being the dominant spring in the tire/ bike/ rider system and more vibration is absorbed by the ride which is less efficient.</p></div>		</li>
