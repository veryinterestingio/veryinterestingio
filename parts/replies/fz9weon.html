<p>So in terms of time, children have to learn language from the ground up. Maybe it takes them twelve years. But for adults, who have already mastered many aspects of language, learning a second language takes less time. Yet at the same time, a child will become bilingual faster if they’re taught both languages simultaneously, compared to an adult learning their native language then a second language “after” (in their adulthood).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing that seems to be missing from all of your points is the definition of children. You seem to be talking about children in very early stages of life.</p>
<p>When I hear the point of &quot;children learning languages easier&quot;, it's used as an argument for why kids between 14 and 19 years old should take second language courses in school, because it would be harder for them to learn those languages later(these are things that I've heard from teachers and administrators at school board meetings, and are used as justifications for curriculum requirements). And that age group(from my interpretation) seems to be outside the range of 'children' in the articles you posted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats interesting. Here in Europe at age 15, we were already learning 2nd foreign language (not that I can speak French lol).  But learning 2nd language should probably start way sooner than that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kids should start learning a second language earlier than 14, and I think most schools in Europe start teaching a second language in elementary school. However, that doesn't mean that you can't learn a language when you're older.</p>
<p>Children will acquire a second language at a native or almost-native level before the age of 7-8 years old. Then there's a second stage until early adulthood (around 21 years old) where kids can still acquire a second language with less effort than an adult, achieving fluency and a good pronunciation, even though native speakers would probably perceive it as &quot;foreign&quot;. After that age it's very difficult to master the phonology of a non-native language.</p>
<p>Note that babies have the ability to discriminate the sounds of every language, but they lose that ability at 10-12 months old, after being exposed to the native language, as they &quot;specialise&quot; in that language. I think it's one of the reasons they should be exposed to a second language as soon as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My kids are growing up with 4+ languages, one of which they don't hear from us. One of the reasons we started kindergarten at age 2 was so they can start with the local language at a young age when the native speakers are not that advanced. They obviously heard it spoken now and then, but the other kids pretty much had a two year head start. It just takes a few weeks in kindergarten to catch up to them.</p></div>		</li>
