			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't need to be dried, but they do need to be ripe. Depending on the species you have, this is generally indicated by a change in color, from green to yellow. Harvesting can also be difficult; most species &quot;let go&quot; of their seeds as soon as they are ripe, meaning that any mechanical agitation may cause the seeds to immediately fall off the stalk and be lost in the ground. Much easier to just buy a bag of seed, or even a patch of sod.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They need to be ripe, as /u/IHaveHorses said. But at different levels of moisture in the seed, you may find issues with dormancy. Many grass seeds need a cold spell before they'll germinate fully if they're freshly harvested. This dormancy disappears over time for many species, but not all.</p></div>		</li>
