			<div class="markdown"><p>The bering land bridge theory has seen consistent controversy in recent years, as the “land bridge” would have been nearly at sea level and extremely swampy which would have caused many herd animals to be hesitant to cross thus eliminating the human crossings as early humans almost always followed herds of animals for food, and it is now just as commonly accepted that humans island hopped across the pacific. </p>

<p>This is an old article (genetically speaking) and we currently think America was populated once. South Americans are descended from people who traveled all the way from Beringia, not from e.g. Polynesians.</p>
<p>They probably did come down the coast though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also- they kind of did, didn't they, through interbreeding with other homo sapians/denisovians, right? <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-04-ancient-dna-reveals-denisovan-family.html" target="_blank">DNA found in native americans</a> links them all and it's becoming more clear that none of the early homo species really  &quot;disappeared&quot;, they all kind of interbred into what we have today.</p></div>		</li>
