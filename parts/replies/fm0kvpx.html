			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand your question, it is about the relative timing of SARS-Cov-2 infection and the emergence of smell loss (vs. what is seen with other viruses). </p>
<p>We do not know the exact mechanisms with any virus, though they certainly can differ from each other. There is a recent preprint (a reanalysis of published gene-expression studies: <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.009084v2" target="_blank">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.009084v2</a>) suggesting that olfactory sensory neurons do not express the two genes most implicated as receptors for SARS-CoV viruses, but that one of these (ACE2) is expressed in supporting and glandular cells in the epithelium. If SARS-CoV-2 is 1st efficiently infecting ACE2+ cells  in the olfactory epithelium, one potential mechanism is to initiate local inflammatory responses.</p></div>		</li>
