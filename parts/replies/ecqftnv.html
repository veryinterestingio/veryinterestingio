<p>Using a 1 dimension vs 2 dimensions analogy, if you pour a bucket of water out on flat ground, the water goes in each direction a little ways, then settles fairly quickly.</p>
<p>If you pour the same bucket of water into a ditch, the water only goes two directions, but goes much further in each of those directions.</p>
<p>In string <del>theory</del> untestable hypothesis, particles can only go through the 3 normal spatial dimensions... the nuclear forces get diluted by going through a couple more dimensions; electromagnetism goes through more; and gravity goes through the most (up to 11 total spatial dimensions in the brane hypothesis).</p>
<p><em>Edit to add</em>: And to clarify, they aren't external dimensions like sci-fi likes to play around in.. It's not a parallel but separate world that we're talking about here, where Mr. Spock is sporting a goatee and Captain Kirk is demanding tribute for the empire from backwater planets... It's other directions in our own universe that we can't travel through.</p>
<p>Like a person on a tightrope... We can travel forwards and backwards... But an ant on that same rope can go around it, as well.  &quot;Around&quot; isn't a direction that we can understand, much like creatures in a 2 dimensional universe can't understand up and down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh.....that kinda makes sense, actually.  Like if you have a square with a side length of 10 meters, it encloses 100 m^(2), but if it's a cube, it encompasses 1000 m^3; the more dimensions, the more &quot;stuff&quot; encompassed.  Flipping it around, like the water, if you have a given amount of &quot;stuff&quot; (force?), you can make a big square, or a smaller cube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so on the one hand the extra dimensions are big enough to dilute the force carriers, and on the other hand they're curled up so tight that they don't matter for all other practical purposes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how the math works out, yes.  And there are thousands of people who are intimately familiar with the domain who have spent years perfecting their equations while critiquing the equations of others in peer reviewed forums, so I'd tend to trust that their math works out.</p>
<p>As for whether it's reality or not... Well, to say that, their hypothesis will have to make predictions that can be tested.</p>
<p>The various hypotheses (hypothesi? hypothesises?) that get lumped together and are each called string theory are, at the very least, internally consistent and compelling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming the theory is correct, the extra dimensions are collapsed into a Calabiâ€“Yau manifold at each 3 dimensional 'point'.   What the dimensions 'do' (aside from allowing the math to work) is up for discussion.  One theory why gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces is that gravity &quot;leaks&quot; into all the extra dimensions.  (Dear everyone smarter than me - I know that isn't the most elegant explanation.)</p></div>		</li>
