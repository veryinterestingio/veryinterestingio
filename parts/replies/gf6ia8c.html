			<div class="markdown"><p>Healthcare workers are more likely to spread it simply due to close contact with tons of people in crowded environments. They are also more likely to get it for the same reasons. </p>
<p>But yes, its also young people. Which is somewhat of a problem, because vaccinating the most social people (mostly youth) would reduce the case load by a large amount, while vaccinating the elderly wouldn't reduce the case load by a large amount, but would reduce hospitalizations and deaths.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In some ways this will self filter, as those who are putting themselves into risky situations might feel that they should go out of their way to get the vaccine, meaning they will have an outsized reduction on the transmission rate.</p>

<p>I think that a large portion of this will be off-set by the cohort who is purposely acting in risky ways. For example, the person who refuses to wear a mask for political reasons may also believe there is no need for them to get a vaccine as well. This subset will continue to be likely super-spreaders only mitigated to the extent that people who are exposed to them have immunity.</p></div>		</li>
