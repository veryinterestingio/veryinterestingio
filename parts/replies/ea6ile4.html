			<div class="markdown"><p>If you radiate 4000W/sqm on earth with a panel efficiency of 10% you get  400W/sqm electricity. When you get closer to the sun you increase the intensity of the radiance, assume 8000W/sqm with same panel efficiency = 800W/sqm electrical power with the same panel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The efficiency is based on absence of power. The atmosphere of Earth is what blocks a lot of energy. Satellites though get a lot of power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Problem is length of Venus day is 116 Earth days.  Pretty long for the batteries to last.</p>
<p>Similar issue with the moon(where a day is 30 Earth days).  A reason Mars is a prime target for rovers/landers is because the day is very close to an Earth day.(and because it has atmosphere our equipment can last a long time in with minimal effort, relatively easily reachable orbit, etc).</p>
<p>Mercury orbit is hell to reach; Venus days take too long, the atmosphere is acidic, and the pressure/heat ruins components in minutes; Everywhere else is difficult to reach, gets little sunlight even if the days are decent, <em>and</em> have atmospheric challenges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd have to drop a tube tens of kilometers, and it would have to be able to stand up to differential wind speeds of 300 km/h in very dense air. Actually the super-rotation winds at altitude would probably be the best source of power and the biggest obstacle to building a viable habitat there.</p></div>		</li>
