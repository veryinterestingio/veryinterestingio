<blockquote>
<p>The bottom of a cricket wing is covered with teeth-like ridges that make it rough. The upper surface of the wing is like a scraper. When crickets rub the upper and lower parts of their wings together, they create a chirping sound called “stridulating.&quot; ... The warmer it is, the more crickets will sing.</p>
