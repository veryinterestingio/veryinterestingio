<p>The amazing part is that we are able to pick up the signal it is sending. </p>

<p>That has always fascinated me. If you don't mind, how <em>does</em> it work? How does that signal reach us? The source is so far away, how does the information travel?</p></div>		</li>

They do spread out as they travel, so listening to the probes from Earth now is like trying to pick out a whisper from across a crowded stadium... But since we know where to listen and what to listen for, we can still make it out. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The NASA array in Australia is getting data from Voyager 2 right now actually - at 159.00 b/sec on 8.42 GHz and the signal strength is -153.60 dBm (4.36 x 10-22 kW)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is how we receive the information. The Deep Space Network. A collection of radio telescopes across the globe. If you are lucky you'll see them talking in realtime on that website to Voyager 1/2.</p>
<p>Here is some educational videos on it: </p>
