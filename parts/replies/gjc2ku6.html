			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I used to live in an arid climate and had sore throat and/or tonsillitis all year round. I moved to the UK more than a decade ago and it just stopped abruptly and permanently. Breathing through the nose didn't really help much though, nor was it possible most of the time because sinus infection was a common &quot;package deal&quot; for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation. One minor nitpick: I think humidity is measured relative to maximum capacity (in percentage), so cold air can be very dry while also having high humidity. When the air heats up in your body though, it gains maximum capacity and so the humidity  drops, which is when everything else you said happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. And when you start breathing more through your nose when outside in the cold, your sinuses get dried up and you start getting nosebleeds.</p>
<p>You just can't win in a cold climate.</p></div>		</li>
