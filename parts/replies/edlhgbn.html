			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note: if you need high power pulsed red light, you can power a dye laser with the  532 nm light from a Nd:YAG, thus resulting in applications with red light also having green lasers present on the laser table.</p>
<p>For pulsed high power blue light you can use the third harmonic (UV) of a Nd:YAG to power a dye laser. But again, people like to avoid pulsed lasers in non-visible wavelengths so you will see less experiments done with pulsed blue light as they need pulsed UV to power the dye lasers. (That and you loose a lot of power going to the third harmonic)  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you need fast (short pulse -- 30 fs or less) red light (800 nm for instance) you can fire a green laser into an optical setup called an oscillator. Although depending on your application you might need to do some chirped-pulse amplification to get your pulses up to snuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this a little. Oscillator itself is a laser that produces ultrashort laser pulses. The same properties that allow it to produce short pulses (wide bandwidth) also require very intense pump light. So another powerful continuous wave laser is used to efficiently pump energy into the lasing medium.</p>
<p>Now, there is an issue with increasing the peak power of such laser. As the energy of each pulse is concentrated in an extremely short time interval, it can damage the lasing medium at a lower average power. Thus there is a limit on the energy of ultrashort pulses we can generate. </p>
<p>However, after we have generated the ultrashort pulses, we can try increasing their energy in other ways, while mostly maintaining the short duration at the end. The effective way to do that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirped_pulse_amplification" target="_blank">Chirped Pulse Amplification</a>, the idea worthy of the latest Nobel prize in physics. The ultrashort pulse is stretched in time &gt;1000x, and while energy stays the same, the intensity drops accordingly. Then it goes through another laser, where it can be amplified accordingly without damaging the medium. Afterwards, it can be compressed again in air or vacuum that are much much harder to damage and we get ultrashort extremely intense pulse. We cannot just compress any pulse like that, but it can be done with pulses that were ultrashort to begin with and were stretched without reducing their bandwidth or losing temporal coherence. </p>
<p>Because of such systems, we call first laser it in (ignoring pumping lasers) an <em>oscillator</em> as it is mostly responsible for the duration of the pulses. Then a second one is an <em>amplifier</em> for obvious reasons that is responsible for the energy of the pulse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the more important thing imo. A YAG into a conversion into a dye laser into more conversions is the standard way to do tunable laser output if you don't really care about most other aspects of the beam.  You can get a lot of wavelengths by mixing and matching 1064, 532, 355, and all the wavelengths dyes can give you from those 3 potential pumps. YAGs are easy to use, robust, and the q switching makes their peak output high enough for very efficient conversion. Dye lasers are handy because you replace the dye and you have a new laser output with minimal work. They're also (relatively) cheap because they're pretty old hat at this point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How does that work? Can a dye laser be powered by any laser of shorter wavelength, or are harmonics important for this as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to use a fluorescent dye. In general you have an absorbance and a longer wavelength for the fluorescence. These are both broad peaks. Ideally, you want to use a laser wavelenghth that matches maximum absorbance of the dye. In practice anything close will work, you just lose a little power the further away you are from the peak. </p>
<p>There is also a peak for the flouresence. So the laser cavity picks the wavelenghth based on its geometry. That wavelenghth has to fall inside the flouresence peak to get lasing. Again closer to the peak of the fluorescence, the better the power output. </p>
<p>They have an added advantage that you can change the dye to get a better match of the peaks to the input and output wavelengths.</p>
<p>You can use any shorter wavelenghth within the constraint of what ƒèyes can be physically made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed! There is also a very similar type of laser, Nd:YVO, that can be used to produce continuous beams of green light with several Watts intensity. These can be used for big outdoor light displays but are mainly used in labs to power another type of laser called a Ti:Sapphire.</p>
<p>Ti:Sapphire lasers can be tuned from <700 nm to >1100 nm in continuous or picosecond-pulsed modes, and this wide &quot;bandwidth&quot; also allows some of the shortest (and therefore brightest) laser pulses of only a few femtoseconds in duration to be created.</p>
<p>These lasers are great general purpose tools in an optics lab: they work very well for doing experiments on semiconductors, imaging biological tissue by measuring its fluorescence lifetime, using nonlinear optics to &quot;super-resolve&quot; below the diffraction limit, or even doing nonlinear conversions to any choice of wavelength near the UV/visible/near-IR range.</p></div>		</li>
