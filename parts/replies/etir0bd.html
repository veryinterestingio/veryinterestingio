			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, it specifically references blue eyes having one common ancestor lol.... from the article:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That makes the gene different from the one <a href="https://www.livescience.com/9578-common-ancestor-blue-eyes.html" target="_blank">responsible for blue eyes</a>, which arose from a single common ancestor between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago. Before then, there were no blue eyes, they said.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always hate how they portray them as being &quot;discovered&quot; in these articles. </p>
<p>You ask anybody that's lives in the islands, they know this is a possible genetic variation.</p></div>		</li>
