			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe an anecdote is more like a story. One time I woke a sleeping bear and she tore me a new, better anus!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An anecdote is a short amusing or interesting story.</p>
<p>&quot;So we were walking in the woods today, and everything was fine until we saw a lone bear cub on the path ahead. Since we didn't want to anger Mama Bear because she was probably nearby, we noped right out of there real quick! We kept looking over our shoulder the whole way back, just in case.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These other guys said it well. An anecdote is a story that typically offers a lesson or advice: &quot;When I was young, my friend lost a leg when we accidently woke a bear. That's why I don't camp in early springtime anymore.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
