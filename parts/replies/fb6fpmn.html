			<div class="markdown"><p>I really like that you're distinguishing the difference between AIDS and HIV. However, it's been shown that the immune system of people living with HIV and taking anti-retrovirals still have a disadvantaged immune system. The exact reasons aren't well characterized. Here's a paper reviewing how the Hepatitis B vaccine that everyone gets is less efficacious in HIV+ individuals. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5489285/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5489285/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an analysis on a sample of studies of people who all had low CD4+ counts. It's my impression that fully suppressed infections (which is normal now with modern therapy) result in relatively normal CD4 counts (correct me if I'm wrong). In this study, the means were quite low (300-400 for many of them). So, you should qualify your statement that people who have low CD4 counts from a HIV infection (approaching AIDS) show a greatly reduced reaction to Hep B vaccines. (which seems obvious)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm reaching back into the sections of my uni degree that I haven't used in several years now, but aren't CD4+ T-cells somewhat involved in the self-vs-non-self process at some stage? Or at the very least involved in enough of the system's checks to kinda kick the chair out from under the whole anti-autoimmune process?</p></div>		</li>
