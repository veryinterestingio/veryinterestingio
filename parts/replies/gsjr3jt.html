			<div class="markdown"><p>Education matters here though.</p>
<p>If I want to make a board game, I'll look at a lot of games, a lot of discussion of games, and deconstruct what we already have.</p>
<p>I not only have access to more games, I also have access to thousands of pages of discussion about how to design games, why certain games do and don't work, alternative game mechanics, experimental ideas and more.</p>
<p>This makes it a lot easier to develop a good game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And as chess was developed over hundreds of years all of those discussions, comparisons, alternative mechanics, and experimental ideas would have had a chance to happen.  And Chess would grow, morph, and change over the years keep g what worked and discarding the rest.</p></div>		</li>
