			<div class="markdown"><p>It took about a century of debating before people came to the conclusion that orangutans were not, in fact, a strange type of human. They weren't discovered until the 1690s, which was around the same time that Europeans were desperately trying to come up with a justification for chattel slavery. Hence the invention of racial science.<br />
Several natural scientists and philosophers (including Rousseau) argued that orangutans were just a racially degenerated form of humans and could theoretically be integrated into &quot;civilisation.&quot; Someone (possibly Descartes?) also reported hearing that apes had the ability to talk but chose not to because they were afraid of being put to work.   </p>
<p>Throughout the 18th century people really struggled to define what it meant to be human. Some people argued that it was rationality - but then how do you account for irrational people, or mentally disabled people, or children? Some argued that it was the ability to feel shame, or the ability to blush, or laugh. It's so interesting to see how people struggled to replace the teachings of the church which had been unquestioned for so long.   </p>
<p>To be honest, I do think that apes deserve a degree of legal protection. Obviously they're not human and don't have the same cognitive ability as us. But I think it's unspeakably cruel to keep such intelligent animals in captivity, or (even worse) as pets. People seem to have agreed upon the idea that it's wrong to have dolphins or whales in captivity. I don't know why the same doesnt apply to chimpanzees or gorillas or orangutans.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No chimp will ever read.</p>

<p>Kind of by definition, since an animal that had developed the brain structures to be able to do so would have evolved into something that is no longer recognizable as a chimp.</p>
<p>You could have said the same years ago: &quot;No homo erectus will ever read.&quot; And you would have been right because by the time they developed reading they weren't homo erectus anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I was going to point out. Not just &quot;chimpy&quot; things but memory tasks! Makes me wonder if there might be some kind of trade off between superior memory and other mental abilities. Maybe we sacrifice amazing memory for being able to use our brain for other things. Although I guess that's pretty unscientific speculation on my part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably some of it is just more practice, too.  We've become accustomed to externalizing use of our memories into books, phones, communicating things to other people, etc.  Chimps have to keep it all in their heads.  And of course (not me) humans can become wicked smaht at memory with training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should check out savants, a guy like Kim Peek had a basically unmatched memory. He supposedly remembered the contents of about 12000 books and could recall what day it would have been if you told him your date of birth. He also knew which areas had which zip codes just by straight memory. On the flip side he couldn't dress himself or do basic tasks, his IQ was seen as very low and he was socially very awkward his elderly father looked after him until the day he died. He was also the inspiration for Rain Man, there are some great videos of him. He literally has one at a university were students just start firing all sorts of questions at him and he answers in greater detail than even necessary.</p></div>		</li>
