			<div class="markdown"><p>Aristarchus came up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sizes_and_Distances_(Aristarchus\)" target="_blank">the right method</a>, but his actual observations were very inaccurate. He estimated the Moon to be 3x closer than its actual distance, and the Sun to be 60x closer than actual.</p>
<p>The first marginally accurate distance to the Moon was accomplished by Hipparcus, who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Sizes_and_Distances_(Hipparchus\)" target="_blank">improved on Aristarchus' methods</a> and made much more accurate observations. He was only about 12% off on the Moon's distance...though the Sun-distance is a much more difficult observation to make, he still was a factor of 50x too close. </p>
<p>It wasn't until 1670 when Giovanni Cassini and Jean Richer observed the parallax of Mars with a telescope that we could make an accurate determination of the Sun's distance (to within 7%).</p></div>		</li>
