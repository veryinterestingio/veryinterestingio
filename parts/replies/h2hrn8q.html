			<div class="markdown"><p>High frequency vibrations are more easily absorbed and lost when they travel through objects. They take a lot of energy to stay coherent, which they lose rapidly. They are simply sucked up by the surrounding environment and not re-transmitted. Low frequency vibrations are bigger waves that resonate better and don't lose energy as easily when traveling through objects, around corners, over long distances, etc...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are asking some cool questions. Your question is actually related to how different wifi 2.5G and 5G network. If you look at a high frequency wave it is going to travel through more surface area than a low frequency wave. This is fundamentally the answer to your question. Low frequency waves tend to have a more &quot;normal&quot; entry angle and thus it penetrates easier.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its basically an impulse wave, so its very short in duration, narrow range in frequency, and high in intensity.  Those sharp peaks tend to stick out in white noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The narrow frequency range having a strong influence here. Ceramic and metal objects bring hard and elastic behave like bells or tuning forks here, releasing a tone that our ears are very sensitive on. Striking them hard will produce a sound, that concentrates most its energy, like any bell, on that note, making it easy to be detected thru the noise :)</p></div>		</li>
