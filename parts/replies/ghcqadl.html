<p>Validation that the number you see is the number that dialed you</p>
<p>Edit since this is getting lots of upvotes: assuming it is properly implemented by the telecom companies. For the US we need to make sure the FCC follows the law, for anyone outside the US you will need similar implementations with your telephone companies, this likely won't be done by their own accord.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second the Google Pixel call screener it really takes out a lot of those spam calls. Not sure how it works but i think Google are using the same method to block spam calls like how they block spam emails so the more people use this feature and report spam calls the better it will get. Hopefully Google will make it a standard feature in future android releases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It plays a message to the caller if its a new number to your phone and asks them to identify themselves. It's not until they speak that you're notified of the call while their response is transcribed so you can decide if you want to answer it. When enough people mark a number as spam it blocks it (sends it to voicemail since blocking a call at the carrier level is currently illegal)</p>
<p>The real magic of the Google Pixel with Google Fi is the 3 different carries it uses (Sprint, TMobile, and USA Networks (i think)). My phone always has service and it's dirt cheap. </p>
<p>Google crushed it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need a Google Pixel to do that, just sign up for a free Google Voice number and link it to your existing cell. My Google number is on the internet instead of my real cell number. I use it wherever I have to list my contact info for advertising.</p>
<p>Call screening is easy and works just like you said. I get an app/text/email alert whenever someone leaves a message.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't entirely accurate. By default the call screen answers suspect calls. Calls that are &quot;likely spam.&quot; </p>
<p>On your phone settings there is an option to answer all first time calls.</p>
<p>It also doesn't connect them immediately. It waits until they introduce themselves and the system determines it is a spam call based on the response it disconnects them outright. It only connects the call if they give a response that sounds &quot;real.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>The technology (STIR/SHAKEN) is a work in progress that isn't due to be implemented for at least another year or two</p>
<p>Read the FCC's Daily Digests, you'll see they're REALLY fucking busy laying the foundation for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blocking a number is not the main idea behind the Google Pixel call screener, that is just an added option. The main idea is that you block and report it as spam and that number gets fed to the Google servers which in turn pushes it to all phones that have the Google Pixel call screener so they automatically block that number. You still see the numbers show up in your call log but they get blocked right away and your phone never rings.</p>
<p>Like i said i think Google are trying to fix the spam call problem just like how spam email is handled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DIDs are also often spoofed. Just like with email you can put any return address you want - with SIP CID you can put what ever phone number and name you want. These guys are using dirt cheap ass VoIP with programmed spoofed  CID to hopefully trick more people into answering. This is why you get some off shore telemarketer with a CID that looks like they are across town.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I worked briefly at a line reseller (b2b level, we used SIP, this was over a decade ago), I personally tested by calling my own phone and making it show whatever tf number I wanted, even an emergency number, even invalid numbers.
