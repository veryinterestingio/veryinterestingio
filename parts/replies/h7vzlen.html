			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in Canada, but I've been to the States. It's definitely different even in these two neighbouring countries. In Canada, credit cards AND debit cards BOTH require a PIN to use (unless you're using tap, which had a cap on the size of the transaction before the pandemic). We also didn't have credit/debit combo cards until relatively recently, but it was common in the states for many years before us.</p>
<p>Funny enough, we got tap much sooner than Americans for some reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason behind this is because the tap function is an extension of the chip for chip and pin use. Simply put, the majority of US cards didn't support chip and pin, and missing the chip couldn't support tap.</p>
<p>The reasons why banks wouldn't support chip and pin range from &quot;It's too expensive&quot; to &quot;it's too hard to use&quot; to &quot;No one will ever want to use it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So I think the concern here from the banks is that if the tradeoff is that if the annoyance of entering a PIN (and remember here that <em>change</em> can matter as much as absolute inconvenience, so if you used to not need to enter a PIN but now you do, as in the US) would push people back to cash, the banks might lose more than they gain from that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.</p>
<p>Also you guys seem to be talking about two options that lead to the same account. In NZ this whole thing is null, 'cause you would hit debit for your debit account, and credit for your credit account. And if you only had one account, you would only have that one option <em>shrug</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially when you pick the 'credit' option on a card that IS your bank account rather than being a separate credit card, the bank is presenting itself to the retailer as if it was a credit card company, following the same normal steps a credit card company would follow:  </p>
<p>(1) Retailer bills credit card.<br />
(2) Credit card pays retailer.<br />
(3) Retailer's side of the deal is done. Retailer stops caring.<br />
(4) Credit card company adds the value to the debt the customer owes them.<br />
(5) Credit card company bills the customer for that debt.  Customer eventually pays it off (hopefully).</p>
<p>When the &quot;credit card company&quot; is actually your bank instead, the retailer-facing side of those steps, from 1 to 3, is the same.  What changes is what happens after step 3 where the retailer stops caring.  Then instead of the &quot;credit card company&quot; tracking your debt to them and billing you for it, the &quot;credit card company&quot; is your bank and just deducts it right away from your account now instead of billing you later.</p>
<p>So from the customer's point of view the &quot;credit card&quot; the bank issues is still pretty much acting as a debit card, with a few extra steps but in the end several seconds later after all the computers are done talking to each other the effect is the same - money went from your bank account to the retailer.  It's the *retailer* that sees the big difference in how they work.  The retailer doesn't *see* the bank like a bank when you use the credit option.  It sees the bank as if the bank was a credit card company.  This affects liability laws and so forth.  It also affects things where there's a promise to be liable to pay later for a thing that's not happened yet - like booking a hotel room for a future trip.  If your bank account is big enough, when the hotel asks the &quot;credit card company&quot; (really your bank) if you have enough credit for the room, your &quot;credit card company&quot; says, &quot;yes the credit rating is good enough&quot; when really that's your bank saying &quot;We are looking at how much money is in this account rather than the credit rating, and there's more than enough for us to believe this person will be able to cover it later.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone from the UK, who has never seen an account able to act as both debit and credit, can you explain what purpose this feature is?</p>
<p>I.e. If it's always going to act like debit, what benefit is there in allowing the credit route on that account?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah yeah. Def get the premise. We just have separate accounts for those two processes. Actually now I think about it even our debit accounts are usually through Visa / Mastercard, so I think it's the same process for both, just one usually uses money you have, and one usually comes from a pot that starts at zero (so you use the bank's money). Two older systems that converged, and now just are different in name and custom only (not actual process)</p></div>		</li>

<p>If your account has reg E opt-in (this is the form you sign when opening an account where you indicate if you would like the ability to overdraft), then the bank is also adding in the allowed overdraft amount for your account to that total it uses to assess ability to pay.  Banks have complicated calculations to analyze accounts and determine the optimal amount of money to let a customer OD and still get paid back.  This value gets associated with the account and is the maximum amount of money the bank will allow you to OD before it starts rejecting transactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Canada this is also true and additionally both kinds of transactions require a PIN. The USA is pretty far behind when it comes to payment security.</p>
<p>edit: Both kinds of transactions also generally require you to insert your card in the reader so that the chip can be read and verified.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(for purchases under $80 I think the limit is, else you have to insert it and use a PIN)</p></div>		</li>
