The B cells in recovered patient produce protein (antibodies) which then go into the new patient via plasma and they will circulate through the blood system for a period of time attaching to virus until hopefully the patients body learns how to fight the virus on its own.

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer your question, some viruses do, some don't. For covid there have been cases on neonatal patients although it is still unknown how the patient acquired the virus. Was it in gestation or after delivery?</p>
<p>Generally though, coronaviruses are not transfered in gestation.</p></div>		</li>
