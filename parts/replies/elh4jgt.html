			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also each effects department needs to be on the same page, hundreds of people and dozens of companies/departments are making it but everything needs to look like it was done by the same person with the same eye for lighting and realism, otherwise one shot will come out slightly wrong. That’s not easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very hard to make a portion of a human look real when it's not. There are SO MANY different things that can make facial cg look bad. They would have to match his skin tone perfectly, pores, the way the light shines on the skin. It's daunting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of things went wrong:</p>
<p>-It was very late in production. The rest of the film was mostly done, so the entirety of the release was waiting on this reshoot. Time pressures would have been immense, likely only a couple of days. The normal creative process for something like that would be weeks or months. An artist would submit a shot, get feedback from the VFX supervisor, make tweaks, resubmit, etc.</p>
<p>-Burnout probably, both for the artist and the production crew. Near the end of production is 'crunch time', the people in question would have been working long days polishing all the effects that would make it to the final cut, before being told 'oh yeah, here's another shot, and we need it within a week, no longer!' It would be demoralizing.</p>
<p>-Doing stuff with people's faces is non trivial. People are really good at noticing faces. A rush job to add details in the background, or remove a watch a character isn't supposed to have on their arm, etc. is much easier.</p>
<p>People got the wrong idea from the deepfakes stuff. A dude spent weeks building a custom piece of software specialized in replacing mouths, and then even more time tweaking and polishing the final product, to replicate /one/ effect. It's a cool tech demo, but it's not really game changing. The industry uses lots of specialized tools for things like simulating water, or hair, or crowds or trees, etc, but 'mustache removal' just isn't something that comes up frequently, and when you have to do it on a short deadline, with an exhausted and demoralized team, you get subpar results.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's on a project to project basis, but sometimes we'll get an email saying something like &quot;btw guys we're only getting 80 credits for this project so some of you will miss out. But you'll still be on the list for IMDb&quot;. </p>
<p>It's usually based on the amount of time each artist logged on that particular project, or alphabetical, or could be picked individually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In certain departments <em>cough electric</em> only the core crew gets credited, so it's usually 1+1+3 or 4 (gaffer, best boy, 3 electricians). But they have day players every day. I was rigging on game night and for the airport scene it took about 40 of us an entire week to rig the entire airport, and the same amount of people de-rigged it in one day. Probably 6 of those people actually got credit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that but on most big sets you have to have a paramedic and fire marshal on hand or maybe more depending on size. My firefighter buddy who will occasionally get these gigs in LA will get paid $88+ an hour for what he says is mostly standing around but will easily get overtime because shoots run pretty long. Oh and if you are shooting on public or city property get ready to pay for permits galore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I forget the movie but I remember reading an article a few years ago about a movie where they had to shut down some street for a few days to film. They needed to shoot one more day than planned and it was cheaper to bring it tons of lights and use some CGI to allow them to film at night and simulate daytime instead of paying for one more day of filming.</p></div>		</li>
