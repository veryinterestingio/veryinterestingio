			<div class="markdown"><p>Its partially because 16x9 is the optimal size to viewing ratio. On 4x3 if they were to display the show in letterbox it would be much smaller and require a much larger 4x3 to get the image to the size of a smaller 16x9.</p>
<p>This gives filmmakers, who to my knowledge most prefer that ~1.8 aspect ratio, the ability to display a much larger picture for the viewer now that we have standardized and solidified 16x9.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's for the same reason that movies don't have just one size.  Different lenses and different screen shapes depict things in different ways, and the film crew has to decide which would look best for what they're trying to achieve.</p></div>		</li>
