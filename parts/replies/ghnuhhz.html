			<div class="markdown"><p>You shouldn't get shingles if your immunity is through a vaccine. This is why chicken pox parties are idiotic. Just give your kid the shot, otherwise they'll need the shingles shot later anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before there was a vaccine, the point of the parties was to get it over with at a good time for you and your kids, because you were all guaranteed to get it eventually. When one of your kids got it, everyone else would get it too. There wasn't a choice or way out. Rather than get tied to the train tracks multiple times, you picked a time and buckled down <em>once</em>. One week of misery for everyone vs a month or more when only one kid gets it at a time. </p>
<p>Now that there's a vaccine, yes, disease parties are nothing but abuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the first phase is the result of systemic, throughout the body, infection. It travels through the blood stream hence the generalized pustules on the trunk. Then when you’re 40 -60 and stressed some virus gets reactivated and travels down the nerve where it was dormant and infects a more localized region of the skin. Note: colleague got shingles of his scrotum... no where on your person is sacred, it’s all fair game, wuah, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!</p></div>		</li>
