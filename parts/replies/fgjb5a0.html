			<div class="markdown"><p>My buddy's diet got so &quot;healthy&quot; that he started to deteriorate his liver and, per doctor's orders, had to cut way back on protein and stop drinking for at least 6 months. </p>
<p>He was eating fiber and vegetables and lean protein but was eating way more than his body needed, despite working out (both cardio and weights) every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That guy was just misunderstanding his body. Sounds like he went with 0% fat intake, which causes the body to breakdown the fat surrounding the organs. Since the liver is a big meaty organ primed for that, it probably targeted that first for him. </p>
<p>Even in Keto you have to have <del>carb intake</del> glucose  to keep the Krebs cycle going, albeit very very little. Understanding what your body is doing to the T with the food you eat is something we as humans are still in our youth on. We're getting there, but still have a ways to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you eat matters too.
When I had severe pancreatitis, I could eat or drink all I wanted, but it came out fast, and while I lost fat, I lost muscle, too. I was ingesting plenty of calories, but my body couldn't use them. Eventually the idea of food became sickening, but for a period, nothing I did mattered. I was always thirsty, always hungry, always in the bathroom.</p>
<p>The doctors treated it as Diabetes at first, and revised the diagnosis months later after maaaaany blood tests and taking into account a pretty major mitigating circumstance (newly diagnosed inflammatory disease)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He wasn't eating more calories than his body needed. He was lean and muscular. The problem is that your liver is what breaks down protein into sugars that your body can use. So by only eating protein, his liver was in overtime. Combine that with the fact that we was still going out for a good time (thus his liver was also breaking down alcohol) and the result was that the entire lifestyle caused his liver to exhaust and start to deteriorate.</p>
<p>He's young (early 30s), and your liver can heal, so after 6 months he was fine. Just seems like a random concern considering how healthy and in such good shape he is (triple black belt in karate, lifts heavy weights, jogs, etc). </p>
<p>He was literally eating eggs for breakfast, protein shakes, and large servings of vegetables/salads with a chicken breast for both lunch and dinner. Just about the most bland diet you can think of. Which is also funny because it shows he was dedicated and focused and still ran into an issue. </p>
<p>The lesson? Talk to your doc about major lifestyle decisions!</p></div>		</li>
