			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, increased dopamine is more associated with the drive/motivation to do a thing, rather than feeling good after doing a thing. If you're hungry and get a whiff of pizza, brain dopamine goes up and drives you to go seek that pizza. When you actually find the pizza, dopamine's job is done. That excited anticipation on Christmas morning, waiting for your parents to come down so you can open presents, that anticipation is dopamine. The craving of a cup of coffee or addictive drugs? Dopamine. The happy content fuzzies you feel as/after you consume the pizza, open the presents, or take the drugs are generally other things.</p>
<p>Obviously far more complex and nuanced than that! But dopamine = drive, motivation, enthusiasm, anticipation, from what I've gathered. Also just looked into this on a hobby level, so very open to being told I've got the wrong end of the stick!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>iirc there's actually research indicating that people with ADHD often suffer from a deficit of dopamine, which is why those of us who have ADHD often have a very hard time giving a damn about things we don't enjoy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually have ADHD and a lot of my research was as a result of that, wondering what made my brain different, why certain things help, why other things feel so hard, etc. How I've understood it (and just rephrasing what I've sent above) is that processes involving dopamine are part of what gives you the &quot;oomph&quot; to do something. Stimulant meds work on dopamine receptors but also noradrenaline, and for receptors all over the brain. </p>
<p>And ADHD isn't just any one thing... It leaks into every aspect of our lives. Working memory, our perception of time, attention/what enters our consciousness, and so much more. 100% dopamine plays a role in all that but it's not just dopamine, there's a lot going on which just isn't well understood yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine dysregulation also factors into many disease processes like schizophrenia and Parkinson's. It's definitely not a &quot;more is better, less is worse&quot; kind of situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This correct. You have too much dopamine in your brain when you are experiencing a psychosis and too little when you have Parkinson's.</p>
<p>Fun fact: a lot of anti-psychotics can cause Parkinson's like symptoms with a high enough dosis. The other way can happen to. With a too high dosis of Parkinson's medication you can get psychosis symptoms</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, 100% - as OP referred to them as happy chemicals I focused on the affective/emotional side of things, but there are very few neurotransmitters and many many jobs, so I know they're all employed all over the place!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dopamin and serotonin (and any other neurotransmitters) can do vastly different things. </p>
<p>What it all boils down to, is that neurotransmitters merely form the contact between a neuron and the next cell. When the electrical impulse reaches its contact point to another cell, the electrical impulse can't simply continue into the other cell. That's where the neurotransmitter is released, creating a chain of events that begins an electrical impulse in the next cell. </p>
<p>Serotonin and dopamine are used in many different neurons in different places. That's why you can't just increase one and expect that &quot;now I will be happy&quot; or whatever. They may even have roles in different systems which completely counteracts eachother. </p>
<p>It might seem counter intuitive that the same neurotransmitter would counteract its own effect, but these systems were never created with the intent of us humans introducing the neurotransmitter on a systemic level. Neurotransmitters are just how the body transmits the electrical signal over the gap between <em>one</em> cell to the next. </p>
<p>The different types of neurons and neurotransmitters are however of course more involved in different behaviours and we can use this by introducing it on a systemic level, but this will affect <em>all</em> neurons that uses serotonin or dopamine, not only the very neurons (or systems) we want. So I think most people have the wrong impression and might think a neurotransmitter is &quot;in charge&quot; of something highly specific, when that's not really how it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like r/CuteSomic touched on, taking a pill with a neurotransmitter or precursor to a neurotransmitter (which then the body metabolises into a neurotransmitter) will add this neurotransmitter to a large part of the body, or even the entire body (depending on what the molecule is and which barriers it can pass). </p>
<p>We will <em>not only</em> increase serotonin or dopamine in the synaptic clefts (this is the space between neurons where the impulse is transmitted from one cell to the other via a neurotransmitter) to precisely the target cells responsible for, for example, your mood. We will add it to <em>all</em> neurons that transmit their signal via serotonin. </p>
<p>This is why many neurotransmitter medicines (especially older ones) could have severe side effects, for example Parkinson patients who overmedicate on dopamine can go into psychosis with hallucinations - what you are trying to treat is lack of dopamine/receptors in what is called the basal ganglia (responsible for controlling and inhibiting muscle movements), but like we've mentioned that's not the only neurons that use dopamine. </p>
<p>To add to this, the &quot;mood&quot; is a highly complex issue in its own and is not only dependent on increasing the firing rate of certain neurons (this is essentially what adding more neurotransmitters does - makes it easier for neurons with this neurotransmitter to transmit signals to the next cell and prolong the time of firing). </p>
<p>I realize this might be getting a bit out of scope for an ELI5.</p></div>		</li>
