<p>Not really. There's some solubility of Ga in Al but it's not the binary isomorphous case you're describing. The issue is liquid metal embrittlement, where the Ga acts along grain boundaries and decreases their strength significantly. There are a few proposed mechanisms but nothing completely agreed upon.</p>
<p>If your proposed &quot;wedge&quot; idea was correct then Cu-Al, PH steels, and Ni superalloys wouldn't be a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, what he said is the opposite of what's typical, which is that strain energy in the lattice associated with substitutional alloying <em>strengthens</em> a material, not weakens it. Brass and bronze are substitutional alloys of copper with some Cu atoms replaced with Sn or Zn, and stainless steels have Cr and typically some Ni substituting for Fe. And the difference in atomic radius between Ga (187 pm) and Al (143 pm) is much smaller than that between Cr (200 pm) and Fe (126 pm) and very similar to that between Ni (163 pm) and Fe.</p>
<p>As you say, if the effect of gallium on aluminum were merely associated with lattice strain because of substitution, the same effect would be seen when introducing iron into chromium or nickel (or vice versa) and many steel alloys would instead be unusable.</p></div>		</li>
