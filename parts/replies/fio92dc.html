<p>I was looking at the mid-ocean ridges on Google Earth the other day and wondering why Iceland is like, the only one to make it out. Does that hotspot have a trace of islands anywhere akin to Hawaii?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't. In Hawaii, the hotspot lies under the Pacific plate, which is scooting by at ~10 cm/year. It's a conveyor belt moving to the northwest, which is why the oldest (and therefore most eroded) islands are Kauai and the smaller ones to the NW; the youngest islands are to the SE. Hawaii is the youngest island to break sea level, and is obviously where the volcanic action is nowadays. There is a younger seamount to the SE, if I recall correctly. The Iceland Hotspot lies under the mid-Atlantic ridge, which is a comparatively stable feature geographically, despite having the North American and Eurasian &amp; African plates flowing away from it. So that weird combination of volcanic chemistries stays more or less there, making a big blob, instead of a chain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a similar trail of volcanic upwellings around Montreal, of which Mont Royal (the mountain in the middle of the city) is one. They're not actual volcanoes like the Hawaii islands or Iceland, but they're volcanic vents (or similar features) that didn't quite reach the surface and eventually were exposed by erosion.  </p>
