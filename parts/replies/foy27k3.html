			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that it's worth anything but thank you for taking the time to give such a fantastic answer. As a naturally curious person having access to years of study and time and work condensed into an easy to understand, and not to mention free, answer is amazing to find. While it is no monetary compensation take comfort in knowing that another human being benefited from your years of acquiring knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My understanding of irradiation is that it damages the DNA of donor leukocytes, which prevents the cells dividing and multiplying after transfusion in in the recipient. This stops them overwhelming the recipient's immune system and establishing its own (which then attacks the host). They still have a finite capacity to attack non-self things though (since otherwise granulocyte transfusions wouldn't be viable).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool! So surely red blood cells would be damaged by the radiation too? Or is this effect negligible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DNA is the thing in cells that is particularly vulnerable to irradiation (and you need functional DNA for a cell to divide). Mature red blood cells don't contain DNA, so it doesn't really affect them as much. Irradiation does do some damage, which shortens the cells' life, but they still do their job up until then. All that means is that we change the expiry date on the unit though.</p></div>		</li>
