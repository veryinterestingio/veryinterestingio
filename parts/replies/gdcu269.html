			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! That one took me a little while to figure out. Old school vertical apostrophes (rather than curved or angled like you see for most things these days).
My dad had an old IBM Selectric which he used for actual work. That typewriter was awesome. I forget if that one had a 1/! key or not. I think it did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God I’m an idiot. First I was like “at the same time or something so they all get used at once?” Then was like “no that’s dumb, but how do you backspace, wouldn’t that get rid of the apostrophe?” Such a smooth brained idiot I am.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh that's weird. I've never heard of a dot, but isn't a zero with a slash through it pretty universally known? I wonder why someone decided to use a dot instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some do choose to use a slash zero. One of the arguments to use a dot rather than a slash is that zero with a slash can be sometimes confused with this letter: Ø. As someone who lives in the US, I've never really encountered a situation where I would confuse the two, but I'm sure it's more common if you speak Danish or Norwegian</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The design of the zero in typefaces is actually pretty interesting. If you're interested in diving into it, Wikipedia has a pretty good summary of the alternatives:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashed_zero#Similar_symbols" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashed\_zero#Similar\_symbols" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashed\_zero#Similar\_symbols</a></a></p>
<p>The short version is: the slashed zero can be confused for a number of characters, most notably the Scandinavian vowel that looks like a slashed o. The dotted 0, however, can resemble an uppercase theta, or the IPA symbol for a bilabial click (the sound that Donkey makes in the carriage in Shrek 2). So there are trade-offs to either version.</p></div>		</li>
