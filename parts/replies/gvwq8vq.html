<p>What are you referring to here with eels? Eels are also bony fish and employ the same osmoregulatory strategies as the rest of the bony fishes (i.e., retain salt in freshwater with lots of dilute urine and active uptake of ions, and expel excess salts through concentrated urine in marine environments).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So cartilaginous fish are super salty.... Lol. Seriously though, i came in here too learn because while we learned about osmoregulation in A&amp;P, and again in Microbiology, we didn't talk about marine animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cartilaginous fishes actually retain urea (and a chemical called TMAO to protect blood proteins from the urea), which gives their blood a slightly higher osmotic concentration than seawater. They excrete excess sodium and chloride ions with a specialized gland.</p>
