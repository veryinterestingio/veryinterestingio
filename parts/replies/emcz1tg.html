			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Italian is not the closest. Phonologically (sound-wise) it would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_language" target="_blank">Sardinian</a>. Grammatically it would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language" target="_blank">Romanian</a>.</p>
<p>Long answer: Sardinian has changed the least from Latin phonologically. C and G before I or E in most Romance languages turned into something else, but in Sardinian, they kept their original pronunciation. Most of the vowels also stayed the same (except for the loss of length distinction). </p>
<p>This phonological comparison is to Classical Latin, and not the Latin used by the Catholic Church today (Ecclesiastical Latin). Ecclesiastical Latin is closer to Italian just because it's literally in the middle of Rome. Italian priests just pronounced the words like they would be in Italian, and the pronunciation stuck.</p>
<p>Grammatically, none are really that close, but Romanian kept some of grammar that the others &quot;lost&quot;. Remnants of the case system in Latin remain in Romanian, and the third gender (neuter) also remains. Of course, the two languages are still vastly different from each other, and Romanian added just as many new things as it kept.</p>
<p>To address Italian: The vowels are the closest, behind Sardinian, but the consonants changed quite a bit from Latin. The grammar is entirely distinct from Latin, as the case system has been lost entirely. In place of the case system is a rigid word order and prepositions, and like most Romance languages, &quot;added&quot; definite and indefinite articles.</p>
<p>Note: this is a massive simplification for the sake of answering the question of someone unfamiliar with this topic, so please don't get on my ass for it. I probably glossed over something that some consider important, but this comment is kept (somewhat) simple intentionally.</p>
<p>If you want to delve deeper, have a look into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgar_Latin" target="_blank">Vulgar Latin</a>, the spoken varieties of Latin that developed into the modern Romance languages (check out the further reading section for even more).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds similar to what happened in the Nordic Countries.  If I recall correctly, Icelandic is the most similar to Old Norse.  The most 'conservative' child language will not necessarily be near the center or capital of where the parent language was spoken.</p></div>		</li>
