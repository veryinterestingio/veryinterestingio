			<div class="markdown"><p>This is assuming it all went into cells at time of injection. Instead, they travel by lymphatics (mostly) and eventually wind up mostly in the liver [EDIT - it's actually quite a few places, (here's a good review - <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/21/mrna-vaccines-what-happens" target="_blank">https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/21/mrna-vaccines-what-happens</a>) ] where they get absorbed, pulled into cells and then transcribed. Most of that happens in 24 hours. 6h would be near the start of that process. I recall seeing a time lapse video or animation of it a few months ago that would have a better sense of the by the hour. A lot of the mRNA is destroyed, too, so these numbers are going to be high. </p>
<p>My pedantic answer, though, is infinitely more spike than was being made &gt;6 hrs ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought most uptake occurred in the spleen and lymph nodes due to *pKa optimization of the lipid nanoparticles for a positive charge at the pH in those areas? Would make sense to target it to clusters of antigen presenting cells. I think other therapies optimize for liver fusion though with different disassociation constants?</p></div>		</li>
