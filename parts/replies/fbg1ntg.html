<p>Vinyl is an organic molecule. Lots of organic molecules smell horrible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think that industrial chemicals smell good to humans (well, most humans). Especially adhesive substances like glue, some glues are made using organic materials and won't smell that bad, but usually glue is made from vinyl/polymers which do smell bad. Do you ever wonder why some kids' glues are so expensive despite not being good glue? It's because they intentionally used more expensive materials to get rid of the toxicity/smell.</p>
<p>I thought I'd rewrite this as a fluent English speaker in case seeing how a fluent speaker would write it helps you at all!</p></div>		</li>
