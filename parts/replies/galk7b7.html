<p>It is very likely that the numbers will increase in the future as people dig into the Full-Frame-Image lightcurves. I am not aware of a reaction wheel problem</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You blame TESS for being less successful than Kepler, but these missions were very different. Kepler stared at one spot in the sky for years. TESS is designed to look at closer and brighter transits throughout the sky. There is no scientific reason to think that their results would be comparable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Surely these two missions are very, very much intertwined. TESS was built out of what we learnt from Kepler, it is designed to look in a different way sure but in a way TESS was literally designed to inform the next Kepler. To give a bigger picture. The aim is different, but comparisons can be made. And I think it is a valid question, surely we would expect TESS to bring us more than Kepler?</p>
<p>On the other hand, I just barely follow all these missions and science.</p>
<p>And I also expect machine learning to have a field day with TESS data.</p></div>		</li>
