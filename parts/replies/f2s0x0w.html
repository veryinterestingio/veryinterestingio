			<div class="markdown"><p>For those that aren't familiar with color wavelengths:</p>
<p>The peak you see on those graphs at around 440nm is a deep blue color. Novelty &quot;black light&quot; purple bulbs and LEDs are down around 400nm. 440nm is still a short enough wavelength to trigger fluorescence - that's actually why it's used. All the other colors you get from a white LED are fluorescence of a yellow-orange coating applied in front of the LED. If you have a blue LED flashlight, try shining it at an unlit LED light bulb - it should glow slightly yellow-orange.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the colors. Moving right from the peak you then see a big dip in the 470-480nm range, which is cyan. Strong dips like that in an light source's spectrum can result in the color of certain objects looking weak compared to others, giving a strange pale unsatisfying appearance overall. Cheap fluorescent lamps can suffer from this as well. Unfortunately that cyan dip is present in every white LED spectrum I've looked at, and even dedicated (single color) LEDs in that range are hard to come by - no easy fix.</p>
<p>530-540nm is green. Green laser pointers output monochromatic 535nm light. That is, it would look like a straight line when looking through a spectrograph (like a prism's rainbow, but science-y).</p>
<p>Yellow is 570-580nm. I got nothing... yellow.</p>
<p>Red starts around 620nm. Red laser pointers are 650nm which is on the upper end of human visual sensitivity. Wavelengths as long as 700nm should still be visible, but progressing from a dim glow to invisible the further you go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That totally depends on if you are using a tri-color LED set to white (used in color LED displays, or anywhere you want a specific color: see <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/articles/techzone/2019/mar/how-to-drive-multicolor-leds" target="_blank">https://www.digikey.com/en/articles/techzone/2019/mar/how-to-drive-multicolor-leds</a> ), or a &quot;white&quot; LED designed to offer a high CRI and broad-spectrum, or a hue color bulb that sits somewhere in the middle and tries to be everything to everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also fun fact, violet would be missing from the spectrum. Even tungsten bulbs emit some UV and violet light, but white LEDs do not unless they are specifically designed to also produce UV (ie, grow lights etc).</p>
<p>The color violet is pretty interesting in its own right though. Another fun fact is that neither digital cameras nor color film can properly record violet light. For digital it's literally not in the color spectrum for computers. Remember, red, green, and blue are the computers way of composing all colors. You can approximate the way humans see violet by combining red and blue, but camera sensors are in capable of detecting it. If they have a UV filter, then violet light is mostly removed. If they do not have a UV filter, then violet light is energetic enough that it will appear as a grey with blue bias because it will activate all of the pixels, R/G/B. There are some clever software algorithms to workaround this limitation but nothing is perfect. </p>
<p>For color film, violet will also not be reproduced properly. Typically a UV filter is highly recommended and most lenses include a UV filter coating directly into the glass. If you're using a lens with a removed coating or an ancient one that never had such a coating, then violet and UV light will make all of the color layers of the film react, thus, again, being a grey with blue bias (blue would have the least filtration in the violet/UV spectrum). </p>
<p>So next time you see a rainbow, remember that pretty much nothing is capable of properly recording that violet edge by blue like your own eyes can.</p></div>		</li>

Your camera can capture and your computer can display the colors in a colorspace (a triangle shown <a href="http://static.astramael.com/1/2d-srgb-applep3.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>) but your eyes can see the oblong region outside of the triangle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our blue cones are sensitive to violet and barely sensitive to some UV, while the red/green cones are not. Every other common capture technology has R/G/B sensitivity to UV/violet that is alleviated by filters, but UV is quite difficult to selectively filter for unless you had a violet only sensor as well, like RGBV. Also our vision works by a much more complicated manner than simple &quot;50% blue, 20% red, 10% green&quot; or whatever. It's not something I understand well enough to properly explain, but if that were the case, purple (not violet) would actually just look like a shade of green, since if you averaged blue + red, you'd land somewhere in the green spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Algorithms.. upon further research, it looks like distinguishing violet is a lot easier for digital cameras than color film. Color film it's for the most part impossible without an additional violet-only color layer (I don't think any color film exists with this, but I could be wrong). For digital though, the filters used for R/G/B sensitivity aren't perfect. In particular both R and G are just barely sensitive to violet, while blue has a fair amount of sensitivity. So the software basically interprets the signals as &quot;if blue signal is pretty high and the green/red signal is low but present, then the color is probably violet and should be corrected to some ratio of blue+red&quot; </p>
<p>See also: <a href="http://pages.jh.edu/~rschlei1/Photographic/violet/violet.html" target="_blank">http://pages.jh.edu/~rschlei1/Photographic/violet/violet.html</a></p>
<p>edit: And yes, this algorithm in software can be fooled into thinking things are violet which are not. That gets into the whole photography world of cast correction etc. A large amount of UV light in pictures on a camera generally shows itself as a blue cast with some things appearing purple/violet where the algorithm guessed wrong. This can probably happen without any UV light in very special controlled settings, but these algorithms have been a huge piece of work for the past 20+ years in making digital pictures have accurate color, so they tend to be difficult to fool</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some LEDs that do produce violet light. A problem with LEDs is poor color rendition, especially in the colors between cyan and indigo. This is a null band in standard LEDs, because a you can't have a phosphor that absorbs blue photons and produces photons that are nearly the same color - color of photons means their energy, and a phosphor absorbing and emitting a photon always retains some of that energy.</p>
<p>So LEDs designed to produce a very high color rendition have a near UV laser that illuminates a range of phosphors, producing a mix of colors all the way from deep violet to deep red. The trade-off is that they are less efficient, because the phosphors cause energy losses for all the colors, they produce colors of light that the eye only faintly sees, and some of the light remains in the near-UV, which the eye cannot see.</p></div>		</li>
