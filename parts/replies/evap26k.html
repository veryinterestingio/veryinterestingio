			<div class="markdown"><p>Chip cards also have an insecure magnetic strip.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out, in these discussions, that none of the security features of a credit card are designed to help <em>you</em>, the cardholder (though they may, as a side-effect). Having a chip on your card is not designed to protect <em>you</em>. Someone can still swipe your magnetic stripe information from your chip card.</p>
<p>The chip was introduced to protect <em>vendors</em>. Vendors who require customers to pay using a chip have some assurance that the card has not been duplicated. This is important because if someone commits credit card fraud using a duplicated card, often it is the vendor who is left holding the bag.</p>
<p>Of course vendors still have to support magnetic stripe payment in case there is a chip error <del>or an American customer</del> (sorry, Americans, my info was out of date). But just having payment via stripe being a very strange and outstanding event can make fraud less likely against the vendor. Probably before long, vendors will stop supporting stripe as a backup payment method at all, requiring all payments to happen via chip, at which point credit card fraud via a duplicated card will become exceedingly rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. So does that mean an unscrupulous person would never have to pay for anything they bought using the stripe, so long as they dispute the charge?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so next time I am at a store and they have a post it note on the card machine covering the chip slot that says &quot;SWIPE ONLY&quot;, then I should take note of that and file a dispute with my card company a few days later right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That magnetic stripe is there for a backup. Sometimes the chip, or tap doesn't work. It's rare, but it does happen. I've found very few cards where the stripe wouldn't work, even at one job, the customers card was cracked down the stripe, and he still used it for years. </p>
<p>It's worth noting, that in Canada, any half new machine on the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interac" target="_blank">Interac</a> system will not allow you to use the stripe unless it detects a problem with the chip. So even having a fake card with the stripe won't do you any good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell, unless the machine doesn't accept chip, Visa and Mastercards here don't use the mag stripe either.</p>
<p>I hear there's a digit on the mag stripe that codes whether or not the card has a chip or not, so the machine will know there's a chip and tell you to put it in or tap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been coming across more and more places (on average about half of them) where the stripe reader has either been disabled, or doesn’t even exist on the reader. As in, chip+pin or tap-to-pay <em>only</em>. If your card comes with only a stripe, you have no way of making a payment with it.</p>
<p>The only places where strips are still being read consistently is at gas stations, and I can only assume it’s because of tourists from down south. If they run out of gas, we’re stuck with them. And we can’t have that, now, can we?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's also worth it to point out though, that the cardholder is already pretty well protected, the vendor has the most exposure in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least for credit cardholders, yes 100%. </p>
<p>Security for the vendor is essential to ensure that the card agreement can continue to afford to protect the cardholder to a great extent. Vendors will only absorb so much liability. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, both cardholders and vendors win if theft is reduced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s really convenient.  I don’t even take out my wallet like 80% of the time anymore because my local gas station and grocery store both take Apple Pay, and the coffee shops I frequent mostly use Square, which also accepts Apple Pay. Even Costco and 7-11 do contactless payments now. At Target I have to use their app for my RedCard credit card, which is annoying but at least works well.</p></div>		</li>
