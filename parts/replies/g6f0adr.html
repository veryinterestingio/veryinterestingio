			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.</p>
<p>We have maps from the Roman republic which split the world into 3 parts, Europa to the West, Africa to the south, and Asia to the East with Rome itself being the center. <a href="https://cdn8.openculture.com/2018/04/11204200/Karte_Pomponius_Mela_rotated-e1523507998701.jpg" target="_blank">EXAMPLE</a></p>
<p>The 'middle east' is the area of the east closest to Rome, while the far East is, well, far from Rome. The idea of the Eastern and Western world was further enforced after the Empire split and the two began to culturally diverge, as u/Kandiru mentions. </p>
<p>Modern history has made some changes, but the Euro-centric view of Europe and the America's as 'West' while everything else is 'East' is in fact derived from the Roman's perception of the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is part of the correct answer, but that hard east-west divide definitely predates Rome. The Greeks already viewed the people to the east as fundamentally different from the people of the west. It's a later revision of their own history, since Ancient Greece and Greek culture are profoundly shaped by interaction and exchange with the Near East, but the model endured throughout the classical period and was easily adapted to fit the Roman worldview after Rome's expansion into and beyond the Greek world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I came to emphasize.  Herodotus wrote the Histories nearly 500 years B.C.E. as a kind of anti-eastern propaganda meant to unite the Western world under one culture.  So there must have been a remarkable divide already between the ideologies of the East and West.    </p>
<p>Other comments in this thread seem to hinge the East/West divide in Rome, and while ultimately that did play a major role in how we think of East/West culture today, I think Greece was more probably the crux of &quot;Western&quot; culture and the frontlines in what may be called a &quot;culture war.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't buy that, about the prime meridian. The prime meridian was chosen in the 1800s, and passes through the capital of the hegemonic super power of the day.</p>
<p>Wikipedia suggests that it was chosen because it's use was widespread. And I'm guessing it was widespread because it was the meridian used by the dominant sea faring power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The person you're replying to might be sort of right. Probably made sense to England to decide their colonial map with half the world's land mass east and half West, with the dateline in the middle of the largest ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The alternative being argued about was Paris, or the anti-Greenwich meridian, but Greenwich won the vote. Now, you can argue about what might have happened had there been a large landmass the otherside of the world from Greenwich, but one of the arguments the British put forward was that choosing Greenwich put the dateline through no major landmasses. </p>
<p>From the proceedings of the conference <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17759/17759-h/17759-h.htm" target="_blank">https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17759/17759-h/17759-h.htm</a> :</p>
<p>[EDIT] This is a big document to read</p>
<p>They do give preference to using Greenwich on account of the number of amps, but also consider using the opposite side of the globe from Greenwich.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The preference given to the Greenwich meridian was based, on one side, on the historical right of the Royal Observatory of England, acquired by eminent services rendered by this establishment during the course of two centuries, to mathematical geography and navigation; on the other side, considering that the great majority of charts now in use upon all the seas are made according to this meridian, and about 90 per cent. of the navigators of long standing are accustomed to take their longitude from this meridian. However, an objection against this proposition is, that the meridian of Greenwich passes through two countries of Europe, and thus the longitude would be reckoned by different signs in different portions of our own continent and also of Africa.</p>
<p>It is important to find for the more densely populated countries the simplest mode possible of transition from local to universal time, and vice versa; and we believe, therefore, that it would be convenient for the practical purposes of the question to adopt for the beginning of the universal day the midnight of Greenwich, and not the noon, as was deemed advisable by the Conference of Rome.
This modification would offer for the whole of Europe and for the greatest part of America the advantage of avoiding the double date in local and universal time during the principal business hours of the day, and would afford great facilities in the transition from local time to universal.
In adopting the universal time for the astronomical almanacs and for astronomical ephemerides, and in counting the beginning of the day from the midnight of Greenwich, there would be, it is true, a modification of the astronomical chronology, as heretofore used; but we think it easier for the astronomers to change the starting point, and to make allowance for these 12 hours of difference in their calculations, than it would be for the public and for the business men, if the date for the universal time began at noon, and not at midnight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could have had 12:00 at Greenwich being the change in date!</p>
<p>Later on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE REGULATION OF TIME AND THE RECKONING OF LONGITUDE</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That a system of universal time be established, with the view of facilitating synchronous scientific observations, for chronological reckonings, for the purpose of trade and commerce[Pg 123] by sea and land, and for all such uses to which it is applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the system be established for the common observance of all peoples, and of such a character that it may be adopted by each separate community, as may be found expedient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the system be based on the principle that for all terrestrial time reckonings there be one recognized unit of measurement only, and that all measured intervals of time be directly related to the one unit measure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>That the unit measure be the period occupied by the diurnal revolution of the earth, defined by the mean solar passage at the meridian twelve hours from the Prime Meridian established through Greenwich.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the unit measure defined as above be held to be a day absolute, and designated a Cosmic Day.</p>
</li>
<li>That such Cosmic Day be held as the chronological date of the earth, changing with the mean solar passage at the anti-meridian of Greenwich.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that's some extensive research. </p>
<p>In your own words, you're saying Paris was the other main contender. The dateline argument seems to apply just as equally to the Paris meridian. It is only a bit more than 2° East of London. This would mean the Paris anti-meridian still passes through the Pacific Ocean at -177°38'54.7”. This is still East of New Zealand, and still passes through Chukotka in Russia, just like the Greenwich anti-meridian.</p>
<p>It also strikes me that there is no real reason not to have the date line follow the prime meridian. It's only because the chosen prime meridian cut through Europe and Africa that is was instead desirable to have the date line follow the anti-meridian of the prime meridian.</p>
<p>If, for example, the prime meridian had been chosen to cut through the Atlantic, then it could be placed such that the only land mass it cuts through is the eastern part of Greenland, where no one lives. It should be noted that people live in the area of Russia that the Greenwich anti-meridian bisects (not many though). You could then also make this Atlantic meridian the date line as it would effect no one.</p>
<p>All of that, to me, means that the primary argument was that having Greenwich as the prime meridian meant the least amount of change or refitting. And that the dateline argument was to head off French calls for a more neutral prime meridian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pre-split there was absolutely still a huge difference between the former Hellenistic territories of the east and the Latin territories in the West. Most of Europe and North Africa west of Egypt were much more heavily Romanized and spoke Latin widely. Most of the remaining parts of the empire were more culturally and linguistically Greek.</p>
<p>A big part of that is the Romans had a lot of respect for Greece, and so didn’t enforce such a huge cultural shift in the territories Alex had already conquered. Another part was the Greek culture’s similarity to and historical influence on Rome’s. High ranking members of Roman society knew both Latin and Koine Greek, and often considered the latter more refined. </p>
<p>In the Western lands they conquered, Latin usually took over and Romanization of culture and religion occurred much more quickly. The Etruscans are a good example, their culture and language disappeared quite quickly - 250 or so years after Rome conquered them. The same can be said of most of the Celts who lived across much of Western Europe. And Carthage, they made sure to burn that all down.</p></div>		</li>
