			<div class="markdown"><p>No large meteorites would definitely detonate as they descended to Jupiter's atmosphere. Also, I'm almost certain liquid and gaseous hydrogen and helium are always less dense then any asteroid at a given pressure and temp. Another note there is no in between solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Those are the only possibilities there are pressures and temperatures where the distinction becomes meaningless but still. You'll never see half boiled water nor will you see partially melted ice. Molecules are either free to move or not. Bound to other molecules or not. So small chunks of meteorite would probably drift around for awhile before settling down onto the core of jupiter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We know the orbit's radius, we know the gravitational constant, we figure out the mass of the smaller objects from observing it's makeup and size, we know the orbit's orbital period, then we can figure out the mass of the larger object.</p>
<p>Jupiter and it's major moons have been watched for about 500 years. The US has sent nine probes to it and one is still there in orbit. So from all those probes and seeing how gravity from the moons impact their planned orbits, we've been able to refine the mass of the moons and the mass of Jupiter over the decades</p></div>		</li>
