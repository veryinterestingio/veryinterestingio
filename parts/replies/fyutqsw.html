			<div class="markdown"><p>Meanwhile whenever my nephew stays over (5-7 years old) I wake him up at night to go to the bathroom so he doesn’t wet himself and he literally does NOT remember me doing that and thinks he wakes up clean on his own (nice for the self esteem lol). I have to do like 90% of the walking &amp; directing for him because he’s literally pretty much not awake. He’s one of the heaviest sleepers I know while I will literally wake up from one wood creak so I think this just depends on the person lol.
Edit: typo</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can confirm. My brother could sleep through construction in an adjacent room. His alarm would just go off for hours sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kids get into more REM (deepest sleep state), in their sleep cycle than adults, according to this <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/toddler/how-kid-sleep-is-different-from-adult-sleep" target="_blank">article</a>. That's why the better the chance in moving them without waking. Also the smaller ones are lighter in weight, so dropping them isn't as much of an issue. </p>
<p>Added source : mom of 2, 6, and 7 year olds. The older two get partially dropped half way up the stairs now.</p>
<p>Edit : deep to deepest. 2 different stages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor correction: REM sleep is where most dreaming occurs, and yes, it's thought to be the time when our brain sorts out new memories. So kids spend more time in REM sleep because there are many things new to them. Deep sleep is a different phase. </p>

<p>Yeah, Galileo proved this when he dropped a kid and a feather off the Tower of Pisa.  They fell at the same rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a bed wetter and I used to dream pee. I would be dreaming I needed to urinate and I would. It seemed the urinating reflex wasn’t paralysed like other muscles so my body acted on what I was dreaming. This would sometimes wake me up allowing me to remember the pee dream.</p>
<p>On a similar note, once my father sleep walked into my room and urinated while looking out my windows. He had, or claimed to have no recollection of it the next day. He did however say he was “taking a leak” when I asked him during the act.</p>
<p>My pee dreams could be controlled by a little red pill. No idea what it was. I just took it obediently as a child particularly if staying over at other places, school camps, etc. Eventually the bed wetting stopped. No more pee dreams. Maybe the sleeping mind came to recognise that urinating was not a “virtual” act like saying running in your dreams.</p></div>		</li>
