			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting! But my question remains, does this actually happen? </p>
<p>If you read anything from Pliny the elder to 19th century medical texts, its soon clear that records and texts can be more dogma than empirical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I theorize that it’s just a phrase people choose to use as to describe what happens to them. For example, I was in a car accident recently and believed I was going to die as I had no control over the vehicle and saw the impending doom close in on me. I would say it felt like my life flashed before my eyes with the awe and sheer terror of what I was beholding. For me, I saw multiple scenarios of what was about to happen “flash” in front of me. I saw multiple forms of death and possible near misses. Luckily I got in the middle, near miss for my body but not so much for the car. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, while it certainly isn’t a flash, it’s probably very common that people look back on their lives when on their deathbeds. In old age reminiscing is all there really is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The couple times in my life where I could have died if things happened differently....i never saw any flashes.</p>
<p>Seems like it depends on how your brain works.  Do you startle easy?  Do you fight or flight?  Do you panic under pressure or become super calm?  These are different from person to person so it seems like the memory flashes should also only happen to some people</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps. Could also depend on the nature of the injury or situation? </p>
<p>Although the barrier between psychological and neurological is grey and fuzzy there are some things that are  distinctly identifiable as belonging to one discipline or the other. </p>
<p>I'm definitely going to keep my options open until I see firm evidence in One Direction or the other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It´s more like you think about every major decision you´ve made in your life really quickly, like you´re trying to find something that can aid you.  Going through your mind is your childhood, first loss of someone close to you, first kiss, just flashbulb memories that your brain considers important enough that every single detail is saved, all in the hopes that one of them lines up with your current situation and can use similar data patterns.</p></div>		</li>
