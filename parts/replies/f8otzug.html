			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not wrong at all. It's a simplified description of what's happening. Slightly more detailed would be gravitational contraction creates high pressure and temperature in the core which leads to nuclear fusion. And of course that's still not a lot of detail but it's not wrong.</p>
<p>Edit: Nevermind I read the upper comment again, looks like Kelvin was wrong about where the energy was coming from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He stuck with the theory for an incredibly long time.</p>
<p>Kelvin originally hit on it as a way of dating the Earth from an incandescent ball of rock. Assuming there was no source of energy inside the Earth and making assumptions over the interior of the Earth, he produced gis first estimate for the age of the Earth in the mid 1860s, figuring it to be between 20 million and 400 million years, though he admitted to many uncertainties over the melting point of rock. Kelvin used this number to argue against Darwin's theories, saying there hadn't been enough time for life to evolve in its current diversity. Naturally this put him in the geologists' bad books - from which he has never escaped.</p>
<p>As time went on, Kelvin kept refining his theory to produce ever lower figures,  by the mid 1890s - it was down to 20-40 million years, even when it was clear the evolutionary record and sediment data could not possibly allow for so little time.</p>
<p>Even after radioactive decay was discovered in 1903, and immediately suggested by Rutherford as a major source of the Earth's internal heat, Kelvin never admitted his error. Instead, he insisted that gravitational collapse was the only source of energy that could power the Sun, and since that could not last for the vast times geologists were producing, their calculations must be in error.</p>
<p>Kelvin died in 1907, long before Eddington proposed fusion as the source of the Sun's energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never get married to a hypothesis, even if your data at the time support it. </p>
<p>For example, one of the chapters in my doctoral thesis was... a bit rubbish... as it turns out that one of the brain samples that I studied wasn't what I thought it was (white matter vs grey matter), but I built a whole hypothesis, diagrams and all, about a gene regulatory mechanism that probably doesn't really exist. But it made sense at the time!</p>
<p>So yeah science can get tricky, and it's worse if you're stubborn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kelvin wasn't wrong though. Radioactive decay is different from nuclear fusion. And since the Earth wasn't a molten boiling sun itself from its own radioactive decay then why would the sun be so much hotter and not closer in temperature to the earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radioactive decay could have made the Sun a bit older, too, its mass is sufficient to keep it much hotter (lower surface to mass ratio). Not old enough, but once you know there are new energy sources it is not completely unreasonable to think there might be processes that release even more energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kelvin actually got into a big debate with Darwin over this. Darwin argued for the geologists’ position that the earth had to be vastly older, which provided the time depth that he thought was necessary to support his evolutionary theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a famous old story about Rutherford who was about to give a paper that the earth was much older than we thought, when he spotted Kelvin in the audience.  Kelvin had calculated that the earth couldn’t be much older than 100 million years as this is how long it’d take for a molten ball to cool to present-day temperatures.  Rutherford had postulated that the earth is heated by radioactive decay, so it was super old and still hot inside.  But how to point out that venerable old Kelvin was wrong <em>right to his face</em>?  </p>
<p>Thinking quickly, he said in his lecture that ‘Lord Kelvin calculated the earth could be no older than 100 million years <em>unless</em> some other method of keeping it warm was found.  And here it is.’  Kelvin, who could have given Rutherford grief, just nodded in agreement.   </p>
<p>Academia, boys and girls, that’s how it’s done.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Giving credit and finding common ground.</p>

<p>Basically immediately inviting Kelvin back into the conversation. Like &quot;hey yeah you were correct, we found what you predicted! Wanna see?&quot;.</p>
<p>Awesome story, thanks for posting.</p></div>		</li>
