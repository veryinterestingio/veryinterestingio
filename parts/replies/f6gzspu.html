<p>Revealing that you have broken the code will immediately alert the enemy to make a new code, which may lose you the war and will result in far more loss of life.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that's true the enemy can't immediately deploy a new code. New machines need time for development, you have to fabricate the new devices and deploy them into potentially hostile regions, as well as provide training for the users (which was clearly not up to scratch as user error was one of the main reasons breaking Enigma was possible at all). This isn't a simple software patch! Even if the Germans suspected that Enigma had been broken, it's much more likely that they would believe they had leaks or spies in their ranks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure there's a scene in the movie 'The Imitation Game' where they discover an imminent ambush on a fleet of allied ships. But, they decide they can't disclose the information to prevent it because it would give up that they'd broken the code.</p>
<p>Only to find out, one of the codebreakers brothers was on one of those ships. Not sure if that part is a true story, but I'm sure its similar to some of the tough decisions that had to be made for the sake of the greater good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if they found out their code had been cracked - but not HOW it was cracked - simply changing it wouldn’t ensure it wouldn’t be cracked again, right? So would they possibly abandon the enigma altogether and revert to relying on the previous generation of technology for communicating, which would’ve won the war for the Allies anyway?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Remember Churchill ordered an attack on the French navy to make sure the ships did not end up in German hands after a armistice was signed between the Germans/Italians and France.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mers-el-Kabir was a complicated situation, the British war cabinet gave the French Fleet several options ranging from joining the British navy along with the other navies of occupied nations to leaving the vessels in the hands of neutral America. If none of those terms were accepted then the fleet would be destroyed to prevent the Germans significantly increasing their naval capacity, the French admiral in charge refused to make a decision on his own initiative and neglected to inform his superiors of the entirety of the situation he was faced with. The blame for this tragedy lies more on his hands than Churchill's, Churchill's war cabinet, and the British Admiralty.</p>

<p>He at least could’ve abandoned them before the British destroyed them</p></div>		</li>

<p>They decided as a loose rule, that any action they took, based on information gained from the team at Bletchley Park (where they broke the enigma code), had to be based on information they would've been able to learn from another source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if there was an Italian convoy in the Mediterranean, the British just happened to make sure a recconaissance aircraft was flying nearby. Then they &quot;knew&quot; about it and could attack it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. If I remember correctly they had to use the intel they gained from the decryption to then send out scouts or use other methods to back up the intel gained from the decryption.</p>
<p>So for instance, if a german fleet was sailing just off the coast of southern france according to the enigma intel, the allies would use scout planes to &quot;locate&quot; said ships and then intercept those ships.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Nazis where 100% sure that enigma was uncrackable. You have to understand that in 1940 computer are not a thing, at all.
The Nazis Admiral was a paranoid so he added a fourth wheel to the machine (allied had a way harder time cracking the german navy code)
The polish worked hard on cracking the code  and failed. The british, then based on that work basically invented what is now know as computer science, and then had to ask help to the USA for their industry for them to build a hundred of those machine.
It took they colbined effort and ressources of several countries to crack the code, using means never heard of.</p></div>		</li>
