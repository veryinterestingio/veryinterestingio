			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the supposedly first non-human animal to ask a question was a grey parrot, asking &quot;what color&quot; when he looked into the mirror, and learning the color and word &quot;grey&quot; when told six times.</p>
<p>He also enjoyed fucking with the researchers, playing pranks on them through spoken language, and making up his own words (more like portmanteaus) for unknown objects, labelling an apple as a &quot;banerry&quot; (from banana and cherry). Throwing food at the researchers when it wasn't what he asked for. Using different language when referring to himself, or something else.</p>
<p>But then again, because it's a singular case, there are a lot of skeptics who think that he was learning words by repetition and guided his responses based on subtle clues from the researchers. Still, that would make him one smart fking bird.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I know of at least one that's used it to tell a story.  A gorilla in a special I was watching used sign language and told the story of how poachers killed another gorilla that was quite possibly his mother.  Even adapted the signs he was taught to more clearly demonstrate exactly what he meant to communicate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are slight differences between “communication” and “language”. While it’s known that plants can communicate via chemical means, we don’t classify that as a “language” because it doesn’t follow any syntactical rules or have any deeper and more implied meanings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but if you're to the point of telling a story, that goes beyond communiation, because a story requires reflection and composition</p></div>		</li>
