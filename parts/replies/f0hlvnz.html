<p>I was also tested for tree nuts and was found allergic when I was a teen but semi recently I was tested again and they found I wasn't allergic to them at all and my peanut allergy is apparently not severe? I've tested some tree nuts and I'm okay but I'm not gonna try peanuts any time soon.</p></div>		</li>
