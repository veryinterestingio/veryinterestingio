			<div class="markdown"><p>this sounds a lot like chinese chess, with the 仕/士 moving one space diagonally and the 相/象 moving two spaces diagonally. except the elephant can't jump over pieces in chinese chess, it would be blocked from moving in that direction if a piece were in the middle of one diagonal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bishops were called alfil, elephant. First, they were elephant figurines, but were later replaced by figurines with two tusks pointing upwards. The french interpreted this as a fool's cap and called the piece &quot;fou&quot;; the british (and other countries) thought the tusks look like the miter of a bishop.</p>
<p>The modern bishop moves like the Courier from the Courier Chess, a historical variant that used a 12x8 board and added more pieces.</p>
<p>For the use of the historical bishop, the alfil, a medieval copist writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>„En inter scaccos alphinus inutilis adstat.“
&quot;Inbetween the chess pieces, the alfil stands around uselessly!&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact in spanish the bishop is still called alfil.  Also the knight is just called caballo (horse) and the proper spanish name for the queen piece is the lady (dama).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is annoying me and is really jarring so I'm going to say it. Saying 'the alfil' is redundant. Al- already means the, so saying the alfil is like saying the the elephant. I know this is English tho so idk if it's really a mistake I just like to nitpick?.</p></div>		</li>
