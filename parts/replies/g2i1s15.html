			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question. The &quot;rest of us smaller rides&quot; use hydraulic brakes. The brake lines are filled with a liquid which transmits pedal force to force actuating the brake caliper (squeezing the brake pads against the brake disc which is spinning with the wheels). The hydraulic action relies on the fact that the liquid is, to all practical extents, incompressible. So, the liquid dutifully transmits the force from one end of the system to the other.</p>
<p>Why not use hydraulics for big rigs? There are several considerations. For truck-and-trailer arrangements, one is enough: Trucks need to attach and disconnect from trailers (which also have brakes) all the time. Imagine the inconvenience if there was a liquid in the lines which are routinely disconnected in service. You'd need a fancier disconnect to prevent leaks and spills (as well as air bubbles in the lines after reconnecting, which will kill the effectiveness of the brakes because air is compressible and will &quot;absorb the brake force&quot; in a hydraulic system like a spring) and some way of handling the screw ups which would inevitably occur.</p>
<p>Another reason to use air breaks is that a small leak, while certainly requiring repair as soon as possible, will not cause a total failure of the system. The air pumps can keep gathering more air to replace the leaked air (assuming a small leak). On the other hand, you can imagine that, for a hydraulic (liquid actuated) system, you only have what you have. Once too much liquid leaks out, the brakes will be ineffective. Leaks also make liquid systems fail because instead of transmitting the braking force, the liquid will just spurt out the leak, pressed out by the pedal force.</p>
<p>One more reason is that trucks have a fail-safe brake which requires air pressure to keep released (a spring constantly acts to apply it). You can read about it in some of the other comments here. It is a lot easier to achieve this &quot;always on&quot; pressure requirement with pressurized air.</p>
<p>Size up the vehicle again to large aircraft, though, and things change. It would be cumbersome to fit (and inspect) air tanks and the other paraphernalia to an aircraft which have the ability to reach the pressures and quantities required for the application. Aircraft undergo constant inspection and maintenance and they have robust systems to alert when things go wrong so the very modest reliability vulnerabilities are well mitigated. In addition, they have two other, completely separate systems for slowing down on landing (reverse thrust and aerodynamic braking), so the conventional brakes get some help and while their failure would be quite alarming, the consequences of (particularly partial) failure is only further reduced. At the end of the day, if you need very large brake forces in a hydraulic system, you just push harder on the fluid. In an air brake system, you'd need to store higher pressures in an air tank. That's cumbersome, especially when aircraft only have one brief need for serious braking as they proceed from departure gate to arrival.</p>
<p>Some of this information is generalized (as in not all of it may exactly apply to every braking system of a class) and/or simplified, but it should give you some idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's one more thing.</p>
<p>Big rigs are really heavy.</p>
<p>This means that whenever they slow down their brakes generate way more heat than a car does.</p>
<p>Some of that heat gets transferred to whatever you are using to actuate the brakes.</p>
<p>Brake fluid can boil especially once it contains some water. Air can't boil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is THE big reason.  All the others can reasonably easily be solved for.  </p>
<p>It’s pretty much impossible to use hydraulic brakes past a certain point since it’s too much energy.</p>
<p>Remember: a brake really is just a device that converts energy (momentum) into heat via friction. It’s no more complicated than that.  More energy means more heat needs to be made to consume that energy. More speed and/or more weight means more momentum. At a certain point you run out of liquids that don’t boil.</p>
<p>Steam expands remember so even if you’re cool with superheated water you need to deal with expansion and contraction impacting sensitivity in the line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is an amazingly informative and well thought out reply, thank you for that.  which makes me curious, why don't passenger cars  use air brakes?  and where do you think the cut over point is between air and  hydraulic is as far as optimum application and by what qualifications?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but heres my few cents.  Air brakes have a lot more &quot;infrastructure&quot;.  A car has a fluid tank, the lines, and the cylinders of the pedals and calipers.  Air brakes a compressor and a dryer in addition to all of those things, and then a handful of valves to make it all work.</p>
<p>This would increase both the cost of the vehicle as well as maintaining said vehicle.  A passenger vehicle is to move a few people and maybe groceries around so it's harder to justify the extra cost whereas a road truck is used to haul loads/make money.  More cost effective, and makes more sense for safety.  A runaway car can do a lot of damage at a ton or two, but a truck loaded with 72 tons of steel or something needs the complex system to be fail safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need an air compressor and tanks which are both large and heavy (relative to a car) and draw power from the engine which could otherwise be used to power the wheels. More expensive too, of course.</p>
<p>I have no idea what the cut over point is, but air brakes make sense on vehicles where the extra space/weight required and the minor power draw from the engine isn't a big deal, and a brake failure would be catastrophic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome write up on brakes in general, but I'm just gonna expand on the airplane stuff.</p>
<p>On transport category aircraft (airliners) we use hydraulic brakes as our primary means of stopping. Reverse thrust is an aid but the wheel brakes make up the vast majority of the braking power on landing. In fact most of the time we land we only use idle reverse unless conditions call for more (Brakes are cheaper to replace than motors). </p>
<p>Aerodynamic braking in the traditional sense isn't allowed in the airlines but ground spoilers help us on landing by pushing down on the wing through aerodynamic forces which makes our wheel brakes more effective. </p>
<p>Another safety feature is that we have 3 separate hydraulic systems and each one is hooked up to our brakes. If all 3 suddenly fail we have a backup accumulator that provides up to 5 or 6 full applications so we can still stop in an emergency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't have the precision of a hydraulic system and the air compressor needed to pressurize the system has more parasitic loss than a normal vehicle could get away with. By that I mean it would take away enough of the power from a commuter car's engine to reduce it's fuel economy. Fuel economy is a much higher market and regulatory driven priority for smaller road going vehicles than heavy equipment.</p>
<p>Also, it's much easier to hook up the air lines onto various loads. So a semi can hook to a trailer or trailers, connect a couple air hoses, and now the trailer's brakes are powered by the semi's braking system. That's not near as easy with hydraulic systems. Light duty trucks (my Chevy Duramax for example) can power electric brakes on a trailer, but that doesn't scale well to truly heavy applications. </p>
<p>Finally, these systems need a more trained operator. The systems often need to build pressure for a bit when they first start. They'll start and idel for a bit to run the compressor. A normal passenger vehicle not having braking power for the first 15-90 seconds is unacceptable.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BaconNap" target="_blank">BaconNap</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, but engine vacuum is always there and could be wasted. Using it to boost the braking system isn't a big parasitic loss like spinning a dedicated air compressor is. </p>
<p>So both systems are ultimately driven by the ICE, but one is a &quot;might as well&quot; and the other is a dedicated system than sucks powa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a gasoline engine the vacuum is always being produced, the brake system just bleeds off a little.</p>
<p>Diesel cars have a small vacuum pump that really doesn't take much power to run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biggest reason? Safety.   If the power source fails, or you spring a leak on air break system it fails safe.  The breaks are applied, the vehicle come to a stop.</p>
<p>On a car with hydraulic breaks, if you spring a leak going down the highway, you won't know until you go to stop an nothing happens. (Though this would require at least 2 leaks as the system is split for safety).</p>
<p>So why not air breaks on cars? The system would take up too much space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The parking cylinder isn't really a failsafe. Typically only one of the axles on a tractor will have parking brakes, and while most trailers have them on all axles some do not, meaning you could be trying to stop 80,000 lbs with one single axle. Additionally, the springs in the parking cylinder don't apply a huge amount of braking force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it will be enough to bring the truck to a stop and hold it there. Also stop the truck from moving if the system can't pressurize in the first place.</p>
<p>Compared to hydraulic systems where if they fail you have no breaks period.  So you can start up go and not realize you can't stop until you try to stop.</p></div>		</li>
