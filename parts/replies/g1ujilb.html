			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of but there is a minimal flight speed for control int hear causes. So that you have enough airspeed over the surfaces to generate counter yaw with the rudder, and the asymmetrical lift with the ailerons. It's called minimal control speed, Vmca. The Vmca drastically increases when you start getting asymmetric thrust. Which is sort of the opposite in a car with a spare where if you went faster you would feel the pull more, in an aircraft going slower results in more pull.</p></div>		</li>
