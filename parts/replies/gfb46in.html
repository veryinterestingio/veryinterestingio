			<div class="markdown"><p>Penicillin was invented in 1928 and by the 40s it was widely used in civilian medicine. So yes, we are much, much better at fighting secondary bacterial infections in general. I'm not sure if there is data that quantifies what proportion of deaths attributed to the 1918 Influenza were from a secondary/opportunistic infection, though. That would be necessary information to factor this out of the comparison between the mortality rates in a modern era.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that Penicillin was invented well after the first world war I would say that yes we are able to treat bacterial infection a lot better today than before the discovery of Penicillin. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spanish Flu killed young adults in their prime. People would go to sleep breathless and in the morning family would wake up to find them cold, blue and dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comparatively, I don't know much about how Corona stacks up to the 1918 Flu.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s called a “cytokine storm” - the infection doesn’t kill you, immune dysregulation does.</p>
<p>This was a key feature of Spanish Flu, and it is the proposed biochemical basis behind the death rate of young, fit people with tip top immune systems.</p>
<p>The same general principle applies to sepsis, it’s not the infection that kills you per se, but rather a severe inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which progresses very quickly. In the case of sepsis, every hour antibiotics are delayed is associated with about a 10% increase in mortality.</p>
<p>In both cases, infection starts off an inflammatory domino effect which is catastrophic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to butt in, but how did Spanish flu go away? </p>
<p>I keep hearing people saying that social distancing will be in place forever, plastic screens, wearing masks. If Spanish flu was worse than covid, why would covid fundamentally change the way humans interact, when Spanish flu didn't have much long term impact on day to day socialization?</p>
<p>Is this just scaremongering,.and both will be beaten by immunization?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at the death curve. It was W shaped. Covid is a ski slope that basically only kills higher age groups. And the curve reflects that. Spanish flu killed much more overall, much more children and much more 18-30 year olds. By far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mortality rate was much higher for the Spanish flu, so it would have killed a lot more people who got infected, but outside of America (where lunatics appear to intentionally spread disease), do you think nearly as many people would be infected without asymptomatic spreaders? Plus if the mortality rate was high enough, maybe less of the anti-science crowd would be spreading minimizing misinformation, and perhaps even slimy republican polititions would mandate preventative measures.</p></div>		</li>
