			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but why are the melanocytes less dense in those specific regions? I'm guessing some kind of evolutionary selection, but I don't know why. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural selection doesn't necessarily try to make everything have a point. Traits develop randomly, and if they aren't selected <em>against</em>, they could stick around simply because nothing is driving them to change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to point out is sometimes mutations can have an advantage in early life with a consequence in later life. As long as this later consequence occurs after an organism typically reproduces then the trait is more of an advantage and is more likely to fix in the population. This concept is one of the theories to explain senescence or cellular aging.  Graying hair may fit this model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, its easier to keep a useless trait that does neither help nor hinder than to spend resources getting rid of it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could even be random, many evolutionary traits seem to lack a purpose (like having 5 fingers as opposed to 4 or 6)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which by the way, apparently 6 fingers is the dominant trait, or so I've heard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I think finger number is probably not randomly selected. But you could be right about this being random, in that it could be a linked gene. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like many traits that sneak by in the natural selection process, once you've passed on your genes, any genetically linked diseases or quirks will likely be passed down, since they didn't prevent you from breeding. Hence things like dementia, and hereditary cancers in humans</p></div>		</li>
