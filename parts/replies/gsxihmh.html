			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand what you're saying but ... potatoes. I used to live in a hard water area. Potatoes tasted very average. I'd visit my mum in a soft water area and her potatoes tasted fabulous. Now I live in a medium-soft water area and my potatoes are very good. Not as good as my mum's, that would be silly. But pretty good. </p>
<p>The only variable is the tap water.</p>
<p>Edit to say thanks for all the comments. To answer some of the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>my mum and I both cook with Tesco finest baby potatoes. They're sold all over the UK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yes, my mum adds love. Very important. That's one variable I forgot to account for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>elevation is unlikely to be a variable now. It might have been when I lived in London, but we both now live very close to the sea with no major changes of elevation. In other words, sea level, give or take 50 feet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the potatoes are cooked for 18-20 minutes, depending on size, in lightly salted water, with a lid on the pan. Larger potatoes are cut into two or three pieces before cooking. They're served as boiled (not mashed) potatoes with the skin on</p>
</li>
<li>thanks for the bouillon suggestion. I'll try that!</li>
</ul>
<p>Second edit. Someone's suggested the pH of the water as a further variable. Fascinating! I live in a sandstone area, my mum lives in a granite stone area, so that's definitely a factor I hadn't considered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>depends what and how you're cooking. As a rule of thumb, it'll lose about 70% of it's alcohol content per hour. </p>
<p>Simmer something for 3-4 hours and there's almost no alcohol left. Quickly make a pan sauce and simmer for a few minutes....almost all of the alcohol is still there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a quick pan sauce you still reduce the wine by more than half, or else the sauce gets way too thin. And that way most of the alcohol is gone as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dilution is also a significant effect. If cooking time is short, you wont lose much EtOH to evaporation but the amount of alcohol used in cooking is small enough that the dose per serving is very small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how you long you cook it. For a quick deglazing, practically all of it is left. If it's part of a long simmering sauce, there will be only traces left.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the wine not boil when you deglaze? A small amount of wine at a high temp is going to lose a lot of alcohol fast.</p>
<p>Same as water, really, just a lower boiling point. Boil it hard, and it goes fast. Simmer for an hour, not so much.</p></div>		</li>
