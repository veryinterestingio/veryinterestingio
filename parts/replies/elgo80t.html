			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious -
When I lived in a colder climate, I only got the flu in the winter.
The one year I moved to a subtropical Caribbean climate and I got the flu three times in one year, i'm assuming different strains. Two of them were in the summer, with two months in between. </p>
<p>Does the flu circulate more actively in hot/humid weather? seem counter intuitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because there were different strains of influenza in the area you moved to compared to where you used to live.</p>
<p>Every time you get a cold or flu it's a different or varied version of a previous one caused by random mutations and genetic reassortment of the viral code. </p>
<p>When you stay in 1 location every cold or flu you get is usually quite similar to a previous cold/flu so your immune system quickly detects the virus and fights it. When you move to a new area you're being exposed to a completely new family of viruses your body hasn't seen before. Meaning you're Ill more often with higher severity.</p>
<p>Influenza typically infects better during cold weather, however this doesn't completely prevent its spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find that odd also because i have moved around alot throughout my life, east coast, west coast, deep south, europe. Lived in every type of climate we have, but never been sick as often as i was in the humid subtropical climate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flu is much more transmissible when it's damp.  That's usually winter for temperate climates, which is why we Northerners associate flu with winter.  Things dry out more quickly in summer, so a sneeze doesn't stay virulent on a doorknob as long.</p>
<p>In a hot, humid climate, the transmission vectors would be present on warm days as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humidity alone can't explain why its more virulent in winter, because in the winter it's actually bone-dry in the north. Dew points and humidity levels are much lower and things are far less damp. There is less condensation and it dries out much faster. There is however a greater difference in humidity levels between indoor and outdoor environments because people keep their windows and doors sealed to keep warmth in (i never did, always felt stuffy and disgusting). The same applies for summer in the south, people keep their houses sealed to keep the air conditioned air inside (including me). With AC on, with the high dew points, it also becomes bone dry indoors. </p>
<p>I'm thinking perhaps it has more to do with the body's response, maybe mucous membrane irritation, caused by constant humidity level shifts throughout the day, which increases succeptability to viral infection, than the survival rate of viruses on surfaces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diseases generally do perform better in warmer environments. Much of the effect of higher transmission during winter in non-equatorial regions comes from people spending more time inside in closer proximity, not from a more direct effect on the disease itself.</p></div>		</li>
