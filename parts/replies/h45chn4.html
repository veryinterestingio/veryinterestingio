			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen density is not going to factor into the service ceiling of a helicopter.  It’s just density altitude and it’s effect on the blades, and the density of the air being ingested into the engine.  Even our peak altitude are very low compared to turbine powered planes cruising altitudes, and they have no trouble with combustion at high altitudes.  In fact the helicopters I fly use the exact same engines as many turboprop helicopters planes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skimmed through the answers and it appears only yours and two others actually discuss the fact that <em>oxygen</em> density falls faster as you climb than the vague <em>air</em> density, affecting how well the engine(s) can generate power to spin the rotor.  Good job!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would firmly argue that air density plays a larger role in limiting helicopter performance than oxygen density. Oxygen density can be compensated for in turbine design, while air density requires longer blades spinning faster (more volume of air “pumped” by the blades). Blade length and rotation speed increase the stress of the blades nonlinearly, so it’s difficult to keep making them bigger. Making turbines that perform better at higher altitudes is possible, just might be more expensive or reduce low altitude performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I imagine fewer people bring it up since it makes the most sense that helicopters would be designed to run out of lift before they run out of oxygen.  </p>
<p>Because being unable to fly higher is a much better problem to have than not being able to fly at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>b) The density of the air reduces enough that the blades cannot rotate fast enough to produce more lift meaning you cannot climb any higher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun fact - helicopters do not produce more thrust/lift by spinning their rotors faster. In fact, optimal performance is at one specific RPM, and (in modern helicopters) that rotor speed is maintained by an automatic governor that throttles the engines up and down to maintain that RPM.</p>
<p>So what <em>does</em> make &quot;more power&quot;? Changing the angle of attack of the rotor blades. When helicopter pilots pull the collective lever, the blades angle to take a &quot;bigger bite&quot; out of the air. Do that faster than the engines can keep up, or maneuver too violently, and the rotor blades can over- or under-speed, both cases that will cause a sharp reduction in lift.</p></div>		</li>
