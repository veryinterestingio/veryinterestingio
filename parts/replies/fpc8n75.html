			<div class="markdown"><p>When you sit down to watch a movie, you are generally planning to be engaged for its entirety. Thereâ€™s generally no good stopping point if you want to turn it off and come back later. A series gives you the option to more easily disengage and come back later, if you choose to do so.</p>
<p>In short, a movie feels more like a commitment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's an old joke, the waitress asked me if I wanted the pizza cut into six pieces or eight, I told her six because there's no way I could eat eight pieces of pizza.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for explaining. Itâ€™s too bad. I think that need to edit was a valuable tool that really cleaned up storytelling. I compare a well structured documentary like Tickled to the drawn out Confession Killer or McMillions or Donâ€™t F* with Cats and I see how they threw away potential. </p>
<p>To be clear, Iâ€™m all for nature documentaries splitting into longer episodes and I am grateful for their increase. Those are all about visuals and descriptions about what makes those creatures, plants, and places unique. I canâ€™t get enough!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current filmmakers will probably tighten up their style once they get used to having a longer runtime.</p>
<p>The new market being sufficiently different to the old market a lot of the style and pacing is probably different than what is currently taught in film school etc.</p>
<p>Right now we're living in an age of general bloat, just go see The hobbit's full length run sometime.</p>
<p>eventually they'll figure out how to properly paste the longer pieces instead of turning them into individual one or two hour mini movies.</p>
<p>you'll see more episodic stuff coming like the how the universe works series where each of the episodes takes on a particular faction of the thing it issue.</p>
<p>New media requires new techniques, we just haven't caught up to that yet fully.</p>
<p>All in my humble opinion of course.</p>
