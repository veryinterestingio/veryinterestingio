			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is why I'm glad battery powered lawn equipment is becoming a thing. Ethanol free has never been available in my area until very recently, and the place it is available now is in an inconvenient location and they only have 86 or 87 octane (you find regular here in both ocatanes, and I can't remember what theirs is).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When would you ever use midgrade? Answer: when your vehicle manufacturer specifies it. </p>
<p>Midgrade is literally just a 50/50 mix of regular and premium, and blended at the pump. Oil companies aren’t shipping around tankers full of midgrade. </p>
<p>Using higher octane than recommended won’t do anything beneficial for your engine. It certainly won’t clean it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but the real question is - why do they even sell mid-grade? Almost every engine that doesn't run on regular unleaded requires premium 91+ AKI. Nobody uses mid-grade - I'm surprised that they even sell enough to pay for the extra button on the pump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further question about midgrade/89 octane: why is it sometimes CHEAPER? Having 89 be a 50/50 at the pump mix of 87 and 91 makes a ton of sense. But I have noticed, especially lately, that 89 is actually cheaper than of course the 91, but also the 87. Sometimes by 5-7 cents! What gives?</p></div>		</li>
