			<div class="markdown"><p>To borrow from Feeling Good by David Burns: when you think depressively, you believe lies about yourself (mental fallacies). Examples include: I’m nothing (untrue in every way), everything is horrible (all-or-nothing thinking), I’m garbage (you have good and bad qualities, and are a person not garbage). Each negative lie makes the next lie more believable, while each lie makes you feel worse. Feeling worse leads to more negative lies. A vicious cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was an extreme bout of this type of thinking that made me realise something was wrong. The way I was berating myself was so severe that I just stopped for a moment and thought:</p>
<p>&quot;you wouldn't say this stuff to a convicted mass murderer! This isn't normal!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also just as a side note depression and having extremely negative self thoughts are not always hand in hand. Many times they are, but you don’t need that to be classified as depressed. Just wanted to throw that out there. </p></div>		</li>
