<li>How you report deaths. In Germany, a cancer patient on chemo who dies from complications of contracting COVID has &quot;cancer&quot; on their death certificate as cause of death. In other countries the virus would be the cause of death. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the second time I've seen that claim and it's untrue. On our death certificate you enter: </p>
<ol>
<li>Ilness/condition leading directly to death</li>
<li>Underlying ilnesses that directly contributed to 1.</li>
<li>Other relevant/predisposing ilnesses/factors/conditions</li>
</ol>
<p>The physician signing the certificate has a lot of leeway in doing so, so if you die due to a covid19 infection the certificate could say 1: acute respiratory distress syndrom 2: covid19 3: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (for example), or it could be 1: covid19 2: copd, or it could even be just 1: covid19 with no additional entry in 2. and 3. </p>
<p>Imho it's highly unlikely that someone will enter any underlying disease as the main cause (point 1) in someone dying due to covid19. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factor is hospitals being full. Untill hospitals aren't you can try and save everyone, when they're full, some can't get the cures they would need to survive, and this is what is happening in northern Italy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quality and availability isn't bad here in italy, but the numbers are simply too high for the system to deal with. That's why I believe all countries with 1000+ cases should already start to close things down, otherwise it will spread as much as it did here and everyone will end up with cluttered hospitals</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, ventilators are expensive and limited. Most hospitals account for 1 per icu bed in their hospital and then some extra for step down units etc. There also aren’t enough respiratory therapists to manage said ventilators. In most healthcare settings only ICU nurses know how to manage a ventilator and they still defer to respiratory therapists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And intensivists, anesthesiologists, CRNAs, AAs, anesthesia residents, and some ER physicians. The limitation will be total number of vents, not people to manage them, at least until we all start dropping like flies. Caveat being that in small hospitals there aren’t this many personnel, but also much fewer ICU beds/vents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point number 3 about testing is quite valid, and a point made by recent a New England journal of medicine article.  </p>
<p>Worldwide, the morbidity is 2 or 3% of CONFIRMED cases.   NEJM theorizes that there are likely several times more patients with covid-19 that have mild or no symptoms compared to the “confirmed” case and the actual morbidity from all infected is likely less than 1%</p></div>		</li>
