			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a great point. Uncoated gold will cold weld to itself in a vacuum, since it doesn’t form an oxide layer on the surface. If you fold up a super thin layer of it, the material will bond and rip when unfolding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not just an issue with welding, its a massive problem with off-gassing.  At elevated temperatures and full vacuum, things like silicone start vaporizing and coating everything else.  The one I know of being an EE is the effect called Tin Whiskers.  The solder on circuit boards will literally form little whiskers that grow out and short out pins adjacent to them, in bad situations, it literally looks like fine steel wool growing out of the metal.  These are huge issues for EEs that deal with space borne components and one Im quite happy not to have to deal with</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it does need some consideration, vacuum welding won't just happen instantly if you touch two pieces of the same metal together in a vacuum.  You generally need a special set of circumstances for it to occur, i.e. high pressure between the two pieces, extremely flat surfaces, very clean.  Since everything we send to space will be made on Earth, it will likely have an oxide layer.</p>
<p>That's not to say it can't happen and can be ignored, there is at least one documented case of it happening to NASA (<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940028813.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940028813.pdf" target="_blank">https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940028813.pdf</a></a>) but it's not just as simple as vacuum + same metal pieces = vacuum welding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being tightly packed and having vibrations from a rocket engine can easily get the job done.</p>
<p>Its not just vacuum + metal, but a rocket launch provides a lot of the other requirements readily. </p>
<p>Unless you were in dire straits and absolutely needed every last drop of reflectivity, you would say that even a small chances of failure on a multi billion dollar project isnt worth it. So while im not on the project to say definitively, it wouldnt surprise me if this was a preventative measure for exactly that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if this was ever confirmed, but I'd heard that cold-welding and/or static discharges was a significant factor in why the bearings of reaction wheels failed so commonly on spacecraft. As a result, reaction wheel production was shifting to use ceramic bearings instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are still issues with galling. Metal can also spontaneously grow whiskers in a vacuum, and many lubricants don't work because most of them are volatile organic compounds, which don't survive in a vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That stuff is Kapton. An older engineer explained to me at the Davis museum in Huntsville, AL that the film itself gives the color, and the metal used is mostly aluminum. I asked exactly your question “why all the wrinkles, they’re obviously intentional” and the answer was that there are multiple layers of this stuff, and the crinkling helps those multiple layers stand separately from each other so they won’t conduct heat as readily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I concur. It's made of a special composite that has the strength for folding/unfolding &amp; stretching while retaining good reflective properties. It's basically made of Kapton and each layer is doped with different material to give individual layers varying properties.</p>
