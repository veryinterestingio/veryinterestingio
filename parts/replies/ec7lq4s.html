<p>But I agree that definitely isn't the norm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not saying it’s a definite, but that likely means that they lowballed you when they hired you. So now you’re getting good raises but you’ll probably be just more in line with where you should be. </p>
<p>Or you work for Santa. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it was (is) my first job out of college and i just took it. I really just accepted the offer and should have countered at least once. </p>
<p>But I think now I'm at about what I should be making in my area, maybe slightly less but I like the environment enough to stay for now </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some companies are also smart enough to base raises on where an employee falls on their relative pay chart.</p>
<p>Where I currently work does it, they give employees in the lower band a twice a year raise.  A past employer did it a little differently.</p>
<p>They had a grade, for example grade 11.  Grade 11 might fall from $14-$22/hr.  If you fell between $14-$17 you were low $17-20 was mid and $20-22 was high.  They’d give raises in accordance with getting those who were underpaid higher into the band.  </p>
<p>So if you made “low grade” you could get up to something like a 12% raise, mid was 3-5% and high was 1-3%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a software engineer for a smallish company. The management is super nice but I think the other guy was right and I was <em>slightly</em> lowballed when I got the job but it's my first one out of college. </p>
<p>In my area I could probably still make a little more, but not sure I'd find as good an environment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One more point: people often debate whether the government inflation figures are accurate.  There are a lot of ways the numbers can be calculated, and ultimately, what matters for inflation is the cost of the goods that YOU buy.  So if you feel like groceries or fuel or whatever is prohibitively more than last year despite your income keeping up with inflation, it might mean that inflation FOR YOU is even higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10 years of experience puts you at expert / senior level.  Start counter-offering, rejecting offers, playing offers off each other, etc.  That's easy to do when you're in a reasonably OK job, but they need to fill seats.</p></div>		</li>
