			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone who listened to metal through the mid-late 2000s knows the pain of song compression. Making the quiet parts so loud that it annihilated any form of contrast was so common. It still is nut not quite as extreme.</p>
<p>That's why even good songs from that era still kind of sound like ass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A key fact that is some readers may not know, is it what an album was recorded, each instrument has its own microphone, and the singer also has a microphone.   Those are all recorded and stored separately.  Each is called a “track”.</p>
<p>The mastering process involves combining those different tracks together, applying different kinds of audio effects to each track, balancing the volumes, etc.   The final result is the master.  The master Is what is copied to make the vinyl or CD, or digital download.</p>
<p>Those individual tracks are preserved. So at anytime, the producers can go back and take those original tracks for all the instruments and create another mix, and that is called  remastering it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two good examples. Pearl Jam's Ten. First album. Only one that didn't get mixed by the dude who did everything else for them. They remastered it, and among some other changes, one of the things they did on Jeremy (just to pull a well known song) at the end, there's a long, bitchin guitar solo. Eddie is vocalizing with it. Original recording, Eddie is louder, drowning out the guitar, as the label wanted. Remaster, Eddie is lower in the mix, and the guitar solo is given center stage, as <em>the band</em> wanted.</p>
<p>Another example, Alice in Chains recorded two awesome songs for &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;. Their usual producer/mixer wasn't allowed to work on the songs, as the movie studio had someone doing it already. When they released those two songs on their box set Music Bank, they were remastered, worked on by their usual collaborator/s. The difference is palpable, and the remaster just got the full feel of the song and the signature feel of the band where the other just kinda missed the mark on both</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without hearing the comparison and going on only your description, the Pearl Jam example is technically a “remix”, not a remaster. Mastering is when EQ, compression, stereo imaging, etc. is added to a 2-track final mix. Mastering doesn’t change the loudness or level of individual tracks, but rather the final mix as a whole.</p></div>		</li>
