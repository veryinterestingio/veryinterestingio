			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit. This just clicked for me. It’s like anything else powered by batteries. Cars just come with a built in charger. The wire goes from positive to the thing that needs power to the frame which is the negative terminal on the battery. Jesus I’m slow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On a manual transmission car, you can do a rolling start and pop the clutch to start the car, without having a battery</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This works on old cars for sure. I have done it myself. With some alternators though, you need at least a little electrical current to set up the charging field or the alternator won't create current, and the car won't start even if you push it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On older permanent magnet alternators (dynamos), the battery could be disconnected once the engine was running, but most modern alternators do need the excitation circuit to create the magnetic field which then allows the alternator to charge the battery.  You will find 2 wires (technically 3 since the metal case is the ground return)-one smaller &quot;control&quot; wire and a thicker &quot;charge&quot; wire loading to the battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to attract more static shocks than average, especially when the air is dry in winter. It's probably some combination of my shoes, clothing and car seats. Now I am actually curious to see if/how this will change now that I bought a new car. And winter is coming...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In good practice, both the positive and negative wire come from the battery terminal on most mass produced vehicles. It's not that expensive and ensures perfect continuity, which is very important e.g. for ECU connections...</p>
<p>An exception would for example be old Italian motorcycles. They took negative from the ground. Hence the reputation for unreliable spaghetti wiring (e.g. <a href="http://www.powerdynamo.biz/deu/systems/7078/wiring1.jpg" target="_blank">here's a 70's or 80's Moto Morini 350</a>). Japanese motorcycles were so much more reliable because they dragged negative everywhere... For example, you can't expect a good earth connection through a bearing (from the bike frame to the forks).</p></div>		</li>
