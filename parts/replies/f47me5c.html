			<div class="markdown"><p>I still have nightmares about using towels at my grandmother's house. She used both the liquid softener you put in the wash <em>and</em> tons of dryer sheets, on towels that were already a million years old. Those towels were as useful as drying off with a plastic bag and they just felt perpetually... greasy? So unpleasant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was also told that even using fabric softener on a towel once pretty much makes it irreversibly less absorbent, which, I guess makes sense. How would you get it off except with the stuff it's now absorbing less of?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note - great information.</p>
<p>If you have small children (0-10) it is <em>NOT</em> recommended that you use either liquid or dryer sheet 'fabric softeners' as they interfere with the flame retardant embedded in children's pajamas and bed sheets.  This interference is a cumulative affect, where the more times you use those substances, the more and more you erode the flame retardant capabilities of the item.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genuine question. Why do kids need flame retardant pajamas? I can understand the bed sheets but like...why the clothes? I feel by the time the flame gets to the clothes, it's moot. I can't recall a moment in my childhood where my clothes were close enough to a flame to warrant flame retardant clothing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Furthermore, house fires are unpredictable.  The rationale is that you can still save a child in a home that is on fire, even if the fire is nearby.  What you don't want are their clothing to ignite <em>and continue to burn</em> while they are being removed from the fire.  Or really any situation where they may become exposed to a flame, accidentally or on purpose.  Kids do dumb things, and you don't want them becoming a human torch because their jammies brushed up against a birthday candle.</p></div>		</li>
