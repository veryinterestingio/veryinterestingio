			<div class="markdown"><p>It leaves questions though:</p>
<p>As the cells all have the same genetic material, what makes the cells that are in the right position to turn some genes on and others in another position to turn them off?</p>
<p>Is the physical mechanism exclusively chemical signals that attract / repel other cells, or are there other mechanisms for &quot;moving&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many components that interact in a complex network going beyond the scope of this answer. But in addition, basically everything in the surrounding environment of a cell can influence the development and movement, as another redditor explained a bit further. These include both chemical and mechanical signals. </p>
<p>Environmental factors can introduce or trigger certain proteins, which all interact with subsequent proteins in downstream cellular cascades. Some of these proteins can act as gene transcription regulators/modulators. Some of these proteins can also alter the epigenetic signature of the cell. In essence, functional groups, such as acetyl or methyl groups, can be added to regions of DNA that cause transcriptional repression or upregulation depending on the specific group. This can contribute to abnormalities in gene expression. So although every cell is made up of the same genetic material, the specific interactions each cell has with its surroundings will modify its specific intracellular mechanisms. </p>
<p>A set of cells destined to become the left side of the body could release a chemical that binds to a receptor on a cell(s) destined to become the right side of the body. This could trigger a cascade of active proteins that move into the nucleus and turn off the left-sided genes, ensuring that only one group of cells forms the left side while the other forms the right side. Proteins on cell surfaces can also be mechanically activated if something in the environment physically moves them.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the field of 'epigenetics'. In short; yes there are mechanisms for exactly this. There are processes in the cell that can add stuff (as in, small chemical groups such as methyl-groups, called 'methylation') to the DNA that ensures that certain areas of the DNA can't be 'read' and used by that particular cell.</p>
<p>Now what triggers the epigenetic process in particular can be a number of things. Cells can sense what happens at their outer surfaces, through a series of chemical reactions (cells have 'skeletons' that can transmit information) or it could be certain chemicals in their environment that trigger an epigenetic modification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is both, there are absolutely physical mechanisms as well as chemical mechanisms, cells dont move only on chemo taxis alone they also move based on where they are in space, the way cells are moving around them, pressure pressures. You also have to think with chemical cascades and the certain abundance of proteins and cytokines they help to begin genetic control, gradient will cause certain cellular processes to be turned on or off.  It is an incredibly intricate process where theres no one feature that dictates what a cell will become. In some organisms there are also maternal effect Gene's which basically supply messenger RNA to prove transcriptions for early development which can also turn Gene's on and off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's excellent, he asked how things know to go left and right, and if it's possible to have switched organs, everyone's reciting their cell biology class, this guy answered the question with his developmental biology class. How do things go left or right, look above, how do does flipped organs happen was not the question</p></div>		</li>

<p>My baby making supplies are titled backwards or backward facing, i can't remembet what the ultra sound lady said. Is that like a less extreme of the same thing this thread is on about or is it completely different?</p></div>		</li>
