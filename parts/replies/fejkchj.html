			<div class="markdown"><p>There has been some great research (on captive animals) that shows they do sleep with half of their brain at a time.  It's not clear whether they are commonly vertically positioned though.  They could even be sleeping while doing activities.  I've seen this in performing dolphins - jumping with one eye closed (indicating likely the opposite side of the brain was actually sleeping). I do not know the specifics of this research and how the alternation occurs, but I'm sure there is some alternating - perhaps in separate sleep cycles.</p></div>		</li>
