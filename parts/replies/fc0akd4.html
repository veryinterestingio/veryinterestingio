<p>Humans, being near 300 Kelvin, are constantly radiating infrared photons, photons with slightly less energy than visible light which are not detectable to our eyes, <a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/uploaded_files/graphics/high_definition_graphics/0008/1341/sig08-004_Ti.jpg?1315346777" target="_blank">but are totally detectable with fancy electronics!</a> This is what you're seeing in that image- and it turns out a black trash bag is actually transparent (like glass!) to infrared radiation, so we can see the man's infrared emission right through it!</p>

<p>Interesting part of that image too is that his glasses <em>arent</em> transparent to IR</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IR cameras can't see through reflective surfaces like shiny ceramic tile, windows, glass, reflective metals, etc, they all act as a mirror.  It's nifty but it can also be pretty annoying when scanning components because you can get false information from the reflection that you didn't expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The materials you mention here are opaque to IR because the substrate material is opaque (absorbs IR wavelengths), not because they are shiny. There are plenty of shiny materials that are still transparent to IR. In fact most lenses used in IR imaging systems will look mirror shiny to the naked eye because they have a high surface quality, but they are transmissive in IR and reflective in visible light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Turns out that silicate glass is opaque to IR in general, lead or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is an oversimplification:<br />
If you have a remote control that uses an IR LED you can proof to yourself that this type of IR (near-IR) behaves very much like visible light, no problem shining it through regular glass and transparent plastics (the camera of a phone will have no problem picking it up).</p>
<p>There is a very big difference between the types of IR radiation because the wavelength starts at 0.78 μm and ends at 1000 μm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are, just not on the scale of the image. Any IR camera will show you light within a certain range of temperature. I assume that is to allow for larger fluctuations of colour, to make the image more readable to us. I.e: If you turn up the scale, everything in the picture would become brighter, including the glasses, and you could see heat permeating through them.</p>
<p>This would likely lead to a mostly, almost completely, washed out white image though, and the only thing &quot;in focus&quot; would be the glasses. So a kinda useless image in most ways.</p>
<p>They are simply blocking more heat radiation than the clothes and thin plastic bag.</p></div>		</li>

<p>E: Upon reading again, you're <em>mostly</em> correct.  The glass itself is opaque in the IR, and is actually doing most of the work.  I'd get the same photo using a window instead of a mirror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use a nearly $11,000 dollar TIC and can confirm that glass and mirrors will both reflect in the infrared range. </p>
<p>It’s actually an important training lesson because they can be misleading in low (regular light) visibility conditions (smoke/dark) if you’re unknowingly looking at the reflection of something on the TIC.</p></div>		</li>
