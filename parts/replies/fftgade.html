			<div class="markdown"><p>Something like Tamiflu blocks the flu virus from replicating in your body so there is less virus for your antibodies to kill so you get better. There's a short window when you start getting sick that Tamiflu will work ( 3 days I think) any later and there's no point in taking it because it has already replicated in your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI: tamiflu actually has little evidence based practice to suggest that it shortened the length of infection. At best, it slightly aides and gives comfort (lessening symptoms) while having the flu.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, doesn't it just, you know, <em>keep</em> replicating as much as possible? Or is it simply a phase of the infection?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does keep replicating but at that point your body is fighting it. I guess I shouldn't have said no point because it may fight flu related complications even if it is taken later than the 48 hour prescribing window. Most people are healthy enough to not have the flu related complications and Tamiflu will usually only shave 1 to 2 days off of recovery time when taken during the prescribing window so if you take it later your spending a lot of money out of pocket to maybe not see that 1 to 2 day shave off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why are Antiviral medicines are  hard on the liver and kidneys?\
Is it because those cells do a lot of replicating as their normal work?</p></div>		</li>
