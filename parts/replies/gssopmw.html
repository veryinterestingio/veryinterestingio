			<div class="markdown"><p>reminds me of the office episode where daryll puts that he's shipped over a billion units of inventory on his resume and everyone is making fun of him because of how misleading that statistic is because he counted individual pieces of paper.  if there's usually several billion transistors in the final product, is it really fair to say that the transistors themselves are the thing?  might as well say the individual particles of aggregate in concrete are the cheapest things humanity has ever produced.  with modern tech, they're also highly engineered and mass produced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are individual transistors produced and sold. You cant say the same about particles of concrete.</p>
<p>The cheapest transistor i could find quickly was a bc848b for 0.5 cents per piece. I could not find concrete below 500g for around 5â‚¬.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I like to count the bits of data for the work I do. </p>
<p>When you figure a single product I've worked on has sold millions of copies that filled each a Bluray, that is a lot of product - I think it may be measurable in  quadrillions, maybe even quintillions... ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't blame them really. I grew up in suburbs close to a major city surrounded by farmland, and as I grew up all the farms around us sold to developers to make compact suburbs/condos/retail space. Even smallish plots were selling for hundreds of millions. Set for life money.</p></div>		</li>
