<p>In the UK we have the turbo shandy, half beer, half Smirnoff Ice (basically lemon fanta with vodka in it)</p>
<p>It's amazing during summer if you want to get extra smashed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm British too, and the turbo shandy was both the bless and bane of my summers when I was a teen/at university.</p>
<p>The best part was watching the American students who'd write it off as 'a drink for pussies' find that despite the fact that it drank like a soft drink, it kicked like a mule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a much more dignified summer than ours... When I was an undergrad we'd peg a bag or two of cask wine (goon bag) to our hills hoist clothes line, stand around and spin it to decide who gets to drink next (&quot;Goon of Fortune&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out in the DC area we had a everclear (basically 90% alcohol moonshine) Gatorade, and Red Bull.  Somehow the Gatorade covered the early flavor, and the Red Bull the after flavor.</p>
<p>But then you are left unbelievably drunk with a ton of energy....</p></div>		</li>

(Don't judge me, the corner store has 'em cheap and I can't always get to the Jewel for vodka and Gatorade.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did you know that Smirnoff Ice is only 5%, about the same as most beers, so you're not making the drink much stronger.  Even drinking a 4% beer adding 1/2 of 5% would only give you a 4.5% drink.</p>
<p>Half beer, half vodka would give you the intended result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that you're making the drink stronger, but you're making it much easier to drink. It tastes a lot more refreshing, so you're likely to drink two (or three, or four...) of them without realising you've just pounded back four beers in an hour, thinking they were shandies.</p></div>		</li>
