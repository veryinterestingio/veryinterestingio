			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens to me when it's NOT an unfamiliar place.</p>
<p>For example...</p>
<p>The walk to my weed dealers house seems like it takes forever. It's grueling(about a 1 hour walk) and FEELS like it takes much longer.</p>
<p>The walk home after I've picked up my weed, however, seems much shorter. Even shorter than an hour. Probably because I'm excited and I'm that much closer to getting my bake on!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah I don't like blazing while I have to walk for so long. I'd much rather wait til I get home and enjoy it there. Plus, I don't really blaze joints/blunts too much anymore. To save, I usually do buckets.</p></div>		</li>
