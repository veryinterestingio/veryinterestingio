<p>That, and the atmosphere. Air is pretty good at absorbing x- and gamma-rays.</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>&quot;Well, our solar system is a binary system and they're the most common solar systems in the galaxy, perhaps the most hospitable to life. Therefore, with this evidence we have, it only makes sense that if you're looking for life in space you should look for planets in binary systems.&quot;</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, we've just barely begun looking at life on other planets, and we've already expanded our view way beyond systems that are like ours. Any civilization intelligent enough to get to that point would have a similar understanding of physics.</p>
<p>Our more notable bias would be that we're primarily looking for other carbon-based life that uses liquid water. It's possible, though incredibly theoretical, that life exists that uses silicon or other elements as its basis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It depends on whether you count by system or by star. About 50% of all stellar systems are binary; equivalently, 66% of all stars are in binary systems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wikipedia has a really nice figure to illustrate this for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_Scorpii" target="_blank">7 star system</a>. You can clearly see how it's just a tree of binaries of binaries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can imagine our own solar system as a two sun system, with Jupiter being a teensy star. (In reality, it's too small to actually be a star, but we can pretend.) We'd have a nicely stable system with one full-size star and one little bitty one, but the principal is the same if Jupiter were larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially, although it would depend on precisely what classification of stars were in the binary, their size, output and so on. Assuming both stars were similar to our sun in size, type and output, you would have to hope that the planet we were living on was just a bit further out than the Earth is from the sun, if only to reduce the severity of the impact of the extra radiation, such that life could be similar to the way it is right now. </p>
<p>The other effect of being further out, is that the further you happen to be from the sun or suns, the less likely it is you get clobbered with a solar flare, because naturally, the closer you are, the more degrees of exposure you have to the flare. At least, thats the way I understand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The planet’s magnetosphere would also matter in this instance, correct?  I would assume a larger planet with a larger molten iron core would generate a larger, and more powerful protective shield that would protect from the binary star system’s increased radiation.  At least that would seem to make sense to me. And it would stand to reason a binary system likely had more matter to begin with and therefore larger rocky planets could also be more likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally depends on the type(s) of the stars.  Red suns have a lot more flares for instance.</p>
<p>However in a binary system your habitable zone would be at a greater distance to the stars, so the intensity of flares that get to you would be lower then in a single start system.</p></div>		</li>
