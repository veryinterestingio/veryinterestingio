<p>On the one hand, the story sounds spurious.  On the other hand, he did race stock cars before helmets, seat belts, roll cages, and fire extinguishers were required, so who knows.</p></div>		</li>

In the United States this process was known as jerking water. There were towns where the steam trains stopped just to fill their water tanks, they no longer had to stop when this process was invented. Such places became known as &quot;jerk water towns&quot;. Their inhabitants were called &quot;jerks&quot;. Someone in a city who acted like a rube from a small town could be called a jerk. So now you know where that expression came from. When the railroads were first built they had to stop for water every 50 miles. They would build a water tank and the trains would stop, in some cases a village would grow up around it. These tiny villages became known as &quot;tank towns&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
