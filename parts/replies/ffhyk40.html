			<div class="markdown"><p>A little more information on that. There are studies that have characterised what sounds more &quot;scary&quot; in a scream and a major factor is how &quot;rough&quot; the sound is, which corresponds to rapidly (and particularly irregularly) changing volume. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27911-discovered-the-unique-feature-that-makes-human-screams-so-awful/" target="_blank">source</a></p>
<p>Also, there's a particular &quot;harmony&quot; that's often used in whistles as it's identified as particularly discordant - also grabbing attention (at least in those who aren't tone deaf :-P) Apparently it was first identified when somebody dropped a violin and it made that particular combination of sounds. <a href="http://www.gdfra.org.au/history_of_the_whistle.htm" target="_blank">Partial source</a> (scroll down to 1883) I couldn't find a clearer source for the exact pair of notes that work so well, but I'm sure I read it somewhere once upon a time...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thinking about the kind of sound the Police should have that was attention grabbing but also so different to any other sound of the street that it would be uniquely identified with the Police, Joseph Hudson did what he liked to do when thinking, he played his violin. Having finished his playing, he placed his violin on his table but didnâ€™t quite put it down as he intended. It fell to the floor and it broke. As it broke it made a dying, discordant note. Anyone who has ever dropped or broken a bottle, a glass or a plate will have experienced the nerve jangling effect that such a happening creates. Joseph Hudson noticed the effect the sound of his breaking violin had on him and knew immediately that he had discovered a unique and jarring signal that demanded attention.</p>
