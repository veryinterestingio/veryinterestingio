I have a book where many electrical circuits are described analogously to water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a recently retired water engineer, you are so correct. Back in my studying days, I was fine with hydraulics and open channel flow subjects, but had one electric/electronics subject. I was lost till a mate explained electricity in terms of water flow. Electricity started to make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electricity isn't the water, but the movement of water. AC is just the water sloshing back and forth to produce movement. The electrons don't move the whole distance with each cycle just like water molecules don't travel across the entire lake with each wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluid mechanics = continuum mechanics. Electricity is a bunch of small particles acting together, so they can also be overall described as a continuum, which leads to fluid analogues everywhere.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fluid mechanics are really similar to electronics at larger scales. Both have small particles moving in a field formed with a different potential energy levels (pressure vs voltage).</p></div>		</li>
