<p>So follow up: if it works out perfectly like that, what is the purpose of leap day?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhhh, so it doesn’t actually have to do with the length of days but the length of year? That makes sense, thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But adding an extra day every four years actually overcorrects thouse approximately .25 days each year, so every even 100 (1700, 1800, 100) years is not a leap year even though it should be. But that overcorrects slightly in the other direction, so every even 400 years (1200, 1600, 2000) IS a leap year even though it shouldn’t be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify your comment about working out perfectly:</p>
<p>We came up with units of time based on the Earth’s movements. A day lasts 24 hours because our ancestors defined an hour to be 1/24 of a day. It’s like cutting a pie into 4 slices and then remarking about perfectly the pie tray fits 4 slices: of course it does, because that’s how we sliced the pie. If the pie was bigger, we’d have made bigger slices; likewise, if it was smaller, we’d have made smaller slices. Regardless, there would always be 4 slices and they would always fit in the tray. The same goes for dividing the Earth’s day. </p>
<p>Leap Day comes about because of the interaction between two <em>separate</em> measurements: a day (one rotation of the Earth around its own axis) and a year (one revolution of the Earth around the sun.) The days don’t evenly divide into a year, so we have to approximate by adding days or seconds every so often.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did you mean how &quot;perfectly the pie tray fits <strong>4</strong> slices&quot;, rather than 3? Otherwise I don't quite follow the example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a point of pedantry, the Sun is a star (but your point stands, it's relative to the &quot;other&quot; stars).  Of course there is a subtle motion of all the stars in the sky as the galaxy rotates and different galaxies shift, but that's pretty minimal on the scale of earth years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is great to mess with astrologists because many astrologists use solar days, which isn't an accurate depiction of where the stars are relative to the earth at the time, kinda their whole shtick. </p>
<p>I told a girlfriend I didn't believe anything about astrology because they weren't internally consistent.</p>
<p>She went and double checked everything she told me in sidereal days. Sounds like it was a PITA for a slight change in made up information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other way round. Sidereal day is &quot;relative to the rest of the unverse&quot;; that's the 23hr56' one. Solar day is relative to the Sun, that's the 24hr one.</p>
<p>If you want, think of looking down from the North Pole; the Earth is then rotating counterclockwise - widdershins - and is also going around the Sun counterclockwise. So each day, it has to turn that extra 4 minutes to get the Sun back overhead, because it went one day along its orbit.</p>
<p>--Dave, ELI5 remembering the phases of the moon: the lit part of the Moon faces the Sun ... and as they go across the sky, the Sun slowly catches up to the Moon, passing it at new moon</p></div>		</li>
