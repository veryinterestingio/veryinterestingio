			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at it from this perspective actually explains my stress induced anxiety amd panic attacks.
The only thing my body knows is that something is stressing me out it however doesn't know it's just an exam and it won't acually kill me. Being under so much stress for a couple of months just made my body think i'm under constant threat and it responded with extra vigilance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/ashwagandha/" target="_blank">KSM-66</a> has helped a lot of people with lowering cortisol, including myself. It seem to make me &quot;care/stress less&quot; when facing a stressful event, while at the same time getting the job done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very much so, they way I learned it is that stress is the result of when the body goes into &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode, but without any physical struggle happening; no outlet for that pent up alertness = stress. And so humans come up with various ways, more or less artificial, and more or less healthy, to give themselves this outlet; sports, sex, drugs, gambling, picking fights, yoga, gaming, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, pretty much. Your body begins to kick in the flight or fight response, which makes you tense up, your breathing and heart beat quicken, you can begin to sweat, a bunch of hormones are released in your body preparing you to run away or fight for your survival... all while you're just sitting there, actually stressing over something that's essentially inane. Can cause damage over time, but mostly as long as it's not constant it's not too bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive read recently that the pacing is more or less based on feeding routine. Of course any animal with a traditionally large territories being confined and refused sufficient vegetation cover (because obviously people need to see the tiger or whats the point of having it) will cause stress and anxiety, but next time youre at a zoo or wildlife park etc, notice how the tiger paces near a door or hatch in the enclosure, its definitely interesting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there is so much to be explained by this that we don’t appreciate or are taught. So much of everyone’s being is driven by instincts we don’t always need. Food, reproduction, survival etc, which today we’re constantly trying to translate to modern life.
An ancient inner language we haven’t deciphered. </p></div>		</li>
