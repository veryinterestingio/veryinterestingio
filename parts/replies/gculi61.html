			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right about the function of brown fat, but there's very little evidence that this is why adults experience heat and cold differently. Adults, in general, possess very little brown fat. The culprit is more likely to do with:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Thyroid function:</strong> if you produce very little thyroid hormone, then you will feel more cold. If you produce at the higher end, you will feel warm more often (and you will also be skinnier - which seems to speak more to what OP experiences).</li>
<li><strong>Iron:</strong> People with lower iron have a harder time delivering oxygen-rich blood to peripheral tissue. Women frequently have anemia at rates much higher than men, and women more frequently experience cold-intolerance as well.</li>
<li><strong>Circulation:</strong> hear rate, blood pressure, blood lipids/cholesterol, and blood sugar all impact circulation and the ability of your blood to perfuse peripheral tissue. If your circulation is poor, you will have greater cold intolerance.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: The issues I have listed are the most common factors or among the most influential factors in your perception of hot vs cold. Overweight in the absence of a thyroid issues will generally make you more heat intolerant rather than cold intolerant. Underweight in the absence of thyroid issues make you much more cold intolerant. Of course, temperature perception is far more complex than any singular explanation. It is always a combination of factors. These are just some of the more common reasons people experience temperature differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get a cast iron pan. My food tastes like my ex's, but MORE IRON!</p>
<p>(Partially joking about the taste, just don't leave food on the pan overnight)</p>
<p>Edit: Since I can't reply to ppl anymore because the thread was locked. Your food may absorb more iron from the pan if you leave it there for extended periods of time, especially if the food is more acidic. Not a huge deal, but something to keep in mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm on the thyroid thing. I have underactive thyroid and even when most of my symptoms are under control, my feet are pretty much always freezing. Sometimes I have to get out of bed and have a hot shower at 3am because they're so uncomfortable. It's sad as I used to pad around barefoot all year round. :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get a heating pad or a hot water bottle! When I was little in the arctic wastes of Michigan my grandma used to sew me little bags full of rice or corn. You can pop them in the microwave and then put them in your covers to make your bed warm. I liked to nudge mine down to the foot of the bed and keep my feet warm on it.</p>
<p>She also used to bake potatoes and wrap them in foil for me before I went out to play. I would put them in my pockets to keep my hands warm and eat them when I wanted a snack. If your circulation is rough on your extremities, please consider heating pads and Pocket Potatoes :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an interesting thing happen to me regarding being cold or hot. I used to tolerate cold very well. Was the last to need a jacket, etc. </p>
<p>I went to work in a steam plant for almost 5 years. The cool areas inside around the boilers were from 90-120 degrees F. Around the boilers it was 180+. Many times the floor would start melting our boots if we were on top of the boiler or if insulation was missing. I bumped a pipe and it burned my arm tearing skin off as I pulled away, leaving it sizzling on the pipe and me bleeding like crazy. Incredibly hot areas.</p>
<p>After working there now I can't tolerate cold at all. I get cold, stay cold, almost like poor circulation. But hot weather I tolerate far easier. Could complete reversal.</p></div>		</li>
