			<div class="markdown"><p>Deva Curl was the brand we used in the salon but it can be pricey. Mainly it’s just ingredients you want to avoid. Look for shampoos without SLS (Sodium Laurel or Laureth Sulfates) and conditioners without silicone or dimethicone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(For me its still expensive about 8€ per product, dont know how much they are in the US.</p>
<p>I could get any other shampoo for 2-3 € but they are the only brand easily accesible in Germany that does not use sulfates and silicones and actualy improves the texture of my wavy hair)</p></div>		</li>
