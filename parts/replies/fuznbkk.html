			<div class="markdown"><p>I think his intuition comes from the fact that the world is discrete in practice. You have 2x more atoms in [0, 2cm] than in [0, 1cm]. If you are not looking at something made of atoms, let's say you have 2x more Planck lengths in [0, 2cm] than in [0, 1cm]. See what I mean? OP's intuition can be correct for physical things in our world, but mathematics go beyond that, with rational numbers being infinitely divisible. As soon as there is a limit to how much you can divide things, even if it's one million digits after the decimal point, OP's intuition is valid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you imagine the rows to be numbers encoded in binary, it doesnt matter what number is in this set, if you take the diagonal and flip the value that number can never be in the set.  Now imagine the rows and columns go on to infinite!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small nb: while the Planck length does constrain our ability to predict physical results at scales smaller than it, there's still no data suggesting it's some fundamental &quot;smallest length scale&quot; (and some data to suggest that if there is such a discretized space-time, that it must be far smaller still)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's definitely not a &quot;smallest length scale&quot;, Planck units are roughly the transition point between general relativity and quantum gravity. When things are smaller than the Planck length, last shorter than the Planck time and/or have less energy than the Planck energy, it's likely that quantum gravity predicts better what will happen than general relativity does. We know very well that there are physical units smaller than Planck units, they're more like a soft lower bound to the standard model than a hard limit of the physical world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can even go further. For every number n in [0, 1], you can construct two numbers in [0, 2]. n and n+1. That is the most natural pairing of numbers in the sets and seems to validate the intuition that there are 2x numbers in the second set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but for every number n in [0, 2], you can also construct 2 numbers in [0, 1]. n/2 and n/4. Neither of the two sets have more elements than the other if you use real numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add: there's a thing called the <em>measure</em> of a set. It does represent the size of OP's intervals - the measure of [0, 2] is twice larger than the measure of [0, 1]. But the measure does not mean the number of elements (because it's infinite in both cases).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, how good an explanation is relative to the person you are talking to.<br />
Just as how big a set is is relative to the things you are comparing it too.   </p>
<p>What is better, is relative.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm pretty sure to people who hadtwoyearsofuniversityleveltrainingonthesubject, this makes sense.  But to me, who has literally no idea what these elements, intervals, etc. are, this is just another head-scratch.</p>
<p>Edit: not literally no idea, maybe already forgot the said concepts</p></div>		</li>
