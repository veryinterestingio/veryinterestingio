			<div class="markdown"><p>By producing hormones, that regulate heart rate either directly - like adrenaline or cortisol, and indirectly - like aldosterone or adrenocortical. I am absolutelly sure that you know what adrenaline does, so I won't get into that, but the latter two hormones regulate blood pressure, and when your blood pressure rises or drops, the heart rate has to adapt and vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adrenal glands secrete hormones when you are in the presence of a stressor.</p>
<p>So you might be sitting and at rest, but are mentally stressed due to life and what not. This stress will cause release of hormones which in turn will effect the cardiovascular system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's responsible for the release of hormones. Hormones such as epinephrine which directly bind to receptors that affect heart rate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, especially since heart rate is such a mutable thing. There is a specialised impulse generating system in the heart, that is unique to each person, which has a huge impact on the heart rate, also adrenal gland activity has an influence, because the adrenals secrete hormones that can alter heart rate. Health depending on heart rate could only be considered if thought of together with other factors, such as amount of cholesterol, coagulation factors, heart size and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say there are two people that are exactly the same with every respect except for heart rate. </p>
<p>We'd have to figure out why their heart rates are different, and if they experience any differences. </p>
<p>If there are causes for the difference in heart rate, you look at the causes to determine if one is healthier than the other, but we said earlier that the two people are exactly the same except for heart rate, so this situation is disqualified.</p>
<p>Let's say that the disparity in heart rate causes some problem for either the lower or higher one. Obviously the other one is healthier, but now they are no longer the same. </p>
<p>Let's say it has no effect in the performance or has an ambiguous/situational effect, like trading speed for stamina. Then you can't really say, but they're no longer the same.</p>
<p>Health is more than just numbers. There's a range for everything that is acceptable, but it's impossible to compute the &quot;best&quot; number to have because human bodies are constantly changing and are very different.</p></div>		</li>
