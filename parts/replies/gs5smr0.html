			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add on to this that they have these recommendations to catch the folks who don't understand the signals their bodies are putting out, either because they do not feel &quot;tired and headache&quot; and think &quot;thirsty&quot; or because they genuinely don't feel thirst. As we age our ability to feel thirsty actually gets worse, so it's better to say &quot;drink this amount of water to cover your bases&quot; than &quot;Meh, drink if you feel thirsty&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The same way people will insist they are too cold or too hot while looking at a thermometer that reads exactly what it always does, thinking it must be broken, or be constantly adjusting it throughout the day. It's not broken, that's your metabolism. If you haven't eaten all day or haven't eaten enough you might feel cold, you might feel cold and tired immediately after eating, you might feel warm if you're dehydrated or if you ate a meal without much water.</p>
<p>Most feeling sickly, tired, headaches, cold, hot, dizzy, lightheaded, nauseous, etc is just some combination of not meeting your basic needs</p></div>		</li>
