			<div class="markdown"><p>The ester bond in a triglyceride is with the fatty acid and the glycerol backbone.  The trans fat refers to the orientation of the double bond in the actual fatty acid.  To make a fat into an oil, you need to reduce the melting temperature by having unsaturated fatty acids make up a higher % of triglycerides.  This can be done without the inclusion of trans fatty acids.  Simply put, it doesn’t mean that there are trans fatty acids added during the interesterification process.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!  So not a trans fat and hence does not have to be labeled as a trans fat, but by modifying it in order to get the same food industry benefits, is it heart healthier than Crisco or is it just as bad for one's heart health?  i.e. the health industry has not been able to investigate it enough to condemn it in any way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know the composition of saturated vs unsaturated fats in crisco, so tough for me to say.  Importantly, fats are not the devil that’s been ingrained into society’s diet understanding.  Fats are extremely important for hormone production and overall health.  If you don’t have a metabolic disorder you can up your fat intake, and still be heart healthy. Just be sure to check out your triglyceride levels and cholesterol 2x a year.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when it was public outcry for &quot;health reasons&quot; that all the fast food places switched from shortening to the Hydrogenated oil.  Just goes to prove that the large public sentiment about things doesn't mean that it's right.  I don't remember where most of the scientific community was on the subject back then, but the only dissent was about $$.</p></div>		</li>
