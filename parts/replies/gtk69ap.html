			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, as the guy was telling me in an ideal world you use a new needle every injection but it’s not realistic to expect people who use needle drugs to do that, so the less blunting of each needle they incur per injection the less likely they are to have messy, infection-prone injection sites or to lacerate their veins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a German Youtuber who was in prison for like 10 years. In one video he talks about his cell mate who wanted to shoot up heroin and he &quot;sharpens&quot; the needle at the prison wall because it was so dull after being used too many times. He said the sound of the needle scratching the wall still gives him nightmares.</p></div>		</li>
