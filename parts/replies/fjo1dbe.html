			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually disagree that figuring out how much to give is easy. There have been massive rcts comparing restrictive v liberal transfusion strategies, and the results are not all identical esp when certain subgroups are considered. Also the clinical picture varies a lot eg blunt trauma v penetrating v ruptured AAA v PPH. </p>
<p>If you just pick an endpoint eg hb, map or mental state then sure you can titrate to it. But are we sure that is the right endpoint? Medicine is complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a much more complex topic that is the subject of great debate. </p>
<p>Your assertion seems more helpful in those with blunt injuries+head trauma, while permissive hypotension (protocols allow for SBP as low as 70) seems to be associated with better outcomes in primary hemorrhage (gunshot, stab wound, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes someone who understands the struggles of trauma resuscitation</p>
<p>The balance of permissive hypotension while trying to maintain CPP is a game we play often but difficult to choose a true end point. </p>
<p>I was going after solo hemorrhagic shock. MAP &gt; 65 with mental status is far superior to SBP &gt; 90.</p></div>		</li>
