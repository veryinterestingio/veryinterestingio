			<div class="markdown"><p>That was also similar to what I went through. I was very witty. Always was in honors English growing up. Words were my playground. And then I lost the ability to articulate. It was the worst feeling in the world. I felt very stupid. I promise. It comes back. You just have to slowly work through things one day at a time and it may take months and even years as it did with me. But it comes back. You will feel smart again. And notice I said “feel”. Because you are smart right now, you’re still you, that part of your brain is just taking a little break right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar for me, I was a huge reader growing up and loved honors english and writing. Now I can rarely concentrate on reading more than 2 or 3 pages of a book at a time and writing essays takes a LOT of willpower. I've wound up as a more of science and math person now, i find it comes a lot easier to me. Maybe it's just me growing up (I'm 18 now, this and my depression has developed over the past 3 years), or maybe it's a result of the depression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the exact same thing, with me having schizophrenia and sometimes depression on top of that.</p>
<p>Reading really helped that. I managed to get into the habit of reading daily, and it really helped sort of give my brain a work out</p>
<p>If I'm going to the pub one night to meet my friends, and make sure to do at least an hour of reading earlier in the day, to work out and warm up my brain, and it makes me this witty joker who can say a lot and articulate it easily and I don't need to think hard and concentrate to do it</p>
<p>Only problem is it's so easy to fall out of that habit, and then all the good effects of reading go away pretty quickly if you're not doing it every day too</p>
<p>I've heard others do puzzles, crosswords, sudoku, that type of thing, to create the same effect I'm going for by reading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for this. I used to be extremely intelligent, quick with a retort, and grasping new concepts was effortless for me. Now I'm almost silent because my memory and articulation are shot. But knowing it can come back is a huge relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Getting off them was a bumpy road for me, I quit mid last November. It's best to google what you can expect before taking the step. Not telling you this to change your mind or discourage you, but you should research it to find the best approach (cold turkey vs tapering) and being ready for side-effects.</p>
<p>I quit cold turkey after 2 years and had major emotional swings. They started iirc 2 days after the last pill. One moment I was glowing with happiness and the next I was crying. I thought I was going bipolar or something. Suddenly I had _zero_ buffer for emotional load and everything had to be addressed. Worrying returned, too.</p>
<p>Luckily I talked about this to the people in my immediate surroundings and it didn't freak them out. It took me some time to be able to tell the signs ... this came from inside me and didn't feel synthetic or chemical. It lasted for a few months and since December I had only a few of these instances and dealt with them on my own. Last one was a couple of weeks ago. </p>
<p>What I should also mention is that my AD had changed my personality as well. When I came off I suddenly took initiative to do all sorts of &quot;normal&quot; things. I had an urge to follow up on people's advice, while I was on meds these things simply didn't register.</p>
<p>For me personally, I should have quit earlier. But in retrospect it's impossible to find solid pointers when to quit. I quit because I hate pills. In the past years I've tried my share of pills and always terminated them as soon as the opportunity presented itself. But I took my antidepressants for 2 years because they were low dose and a number of people were very persistent in me taking them.</p>
<p>This should be read as nothing more than anecdotal. I know a number of people now who have varying degrees of prescriptions for depression and no two stories are alike.</p></div>		</li>
