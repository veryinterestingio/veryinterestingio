			<div class="markdown"><p>This. This right here is the correct answer.</p>
<p>I know people who have enabled &quot;GDPR Compliance Plugins&quot; to give the cookie warning on personal blogs, WordPress, etc.</p>
<p>Dude. Nobody is logging in, you have no ads, and you have no analytics - not Google, not Matomo. Squat.</p>
<p>You don't need any of this shit.</p>
<p>But people think it's easier to show they've done something to &quot;comply&quot; rather than read the actual regs and realise they're already compliant!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What’s also quite annoying is how many sites are not compliant with any disability laws. But because GDPR is “easy” to implement with a banner, people bother. But one glance over a site with an accessibility scanner that throws up hundreds of errors, and suddenly it doesn’t seem as important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that large business and government should be completely disability compliant. But people making personal blogs or hobby sites or grandma and grandpa that sell jam are not going to invest the time or money to do it. I'm not saying it's right that those people won't do it, I'm saying I understand why and don't fault them for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not talking about hosted services like blogger or tumblr. People running their own wordpress/joomla site on £3/mo managed hosting and getting het up about GDPR and the Cookie regs that literally don't apply to their use case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're not a lawyer, can't afford to hire a lawyer I'm sure it's a lot easier to add a GDPR plugin than to peruse all the legislation yourself to figure out if you're compliant or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're in business, you can't afford not to have a solicitor.</p>
<p>If you're not in business, you're probably already compliant, unless you're in the business of doxxing people.</p>
<p>And the legislation really isn't thta hard - everything important is in Articles 1-6.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google Analytics falls under the second of the three examples. You just need to inform the user that it’s there, but you don’t need permission from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Last time I checked, Google Analytics is solidly into &quot;ask for consent&quot; territory.</p>
