			<div class="markdown"><p>I see your meta-comment pointing that out got a silver. Sometimes I wonder if the people giving out awards are all admins with an unlimited supply, trying to make us think it's normal to spend money awarding posts and comments. I can't imagine ever spending real money on that, lol. But then again, I'm pretty cheap.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Source: I'm a microbiologist who does the CWD testing for my state</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh I've read it, it's not anymore unsettling than having a healthy understanding of the disease. They were directly inoculated with infected brain tissue, which would only be pertinent if I was eating the brain. Also I'm in TX and we've only had a few reported cases, and TPWD and TAHC have done a really good job of setting up mandatory sampling zones and informing hunters and processors on safe handling procedures. Those mandatory sampling zones are very far away from where I hunt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched an interview with a top infectious disease expert on the Joe Rogan experience, I believe he worked for the W. H. O among others. . It was at the start of the Pandemic and the subject in hand was about covid, he explained that early tests of infected people from swabs taken from their throat showed 10x more virus than normal flu and how it can be passed on just by conversing in an enclosed space. He later went on to talk about how they were concerned and keeping their eye on CWD  and how it has the hallmarks of jumping to humans, he said its not a matter of if but when.</p></div>		</li>
