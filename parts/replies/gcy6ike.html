			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, interesting. It makes you wonder if, in a world without vaccines, you could inoculate people by introducing a small dose of the virus into their digestive tract.</p>
<p>Kinda like how they used to rub puss from small pox patients into a scratch in your skin to trigger an immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was already a paper theorizing that small amounts might have gone through mask filters, but was enough to build an immune response without giving them a fullblown covid19 infection. It came out months ago and not sure what came to be of it. I'll see if I can find the link</p>
<p>Edit: found it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Face masks may be inadvertently giving people Covid-19 immunity and making them get less sick from the virus, academics have suggested in one of the most respected medical journals in the world. 
The commentary, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, advances the unproven but promising theory that universal face mask wearing might be helping to reduce the severity of the virus and ensuring that a greater proportion of new infections are asymptomatic. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean it makes sense, with exponential growth you want to cut down on the base as much as you can. After 4 reproductions 2^4 is a whole lot less virus than 10^4. Obviously that way over simplifies how biology actually works but it's just one more argument people should reduce exposure and wear a damn mask.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s actually a version of the polio vaccine that was an oral vaccine that infected your intestinal cells with a severely weakened form of poliovirus. Since polio is primarily spread through fecal-oral transmission, this is a perfect method for that, but other viruses with modes of transmission that aren’t intestinal it might not stimulate the right kind of immunity to protect everything</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm like 85% sure i had digestive tract covid in early September. I got INCREDIBLY nauseated and crampy intermittently, slightly feverish, body aches, headaches, and diarrhea for like 2 weeks. Got an oral swab and it was negative. </p>
<p>Question, if it manifests and takes over in one system is it (more) likely to appear negative in another?
Thx.</p></div>		</li>
