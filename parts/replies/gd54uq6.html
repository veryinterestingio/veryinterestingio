			<div class="markdown"><p>Man I know this is the theory but I’ve still never had it work out for me.  I have a 7.1 system and used the microphones and test tone auto setup to configure the levels when I got it.  I was just watching a movie tonight where the volume was a good spot to hear dialogue.  Suddenly a car explodes and a firefight breaks out and my fucking walls are shaking and my ears are just getting painfully blasted.  I cranked it down to what I could actually tolerate and when the scene was over I couldn’t hear the dialogue for shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's still not a perfect system. assuming your system is set up correctly and you are using all of the correct listening modes, at the end of the day it comes down to the talent of the audio engineer, and sometimes they don't make the best decisions. But for the most part, if you have a competent system and have it set up for your environment, most of what you watch should sound great. </p>
<p>Also, if it's something that happens on a regular basis for you, You may consider turning up the gain on just your center channel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah a manual tweak on the center is probably needed.  It happens a lot to various extents but the movie tonight was particularly egregious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with you here.  I have similar problems using a a decent headset and in newer movie theaters.  I think it’s the style of modern mixing.  I’m not sure, just my two cents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like (pun intended) some sort of filter (either software or hardware) that would limit the maximum decibel level would be the simplest solution. Is that available? Why isn't it already built into TVs if this is such a common complaint? (Anecdotally, it is.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's something you're more apt to find on a surround receiver. I have a 10+ year old Yamaha 5.1 receiver, that I'm currently only using in 2.1 mode, because reasons. It has a 'Night Mode' with a Cinema and a Music preset. On Cinema it does a pretty good job of reining in the subwoofer and boosting the higher frequencies a bit so you can hear dialogue better. It works, but it isn't perfect, and I still find myself switching off the subwoofer when I'm late-night watching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BTW, this simple, direct solution would also solve the problem of commercials that ramp up the volume.  (Which I thought the FCC was supposed to stop.)</p></div>		</li>
