			<div class="markdown"><p>When pasting long links, you can often look for a question mark and delete everything after it, just posting the much shorter link.  It makes it look better, and it leaves off all the irritating tracking info (that can also cause problems, since the website might choke if the format of the tracking part of the URL changes in the future).  So, your link could just be:<br />
<a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Utilitech-0-5ft-2-Out-Outlet-Extender-White/1002815162" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Utilitech-0-5ft-2-Out-Outlet-Extender-White/1002815162" target="_blank">https://www.lowes.com/pd/Utilitech-0-5ft-2-Out-Outlet-Extender-White/1002815162</a></a></p>
<p>Good to test the link before you post it, but that is much easier to look at that your original link.</p>
<p>Related to the product, those are great!  They are good for oddly shaped/large power supplies, but I also use them as a right-angle plug for outlets behind furniture.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/stuff-this-in-your-socket/1002815162" target="_blank">https://www.lowes.com/pd/stuff-this-in-your-socket/1002815162</a></p>
<p>Or to make it short as possible I'll replace with &quot;x&quot;.  Works also on eBay.</p></div>		</li>
