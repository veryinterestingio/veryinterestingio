			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why spoiled eggs float.   </p>
<p>The egg slowly breaks down and the gases that form while the egg is breaking down leave through the porous shell. While the egg starts off slightly more dense than water (so it sinks) at some point it will have lost so much mass that it’s lighter than water and floats (at which point you should throw it).</p></div>		</li>
