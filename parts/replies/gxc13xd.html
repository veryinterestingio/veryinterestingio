We called them touch-me-nots, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impatiens_capensis?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">impatiens capensis</a>. If you touched them, they let out a little poof if seeds and curled up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few plants with exploding seed pods like impatiens, wisteria is another. Disturb the dried pods on a hot day and they explode violently. Pretty different than what the OP is talking about where leaves close when touched, then re-open after a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love squeezing impatiens seed pods, taught my kids that early on- probably age five. While it's not the same plant or plant part, it's still a version of thigmonasty (or thigmo something, looks like someone above knows all the thigmos!)- a plant reacting to physical touch.</p></div>		</li>
