			<div class="markdown"><p>Any source for this? There is no reason to think once the voice algorithm has been written/trained using it is particularly compute-intensive.</p>
<p>EDIT: And honestly Siri or Google Assistant sound pretty good, they don't sound like robots, they have human voices. The objective isn't to make them speak using the voice of a celebrity. They sound non-human when they don't know how to pronounce a specific word or name maybe, but there's no reason to think the algorithm that imitates Bill Gates' voice doesn't have the same issue...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A computer can analyze Gates's voice patterns, and generate speech in the style of Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Apple originally used a voice actor,  Susan Bennett, for Siri. She was hired, spent two months in the studio recording lots and lots of words and phrases, but never told what the job was. Apple did not want her to become famous as &quot;the voice of Siri&quot;, because that would take the spotlight off of Siri.</p>
<p>After Siri launched, Apple started creating their own &quot;Siri&quot; voice. The wanted it to sound close to  Susan Bennett so that they could merge it in with the current Siri, but the goal was to completely replace all of Bennett's recordings.</p>
<p>So, if Siri sounds a bit robotic, that's intentional.</p></div>		</li>
