			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. One thing I'll add is that, regenerative breaking isn't the only way to slow down an electric vehicle.</p>
<p>Imagine turning on a ceiling fan, letting it get up to speed, and then switching that little switch that changes the fan's direction. The electric flow is reversed and the energy being spent is to first slow the fan down in its current direction and then speed it up in the opposite direction. The same principle can be applied to electric motors. The mechanism to switch the flow of electricity is an electric switch, which is electronically controlled, and can be quickly flipped as-needed.</p>
<p>The car can remain in drive, but, when it detects the break pedal being pressed, it can switch the flow of electricity (effectively putting it in reverse) and *use* energy to slow down, rather than capture it like regenerative breaking does. Of course, this requires some additional intelligence for corner cases (e.g. what to do when someone presses both pedals at the same time), but, in normal driving circumstances, it's very practical and has already been hypothesized as something Tesla might do.</p>
<p>This is not possible in an ICE vehicle because (a) you would need to switch the transmission between drive and reverse, which is much slower than an electric switch and (b) switching the transmission to reverse while the car is moving forward would probably do very bad things to it, if it could be done at all.</p>
<p>Is this a practical thing to do? Well, it depends on other concessions you make, e.g. (as others suggest) using a different, cheaper, less efficient breaking system. If that breaking system can be augmented with this electrical system, then it might be a reasonable trade-off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats what my electric scooter does (it has both hub motor braking and disc brake) - when I brake lightly or coast with KERS on, it will regenerate some power, but braking harder flips it and it starts to consume power to, I suppose, produce counter torque. Below 5km/h electric braking cuts completely, but I suppose it could continue producing counter torque/ try to accelerate backwards to sop completely, in principle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was looking for. Work with industrial motors and VFDs regularly and those motors can be slowed down very quickly by the VFDs using electronic braking. I'm sure they could be used to actually stop the motors but in our use case it isn't necessary or worth the effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a bad idea but there is one caveat which kinda kills it. The braking speed of 99.9% of vehicles is not limited by braking power but by traction. You could have the best brakes in the world, and all the torque available to stop your wheels but the only thing that will actually shorten your stopping distance is having better tires, or a highly intelligent ABS system.</p>
<p>High performance brakes only provide a benefit when there is the potential of overheated brakes. This will likely never happen unless you're in a race or driving down a long steep hill. </p>
<p>The reason Anti-lock-brake systems exist is because static friction provides more grip than dynamic friction. Dynamic friction is what happens when your wheels start squealing because they no longer have a consistent grip on the road.</p>
<p>Could the electric motor braking system work? Yes. But it is <strong>far</strong> less efficient and reliable than using just regular brakes and it doesn't provide any performance benefits. </p>
<p>Tesla is working on technology that can dramatically improve braking performance, but it will probably only be available in super expensive cars. Compressed air rockets are not very efficient at all, but they can provide a short burst of energy that can be used to accelerate or brake very quickly. If the new Tesla Roadster has compressed air rockets it will likely be able to start and stop faster than any other car on earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question i think OP is asking is more why they haven't designed the regen breaking for low speed. it's not impossible, just impractical and unnecessary for reasons you outlined. One interesting idea is to reverse the motors for breaking at low speeds... but that is probably a can of worms</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The resistance at low speeds is too low. The owners manual on Prius states that it basically switches to friction brakes at under 7 mph. The electric generator can't make enough friction at low RPM, and if it did, it would be too big/powerful too be on a car. Having a generator be too big means otp be heavier which costs range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's some fakery. they blend friction breaking at the end. Tesla for example cannot bring vehicle to stop without friction breaks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others are saying, you're also removing the ability to coast if there's only 1 pedal, and destroying your ability to have controlled braking, right? Like you can't brake faster and harder, you can just brake at the level the car wants you to, no more no less. This sounds terribly impractical</p></div>		</li>

<li>An automobiles service brakes do not hold the car while parked.  If equipped with an automatic transmission, the driveshaft(s) are locked when put into park. If a manual, then a parking brake must be applied. The parking brake is not the same as the service brake.
OP's question is about bringing a moving vehicle to a stop.
Air brakes are a different beast altogether, but I believe the brakes act as both the service and parking brakes.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Depends on the vehicle.  My understanding is that it would be unusual these days for &quot;regular&quot; cars to have a separate brake system for the parking brake, it's usually just forcing the service brakes on.</p>
<p>Things like semi trucks do usually have a completely separate emergency/parking brake system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. In my car there is an electric motor that clamps down the rear discs - it is also used as part of the automatic braking feature on the car. And my old truck uses a cable attached to the rear drum brakes to clamp them on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trucks have a separate air circuit to apply the brakes for parking, and for the past forty years they've had a whole other backup system called spring brakes for when the air pressure is exhausted, but they operate on the same drums, shoes and pneumatic applicators as the service brakes.</p>
<p>Before spring brakes, the backup parking brake was putting the transmission in its lowest gear and betting the truck wasn't heavy enough to turn over the engine when the air was down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air brakes are a fail closed system. When unpowered, they exert their maximum braking force. You need to supply high pressure air to open them up.</p></div>		</li>
