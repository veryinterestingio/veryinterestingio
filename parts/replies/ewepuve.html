			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so glad you said this because I've always had an issue with feeling nauseous in the mornings. Ever since I was like 14 or so I didn't want to eat breakfast because I would  feel gross. But any time I would try to search &quot;nausea in the mornings&quot; the only response to ever come back was Pregnancy. </p>
<p>It was so frustrating because I KNEW that wasn't it but I could never find any real answer. I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia as a kid but nobody ever told me that was a side effect. They never really told me anything about it other than Mom forcing more snacks down my throat in the afternoons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pregnancy or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_vomiting_syndrome" target="_blank">CVS</a> is all I ever found when researching why I was sick in the mornings, I always eat one huge meal a day at noon, skip breakfast, and sometimes skip dinner since I eat so late.</p>
<p>Turns out I have slight CVS sometimes. who knew lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had issues with nausea in the mornings for about 4 years. Took me heck of a long time to find out that it was a combination of weak stomach sphincter, (therefore acid reflux) and low blood sugar. I HAVE to have something in my stomach when I go to bed, or else I get nausea from hypoglycemia in the morning, but I can't eat a whole meal within &lt;4 hours of bedtime or else I get nauseous  from acid reflux. </p>
<p>For my fellow folks with this problem, I recommend figuring out by testing, if your problem gets worse by eating/drinking tomatosauce (hard on the stomach),
things with coffein (including chocolate),
soda or anything carbonated (because acid), legumes or mushrooms (gas)
and foods with a burned crust (I dunno why). </p>
<p>I also recommend sleeping with your upper body elevated by a 30 degrees angle, to keep the acid down through the worst periods.
Good luck to you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have issues being hungry in the middle of the night and in the morning, to the point where I don't feel well.  I eat high protein snacks before bed.  Usually a peanut butter sandwich and some yogurt.  But sliced deli meat and cheese also works.  Just protein stuff.  Carbs don't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. I start getting shaky, then I start to sweat. I get really agitated and then super nauseous. The one thing I need, sugar, is the thing I am not eating because I am nauseous. Usually have to get a Sprite or Mt. Dew to get my blood sugar back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought I was the only person to experience this!!! This used to happen in grade school and still happens from time to time if I fast. I even bought a diabetes kit one time thinking maybe I had diabetes but the sugar results were within the normal range. So happy to finally get an explanation, even my doctor didn't know how to address it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not how hypoglycemia works.</p>
<p>Hypoglycemia has nothing to do with the sugar in your diet and everything to do with your blood glucose levels. If your blood sugar is so low you're exhibiting physical symptoms, the most important this is to raise it, and the most effect way to do that is with simple sugar because your body processes it quickly.  It doesn't &quot;correct&quot; itself if you cut out sugar because it has to do with how your body regulates blood glucose levels not actual sugar in your diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Around this time last year I started not feeling hungry and when I would eat a tiny amount of food I would feel like I was going to puke. It got to the point where whenever I went out with my boyfriend he would force me to eat, whether it was soft serve ice cream or bites of his burgers. I had other symptoms too and talked to my doctor and found out my birth control was too strong and screwing up my body more then it was already screwed up. It took a really long time for me to get my stomach back. Last month I was snuggling with my boyfriend and mentioned I had eaten 7 pieces of pizza the night before (cut in squares not triangles) and he celebrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My whole life I've had issues with not being able to eat much without feeling nauseous, and not eating also makes me nauseous. I'm emetophobic on top of it all, which is just a big mess. Was it just hypoglycemia for you? How did you go about getting diagnosed? Sorry for all the questions, this may just be an answer to a lot of problems I've had my whole life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found out because if your birth control is too strong it give you too much estrogen which can cause bad things if your body isn't used to it.  I had looked into it and it said too much could cause lack of appetite. I also had a bunch of other symptoms that go with having too strong of a birth control. When I talked to my doctor she knew what the issue was and prescribed a different one.
I'm not sure if it was hypoglycemia, all I know for sure was that the problem over all was the medicine. It started as food aversions and quickly followed with the nausea. I would talk to your doctor about it.
After switching meds I got better, it just took time for my body to readjust and work the extra estrogen out.
If you need there's a website where you can talk to a random doctor online (if you can't get in contact with your normal doctor) I believe it's called Second Opinion. It does take some time to get a response tho, like a couple days or so.</p></div>		</li>
