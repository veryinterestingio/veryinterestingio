			<div class="markdown"><p>In many cases though old drugs are being used because we are targeting treatment to the cancer and the old drug happens to be a good choice. </p>
<p>In 95 drug A might have been the &quot;best&quot; with drugs B, C, and D being fallbacks if A doesn't work well. Today, you will probably have your tumor sequenced and based on that a treatment is chosen. Sometimes that will still be A, sometimes one of the alternatives. So while the particular drug might be the same the protocol as a whole is greatly improved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Treatment isn't chosen on (only) sequencing data. You are right that it is increasingly targeted. But at the core of that is traditional histology and anatomical pathology. The tumor doesn't get to go into a machine and boom, best treatment comes out. The sample is processed, looked at in a microscope by an actual human doctor, classified and molecular tests ordered if adequate for the particular tumor type diagnosed. The aggregate of that information is used, in a particular clinical context, to choose the best therapeutic course - and that might include chemo, surgery and targeted therapy. Guidelines for this are based on the best available evidence (including clinical trials) and expert consensus. Oncology has progressed immensely and the tools at our disposal are much better than they once were. There's still a lot we don't know, however, and so we just go on experience and what seems to work best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Another great example is our first line of therapy for certain lymphomas, R-CHOP. The regimen still includes Doxorubicin, first approved in 1974. Current studies are trying to move newer therapies forward in the standard of care, though. Cell therapy has moved from &quot;last option&quot; to Third line, and is expected to move to Second line therapy with results from the Zuma-7 study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best case meaning cure with no side effects? For late stage cancers, we are very, very far from this ultimate goal. We cant even define how far away bc we really dont even have a good idea what this solution would look like. Today, we are just focused on buying late stage cancer patients time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the target- there are several competing platforms developing biologics for cancer and the therapies need to be designed for specific markers depending on the cancer (or genetic disorder). Many don't make it out of small-scale R&amp;D because the transgene or antibody won't work on that particular platform, and from there many don't make it to large-scale because there are unanticipated scaling factors. But some of them have been extremely promising and are becoming safer as our understanding of them improves. There's a lot of room for improvement; the manufacturing processes for some of these treatments have barely been characterized much less optimized at this point.</p>
<p>I work in process development at a biotech company that's researching and producing vectors used for gene therapy, which is a different approach than the monoclonal antibodies which the OP was probably talking about (although I've also manufactured those at a different company). Both of these processes involve using genetically engineered mammalian cells, and another similarity is that there is no shortage of clients trying new targets. Also, the FDA is very supportive of these approaches which helps a lot. Their scrutiny will intensify as more of these products make it to market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For things like NSCLC we have 3 or four small molecules for the most common mutations and pathways. For less common and more specific cancers it's maybe 1 or 2 then traditional chemo</p>
<p>Depending on the cancer this mean you can have 3 to 5 years per option of OS</p></div>		</li>
