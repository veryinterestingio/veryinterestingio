			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve actually had a portion of one of my fingers reattached. It has most of the feeling, but not all. The nerves also must have rerouted some too, because as they reconnected over time, they would “burn” for a few seconds as they reconnected, and then I’d have more feeling. Also, for a while, the feelings were messed up (e.g. smooth felt like cold).
The surgeon was actually impressed I got as much feeling back as I did. The worse the injury/damage, the less likely it’ll reconnect/feel in the future. They can’t always reconnect the nerves. And sometimes they Re-route through other nerves, or even regrow in unexpected ways.</p></div>		</li>
