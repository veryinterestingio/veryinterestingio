			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people explain e this way. I still find it’s hard to understand. 100% interest a year, but if you compound every 6 month, it’s not 100% a year any more is it? And I don’t know why but the 100% a year mean 50% every 6 months doesn’t seem intuitive to me since we’re doing exponent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you're confusing <em>interest rate</em> with <em>annual percentage yield</em>.  APY is how much you'll actually earn on an investment for a given interest rate that's compounded continuously.  Because of that, the actual amount of money you'll get back on an investment is usually higher than what the interest rate is.</p>
<p>In this context, the term &quot;compound&quot; essentially means</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when the bank calculates the interest payment on your investment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a bank offers you <strong>100%</strong> interest, <strong>compounded annually</strong>, they're saying, &quot;If you invest your money with us, we will give you <strong>100%</strong> more than the money you invested after one year.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$100 invested at 100% interest for 1 year= $100 interest paid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We then have an interest rate of 100% and an APY of 100%.</p>
<p>However, a bank could also offer you <strong>100%</strong> interest, <strong>compounded biannually.</strong>  Now you're getting <strong>half</strong> the interest rate <strong>every half year</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will give you <strong>100%</strong> more than the money you invested after one year.  We'll give you <strong>50%</strong> after six months, and another <strong>50%</strong> six months after that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Invest <strong>$100</strong> and after six months the bank will pay you <strong>50%</strong> of your annual rate, which means that you now have <strong>$150</strong>.  Now when the bank calculates the remaining <strong>50%</strong> they owe you, it won't just be on the original <strong>$100</strong> you invested, but will also include the <strong>$50</strong> they've already paid you for the first six months.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>$100</strong> invested at <strong>50%</strong> for the first half-year = <strong>$50</strong> paid to you.  You now have <strong>$150</strong> invested.</p>
<p><strong>$150</strong> invested at <strong>50%</strong> for the second half-year = <strong>$75</strong>.  You now have <strong>$100</strong> + <strong>$50</strong> + <strong>$75</strong> = <strong>$225</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of a 100% interest rate, we get an APY of 125%.</p></div>		</li>
