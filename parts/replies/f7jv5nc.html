			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, but once they cool to the temperature in the environment, they stop cooling? They can't get &quot;colder&quot; than the temp. (Like feeling windchill where humans feel colder than the actual temperature).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Windchill doesn’t affect temperature it affects rate of heat transfer. The car outside will get colder faster than in the garage. But eventually they’ll reach the same temp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some.  If it's 10C out, the car won't cool below 10C no matter how long it's out there.  However, if it's windy, it will cool down somewhat faster- but not all that much.  If the sun is out, a black car in 10C air could stay at 20C all afternoon.</p>
<p>Wind chill factors cools exposed, moisture-bearing skin MUCH more dramatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Objects left outside will pretty much match the temperature, with time.</p>
<p>Humans cannot afford to, hence the rate of heat loss is very important to us.</p></div>		</li>
