			<div class="markdown"><p>Added to this is the fact that the infant larynx is much much higher up than the adult. This mean that the entrance to the airway is tucked under the back to the tongue. As the infant swallows the airway is protected by the base of tongue as well as the epiglottis (the flap which covers the airway during swallowing) making it extra hard for infants to choke while swallowing. </p>
<p>As we age then, the larynx lowers and it becomes easier to choke, especially while lying down. Normal ageing also has a huge impact on the muscles involved in swallowing so as you enter old age the slight muscle wastage which is normal will result in slightly more coughing at meals. </p>
<p>The swallow is a highly coordinated response that intrigued me so much because the tiniest change or incorrect muscle movements can affect it so badly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert but I've heard it has to do with speech. The lowering of the layrynx is what allows us to make intricate sounds we know as language. Although, Before the lowering I believe Kids can swallow food and breathe at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of other things can go wrong too that increase the chance of swallowing wrong or of food / liquid coming back up even if it went down right the first time.</p>
<p>In addition to severe swallow problems like we may see after a stroke, sedatives for sleep or pain meds etc. may disrupt the swallow.  And acute illness, like with a bad pneumonia, may further worsen the safety of the swallowing mechanism - so hospitalized patients tend to be at higher risk of problems.</p>
<p>Even if the swallow is intact up higher,  problems with the esophagus can occur and include strictures (narrowing) keeping food from passing easily or other obstructive problems (potentially cancer). </p>
<p>In other cases a lack of the wave of contraction in the muscle or pouches in the esophagus that can collect food make it more difficult for food to go down correctly.  This occurs more often with age as well as with certain medical conditions like scleroderma.</p>
<p>Finally, problems with the connection between the esophagus and stomach can occur; this region  is supposed to keep food down once it's down.  In this case, swallowing is initially ok - but when lying down during or soon after, everything tries to come back up.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons - eating while upright and not lying down right afterwards is recommended in older individuals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parent of 3 here, I've always been told that babies shouldn't be made to drink lying down completely either, at least from a bottle, because of the risk of inhalation. When giving a bottle, you should always support the baby's head and upper back so it's in a reclining position. My babies didn't seem to like drinking bottles when lying on their backs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breastfeeder here, you are definitely correct and with breastfeeding it's often adviced to feed upright or with the head higher up than the nipple so the baby doesn't get waterboarded if you have a strong let down or the baby has bad reflux. That way they don't have to fight gravity and can just let it dribble out if it's too much. </p></div>		</li>
