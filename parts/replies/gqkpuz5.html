			<div class="markdown"><p>My colleagues will reply after 2pm, but I suspect there will be lots of questions, so I will take some now. </p>
<p>The answer is studies have not been done (but are badly needed) on the effect of these medications on the microbiome, nor on how the microbiome affects drug uptake and efficacy. I suspect drug companies are reluctant to fund these because if their products are influenced in a major way, they would have to go back and perform studies to then identify who would benefit the most and least from the drugs. </p>
<p>Before that happens, we need to get to grips with what's really going on in the microbiome. Just sequencing DNA is not enough. Even showing what they produce is insufficient, albeit an advance. Nobody has the same microbiome yet most of us live okay. So there must be different organisms that take on similar tasks. I recently published a paper <a href="https://www.lidsen.com/journals/hg/hg-05-01-055" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.lidsen.com/journals/hg/hg-05-01-055" target="_blank">https://www.lidsen.com/journals/hg/hg-05-01-055</a></a> urging studies to be done to identify pairings, co-dependencies and how organisms associate with each other. I think this will get to the crux of the matter with how the organisms function, why some are associated with diseases like Crohn's, and how we design interventions. For example, disrupting some co-associations to alleviate bad outcomes or integrating a beneficial strain into an existing coaggregate to alleviate symptoms and signs of disease. </p>
<p>I am not a physician and would not relay any medical advice on depression and disease. I will try to discuss if and how microbes might play a role in depression later. </p>
<p>I hope that answers your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the question! There are a few studies that look at correlations between human microbiota composition and usage of some of these drugs with varying specificity (e.g &quot;antidepressants&quot; vs. &quot;SSRIs&quot; vs. a specific drug). The short answer is...they very likely have some effect, but we don't know exactly how these effects play out in the real world. We know some microbes are directly sensitive to certain SSRIs, some microbes can breakdown certain some of these drugs, and some microbes likely have a more complicated interaction with these drugs (e.g. binding to a drug but not degrading it, altering associated symptoms or side effects, drug affecting some other aspects of the overall community, etc.)</p>
<p>As for serotonin, this actually relates directly to my work! The gut microbiota stimulates production of serotonin in the gastrointestinal tract, where most of the body's serotonin is made (some of it then circulates through the rest of the body). The bacterium I work on, <em>Turicibacter sanguinis</em>, benefits from a high serotonin environment, is sensitive to the active component of Prozac (an SSRI), and is part of the group of bacteria that can stimulate serotonin production. Other bacteria can make or degrade neurotransmitter/neuroactive molecules like GABA, dopmaine, and tryptamine.</p>
<p>Inflammation can definitely have an effect on microbiota diversity, both by changing the  nutrient and chemical composition of the gastrointestinal tract, and by changing the way the microbiota interacts with the immune system. There is a lot of variation between people, so this isn't always easy to predict, but the microbiota is an ecosystem; it can be resilient to certain types of interference, but large enough (or small specific) disruptions can have major impacts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do we know whether the neurotransmitters produced by the gut microbiome can cross the BBB (thus produce CNS effects)? I thought part of the reason why we can't just take 'serotonin pill' or 'dopamine pill' is that they do not reach the CNS to act as a neurotransmitter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurotransmitters produced in the periphery are generally thought to be in a separate pool than those in the CNS. However, certain precursors like L-Dopa, both can cross the BBB, and can be modified by the microbiota, so there can still be semi-direct microbiota-neurotransmitter-CNS connections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi u/metronomicon.<br />
I agree with u/Suspicious_Dinner_31 that more studies on this topic are definitely merited. I have seen some research to suggest that SSRIs can potentially increase the diversity of the gut microbiota, which is generally affiliated with health. However, there is little comprehensive research on which populations of microbes are specifically affected and how this mechanistically impacts health or mood.   </p>
<p>With regard to inflammation, however, there is a definitive correlation between inflammation and the microbiome. In animal studies, we've seen that the relationship appears to be reciprocal: inflammation can impact the microbiota, as can the microbiota impact the immune system.   </p>
<p>In general, microbes can modify foods we eat into metabolites that affect our biology. One of the most researched examples is fiber, which gets converted by the microbiota into short chain fatty acids (SCFA) that do a mountain of important things. Butyrate, one of the SCFAs, is anti-inflammatory on multiple levels, from helping firm up the barrier of the gut, to affecting immune cell metabolism and gene expression, to changing the fate of naive immune cells into a more anti-inflammatory cell type.   </p>
<p>At the same time, inflammatory signals can work against those benefits in numerous ways. One of these is changing surface protein expression on colon cells in a way that changes the pH. This pH change can impact which bacteria survive, including those that are able to break down fiber. At a higher pH, even surviving fiber fermenters may not create anti-inflammatory SCFA as efficiently, whereas some pathogens like C. diff operate more effectively at that higher pH. Inflammation can also break down the protective mucus barrier in the gut (the structure is also pH sensitive) that keeps normal bacteria a safe distance away, and can cause unwanted contact that exacerbates the inflammation.   </p>
<p>Depression is affiliated with inflammation as well. Some circulating pro-inflammatory signals (IL-6 and CRP) have been associated with depressive symptoms in humans. Depression is also affiliated with a loss of neurogenesis in a brain region called the hippocampus, which one recent animal study showed could be improved by supplementation with certain microbes. However, we still have a lot to learn about the mechanisms and causality, and certainly much more to study clinically before we can make definitive claims.   </p>
<p>I am not medically trained and cannot offer medical advice, but I hope you find this informative. All the best.</p></div>		</li>
