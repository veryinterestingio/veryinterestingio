			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting too that there’s a bit of a distraction/placebo effect going on for major joints (like knee pain/back pain). Ointments don’t “penetrate” deeply enough to actually affect the joint itself, but because pain is such a weird and multifaceted aspect of human experience, the cream’s overstimulation affect on your dermal (skin) nerves can be helpful for taking the edge off the nearby deeper joint pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe.</p>
<p>CBD is in a weird area where it <em>does</em> have medicinal properties but there's so much hype and marketing surrounding such little data it's hard to know for sure what's actually happening until there's more non-bias studies done.</p>
<p>Of course that's due to the fact cannabis is so illegal you can't even use it for medicinal studies so there's not a whole lot of hard evidence proving it helps more than a placebo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother has rheumatoid arthritis extremely bad in her hands and elbows. She would have days where she couldn't use her hands without debilitating pain. She had it under control with certain medications but she had to stop taking them because it started to cause issues with her blood tests. They gave her prednisone but she said it did nothing for bad days. Personally I thought the CBD thing was BS but she tried everything else and as a hail mary I bought her some cream. She was skeptical too but within an hour she said it started working. She said it doesn't stop all the pain but it makes a bad day into a day she can use her hands almost normally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I hurt my knee, my orthopedist gave me a topical NSAID called Pennsaid. Man did that stuff work. I’d just rub some on my skin and like 15 minutes later the pain was gone. I need to get a prescription for it again because that stuff is awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aspirin is unique in that it is a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor (aka COX inhibitor). There are 2 types of COX enzymes that are involved with the mechanisms of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs): COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin is non-selective in that it inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 and COX-2 lead to two different pathways of prostaglandins and products of those prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are hormones that are associated with inflammation, tissue healing, and homeostasis. </p>
<p>COX-1 leads to a pathway resulting in TXA2 (thromboxane A2).
TXA2 stimulates the activation of platelets aka blood clotting and also vasoconstricts (narrows/tightens your blood vessels).</p>
<p>COX-2 leads to a pathway resulting in PGI2 (prostacyclin). Prostacyclin inhibits platelets (stops blood from clotting) and promotes vasodilation. </p>
<p>However, aspirin is slightly more selective for inhibiting COX-1. So, most importantly aspirin is inhibiting platelet aggregation (blood clotting) and vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). This makes sense because we know aspirin is used to prevent heart attacks aka blood clots in the heart in constricted vessel walls. Yet at the same time, aspirin is inhibiting a pathway of vasodilation aka inflammation. This makes sense because we know aspirin is used for pain resulting from inflammation. </p>
<p>ELI10: Aspirin inhibits two pathways in the body. One path is responsible for blood clotting and one path is responsible for inflammation. Aspirin blocks both of these paths stopping the blood from clotting so that it prevents heart attacks and at the same time it is shrinking swollen blood vessels that cause pain. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biofreeze came out over 20 years ago. For some dumb reason, its developers wanted it to be &quot;from the PT only&quot;...instead of available over the counter.</p>
<p>It was just as good then as it is now...apparently they have a new sales team now.</p></div>		</li>
