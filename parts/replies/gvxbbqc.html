			<div class="markdown"><p>Toothpaste pumps were all the rage for like two years in the early/mid-80s. They weren’t aerosol pumps though, you’d push a button on the top and the base of the pump would move up and push the toothpaste out the top. So they were kind of a hybrid pump/tube I guess.</p></div>		</li>
