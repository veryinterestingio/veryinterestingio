			<div class="markdown"><p>For some guesses now, first the next 300 years will see a weaker protection from solar radiation.
Around then there will pop up multiple poles around the world, compasses won't be very useful, may see auroras all over the world!
(auroras happen near the poles as solar radiation kind of pools there.)</p>
<p>Then for 3000 years it'll chill like that. Moving poles, multiple ones, weak radiation protection (not so much lethal). Maybe mess up some communications, no compasses.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the last part of that period, things will slow down, moving more and more of those poles to the tips where they are now, and eventually they'll be flipped. South up top, north at the bottom.</p>
<p>I can't for the life of me remember which video it was, saw it just a day or two ago. I want to say it was nat Geo, and yeah. It was a very interesting possibility. They're able to measure the shifts in the past due to polarity of volcano expulsions in the past past. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the other cool things is that with the moving poles, iirc, we would see features like the Aurora borealis all over the place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Seeing as they only happen close to the poles, if we have &quot;poles&quot; everywhere, that's like 300 to 2500 years of auroras everywhere.</p>
<p>Generations will live with lights and no compasses... Can you imagine? From when we discovered compasses to now. But the other way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More often than that sometimes, and sometimes not nearly that often.  The duration between reversals is <em>highly</em> variable and not a predictable cycle.  The most recent reversal was about 780000 years ago, but some periods are only 10000 years or less apart, and normal or reversed periods can last for millions to tens of millions of years.</p></div>		</li>
