			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, brushing time significantly improves plaque removal regardless of brush used. This study from 1993 compared three different electric toothbrushes to a manual toothbrush with different brushing times: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,26&qsp=2&q=electric+toothbrush+plaque&qst=ib#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DBCAlW5QET_8J" target="_blank">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,26&qsp=2&q=electric+toothbrush+plaque&qst=ib#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DBCAlW5QET_8J</a></p>
<p>While the details of specific brushes from 27 years ago aren't really meaningful, the key message is that brushing for long enough (30 seconds per quadrant or 2 minutes total) is more important than choosing the &quot;right&quot; toothbrush but also that an electric toothbrush outperforms a manual toothbrush used for the same amount of time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a key point that gets ignored a lot by patients.  They look for the newest or &quot;best&quot; toothpastes and toothbrushes, when in reality, you can do a lot better plaque removal by just brushing for longer.  I can't bring up the study but iirc patients brush their teeth for an average of 43 seconds.  That's about 1/3 the necessary time.  </p>
<p>Want better oral hygiene?  Brush longer.  Like a lot longer.  Remember, two minutes is the MINIMUM time to brush.  Patients in braces, patients with a history of gum disease, patients prone to cavities, patients with dexterity problems, etc will need longer.  </p>
<p>Any electric toothbrush worth a damn will have a two minute timer as part of it.</p></div>		</li>
