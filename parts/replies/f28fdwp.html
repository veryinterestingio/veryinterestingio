			<div class="markdown"><p>This one really hit home for me as my ex is someone with BPD. Just wish I had known she had it, because she never told me, maybe she was scared I wouldn’t see her in the same way if she did. At the time at didn’t even know what BPD was, literally never heard of it, I did however know something was up based on the way she behaved sometimes.</p>
<p>Sometimes when we would be out at a club, drinking and then going home it was either ”I hate you and you hate me” or ”you’re the best thing that ever happened to me”, maybe it would have helped if I had known but it was so scary how she could go from one person to another in just a few minutes , and that I always had the feeling I was in the wrong.
As I’ve learned more about BPD though it has explained a lot of what she did, but heard someone say that a disorder can help explain a behaviour, but not excuse it. (It is worth mentioning that she didn’t get treatment for it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for sharing.  I have an ex-friend, I'm fairly confident she had BPD.  I totally feel the &quot;ride the wave then calm them down&quot; because that's about all that worked with her.  I was overly tolerant because she was young, her parents had passed, her brother was killed and she had no family.  It was sad, I was a few years older and had a good support system so I tried to help as much as I could.</p>
<p>Then I got chronically ill and couldn't accompany her on her binge drinking tirades and random whims of &quot;I need to buy a house today....&quot; she dropped me like a ton of bricks.  It was intense, at least a 3 page email one day detailing what a terrible person I was to her.  So I was in and out of ERs with crazy intense pain (endometriosis) and she was angry because I abandoned her?</p>
<p>It was impulsive and dumb on her part (hence why I think BPD is a contender) because our husbands (I introduced her to her husband) have been best friends since childhood; and they were in a touring band together and we work in the same creative field.  I saw her a few more times before we moved away, and she just seemed sad.  I pretended like nothing happened and was friendly just because I always felt there was something up with her.</p>
<p>My husband's band ended up ghosting him after using a touring musician to fill in on a tour; I'm convinced she did/said something.  I have zero control over what people think of us, so we just let the the whole thing go.  </p>
<p>Anyway, it was a really rough experience for us.  Thinking about BPD and her childhood trauma actually really helped me understand.  You actually provided me with a moment of healing, I feel like I can really let the whole thing go now.  It was really hard to not take it all personally, but now I just feel bad for her....not bad enough to reach out, but bad enough to not hold it against her.</p></div>		</li>
