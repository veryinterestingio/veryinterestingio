			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the body doesn't &quot;know&quot; as in it doesn't make a yea or nay decision. Rather it's evolved to ignore a variety of substances and proteins, and attacks pretty much anything else. Most of these attacks are quite minor, only in certain cases do we get the full immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a few problems with your answer.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You say of an antigen, &quot;typically these are chemicals that bind to our invade your body.&quot; That is not the case.  This is anything which an antibody or B cell receptor can bind to, including self proteins.  This is particular important in autoimmune diseases or areas of immune privilege, and there is a process to limit these from harming ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think your order of antigen &quot;causing an immune response&quot; is slightly out of order.  The receptor will have two parts, a light and heavy part, with random &quot;tips&quot; that have the heavy and light part put together so those two random tips make a random 3-dimensional cup.  This is not in response to anything, but rather a process that is always going on.  There are billions of these combinations, theoretically up to like 10^10-12 combinations.  And they are always being made, waiting for their antigen, whether it exists or not.  Through a process with the T cell, there is positive feedback once the antigen is introduced.  But, all the pieces are likely already in play somewhere in the body rather than in response to the antigen, as I think you were suggesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You said &quot;bind to or invade your cell.&quot; This process is typically extracellular, as we have another system in place for intracellular recognition of antigen fragments with T cells.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What antigens we react to it a product of thymic education, or the T cells.  A very important part of that is hereditary through the MHC system, but we do not have the billions of combinations of fragments coded into us.  Again, this is another process of randomly combining pieces and getting the right combination of binding to these fragments, but not binding to us.  Again, this can have problems, this fragment is not always foreign, so that is not part of a strict definition.  </p>
</li>
<li>There are probably unlimited antigens once you start counting the 3-dimensional shapes, not thousands.  As I mentioned earlier, we can make something like 10^10-12  receptor combinations.</li>
</ol>
<p>I do agree that the shape, as it fits in that 3D pocket is a very key part, and as more cells are made, &quot;better fitting&quot; versions are selected for so that the binding gets better and better.</p>
<p>Sorry if this seemed overly critical.  It was the top response, and I wanted to take a second since many people are likely to see this first</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, I was going for an easy to understand, simple answer. Absolutely worth noting antigens also include non-foreign chemicals in your body, but of course in the absence of things like autoimmune diseases, the chemistry of your body means the immune systems &quot;learns&quot; to not react against these.</p>
<p>Also I think worth noting just because I may not have explained this part very well - things like viruses and bacteria contain many different antigens, as they are complex chemical structures (and in the case of bacteria, many times more chemically complex than a virus), a &quot;whole&quot; virus isn't a single antigen to the immune system.</p></div>		</li>
