			<div class="markdown"><p>Speakers don't vibrate actually (well most of them), they &quot;pulse&quot;. Imagine taking a bed sheet and pulling it SUPER tight. If you flick the center of it, the whole thing kinda wobbles in and out around that center point. Or... how dropping a marble into a pond creates ripples in the pond.</p>
<p>Speakers do that, but REALLY fast, to produce the waves that make up sound. Coincidentally, this is also how active noise cancellation works - you measure the waves incoming, then product waves that cancel them out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The confusing part is timbre. What about a sax vs a voice? playing the same note, how does the speaker make em sound different? the answer is a saxophone sounds like a saxophone because of all the other frequencies that play (at varying amplitudes but all lower than the main note) besides the main one when you make a note. Thatâ€™s different from a voice and is why the voice sounds different. the speaker replicates that, not quite perfectly, but well enough that we can very easily tell the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you imagine the sound gets broken up into frequencies like the keys on a keyboard, and it sends through how loud to play each key at once in order to make the sound at each point in time, then replays it back as a sound clip. </p>
<p>It's not entirely perfect, but pretty much close enough - but the difference is why some people prefer things like records, which are a lot closer to the original.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends if you're talking about analog or digial audio signals.</p>
<p>Multiple voices are just individual waveforms summed together. The final waveform is a single signal that needs to be transmitted down the wire.</p>
<p>In analog that signal is directly sent down the wire, so the voltage directly matches the signal of the final waveform and can be &quot;read&quot; back at the other end. This signal can drive a speaker to output the same signal back.</p>
<p>In digital you also have a adc (analog to digital converter), which converts the analog signal into a stream of digital data. That data are just a stream of numbers (in binary) which sample (inspect the value of a signal at any given time) the signal at a specific rate i.e 48,000hz (48,000 times a second). By sending those samples down the wire (as binary digits), a dac (digital to analog converter) at the other end of the wire can convert the samples back into an analog stream which can also drive a speaker.</p>
<p>The advantage of digital signals is they are less impacted by line interference (external unwanted signals can modify a signal as it travels down the wire), because slightly modulating a digital signal doesnt often impact wether it will detect a 1 or 0 in binary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To slightly add to your understanding of fibre optics - optical fibres are rarely plastic unless they're cheap and only over a short distance. Plastic fibres have much too high attenuation and can't really support long distances.</p>
<p>The glass that optical fibres are made from is extremely pure, and extremely thin. Both of these factors let it be flexible. We think of glass as hard and brittle, but when it's measured in micrometers, it is very flexible. The vast majority of the diameter of an optical fibre is cladding material (which can be plastic) which protects the fibre inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting, I never imagined the fibres are made from glass, i thought it to be some kind of polymer. I find it cool that the thin glass flexes instead of shatters, like what you would typically expect from something like a glass stirring rod at a lab. Happy cake day!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets even cooler. Without any additional gear, we can transmit that light up to 80km end to end, but if you want to go further you can use Raman or Erbium-doped amplification and essentially &quot;boost&quot; the light carrying the data by using a photon pump which excites the low energy light to a higher energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>in computers all data is already in the form of ones and zeros, so you just transmit it raw</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For ELI5 I guess this is close enough, but if you want to be picky, it's not just the raw 1s and 0s. Any data transfer protocol is also adding it's own packaging, and there can also be data encoding happening at different levels.</p>
<p>One can imagine this as, instead of sending an entire book, we rip out the individual pages and make a couple of copies in different colors (data encoding, to make the transfer more resitant against interference) and stick those color copies in envelopes with an address and a page number on the outside (packaging).</p></div>		</li>
