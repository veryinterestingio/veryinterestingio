			<div class="markdown"><p>Some parasites rely on the death of their host to complete their life cycles. Is it possible that rabies is spread in part due to other animals eating the remains of an afflicted victim?</p>
<p>We’ve never heard of rabies becoming extinct or even close. Perhaps, rabies is doing exactly what’s necessary when it leads to the death of its hosts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are certainly parasites that exhibit some more complex life histories, requiring two or even more unique hosts in order to complete their life cycles. However things like viruses, including the rabies virus (which is an RNA virus) typically don't have a multi-host strategy. I believe there is some risk associated with eating animal tissue infected with rabies, but the highest risk would be in nervous and salivary tissue where the virus resides so not something most carnivores would snack on.</p>
<p>Since the main form of transmission is via biting/saliva I think from the rabies point of view it would be best to keep the animal alive and producing the virus for as long as possible, increasing it's chances to infect others. An animal that dies within a few days does not present the same ability to transmit the disease. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The destructive effects may be required however. If you can shorten the lifetime of a host by half, but increase aggression and chance of transmission three or four fold, this may be the good evolutionary adaptation. </p></div>		</li>
