			<div class="markdown"><p>The button was probably used for other symbols. We now use alt-gr (or option on mac) that allows a third symbol for the same key, something not possible on a typewriter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think for a mechanical typewriter it would be a lot more complex than just adding a simple button. It would need the entire mechanism to move an additional arm that needs to be added to the already numerous arms and it would require them to realign the entire thing. This might also cause more chances of the arms hitting each other (i think this was a big part of how qwerty came to be and how some of the countries close to me still think azerty is the way to go)</p></div>		</li>
