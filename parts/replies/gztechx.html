<p>Do they actively do this? If so how have they learnt that this is something they should do? Hard to put 2 and 2 together, rotating eggs and birth defects</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's usually a few eggs that maybe never got fertilized. Some chicks develop and never make it to hatching. Some chicks can't get out of the egg. I'm sure in a controlled environment I could do better but I only hatch about 60-70%. That's free range cage free.</p></div>		</li>
