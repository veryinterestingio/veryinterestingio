			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you make the case that your decision to sell the stock was not a result of the MNPI and it wasn’t your fault that someone imposed MNPI upon you for a stock that you were holding - that you would have sold it anyway?</p>
<p>Seems like if a trader has an active portfolio and a buddy sends him a text with MNPI about a stock the trader is holding, he shouldn’t then be obligated to hold it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about what can be argued for or against in court at some point, but the trader would have to make a very very good case as to why he chose not only to sell his position at the time he did, but also why he decided to hold it in the first place; not only that but the regulators and prosecutors will go through his or her entire trading history and start looking for patterns of transactions that stick out of the ordinary (this sort of things are done automatically and in real time nowadays too). In the end the court decides and they arent known to be very lenient.</p>
<p>Modern financial systems have data links to most their regulators (in the US it would be the SEC, FINRA, etc..) that automatically report transaction and quote data. In case of insider trading, the most critical point of a prosecution is usually that different people did the same kind of transactions around the same time while the bulk of the population did not; this detection is also done in real time and as far as I know it works really well. Of course if only one person benefits from a particular instance of insider trading it is useless, but people are greedy...</p></div>		</li>
