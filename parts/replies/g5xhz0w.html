			<div class="markdown"><p>This^. A lot of waste from developed countries are sent to developing countries in shiploads of trash to be manually segregated by poorer people because it is more economical. </p>
<p>There's been some drama between SEAsian nations and Canada a few years back. A lot of times that &quot;recyclable&quot;  (in parentheses cuz often times, it is more toxic than recyclable) trash is sold to shady, unliscensed companies and ends up trashing poor communiylties in the developing countries instead.</p></div>		</li>
