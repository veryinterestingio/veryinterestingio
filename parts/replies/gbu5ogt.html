			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol believe me no one was more surprised than me that it worked. I spent 8 years on a ship in the coast guard so it’s second nature to me and I’ve known plenty of people that didn’t even take to it this fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem is one of perspective.  For instance I always have a hard time when someone says the left or right side of an object you're facing.  is the right side of my desk my right side, or the right side as if from it's perspective.  Once you start driving, I think saying driver/passenger side is more clear for one thing, which is probably why port/starboard is also easier.  </p>
<p>I also always have to think a second or two and do the calculation when talking about someone that's facing me, their left side is on my right.</p></div>		</li>
