			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer is phenomenal. But the other part of their question for the Colorado river carving up the southwest, it has to deal with the type of rock it goes through and the timescale which it had to act on that rock. And these would be some of the differences why you don't see a Grand Canyon from the Amazon or Nile. I don't know enough to expand on the differences of what causes canyon growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canyons do not form due to rock type alone, they require relatively rapid rock uplift (or base level fall). The morphology and topographic evolution of the canyon is in part controlled by the type of rock (and specifically the presence of contrasts in resistance to erosion in nearly horizontal layers), but without rapid, relative uplift, a canyon will not form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the overall slope have anything to do with it too? The Colorado drops 2 miles over 1450 miles (.0013 slope) whereas the Amazon drops 3 over 4000 (.00075) and the Nile drops 2 over 4100 (.00048)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so I know I understand this. You are saying that canyons are formed due to having a bunch of different layers of rock that are no long laying flat on top of each other, like pancakes, but are now vertical/angled, like a layer cake slice flopped on its side?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to sound like a 4 year old, but why? What does uplift have to do with erosion rates? </p>
<p>I listened to Nick Zentners podcast, and he said something similar. What I think I don't understand is which processes make erosion go faster? Will uplift increase the potential energy of the water and therefore increase erosion? Is it the rate of water flow, amount of water flow, that dictates erosion rates? Or do you need uplift to keep the river at the same location in space and this keeps the erosion at a high rate? I'm grasping at straws, and don't want an answer to these questions, only how erosion rates work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the Nile does have a Grand Canyon… or should I say did have. During the Messinian salinity crisis (when the Straits of Gibraltar closed and the Mediterranean Sea dried up, creating a desert over 10,000 feet below sea level in places) there was a canyon 8,000 feet deep where Cairo now stands. It silted back up from delta deposits after the sea refilled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I go to the Grand Canyon whenever I can. The thing with the canyon is that the river doesn’t just carve through a flat area and happened to carve a deep canyon; it flows through the Kaibab Plateau which was a result of uplift. You can drive US89 past the east side of the plateau and you’ll see it pretty clearly. You’d be around 5000 feet elevation while driving there, but the east side of the plateau tops out at around 7500 feet. At Lees Ferry, the starting point of Grand Canyon National Park on the Colorado River, the elevation at river level is 3100 feet. By the time the river gets to Unkar Rapids, in the same area as the eastern part of the plateau, the river elevation is a little over 2600 feet. 7500 feet minus 2600 feet equals a lot of rock to be carved through. The uplift created an area where if a river found its way through, it would have to carve a deep, deep canyon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your post.</p>
<p>A lot of the Colorado drainage area is desert. If it had more rainfall, would that make the Colorado river bigger, or would there be more rivers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite likely both. A new river in the Colorado's drainage basin is likely to end up flowing into the Colorado.</p></div>		</li>
