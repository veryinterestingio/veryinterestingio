Skin and muscle becoming more rigid and decreased barometric pressure make it more painful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fair bit of research using the cold pressor test (holding one's hand in ice water) seems to indicate a causal increase in blood pressure.</p>
<p>> Most patients responded to the cold pressor test with statistically significant increase in diastolic blood pressure than systolic blood pressure. There was 12.10% rise in systolic blood pressure and 16.02% rise in diastolic blood pressure with 23.09 % rise in heart rate.</p>

<p>Not to discount the effect of barometric pressure, but irrespective of weather conditions feeling cold increases the sensation of pain.</p></div>		</li>
