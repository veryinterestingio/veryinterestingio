			<div class="markdown"><p>The V2 rockets that were launched by the Nazis at Britain were designed by Werner Von Braun, who was shipped to the US as part of Operation Paperclip. He went on to develop the Redstone Rocket and became the chief architect of the Saturn V. </p>
<p>And even much more Modern space rockets are still ICBMs, or very close to them. The Soyuz used by the Russians is a derivative of the R-7, the world’s first ICBM (which also was hacked together to launch Sputnik).
Even the space shuttle’s design team had huge influence from the Air Force, who wanted it to be able to put up military satellites, and I’m sure that companies like SpaceX will have had similar conversations in the design process of their launch vehicles. </p>
<p>Then there’s the fact that Hubble is one of many similarly classed telescopes in space - it’s just the only one that doesn’t look back down to Earth. </p>
<p>Modern space exploration is still hugely funded/influenced by the military.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the above. Some people saw it as exploration, research, etc... Many others saw it as a proxy for the battle between Capitalism and Communism. It was definitely more than just science, so a snooty view one can take of the whole thing is to characterize it as just a pissing match.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people were absolutely into it because of the science and research and technology.  </p>
<p>But just look at Kennedy's 'We choose to go to the Moon' speech -- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But why, some say, the Moon?  We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon... We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one <strong>we intend to win</strong>, and the others, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth noting, he was harping so hard on the decision to land on the moon because Russia, which was perceived as being more technologically advanced than us in terms of the space race, was very likely going to beat us to a space station and orbiting the moon.  They were much further from actually landing on the moon, so America had the best chance (because they had the most time) to beat them to that specific goal.  </p>
<p>The US government and the wider public absolutely wanted to win and be first.  Any technology or research that happened was an adjacent benefit for most people.  Remember, at the time, the entire country lived in constantly low grade fear of the Cold War becoming not-cold.  Being more technologically advanced (the space race was really just an extension of the arms race) was kind of... comforting.  Or reassuring. </p>
<p>I mean, if it were just about advancement of research, we would have been working together from the beginning.  And we definitely, definitely weren't.  It was always presented as winning and losing against the Soviets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's also why we stopped going to the moon.  Once we had gotten to the moon and figured out the Soviets weren't going to the moon, interest waned since the competition was 'won.'  </p>
<p>Things would have been very different if the Soviets had been first to the moon.  We'd still probably have a base on the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know. Being the first private corporation to land on the moon would be one for history. Recording / Streaming it with modern technology would amazing to see and generate a massive amount of interest and support for Space-X and space programs in general.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s fair to dismiss the relevance and potential that replicating the moon landing today could generate. You may very well inspire an entirely new generation of astronauts and scientists. Current generations are more plugged in to science than ever before and yet the best thing NASA has done in our lifetimes is make a music video on the ISS.</p></div>		</li>
