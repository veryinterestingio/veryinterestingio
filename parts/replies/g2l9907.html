			<div class="markdown"><p>If we had one simple direct method, it would be less effective because thirst is not the only thing the renin-angiotensinogen (RAS)  system regulates, it also regulates electrolyte balance and vascular resistance. Also the mineralcorticoid hormone aldosterone can also be involved in this pathway, the renin-angiontensinogen-aldosterone system (RAAS). Aldosterone promotes higher levels of sodium in the blood and for more potassium to be excreted in the urine. Because the volume of blood as well as salts and others fluctuate, I think it makes sense to have a network of different systems that can effectively control the levels of them. It is also much easier to compensate for one failed part (excess aldosterone can be controlled with ACE inhibitors) than have a whole direct system fail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! That's really interesting. I'm fascinated how such a simple process such as osmosis can lead to a conscious urge to go and fill up a glass of water! I assume this is one of our senses? Do you know if there is a specific name for it (maybe something along the lines of osmoception...?) if it is categorised as a sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems simple but it is tightly regulated! A mere 1% increase in blood osmolarity will signal thirst and motivate us to drink water. Inhibition occurs at roughly 2% decrease. I do not believe there is a specific term for it and it is not classified as one of the major senses.</p>
<p>I think one of the most interesting aspects of thirst is that it is terminated by sensory cues in our oral cavity (oropharynx). Have you noticed that when you are thirsty, when you drink that initial cup of water, you are instantly satiated? There is quite a delay for the water to be fully absorbed into the blood, and you are satiated before there are changes in blood osmolarity or volume. This is because the oral cavity sends information to the subfornical neurons and they estimate and anticipate how much water is needed to hydrate the body. </p>
<p>One of the aspects of the information that is sent is temperature. It is known that cooler substances and carbonation are better at quenching thirst than warm, non-carbonated drinks. Mouth cooling alone can inhibit thirst neurons, and current research is trying to further figure out the relationship of these kinds of cues and thirst. </p>
<p>During my residency, we used to give ice chips for patients to suck on with fluid restricted diets or with dysphagia (cannot swallow) to satiate thirst. If you ever end up in the hospital and have problems with your esophagus, and they give you ice chips, now you'll know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That termination of thirst is quite neat, and it has just reminded me of something I thought of while eating supper just now. I was wondering if you might know why we often get thirsty while eating? Is this simply because there is a sudden rise in blood sugar/salt levels, and so the same mechanism you explained earlier works, or... I thought this may not be triggered by osmolarity, but instead potentially something to do with tasting food/salt/sugar, and so signals are sent to the brain telling you to drink (either in anticipation of changing osmolarity of blood, or maybe to make digestion easier??). Or alternatively receptors in your oesophagus/somewhere in your gut sense you have food, and therefore tell you to drink water (for the same reasons I just mentioned).
(Sorry if my terminology isn't correct/good, I'm not exactly an expert in biology - although I hope to study it at university!)</p></div>		</li>
