<p>Modern computers do more and more in parallel. Not just from having multiple cores, but also from handling multiple instructions in parallel in one core. A large part of the logic in a processor is used to handle that without conflicts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And FYI as an electronic hobbyist I can tell you the base microprocessor (read it as a small computer) usually go up to 20 MHZ nowday and is available for like 1$ on single quantity - and this is because you buy one that can be reprogrammed, a &quot;decent&quot; amount of memory and with other features. Otherwise I saw youtuber finding genuine microcontrollers for like 0.10$...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens nowadays is that there are 3 or 4 flight computers,  every one of which is running the same calculations simaltainiously. The outcome of every calculations  is checked against the other 3 computers, and then it's majority rules. The chances of one computer miscalculating are very low to begin with. The chance of 3 messing up is almost unfathomably low, resulting in a very very high accuracy rating.</p>
<p>As for the 1960s, the capabilities of the flight computer were very limited, so it wasn't used for any th ing near as much as the computers would be today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>then you have the Byzantines coming in, telling the other 3 computers a different answer and watch them all get confused. I think a system can tolerate n machines doing that if they have 3n+1 machines (which with 4 computers will be able to find out who the 1 imposter among us is)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Saturn 5's had 4 guidance computers. During the entire project, the computers while in flight or testing had a max of 5 times when the computers didn't match. None of the errors were considered to be major and the computers immediately performed their error handling and used the computed value that &quot;made the most sense to it&quot;. </p>
<p>I think I would say that I would prefer to use the logic/algorithms they used but on modern hardware.</p></div>		</li>
