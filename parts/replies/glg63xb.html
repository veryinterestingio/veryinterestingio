			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, it's not that wild Junglefowl are more efficient; it's just that they are laying fewer eggs. Domestic Chickens continue to lay eggs as long as you keep taking their eggs away. If you let the chicken keep her eggs, then she will stop laying once she has a full clutch, and will start to incubate the eggs she has until they hatch. So if you don't take the eggs from your chicken, then she won't need as much calcium (because she'll stop laying).</p></div>		</li>

<p>YMMV, depending on chicken. A lot of breeds (heritage and commercial both) have been intentionally bred to have little brooding instinct. So if you have a breed that's very prone to not going broody, they'll usually keep laying no matter how many eggs are in their spot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good luck catching them. Here in Singapore they're an endemic species (well, mostly hybrids with domestic breeds). There's a flock that hangs around my neighborhood and it's testament to their cunning and evasiveness that the five or six cats that live here hardly ever manage to catch any.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs to be the top answer! The real chicken does not needs that much. The domesticated franken-chicken needs so much calcium they get fed ground up sea shells (not part of a chicken-in-nature's diet) and still they have a lot of bone fractures later in their short life due to calcium depletion.</p>
<p>Please consider not paying for this cruel industry! Tnx</p></div>		</li>
