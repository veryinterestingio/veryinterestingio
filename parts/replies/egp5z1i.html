			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in heavy drinkers, the abrupt discontinuation of drinking (AKA ceasing the artificial supply of excess GABA-activity to the brain) can cause moderate to serious withdrawal symptoms, ranging from sweating, anxiety, and tremors, to visual disturbances, altered mental status, seizure, delirium tremens, and coma. </p>
<p>This is because GABA is inhibitory in our brain and slows us down, and so when we drink excessively, your brain up-regulates the opposite neurotransmitter, glutamate, in order to try to balance things out with excitatory activity. When you stop giving your brain extra GABA, aka alcohol, the excitatory glutamate activity takes over and can cause life-threatening symptoms. </p>
<p>People who are addicted to alcohol or heavy users also can be heavily vitamin deficient, especially in folic acid and b vitamins such as b12 and thiamine, which may lead to anemias or other more serious issues. When people come into the hospital with heavy alcohol use history, we always give them thiamine. Usually also b12, folate, and  a benzodiazepine like Ativan that ya simile effects on the brain to alcohol to help reduce the likelihood of complications from withdrawal. </p>
<p>People don’t realize you can die from alcohol withdrawal. Even withdrawing from something like heroin is much “safer” by comparison, not usually life threatening, albeit extremely uncomfortable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother's withdrawal was so horrible. He had a collapsed lung and had to be admitted to the hospital where he quickly went into  withdrawal. Long story short, they had to put him in a medically induced coma because the usual benzodiazapines and Librium weren't working and he was still having seizures. It was pretty grim. He had to be there for a month,all told. Stayed sober for a year then went back to drinking</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a family member who was a long time (10yr+) drinker and decided to quit cold turkey.</p>
<p>5 days in and they started having visual hallucations of giant bugs crawling everywhere. They were in a state of total delirium with pretty bad tremors. </p>
<p>I discovered they were in this state and ran them to the E.R. where they got I.V. with nutrients and shit. Was a pretty crazy experience and I had no idea prior to that that alcohol withdrawal could be so serious and life threatening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah alcohol withdrawal can be scary as fuck. I was lucky that I never had seizures or anything, but the shakes were so bad I couldn’t write my name or work on the puzzles they had in detox. It’s a little ironic that when you’re waiting for detox, the advice they give is “whatever you do, don’t stop drinking (entirely) until you get there.”</p>
<p>Fuck, that was hell. The physical symptoms suck, but the psychological effects will drive you insane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you describe in a bit more detail some of the psychological challenges? I am 25 days without a drink due to medical issues, and I think I was mainly a moderate drinker (never drinking during the week but technically binging on the weekend) and I'm curious to better understand the psychological symptoms people face after several weeks of &quot;detox&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm I see what you're up to but if I remember correctly, it only widens blood vessels in the skin. It fucks with our thermoregulation and makes the body think we're feverish, so it widens the blood vessels to release 'excess' heat. I don't think it interacts with the blood vessels in the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comment is referring to dilation of the venous system, not the arterial system.  Dilation of veins and venules in superficial layers of your skin can make you feel warmer but is dangerous because your body is exposing large amounts of warm blood to the environment, causing you to lose heat quickly.</p>
<p>Strokes (usually caused by blood clots that travel to the brain) cause damage because they get lodged in arteries and interrupt blood supply.  They never make it to the venous system.  Arteries in the human body are under very strict control by the autonomic nervous system and do not dilate in response to alcohol, although there are some drugs that can do that.</p></div>		</li>
