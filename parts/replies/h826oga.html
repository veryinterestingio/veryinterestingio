			<div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally, people often underestimate the difference in the size of pizzas for the same reason. How much bigger is a 20&quot; pizza than a 16&quot; pizza? Well, it's 1.25 times the diameter, but it's about 1.56 times the area (1.25^2) which is what actually matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buddies of mine own a pizza shop and they will actually recommend the 20&quot; to their friends because it's cheaper per square inch than the 9&quot;, 12&quot;, and 16&quot;. Getting an extra toppi g for free in a nice bonus too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few more variables when it comes to pizza as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>A larger pizza will have more crust, and most people value the crust part less than the middle part (unless it's stuffed crust pizza). So you can compute the area of the crust and the area of the middle seperately and weight them according to your tastes.</li>
<li>Some particularly nefarious pizza places will not add more toppings even if the pizza is larger. If you value toppings and order from such a place then you may lean towards a smaller pizza to get appropriate topping density.</li>
<li>Conversely extra toppings are usually the same price regardless of the pizza size. So at any proper pizza place that puts more toppings on larger pizzas, you may want to aim for a larger pizza to maximize extra topping value.</li>
<li>I live alone and can't always eat an entire large or extra large pizza without freezing some of it or getting totally sick of pizza.</li>

<p>Actually a larger pizza has less crust, relatively speaking. The crust only increases linearly with diameter (because it’s proportional to the circumference) the area increases with diameter squared.</p></div>		</li>
