It was also a good refresher for me because it’s easy to forget the fundamentals that drive certain aspects in economics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way to explain things to children is using their inherent tendency to ask &quot;why&quot; questions. Some children just ask it for the heck of it, some will ruminate for a while on what you say before asking it. I sometimes ask questions back to test their understanding. If they don't have an answer, ask them to think about it and come back. Most children will forget and move on. A few will remember.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But we know that populations tend to grow exponentially (i.e., people have more and more babies). The more people there are, the higher overall demand goes for certain staple products like milk, steel, and so on</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean for first world countries that have stabilized (or even declining) populations?  We would expect them to have some deflationary pressure right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japan is getting way worse population srinking than other developed nations. Not only do they have a missing generation (from the war) with gives them lots of elders but not many workers, they also don't get much immigration to level that out. To top it all off, it's expensive to live there, so lots of people don't want kids, they just want a decent life. This means women only have about 1.42 children on average. It's  close to Canada actually, but most Commonwealth countries have more than 1.6 children per mother. </p>
<p>Basically, they have the worse case scenario in three ways, and the government has no idea what to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a super complicated question for a number of reasons, but the answer is yes, we would <em>expect</em> them to have <em>some</em> deflationary pressure. That being said, having some deflationary pressure doesn't mean the result will be deflation. These countries still exist alongside growing countries, technology rates do not increase homogeneously across countries, and the carrying capacity of a given environment in one country may start to have limiting effects before that of another country. There are other reasons, but I believe the answer is yes, there would be <em>some</em> deflationary pressure at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their first paragraph rectifies that and is a true explanation for five year olds.</p>
<p>You can’t ask an insanely complex question that even academics debate and expect a two line answer a 5 year old could understand, it’s contradictory logic.</p></div>		</li>
