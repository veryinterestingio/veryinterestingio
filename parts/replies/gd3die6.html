			<div class="markdown"><p>The part around the fracture absolutely. A hematoma forms (blood clot) which is the first stage in mending the fracture. This is replaced with cartilage and subsequently bone. Each of these (hematoma &gt; cartilage &gt; bone) is progressively more stiff, and the stem cells react to the amount of motion at the fracture site by turning into cells that produce cartilage and then cells that produce bone. So as your body manages to stabilize the fracture, the appropriate cells to further stabilize the fracture are generate (because there is less motion at the fracture site, and the cells are able to sense this). It's basically your body's own built in system for casting and splinting. Pretty remarkable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would splinting a break mean that less cartilage would be produced before switching to producing bone? And if so would this make a splinted bone weaker due to being less flexible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, it's remarkable. Even more remarkable is the fact that as the body starts laying bone the break site will be stronger &amp; more resistant to breakage than the bone around it. The human body is an amazing piece of work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is one of the biggest indicators you have broken or chipped a bone. When you can see that bruising deep inside a finger or area where the surface is not bruised, it is likely a break</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes unless it’s a compound fracture. Either way you’re going to the hospital so they’ll look. Another big concern with big bone breaks (and imo the more serious concern) is throwing a fat emboli</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Confused. Are you saying an open fracture doesn't bleed? We don't look for bleeding bone and fat embolism syndrome is pretty uncommon even in polytraumas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, new artery formation happens through an enlargement of preexisting arterioles. When a prior artery stops working (due to blockage or trauma), the blood is forced to go through the network of smaller vessels. The increases flow creates more shear stress against the endothelial cells within the arterioles, causing them to release MCP-1 which attracts leukocytes, which in turn release growth factors such as VEGF. While many vessels will grow and may merge in this process, usually just one new artery (or vein) will end up being the primary source of flow. </p>
<p>Source: I've coauthored 5 papers on the matter, but I recommend reading &quot;Arteriogenesis&quot; by Schaper. </p>
<p>Anecdotally, it's pretty amazing how complex the whole processes is, complex enough that we don't know how to stimulate it in a person. If we did, we wouldn't need to perform highly invasive procedures like stents, angioplasty, etc.</p></div>		</li>
