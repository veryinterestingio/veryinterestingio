			<div class="markdown"><p>You have part of the answer. The sheer distance and the signal traveling at the speed of light.</p>
<p>The other part is switch boards and computers. The signal has to be processed on the reporter end, sent to the satellite, which parses it out from other signals, sends it down to a receiver, which processes it, then it's transmitted across the internet, and it goes through modems and routers before finally being received. Therefore the majority of the delay is from signal processing. </p>
<p>Don't forget as well that your seeing double the delay. Because there's the delay right after the question is asked and the delay right before the response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the delay for a conversation is double that.</p>
<p>Presenter at the main studio finishes speaking, it takes 250ms for the on-the-scene person to hear that.</p>
<p>Then on-the-scene person starts speaking, it takes 250ms for the presenter in the main studio to hear their response.</p>
<p>So from the point of view of the people in the studio, there's actually a 500ms delay there.  And since the TV broadcast comes from the studio, everyone at home sees a 500ms delay too.</p>
<p>In contrast, when the TV viewers see the person-on-the-scene stop talking, they might see the main studio presenter reply immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sometimes wonder whether, before they reply, the reporter on the scene also takes advantage of the fact that we know there's going to be a pause, to compose themselves and think how they're going to reply without it being obvious. And just possibly that they're receiving production feed as well, that we don't hear. Certainly I've seen cases recently of someone on the ground, no more than a couple of miles from the studio, taking well over a couple of seconds of apparent attentive listening before visibly acknowledging that they've heard the question and are about to respond. But maybe I'm just overthinking things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weirdly, one of the best quality live crosses I've ever done was Australia to Russia, whereas the worst quality was from the studio to... 30m down the road from the studio. I suggested extension cables instead of satellite. They laughed. They didn't laugh after that cross.</p></div>		</li>
