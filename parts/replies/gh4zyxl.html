			<div class="markdown"><p>Was looking around for this answer. A lot of people just answering &quot;we have that, its called drugs&quot; or &quot;because it's going to be too addictive&quot; or whatever, but the crux of the question is &quot;why can't I buy a dopamine pill or syringe?&quot; and the answer to that is because it can't get to your brain in that state. The best we can do for that is to give you something that DOES cross the blood-brain barrier and &quot;tricks&quot; your brain into producing dopamine itself.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we have been working on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25575854/" target="_blank">technologies</a> to allow us to brute-force the BBB and get things in directly. Direct-to-brain stim-packs might be nearer than we expect!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And not all precursors' crossing capabilities are equal. L-tryptophan is a precursor of 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) which is a precursor of serotonin. L-tryptophan is way better at crossing the blood-brain barrier, although 5-HTP is not too shabby either.</p></div>		</li>

That’s why we make synthetic substances that bind those receptors, or drugs that block the reuptake of neurotransmitters into brain cells so there are more floating around freely to bind to the receptors and ultimately help us feel better</p></div>		</li>
