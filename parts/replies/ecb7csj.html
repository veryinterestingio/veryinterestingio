<p>There are plenty of people over 30 that fall square into the middle of the &quot;hating everything that's popular&quot; mold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. But...that's precisely what I'm saying. Whilst the presentation may vary and there's no one rule for all, I would say that most of <em>that</em> doesn't come from a place of &quot;irrational hate&quot;. But from a place that's (usually) rooted in greater experience.</p>
<p>Take for example the thousands of video-essays on Youtube concerning Star Wars. Specifically the polarising film, <strong>The Last Jedi</strong>.</p>
<p>Start watching those and you quickly realise that criticisms of the film are mostly not coming from contrarianism, or built in toxicity among a fan base (despite what the producers say on Twitter), or from a desire to fit into a tribe. But from experience with the rest of the franchise and film-making in general. And how many of them make numerous valid points concerning film structure and character development, along with the storyline in the context of the broader franchise these 30 year olds have grown up with.</p>
<p>There are exceptions yes. But I'm saying that with age comes experience. And that hate turns into a.) apathy for a thing not to your taste. b.) reasons for dislike in the context of experience.</p>
<p>Now I'm not saying that all of those people communicate said points as eloquently as they could. Or that there's aren't people out there who hate for the sake of hating, despite being 47 or whatever. But that even a brief dip into  Youtube reveals reasoned analysis rather than irrational hate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone believes their irrational hate is entirely rational though, and will use illogical arguments as faultless logic.</p>
<p>Even take The Last Jedi as an example. But also take The Phantom Menace at the same time. The original trilogy fans HATED TPM when it came out, but &quot;kids&quot; loved the movie. It's been some years since the prequel...sequels came out, and now both generations can hate on the new thing together.</p>
<p>You could probably find someone that could make a rational argument as to why 4/5/6 are the worse trilogy compared to 1/2/3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pssssh, you know deep down BB1 and BB2 were skating by on the back of their one talented and dreamy lead. Boy Band 3 is actually the best group, but MC ramen hair and quadfrosted tips loved the drama and hoarded all the attention. /s</p></div>		</li>
