			<div class="markdown"><p>This great answer applies to the US, which is probably most helpful for the OP. But it may be useful to compare that with how banks work elsewhere.</p>
<p>Within the Single Euro Payments Area (basically the EU and some neighbours), <a href="https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/what-we-do/sepa-instant-credit-transfer" target="_blank">the SEPA Inst scheme</a> allows payments of up to €100,000 to be made every minute of every day, 24 / 7 / 365. The payment must be completed within ten seconds and is cleared at central bank level.</p>
<p>For payments over that limit, the SEPA Credit Transfer allows payments within one working day, which is very similar to the US system described above.</p>
<p>This reinforces that the obstacles to such a payment system in the US may be political and commercial, not technical.</p></div>		</li>

Oh well, not like that can be fucked with by bad foreign actors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it’s someone’s benefit not to have an efficient system so someone can make more money while they hold your money?
The banks used to use helicopters to carry cancelled checks from each bank to their HQ and the Fed to make that extra interest quickly. They are they system ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let’s assume I’m bank A and one of my customers want to transfer a million to bank B. Of course it would make sense to withhold the actual transfer for as long as possible (even if it’s just a minute or an hour) so I can invest the million and make a few cents or euros of profit.</p>
<p>But isn’t it likely that someone from bank B also wants to transfer a million to me (or one of my customers)? Wouldn’t it all even out if we do transfers instantly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Europe the banks even have to pay negative interest (currently -0.5 percent) if they keep their excess liquidity on their accounts with the central banks. And in reality you don‘t have a good alternative to park your money overnight. You could keep physical cash in your safe (only works for small amounts) or keep the money on an account with another bank, but that just shifts the problem to them...</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>What's the rationale for this?  Why would the central bank not want to hold money, or not want the banks to have some extra reserve to keep things stable in case of the unforeseen?</p></div>		</li>
