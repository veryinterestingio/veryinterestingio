			<div class="markdown"><p>When Toyota was engineering the original Lexus LS400, they touted the use of gold-plated contacts for the SRS(airbag) system because gold doesn’t corrode. Since airbags are a safety-critical system, they wanted the system to be as reliable as possible. The rest of the car’s connectors were tin-plated. Toyota then spread this practice to the rest of their lineup when airbags were phased in the early 1990s. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People always deserve to relook at this sort of thing.  It just depends on the application.  Aluminum is often used for some applications  (Power lines being notable)  sometimes in cost effective solutions.  Used to be used in home wiring (stronger/cheaper) but issues with the contacts was actually why it stopped being used.  Silver wire I believe is used for some highly specialized applications,  Gold wire is generally not suitable.</p>
<p>For most home use, just look at what it is rated for an HDMI cable is an HDMI cable, most of the problems is from poorly designed plastic plugs breaking.</p>
<p>Industrial cabling is a whole another can of flexibility vs thermal rating vs shielding and a slew of other stuff.  its interesting in how much design a &quot;simple&quot; cable or wire can have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct (I used to work for the largest high end cable manufacturer in the world).</p>
<p>The standard for most applications is UPOFC (Ultra Pure Oxygen free Copper) for the conductor in the inside cable then to use silver solder and gold plated connectors for the majority of audio, video and broadcast applications (if possible). The reason being is that copper is cheap and flexible yet conducts well and won't corrode when insulated/jacketed etc, silver makes a great conductor for contacts and gold never corrodes so you don't oxidization at the exposed bits which could eventually negatively affect conductivity.</p>
<p>In extreme, somewhat psuedo science / diminishing returns audiophile lore, silver conductor cables should be used but everything in from the source, entire signal path and listening environment would have to be so perfect as to warrant any perceivable benefit and often when people are lauding these things, they start using terms like &quot;sounds more musical&quot; or &quot;has a greater soundstage&quot; which often tell tale signs that these people like to spend money becuase they can, and not becuase it's better in real world application. I've even seen solid silver conductor main power outlets going for over $1000 each promising such improvement terms. I even know someone that bought and audiophile pure silver USB cable for $1500 becuase they think it sounds better.</p>
<p>Industrial cable is far more about large loads, capacitance, resistance, inductance, shielding and thermal considerations for the long haul, rather than clarity of signal transmission. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a shame that more cables don't use screw mounts such as the VGA standard. I've had several HDMI ports on TVs loosen and become unusable which would likely have been avoided if 5+ years of stress were on metal screws instead of the port itself.</p>
<p>I'm sure this isn't a vastly common thing, but it has happened to me on two separate occasions. Go to watch something one day and the port just won't work, but another will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite silver factoids is that when the US was building the first atom bombs the Army had to borrow silver from the US Treasury in order to build electrical components for enriching uranium. Metal rationing for the war effort made using copper less viable, so they turned to silver instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be pointed out that the difference in conductivity/impedance/capacitance/etc between gold and copper, in the very tiny amount that you actually find on a connector, will have almost no bearing whatsoever.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the difference in corrosion between the same amounts of metals, is vastly improved when using not-copper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen is an insanely reactive element, and Gold simply doesn't react with.. well hardly anything. Aluminum is heavily used when corrosion resistance is important, but it protects itself by forming a very thin layer of Aluminum Oxide on all exposed surfaces. Titanium does this as well. This prevents oxygen from reaching below a few microns, and it shields nearly all of the underlying substance from any damage. This layer of oxidation is less conductive though, and that's the issue. Gold won't form this layer as it doesn't oxidize. Iron is the worst. As it oxidizes, it flakes off, and this exposes the material underneath to more oxidation. When they make stainless steel, the most prevalent component is iron, but they also mix in a significant amount of chromium. Chromium does exactly what Aluminum and Titanium do, and it forms a layer of oxidation on the outside of stainless steel that protects it in the same fashion. </p></div>		</li>
