			<div class="markdown"><p>I was also wondering the answer to this. I know some people who believe they got gray hair early from stress (and I believe them because they’re stressors), but am wondering why stress causes this (scientifically).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's all just the process of senescence. It happens at all ages of living things, all the time. Cells in our body come into senescence every day. What affects whether those cells stick around or not, and thus become noticeable by us, is whether we are in a calorically deficient state, or a calorically excessive state. If we exercise and calorically restrict, the body will recycle senescent cells (such as gray hair cells) by apoptosing them (i.e., exploding them) and using the remains to recycle into new, fresh cells.</p>
<p>If we are in a well fed state, meeting all of our caloric needs (or more), our body will not recycle senescent cells, and they will accumulate in our body until we die (or until we stop eating so much and start exercising more to achieve a caloric deficit), causing the phenomenon of having a full head of gray hair, or excessively saggy skin (from senescent skin cells which can't produce collagen).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I said being <strong>calorically restricted</strong>, which is <strong><em>not</em></strong> the same thing as &quot;eating less calories&quot;. You can eat less calories and still be in a caloric surplus or at equilibrium.</p>
<p>Autophagy (triggered when the body is in a state of <strong>caloric restriction</strong>) prevents and reverses gray hair and wrinkles, yes, (duh). It is quite literally the process of self-eating and recycling. You cannot have any excess skin or senescent melanocytes if your body eats them all away.</p></div>		</li>
