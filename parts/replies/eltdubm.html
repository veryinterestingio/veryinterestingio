<p>I'll tend to start losing track of who's who, where they are etc. Perhaps it's because I tend to read more complex sci-fi when I actually do read.</p>

<p>I hate it when they have several characters, with names like Xylithan, Xyquorian and Xyventian.</p>
<p>I don't recognise the names as proper words, or really even pronounce them to myself; I just see them as &quot;oh, that person with a longish name that begins with Xy&quot;. Then I will get them all muddled up together. (Yes, Tolkien, I mean you, with your Saruman and Sauron, your Déagol, Denethor and Dúnhere and so on)</p></div>		</li>
