<p>Do you mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy" target="_blank">activation energy</a> and not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis" target="_blank">catalysis</a> which implies there is a catalyst which does not get consumed during the reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Early in the morning here, good catch, no idea why I changed terms mid-sentence there.  Yes, no catalyst is necessary, just an energy push, that is it.  There are ways to use catalysts to lower what's required for activation energy, but it's far from needed in the case of an explosive like this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It seems like a bright enough white flash (the visible light) would be sufficient to accomplish this. I don't doubt that there's some UV in there as well, nor that UV can damage your vision. I'm just curious if that's actually the design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UV light is typically mostly absorbed in the Cornea, so while it could damage your eyesight, I don't think UV is how the stun grenade typically causes &quot;flash blindness&quot;, as that relies on overloading photoreceptors in the retina, which is much easier to do in the visible/IR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phonetastic wasnt saying that uv drives the reaction, but that the energy produced from the reaction comes out in the form of uv.  Goggle up when you burn mg</p></div>		</li>
