			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read that the middle of Pangea was a huge desert since mountains were there and just the general distance to the ocean was longer. </p>
<p>If you look up the geology of the Appalachian Plateau, most of the sandstone formed there actually formed from the horribly dry climate of Pangea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mountains right in the middle of a landmass seems bizarre when in much of the world today they mostly seem to be near one of the edges (though I guess the Himalaya's are an exception, but even they'e the result of two landmass coastlines clashing). Weird to think that probably nothing would have lived there (would be surprised if anything did).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melting ice from the pole and greenland drives cold water south along the canadian and US coast and down to mexico. In the gulf of mexico heat and wind drives water to the surface (warm water is less dense than cold water) and powers the water north east along the european coast (making the british islands and norwegian coast warmer than it should be).</p>
<p>This is helped by prevailing wind conditions (which in turn are generated by the coriolis effect)</p></div>		</li>
