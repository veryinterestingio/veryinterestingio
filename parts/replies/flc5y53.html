			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh. I think I just figured out what wiped out an entire freshwater fish tank of mine a while ago. The fish started showing slight symptoms, like reddish sores, and then a couple hours later completely dead in the water, looking like they had partially liquefied. If I'm correct, this is one hell of an virus, and completely ended a tank in less than a day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many other viruses out there in the aquatic world that can cause quick die-off events, so it could have been any number of things. It might be worth it to test the waters you have been using for your tank, or by locating the contact information for a fish pathologist. There should be at least a couple fish pathologists employed by each state, and fish pathology labs are relative commonplace in the DNR/DEC/DEM state government world. I myself am not a fish pathologist, however I do work in the fisheries field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this still prevalent? When I was getting my undergrad in biology, this was talked about often but that was in the mid 2000's. I haven't heard much about it since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is still around! I found a few specimen near me that had the symptoms, which was unconfirmed, and there was another body of water in my state that did, as well (more details cannot yet be released).</p></div>		</li>
