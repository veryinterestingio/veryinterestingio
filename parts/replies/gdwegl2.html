			<div class="markdown"><p>I insist that I’m allergic/have a sensitivity to saline solution (some binding agent in it maybe? Idk), but doctors just refuse to even consider it. Not only do I taste saline flushes, I can feel a tingle progress through my body and then subside. I can’t use typical eye drops, because they burn so, so fucking bad. When they do that allergy test with all the spots on your arm, my biggest welt is from the saline “control”. </p>
<p>It’s something I’ll just never have an answer to. If I mention it to a GP, they say I’m mixing it up with something else, because you can’t be allergic to saline solution. I made the mistake of mentioning to to a nurse when I was having a flush done for surgery, and they just cancelled my procedure. It was determined that I was having an anxiety attack and that it would become a manic episode (the joys of being bipolar). Its not like it’s debilitating, but it’s really annoying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only way you’d be allergic to saline is if it had an additive. A case I read about that involved similar the patient underwent testing for the allergy and the alcohol swab they used contained
2% chlorhexidine.<br />
That is unless you’re allergic to water, (aquagenic urticaria) or consume a high amount of salt, (common table salt has been linked with the formation of Th2 cells. These cells play a key role in allergic reactions). The reason why you very likely aren’t allergic to saline is because it is a mix of sodium chloride and water. The human body contains .4% sodium chloride normally.     </p>
<p>You might ask your dr to run an allergy test for chlorhexidine, as well as reduce table salt use or switch to natural sea salt.<br />
You can test for aquagenic urticaria easily enough, drop distilled water on your skin (to rule out anything being present in the water). If you have a reaction, then you can consult your dr about it.<br />
Good luck and I hope you find out the cause.</p></div>		</li>
