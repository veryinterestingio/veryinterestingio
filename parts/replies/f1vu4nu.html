<p>The state of the art right now is 7 nanometer feature size. 7 nanometers means you're working with 70 atoms of stuff to define a feature.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The unit cell of silicon is ~5.4 angstroms wide, so 7 nanometers is only 13 atoms wide.</p>
</li>
<li>Nothing about any 7 nm process is actually 7 nm in size.  The minimum metal pitch in Intel's 7 nm process is 36 nm and the fin pitch is 34 nm.  Still- each fin is ~62 atoms across.  The gate insulation is ~.2 nm, or 6 atoms thick.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tradition, basically.  In 2013 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Technology_Roadmap_for_Semiconductors" target="_blank">ITRS</a> made its last release of its semiconductor technology roadmap.  That was what laid out the 10nm, 7nm, 5nm, and 3nm process nodes.  Even then, the naming was found by some complicated formula or something mostly based around transistor density.  The name was just a name, to match when the name actually did refer to channel length.</p>
<p>Since then manufacturers have basically just been going off the names but not really the formulas.  They all have different processes with very different performances.  In fact Samsung and Intel have gotten so out of sync that Samsung's 10nm and Intel's 14nm have the same transistor size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the architecture is pretty much the smallest size it can be, but that is not why speeds are limited. There are faster processors, but the problem becomes getting rid of the heat it makes before it melts itself.</p></div>		</li>
