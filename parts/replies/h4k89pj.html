<p>A warning for others. It can sometimes look like a bunch of floating carpet until it's almost on top of you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ants are the coolest creature on the planet. Their biological strategy is so strange to humans, and so effective.</p>
<p>For anyone who doesn't know, ants are like bees and hornets, and other hive insects, they don't have a diversified genetic pool. Every ant is a clone of every other ant. This changes the biological equations for ant altruism.</p>
<p>Let me explain this way, if you have a brother (or sister, but brother for simplicity), he shares 50% (on average) of your DNA, therefore, saving your brothers life by sacrificing your own, will get \~50% of your genes into the next generation (not great). This means, saving 2 brothers, would be equal to you surviving and getting your genes into the next generation. Saving 3 brothers lives and sacrificing your own, is a more efficient way for your genes to get into the next generation, because you share 150% (actually 100% with some overlap) of the genes with your 3 siblings. This is a good way to describe altruism in humans and animals. Even though we want to survive, and propagate our genes, there are circumstances where helping others to survive is more efficient way of doing so.</p>
<p>This is where ants come in. Ants of one colony are all genetically identical, which means that any ant interested in propagating genes (every ant ever), is equally satisfied if it survives, or any of its brood survive. This is why we see extreme altruism in ants. On these floating groups of ants, some undoubtedly drown, but they do so willingly, because the dispersion of genes in the colony, literally mean every ant is equal, and the only thing that matters is the greater good, the survival of the queen ant, and the colony. This is also why you will see 30 ants attacking a giant bug, and said bug murdering many ants, but still the ants go in and sacrifice themselves, trying to succeed for the colony. I think this is the coolest thing in the animal kingdom. Imagine if humans were all 100% genetically identical?</p>
<p>It has been a while since I read about these magical little aliens, so if I'm wrong please let me know. Anyone interested in altruism from a genes eye view, should consider reading &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; -by Richard Dawkins. Shit literally changed my life, and sparked an extreme interest in learning about nature and biological life. It changed the way I look at everything from human behavior, to animal behavior, to even getting more interested in learning in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're close - and hymenopterans' (wasps, bees, ants) sex chromosome system is indeed why they are so often social, but a little off the mark.</p>
<p>Workers are not clones.  What's going on is that male ants only have one copy of their genome.  That is, they're haploid, just like a mammalian sperm cell or egg cell. As a result, all of their sperm are identical, and each of their <em>daughters</em> gets the exact same paternal genome.</p>
<p>Female ants are &quot;normal&quot; and so eggs are a mix of genetics from both parents.</p>
<p>As a result, female ants are 75% identical to their sisters rather than the usual 50%, and so are <em>more closely related</em> to sisters than to their own offspring.  So using the selfish gene model, genes get propagated more if an ant's mother makes more sisters for it than it it has kids itself.  This sets the stage for the eusocial behavior that's so common in ants and bees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is much better explained, and for some reason I incorrectly remembered that it was 100% gene overlap.I didn't do a great job explaining this lol. I am a laymen when it comes to the topic, just wanted to share. </p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification I appreciate you teaching me more about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's definitely one good way to put it. The ants are components of a bigger organism, the colony.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the part with if you save 2 brother you save100% of yourself is a bit wrong. There is an overlapp and it doesn't take into account the small amount mutation you and everyone has. Additionally, you have genes for many things, but because of environmental conditions, many of.those features won't be pronounced.</p>
<p>So it will be close to impossible to save 100% of youraelf, as long as you don't clone. You have a good chance that many of you distinguishing features will be given.to the next generation, if you save a few brothers, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it isn't exactly 50% or 100% or 150% in all these cases. Those are just the statistical numbers that is on average the genes you share with your kin, correct? I should have been more clear.</p></div>		</li>
