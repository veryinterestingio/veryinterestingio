<p>Estetrol (e4) is an estrogen made by the body in pregnancy, and the company putting it on the market claims that it would not cause the clotting risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't make sense to me since blood clot risk also increases significantly during pregnancy...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that still means the fact that E4 is raised during pregnancy does not imply the added safety the manufacturer claims. .
Unless they somehow managed to determjne that E4 is not procoagulant. But then again, that would have nothing to do with when the levels are naturally high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, I'm just saying that using a form produced during pregnancy doesn't sound good, unless they're going after the &quot;natural&quot; angle and assume people don't know about increased blood clot risks during pregnancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not claiming to be an expert, but there are significant complicating factors around pregnancy. Reduced mobility, oedema, varicose veins all go hand in hand with pregnancy. Venous stasis due to any degree of IVC compression will play also contribute.</p>
<p>I can't comment, and I'm not sure if anyone has proved reliably, how much of the increased risk comes from the 'hypercoaguability' side of Virchow's triad and how much comes from the stasis side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there's a HUGE risk of clots during pregnancy, arguably larger than the risk from current birth control methods. It sounds like their marketing is false.</p></div>		</li>
