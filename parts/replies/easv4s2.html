			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes. It should be pointed out that a larger battery can produce more <em>current</em> and the device using the power can convert (transform) that to voltage if needed.</p>
<p>I think the biggest real issue is that large batteries are more prone internal defects and pose a cooling problem. Ultimately, the system using the energy is almost certain to convert the voltage/current anyway. If big batteries didn't have drawbacks in cooling and construction, they'd be entirely suitable.</p>
<p>In fact, the way the industry has intensely narrowed itself to a small cell is the overall determining factor. We've got balls to the wall on economies-of-scale on cell construction. Everything has been fine-tuned, from the chemistry on up to packaging. For consumer uses, we're pretty much stuck with just a bare couple of form factors.</p></div>		</li>
