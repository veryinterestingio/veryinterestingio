			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant the millions of years in OP's assertion is probably wrong. Also it did actually take 60 million years for bacteria and fungi to develop the enzymes that digest cellulose, so it's actually kinda surprising that bacteria have evolved to digest a new material that was only invented in the 1940s. Makes me wonder if microrganisms have got a lot better at adapting in the past couple of hundred million years, or it was just a fluke.</p></div>		</li>
