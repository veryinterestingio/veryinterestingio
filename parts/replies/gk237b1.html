			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!  Gilbert and Galileo seem like great examples of a common problem in science: someone makes an advance in a field, and starts to think that advance explains <em>everything</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s actually a problem, unless the proponents are too attached to their theory and are unwilling to even consider different explanations.</p>
<p>Science is like being a toddler all over again. You discover something new (oh wow, this tastes sweet) and now you have to test if your new discovery is applicable to other things (letâ€™s try the stuff the dog eats. Maybe itâ€™s sweet too!)</p>
<p>The goal of science is to find explanations, and formulate your explanation in a universally applicable way. If someone finds something your theory doesnâ€™t explain, or demonstrably predicts the wrong outcome of an experiment, then this doesnâ€™t automatically mean the theory is wrong. It could just be the wrong context - but you donâ€™t know until you try.</p>
<p>And if you try, then sometimes you will be wrong, or will be proven wrong later, even though it seems to fit initially. IMO all that drives new discovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with everything you said. Maybe agate (but perhaps not, and reflects my own interpretation and intuition) is pointing to the fact that sometimes we take the long tedious trail to a truth as the tides ðŸ™‚seem to side with those with a track record (even in a domain outside their expertise)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, this. Of course people would have made the link between tides and the moon cycle, and have been able to predict the tide, shortly after they've had calendars.</p>
<p>But if by &quot;causality&quot; we mean the gravitational effect of the moon, then of course it's going to be something posterior to Newton. Causality is a <em>very</em> tricky thing</p></div>		</li>
