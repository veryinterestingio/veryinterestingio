These tend to be disproportionately circular.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is likely due to the underlying geology of the Canadian Shield. </p>

<p>My first thought was that impact craters in other regions of different geology have likely filled with sediment, etc., over the ages, so the impact scar is gone, whereas the Canadian Shield doesn't really lend itself well to erosion products that would end up filling such a hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact, the road system in Quebec (and most of Canada) only reaches a tiny fraction of lakes, although its the most extensive road network per capita in the world. Even in the Laurentian mountains, just 45 min to 2.5 hours north of Montreal, the amount of lakes developed for acces by country houses seems like less than 5% of the lakes out there. The further north you go, far less has any infrastructure to access them, unless you go back to First Nation ways or have a sea plane.</p></div>		</li>
