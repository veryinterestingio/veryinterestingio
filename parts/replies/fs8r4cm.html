			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s nothing to do with fat, it’s to do with myoglobin. Myoglobin carries oxygen to muscles that need it. Chickens don’t fly, hence the breast muscle is never used. They walk around a lot therefore the leg and thigh muscles require more oxygen storage, therefore contain more myoglobin and are darker.</p>
<p>Pigeon breast is dark red because they fly for miles and the breast muscle requires a lot of oxygen storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different tastes and textures I believe. I’m not much of a chef but I know that the muscles they’re not using as much (breast and wing) will be more tender, and juicier. Needs fact checking from someone more knowledgeable than I, however.</p></div>		</li>
