My theory teacher in second year had to retire earlier than he wanted to from doing full time welding cause he got arthritis in his neck and couldn't wear his hood for more than a couple minutes at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just if your back is upright, the neck muscles have only to keep your head stable, the actual weight is mostly taken by the spine. If you were to lay down horizontally, without head support, you'll very soon feel strain on the neck muscles, because at that point they are supporting the entire weight of the head.</p></div>		</li>
