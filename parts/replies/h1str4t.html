			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I had always heard it was at least partly because their was more oxygen. Is it controversial or is what you said considered a fact now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what they used to think but amber seems to hold the most reliable data. For the last 8 or so years they have data that seems to say that oxygen was a out 10-15% of the atmosphere, compared to the 21% we have now. </p>
<p>Not sure if you have access to the paper, but one is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016703713003906" target="_blank">here </a></p></div>		</li>

to be in an atmosphere with 10-15% oxygen? Would we notice or feel it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The oxygen levels throughout most of the Mesozoic were around what it is now, never really significantly higher or lower. </p>
<p>I’m not sure scientists ever had anything that actually pointed towards high oxygen levels during the Mesozoic, it was just one of (many many) ideas as to how gigantism happened in many dinosaurs. </p>
<p>It also seems to get muddled with the Carboniferous, which was long before dinosaurs were around and genuinely did have some of the highest atmospheric oxygen levels the Earth has ever seen. This is in part what lead to the gigantism of certain arthropods, like the dragonfly ancestor <em>Meganeura</em> or the terrifying 6 ft long millipede ancestor <em>Arthropleura</em>. </p>
<p>We have a better understanding of dinosaur physiology these days and the way that some species managed to get extremely large is like it’s more to do with particular adaptations like bone structure, heat regulation and metabolism. The fact that the late Mesozoic probably saw one of the highest levels of total biomass that the Earth has ever supported also helped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more oxygen thing is more about giant insects in even earlier times. Bugs have an inefficient way to breathe, compared to lungs, that's why they don't grow larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More recently it's been proposed that sauropods were not height browsers but sweep browsers - they held their necks horizontal and swept a semi-circle around, then took a step and repeated (like using a line trimmer). The evidence is the attachments of the neck vertebra, which seem better to work this way than for height.</p></div>		</li>
