			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the response. I know I was asking a somewhat vague question, I guess I could have phrased it better like, &quot;once the explosion begins, what happens in what order&quot; in relation to the context of the original question. </p>
<p>I saw somebody responded with a video that I'm going to check out (after this movie that I'm still finishing lol). </p>
<p>Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The detonator fires and causes a reaction in the explosive.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The explosive expands very quickly, usually with a great deal of heat, from wherever the detonator fires.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This expansion is very forceful and the pressure it creates forces apart the container it is in.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Depending on how this container is designed, pieces of the container then fly outwards at almost the same speed as the explosive wave. but will fly out before it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Depending on the distance from the explosion, a person will feel the shock wave and effects of shrapnel within a very close period of time.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Depending on the weight of the shrapnel, the force of the explosion and the distance from the person, , the shrapnel will then hit, causing tears in the skin, flesh, organs and bones and the shock wave will pass around and through the body, causing damage.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the explosion is large enough, and the person was close enough, then the shock wave would break the blood vessels, organs and bones, and the shrapnel would tear through these things until enough force is absorbed, or the shock wave and shrapnel pass through the body, leading to disintegration of the body, at least to some extent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for taking time to lay this out for me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall an analogy I heard for getting hit by an explosion while wearing a bomb suit being 'imagine throwing a carton of eggs against the wall'. Referring to the intense pressure that may just ruin your insides well before the same damage is reflected externally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a simple way to think about it. It's like if you fell off a building and hit the ground. That's what the pressure is doing. It's throwing air at you harder than you can probably imagine. That's assuming there wasn't shrapnel or something like that which ripped through a body. I figured that was too obvious for your question though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, the concussive shockwave can travel through the skull and cause a bunch of diffuse white matter damage.  Basically, the brain is a very soft delicate organ that has the texture of jello, and a big portion of its gooey center is composed of complex nerve fibers that form connections between cells.</p>
<p>That shock wave jiggles the brain in a very rough manner, and a lot of tiny micro-tears occur in those connections, which can't really reconnect.  Because those micro-tears aren't localized you see a general drop in cognitive function... inability to focus, memory issues, struggles in processing information, etc.  I know of one patient who suffered this kind of damage due to head trauma and it dropped his IQ by 30 points.  Guy was a radiologist and it destroyed his career because he could no longer do his job.</p>
<p>Soldiers during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan saw a lot of this shit happen.  It's not just PTSD that damages their cognitive function.</p></div>		</li>
