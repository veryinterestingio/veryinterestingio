			<div class="markdown"><p>Emm, I don't think so. If there's nothing to ionize then it can't arc.</p>
<p>Vacuums are actually used as a good insulator. High voltage circuit breakers often have vacuums inside for insulation &amp; arc control.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I've not studied this in detail. Someone else may be able to explain better &amp; there may be specific circumstances on which a vacuum arc is possible. Off the top of my head I guess it's possible that the two conductors vaporise and allow conduction through the vacuum, but technically it's no longer a vacuum as the space is filled with vaporised conductor, not nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arcs absolutely happen in vacuum. You'll more likely have different type of discharge like a glow, but if you don't regulate the voltage, you can develop an arc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The arc you see is ionized gases. In a perfect vacuum, there are not gasses so no arch is possible.  You can still have elections that travel in the vacuum and that is how old CRT tubes worked. </p>
<p>The path of the elections will depend on the electrical and magnetic field and even gravity. But there would not be a visible arc just electrons that moved by themselves.  </p>

<p>In no perfect vacuum, you sill the ionized glowing gas but is tend to spread out over a large volume. I am not 100% certain why it is the case but I suspect it is because there is less particle so to get the same resistance you need a wider path. The number of the ionized particles is likely identical but spread out over a larger area. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will arc. Even a vacuum has a breakdown voltage. It is however, exceptionally high. For scale: air it's 3*10⁶ V/m vs. a vacuum as much as 10¹² V/m.</p></div>		</li>
