<p>Also, the cycles of &quot;levels&quot; are, ON AVERAGE, about 90 minutes, not exactly 90 minutes for everyone all the time. Minutes are made up arbitrary units of measurement, after all, not biologically determined. </p>
<p>Which is why if you can get into a rhythm of waking up before your alarm goes off you'll probably have much better mornings. If you sleep without an alarm your body will wake up after a cycle, whenever that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also some app-based alarms that you keep on your bed or under your pillow that will gently wake you up at the end of a sleep cycle, within some time range. I think they use the microphone and accelerometer to measure how much you're moving in your sleep and what your breathing sounds like. You set it for like 6-6:45, and it determines when to wake you.</p>
<p>I used one for a long time with pretty good success, until I got married. The app I was using got confused when there were two people in the bed, because it would feel both of us moving</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly there are lots of awesome things about being married but better sleep is not one of them. I even really love sharing a bed, very few complaints, but I'd get more regular and better sleep alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to consider, is that age plays a part in things. My experience so far has been that what your body is comfortable with, sleep wise, goes through phases as you age. You have the baby to toddler phase, where patterns are widely varied and strange, theres a relative normalisation during childhood, right up until puberty kicks in and throws the entire thing in a spin for a few years. Then you reach young adulthood, and you can go 72 hours with no sleep and still have a bounce in your step right up until the age of about 32, when you NEED sleep like you need your next breath, and given the choice between the sleep and the breath, you'll take the sleep. I am 35 now, and still something of a nightowl, but I do need my Z's. Never used to care much up until relatively recently. </p>
<p>I imagine things will continue to be in flux until I die, with regard to sleep cycles. I could end up being one of those folks who falls asleep at the drop of a hat, or I could wind up being one of those crotchety old bastards who gets sleep in hour long doses, and always looks like they are one step away from starting to say &quot;Braiiiiiiins&quot; and trying to nom peoples skulls. No idea till it starts to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If minutes is a bad unit, is it possible that heartbeats could be used as a more consistent measure for sleep time? Or maybe breaths? Maybe there other biological cycles that could consistently describe sleep cycles?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe? I'm happy to be corrected because I'm no sleep scientist, but:</p>
<p>I believe the sleep cycles are mostly controlled by hormones (like melatonin), and at least the release and metabolizing of hormones is influenced to some extent by things like heart rate...</p>
<p>But realistically, I doubt even in one night that you are likely to have two identical sleep cycles, let alone having absolutely consistent cycles night to night. Which is why any absolute value, especially applied to every person, wont fit, and your best bet is probably to try to get to sleep early enough that you can wake up without an alarm. Ideally. (Arguably, unrealistically. I certainly almost never do that.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add to this a typical sleep cycle is approximately 90 mins for the first cycle. Every consecutive cycle is then also reduced as you do not need to cycle back up fully to awake and itâ€™s easier to drop through the Cycles into REM sleep. So while the first cycle may be 85 mins the second may be 70 and then 60 and then 55. It really varies person to person but generally follows this trend</p></div>		</li>
