			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion with slightly improved water electrolysis technologies hydrogen is the way to go. Due to the abundance of water well never run out of fuel. Additionally the only product of energy regeneration is water again. We could replace the shitton of hydrogen generated from hydrocarbons used in chemical processes with clean hydrogen. There is a ton of overlap with other industries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even better, replace water oxidation with alcohol oxidation or some other value-added oxidation reaction while in acidic media. This gives you the hydrogen youâ€™re looking for on the cathode while also replacing O2 generation with something of higher value. Water oxidation is the energy-intensive step, so replacement with alcohols for example shaves off a lot of cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much the same process in the opposite direction</p>
<p>Turbines extract energy from a fluid by reducing velocity/pressure, pumps impart energy by increasing velocity/pressure</p></div>		</li>
