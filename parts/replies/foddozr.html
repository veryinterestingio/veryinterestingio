			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that is a great response, thank you so much! I saw the post on r/wholesomememes and got so worried about it being bad for the turtles.</p>
<p>Since you downright answered my question, do you think it's a good idea to scrub their shells when they are in the wild? Couldn't it hurt them if done by someone who isn't an expert? And would lake or river dwelling turtles be benefitted by having algae grown on them? Like, for camouflage and hunting?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's a good idea no, a healthy turtle in the wild keeps all that in check, it's a naturally pretty symbiotic relationship so I really wouldn't see a need for someone to be scrubbing a wild one. And yeah if you didn't know what you were doing, I'd worry you could cause some damage. Their shells do have sensation, so it could potentially hurt if you were scrubbing hard. When we rescue a turtle, we have to be really careful about whether or not we pick off barnacles; some are so well adhered that they could pull a scute off with them if you didn't play your cards right. </p>
<p>And yes certainly, that's one of the benefits of a covering of algae and other things, it can be great camouflage to protect from predators, so generally, all things considered, best to leave it on. Unless like I said before, they're in rehabilitation programmes or otherwise out of their natural environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad, I came up with this question because I was in a very &quot;maybe we shouldn't intervene with things that happen in nature that aren't at all related or caused by us, they might have a reason to exist that we just don't get&quot; mindset and your answer makes me feel like that is a good value to keep. Thank you so much for replying, hope you can see your turtles soon, I'm sure they miss you a lot!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Hawaii we were told to not touch turtles because it damages their “protective layer”. How does that play into this, if turtles naturally rub against corals and rocks?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, we definitely do have the two different names... whether or not anyone knows the difference is a whole 'nother story</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha yes this is what I thought. I know they exist but no one uses them properly! And that was compounded by that awful video of a girl from the US throwing a terrestrial &quot;turtle&quot; into the water because she was under the impression all turtles swam. So I actually feel like it is a big deal to differentiate them.</p></div>		</li>
