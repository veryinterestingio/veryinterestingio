			<div class="markdown"><p>I have <del>parietal</del>  (edit: i always remember this wrong, english is not my native) hiatal hernia, which is when stomach is moving inside the chest cavity. One of the symptoms is irritation of the vagus nerve and i get the the feeling of anxiety and increase in the adrenaline levels without actually doing anything (in fact, it happens most often at rest..). It took forever to find out what is wrong with me, why my heart rate went up without a reason, started pounding harder and sometime i get a genuine &quot;scared&quot; reaction, the best way to describe it s like when you open up a your electric bill too late and it is a final notice. I had all tests made to make sure it isn't heart, it was then traced to be nerve related. I put the things together and suggested it might be actually <del>parietal</del>  hiatal hernia.. and it was. But i did develop panic disorder to the point where i called an ambulance.  I had NO idea why i'm having sudden heart issues that really came from that odd feeling, combined with elevated heart rate. Damn that was scary times, i seriously thought &quot;this is it&quot; multiple times. I was living so that i would a have presentable body, those who have gone thru something similar know exactly what i mean, i was cleaning for the moment when paramedics and relatives arrive...</p>
<p>When it happens, i do my routine of calming the vagus nerve down and exercises meant to &quot;shuffle&quot; my organs back in their right places, so to speak. Drawing lungs full of breath, holding it a while, then drawing MORE air in, to the point where lungs start to hurt. It will open up the alveoli in the lungs that will also calm down vagus nerve. Then i push my stomach forward will releasing air, keeping my back straight and posture up. The combination slides the stomach back down. It is very, very odd feeling as there are no touch receptors in there. I use beta blockers when the symptoms last a bit longer, sliding also happens the most when my stomach is empty, with full stomach there is feeling of pressure. Burbing has never been so gratifying as it usually means that the pressure around the stomach lining opening that links esophagus to the stomach, the place that has given away, is relieved.. so it is a REAL relief, heart rate goes down, nausea goes away, adrenaline secretion slows down...</p>
<p>It is apparently quite common, one fifth will get it but most show no symptoms.. but knowing what i know now, i have had it for a LONG time...  So. if anyone reading has weird panic attacks that are triggered by really nothing, if heart rate goes up with no explanation, you get the feeling of &quot;dread&quot; that goes away on its own... talk to your doctor. You need to eat the camera and that is NOT fun... It is doable if you can stay calm but it really, really is not fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this too, exactly!! And arrived at the exact same diagnosis.  Lost 30 pounds, have adjusted eating and exercise without being nutty about it, and am pretty much good to go.  It helped so much just to figure it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy heck! I started having heart... palpitations? last weekend and ended up in the ER; I‚Äôd been taking a new medication that could result in similar symptoms (spironolactone, a diuretic&gt;Hyperkalemia&gt;cardiac arrest) so I was worried that I was on my way to a heart attack.  Your description was exactly what I was feeling: inexplicably anxious, a feeling like my heart was in the wrong place and beating strangely, I even felt high (but had taken no rec drugs nor alcohol). Most uncomfortable when lying down. </p>
<p>The ER found absolutely nothing wrong, EKG normal, blood test normal, chest X-ray normal. It‚Äôs better now but every so often (every hour) I get that ‚Äúthunk‚Äù in my chest, it‚Äôs very unnerving. I‚Äôve stopped the medication (for now) and am due to check in with the doctor again in a week to see if it‚Äôs ongoing. There‚Äôs no proof that my condition was caused by the meds, since there was no indication of it in any of the test results, but that‚Äôs the assumption we‚Äôre all making for now. </p>
<p>Do you have any idea what caused the hernia in the first place? Was it a physical injury, or a congenital defect? How did your doctors confirm the hernia - could it be seen with imaging?</p>
<p><em>Seriously, thanks</em>. I hate it when something weird happens, with no obvious explanation and the doctors are just like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre alive so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚Äú. I‚Äôm glad to have an alternative if they want to drop it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, i remember wrong, english is not my first language and i have been dealing with this in finnish... It is hiatal hernia. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatal_hernia" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatal_hernia</a></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yup, got those too. It was one of the main triggers for my panic disorder, although it gets better all the time. They almost went away when i was diagnosed, which was what the doctors and even i was sure was going to happen after all tests came back negative that it wasn't my heart. It is going strong, which i kind of knew; i live on top of a hill and i don't own a car, i use a bicycle... that is nice stress test i take about once a day.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor and admit it straight out that it is some stranger on the internet but you feel there are similarities in the symptoms.. The bad news is that there is no real cure. Only if the stomach starts twisting and it cuts circulation, resulting in pain or that it starts to hurt, they can do a surgical procedure but if at all possible, they try to avoid it.</p>
<p>When you lie in bed, try raising your body up on an angle. Use pillows to prop yourself up a bit, the best solution are mattress wedges (don't know it in english). It should help with the symptoms. I switched to anatomical pillow and got stiffer bed. I still can't fall a sleep very well on my right side, left side is much better.</p>
<p>The causes are... bad posture, hunching down for years on a sofa and coughing but based on a hindsight, i have had propensity to it for a LOOONG time.. Acid reflux has been a long term problem and i did have inflammation that has since healed, i use proton pump inhibitors. The better the stomach condition overall is, the less there are symptoms.  Good posture helps a LOT, i started doing posture exercises even before the diagnose as i felt it helped. Using more lung capacity, drawing deep breaths and then pushing with stomach muscles your gut out, almost like you are &quot;making more room&quot; and slowly breathing out. Repeating that every now and then helps and the less that area is irritated, the better. Drinking cool water may help. I also drink carbonated beverages to induce burbing after a meal but afaik, this is very personal as it can also cause discomfort.</p>
<p>I do need beta blockers when the symptoms last a bit longer, i usually just take one for caution when that &quot;clunk&quot; or &quot;knot in the stomach&quot; happens. My blood pressure is a bit up anyway, it has always been so they treat multiple things, also social anxiety is not a problem anymore. The most annoying it is when that &quot;clunk&quot; happens in public, you just know that &quot;ok, i will have elevated heart rate and a bit of fright&amp;flight mechanism in action for couple of minutes, it is ok.&quot; By FAR most often when it feels that my heart is racing... it is not. It just feels like that in the exact spot where the esophagus and stomach connect. It is just where the sternum ends, in the &quot;pit&quot;.. It can gurgle and do rapid fluttering which is NOT your pulse. It is 2-3 times faster... So, learn how to take quick pulse measurement casually, thumb on a wrist is faster than index finger anywhere and doesn't look the same  (you should never measure someone elses pulse this way, that is where you use your index and middle fingers so you don't mix it with your own pulse). I laugh everytime that happens since it feels like rararaatatatata but pulse is thump.... thump.... thump... like a clockwork. Except that it usually also lowers the moment you disconnect the ratatatata feeling that it isn't our heart..</p>
<p>Meditation also helps, in and outside... If you can get in that &quot;space&quot; anywhere in seconds, that alleviates panic response.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor, it HAS to be examined. If it is &quot;sliding hernia&quot;, you are ok. If it is something else, you may need a surgery but it really should be at least ruled out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You stay alive. The vagus nerve being active isn‚Äôt bad. It sends signals to most of the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest, opposite of flight or fight). It controls our heart rate (slows it down usually), digestion, and a lot of other things.</p></div>		</li>
