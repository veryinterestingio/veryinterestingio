			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of different pathways Into the business. Some guys go to film school, some get degrees in electrical engineering, some have no degrees at all (like me).</p>
<p>Personally I served 8 years in the Marines in satcom, and took those technical skills to tv working as a broadcast engineer. </p>
<p>Now I'm a supervisor in the control room for a major network.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Appreciate your answer, thank you. </p>
<p>The Marines has a broad spectrum of roles available, did you
pursue this option because it aligned with a particular interest, or was it something you were assigned and it grew from there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the people I work with don't have degrees. I didnt when I started in this industry. A degree is one path, but experience will always be prioritized. The best advice I can give anyone who wants a job in broadcasting is to take a job in broadcasting. Any job. Once you have that first one you can start building the connections and experience you need to get where you want. Don't ever burn a single bridge, learn everything you can, and don't give up when you feel stuck - just keep applying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>But operating a camera takes some skill, not everyone understands depth of field, aperture, shutter speed etc, heckj, most folks dont even seem to care about focus given all the selfies etc constantly out there. </p>
<p>So if being a camera operator is a goal, is training provided for that? Or is some latent skill/knowledge still required?</p></div>		</li>
