In quantum computing, it's important to understand that the field is very interdisciplinary. For this reason, if you are interested in computer science, you might consider taking courses like computational complexity and linear algebra -- these courses will help you no matter what you study. You might also find it useful to study the relationship between information theory and physics, as that will broaden your exposure to how the two relate. There is great work by pioneers of the field like Charlie Bennett describing these relationships. Feynman's Lectures on Computation provides you an excellent overview of the relationship between physics and computing.</p></div>		</li>
