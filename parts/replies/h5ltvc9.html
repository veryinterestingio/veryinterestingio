			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. There had been some debate if the cephalic phase of insulin release was present in humans, but <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32707265/" target="_blank">a recent systematic review and meta-analysis</a> strongly suggests it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this should be almost self evident as we begin salivating with the sheer sight and intention of food.  As an aside, this is why diet drinks are so bad for you. You know the sweetness is fake, but your primitive brain doesn't. So it releases insulin to balance sugar which isn't there, driving your blood sugar down, making you hungry and eat more. That's why people who drink diet sodas slowly gain weight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you don't eat more to correct for the low blood sugar, and you drank these all day, would being in a constant state of low blood sugar mimic depression?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is how people get addicted to diet sodas. The soda drives blood sugar lower. Thus, you want to raise your b. Sugar back up. You want something sweet. So you reach for another soda. Repeat.  I was addicted to diet sodas but didn't realize it. I read an article about it with its conclusion being &quot; well if you don't have a problem, you should be able to stop for three days. Right?&quot;  I took the challenge, very difficult. And it wasn't caffeine either. I allowed myself all the coffee I wanted. Still, strong cravings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the theory, though it is a contentious assertion. The insulin release is fairly limited, it’ll be sucked up by any food eaten at the same time, and it does still have a ton fewer calories, so the insulin pre release has to translate to an additional 140 calories for a can of coke. Associative studies have been done (a number funded by sugar companies) and some have found that it’s linked with weight gain, though there may be confounding variables like how weight loss programs may be linked to diet soft drink intake and weight loss programs often result in weight gain due to long term adherence issues. All I’m saying is that your assertion isn’t quite as rock solid as you make it seem</p>
<p>Aspartame for example doesn’t even cause insulin release, so your mechanism is flawed too.</p></div>		</li>
