			<div class="markdown"><p>This is controversial. Studies of preindustrial societies that currently exist (generally remote tribes) have failed to turn up much to support the hypothesis, and reviews of literature throughout the ages has found some things that might be evidence but which are not conclusive. It may be that it was practiced in some cultures but was not universal, that it was common but not considered notable so wasn't documented, or that it was an individual or small group choice. Given the scarcity of detailed writings the way we think of them and the difficulty associated with a useful study on something like this, we may never know.</p></div>		</li>
