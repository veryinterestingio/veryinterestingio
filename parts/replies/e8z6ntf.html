			<div class="markdown"><p>On a trip from Missouri to Mississippi bringing back our new canoe, the strap noise was driving us absolutely crazy. I searched on my phone for a solution and pulled over took Google's advice to put a twist in the straps. It worked marvelously and saved our sanity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with doing this is that it significantly weakens the strap - in Australia the Highway Patrol in New South Wales has been known to five people traffic offences for putting twists in ratchet straps as it increases the likelihood of a break significantly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that (anecdotally) the HWP cvnts do fine people in Australia do this, but that doesn’t necessarily prove anything. </p>
<p>A mate who is a builder told me that cops fine people. He was also a helicopter load master in the army, and they have to put twists in the strap. </p>
<p>I think it’s just HWP being cvnts, ‘cause they are cvnts, or in actuality never happened. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to put twists in any straps, until my mate who owns a construction company told me about the fines from the cops. He said it is $10,000 fine for doing it. Seems stupid to be that high, and also I doubt the logic of it weakens the strap.</p></div>		</li>
