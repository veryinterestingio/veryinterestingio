			<div class="markdown"><p>The nucleus isn't isolated from its environment at all. Otherwise nMR and thus MRI's wouldn't function. The fundamental energy is much greater as the primary potential is due to the Strong Force (interacting through the Yukawa Potential). The Heisenberg uncertainty principle doesn't precisely work with energy, but instead any non-commuting operators. The energy goes as p\^2 , so we can use the Virial theorem to relate <T> to the potential <V>. Schrodinger's equation can show how we get the approximate principle, but true energy variance occurs in QFT. The time it takes for a photon to be emitted has to do with the availability of other states. The decay time is inversely related to the energy difference. Mossbauer spectroscopy in crystals entirely relies on the nuclei being bound in place.</p></div>		</li>
