			<div class="markdown"><p>The article mentions Abby and Brittany Hensel, who are 30 years old. They're not considered &quot;a two-headed girl&quot; but two people with different personalities, who each control half of their one body well enough to walk, ride a bicycle, and drive. Their parents wanted them to have as normal a childhood as possible. They were the subjects of two documentaries where their hometown wasn't mentioned.</p>
<p>Edit: confirmed their age</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Properly speaking that's true of all animals with full polycephaly... you've got two brains so two individuals.  Sometimes there are behavioral/personality differences you can see even in animals like snakes.  They must have an interesting time coordinating movements since the same issue with each mind controlling half the body would apply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no question that rat snake would have died in the wild. Imagine killing your food, then fighting with the guy who shares your body. You can't just slither off with dinner. Meanwhile, some other critter makes off with your kill.</p></div>		</li>
