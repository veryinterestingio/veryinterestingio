			<div class="markdown"><p>I just remembered the name, but not the person behind it. </p>
<p>The technique is called ‚ÄúTremoring‚Äù. </p>
<p>I believe it‚Äôs also used in sports training as a way to relieve extreme muscle tension and stress. But I learned it from acting school. </p>
<p>I hope this helps at least find more info on it! It‚Äôs not the most complete explanation, but might steer you in the right direction if you want to try to find more info. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just looked it up and I think that‚Äôs what it is!</p>
<p>It will make you feel very silly, if you try it, but it will definitely help towards relieving stress and bottled up emotions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a way I can replicate this if I try to? Or does my body need to be in a certain condition for it to occur? e.g. post-workout, in bed, exhausted</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, the person above who mentioned David Berceli's Trauma Releasing Exercises - he has lots of suggestions of ways to trigger this shaking/tremoring. I'm not sure if you can find all the exercises online, I actually bought the book cheap online. If you're really interested in this though I definitely recommend looking this up! It's helped me loads with healing my mental health and now I feel more attuned to other times and ways my body will shake or release. It's really cool!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There‚Äôs no specific ‚Äústate‚Äù you have to be in, just certain positions and better to try on a flat, hard surface and not in bed.</p>
<p>You can try (safely) exploring different stretches and once you feel that tremor start to happen, kind of encourage it to keep going. Not forcing it, but just let yourself shake for some time. </p>
<p>Looking up videos for both Fitzmaurice and Beceli techniques will give you an idea of what stretches are done. </p>
<p>The only equipment I ever used was a zafu (meditation cushion). Any type of big cushion (that‚Äôs not overly soft) would probably work. If you have bare floors, a yoga mat might make it more comfortable. Otherwise, it‚Äôs just your body!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It‚Äôs the Fitzmaurice technique! I took a class on it during my theatre major undergrad. Tremoring can be a great way to relax and ground yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the one that was referring to! Thank you for reminding me of the name. </p>
<p>Beceli‚Äôs technique seems very similar, though. Might be easier for OP to access videos or books.</p></div>		</li>
