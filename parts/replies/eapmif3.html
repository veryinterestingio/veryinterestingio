<ul>
<li>ice has greater volume than water  </li>
<li>hence you can melt ice by compressing it  </li>
<li>hence when you stand on ice you melt it  </li>
<li>water layer  </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I was taught too. That it's the pressure that melts the surface of the ice. Later I learned that it was the combination of pressure and friction. Now I have learned no one knows. It's like science is going backwards.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm amazed by the number of people who feel it's necessary to comment that science is in fact <em>not</em> going backwards. I'll remember next time to add the ^/s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in theory, if ice was so cold that there was no water layer, it wouldn't be slippery?</p>
<p>Or if we had two surfaces of the same temp, ice wouldn't melt, and therefore not be slippery?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't make sense because even very light objects are &quot;slippery&quot; on ice. </p>
<p>My completely unsubstantiated guess is that regardless of smooth ice or rough ice, at the microscopic level, the peaks and valleys of ice at the surface can easily be broken. And friction is essentially the summation of all the forces required to break all those little peaks. I'd love to see an SEM view of the surface of really smooth ice to see what it looks like. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of friction the reduced surface area concept is still valid. As to why it works on ice beyond that, I dont think we know anything solid (hehe), at least nothing more than a few educated guesses. We just know it's got smth to do with &quot;anomalous&quot; ice</p>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Theorists have speculated that it may be the very act of slipping making contact with the ice that melts its surface.   Others think the fluid layer is there before the slipper ever arrived, and is somehow generated by the inherent motion of surface molecules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <em>feel</em> like this would be easy enough to determine, but no doubt there's some reason we haven't figured it out yet.</p>
<p>Actually, why would a thin water surface make it slippery? Water can be a bit slippery, but why can it make some surfaces slippery when it doesn't seem to be slippery. Is it similar to having a bunch of marbles on the floor and trying to walk on them? When you have water on your skin it doesn't make your skin more slippery. Is that unique to our skin? Does water create less friction when it comes into contact with water or ice than it would other substances?</p>
<p>Water is kinda weird when you think about it. I could be (read: am probably) wrong but I remember reading that scientists don't know why water expands when it freezes, when everything else contracts when it freezes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think because below the thin water surface, it's just more water molecules, waiting to be knocked out of their crystal lattice of ice. So if the thin water surface gets pushed out of the way, more water just forms. This doesn't happen to water on your skin.</p>
<p>I think you're right, it's exactly like walking on marbles. Also, water <em>does</em> make wet surfaces a little slippery. That's why &quot;Caution: wet floor&quot; signs exist, and why a car will slide longer on a wet road.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>yes it does, tires on dry vs wet concrete/asphalt have <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physics_Study_Guide/Frictional_coefficients" target="_blank">different coefficient of frictions.</a></p>
<p>For clarity of that chart, Kinetic is moving then touching, static is touching then moving.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Waxed ski on snow  0.05    0.14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that one is of note in particular as from a starting position the waxed ski has nearly 3 times as much friction on the snow, than when already moving.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>scientists don't know why water expands when it freezes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They do know this, it is due to Crystalline structure, the ice expands to form a specific shaped crystal, which is a reason why <a href="http://www.4college.co.uk/a/O/entsurr.php" target="_blank">salt water freezes at lower temps</a>, as the salt gets in the way of the crystals forming.</p>
<p>Entropy is your answer btw, when things don't make sense and it should be doing something when you drop the temperature(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy" target="_blank">Enthalpy</a>), the reason it does something weird is because of Entropy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I explained it above, but the long and short is that liquids by their nature can't apply shear forces through itself (they don't have a structure, which is what makes it a liquid as compared to a solid which can resist shear forces).  A shear force is like if you lay your hand flat on teh surface of a deep pool. If you then move your hand to the left, only the water at the very surface moves, the water at the bottom doesn't move at all.  So when you walk on a wet surface, the cross-section is your shoe on top of a layer of liquid (which fills in the microscopic gaps between your shoe and the floor) and then the floor.  So when you try to walk normally, friction is a shear force along the ground that propels you forwards.  With the liquid in the way, the liquid can't apply significant friction (because friction is a shear force) and your shoe slips backwards.  </p></div>		</li>
