			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to add to this: </p>
<p>If you have a poor posture, don’t try to avoid breathing ‘into chest’ for breathing ‘into stomach’. The rib cage has to move during breathing for all the surrounding muscles to work properly. While this isn’t a problem for people with good posture it can be for those slouched over. </p>
<p>The way that lets you get the most air in is the right way to breathe. Diaphragm lowering and chest expansion should happen at the same time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I accidentally found this out about a month ago. I have shit posture from PTSD and hyper mobility that keeps me in constant pain. Years of voice lessons and I still couldn’t activate my voice properly because of weak breath. One day about a month ago I gave up breathing through the stomach. I knew I wasn’t supposed to breath with my shoulders so I divided the two and breathed through the middle of my torso and WHOA WHAT’S THAT NEW MUSCLE?!? Diaphragm boi, is that you?? Made a HUGE difference. Idk if it’s still proper posture for singing but I know I sound a hell of a lot better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly right. Had similar issue though maybe not as bad. Everyone keeps saying breathe into the stomach but that’s not exactly right. A full breath is what you need, your body knows how to do the rest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Living in the past, worrying about the future, stress, anxiety, self doubt, overstimulation.</p>
<p>Keeping your focus on your breath requires you to live entirely in the present moment. This is extremely difficult to do, if not impossible, all day in the modern world. Don't worry about it, don't pass judgement on yourself. Whenever you think about, correct your breathing and feel the relaxation. This is what mindfulness is. It is a practice not an end goal. Don't chastise yourself for slipping, just do it when you think about it and maintain it until you become distracted again. Repeat for the rest of your life.</p></div>		</li>
