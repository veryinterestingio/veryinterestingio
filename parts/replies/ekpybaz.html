			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lot of cruising ships in that part of the sea. Does that mean they have some restricted area where they shoudn’t sail under any circumstance? </p>
<p>If the rocket fails, you can’t really predict with certainty where the parts will fall down and the cruise ship can only move 20ish knots so the “escaping maneuver” wouldn’t do much. That’s of course only my opinion as a layman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we can get pretty good estimates of where the debris will fall the moment we decided the mission is scrubbed or we know something went wrong baring anything crazy like a thruster being stuck at full throttle and being unresponsive. </p>
<p>I think the problem is that it's a lot harder to predict what a random human controlling a ship on the water might do, especially since you can't guarantee that you can get communications to them in time without also heavily risking safety personnel lives in the process.</p></div>		</li>
