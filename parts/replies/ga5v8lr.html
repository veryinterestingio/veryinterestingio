			<div class="markdown"><p>Into the 1980s, we only had 3 channels and they went off the air around midnight (after Carson). That's why Tom Snyder's Late Late Show and Midnight Special were such a big deal. I remember the test pattern on the tv early in the morning waiting for cartoons to come on. They ended every broadcast day with the national anthem.</p></div>		</li>

That's it)...but one of our PBS channels ended the night with that cute Velvet Underground song sung by Maureen Tucker:&quot;if I close my eyes, the night will last forever...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit. You don't have to go all the way back to the 50's. I was born in 70 and we only had the big three networks plus a PBS station. In the late 70's we got an independent station that showed classic TV re-runs and old black and white movies. Most of them when off-air at midnight. </p>
<p>Cable wasn't available where I lived until the mid-late 80's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was lucky to get 5 channels, the big three, PBS, and a local station even though I was between two major cities. Spent the whole 70s waiting for someone to start The Fourth Network.</p>
<p>In ‘82 I moved to rural Alaska where they’d just started a cable company and we had MTV from launch day when major cities couldn’t get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was born in '77 and still remember the TV lineup for KC<br />
4 - NBC<br />
5 - CBS<br />
9 - ABC<br />
19 - PBS</p>
<p>That was it until Fox came around when I was about 10. Then we got a couple of local channels. Then Fox and NBC swapped local stations during my late teens which still gets me confused sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm that the 3 channel thing was alive and well into the early 80s if you didn’t have cable. When we first got cable in I think’74 the tuner was a box with a push button for each channel, for a total of maybe a dozen, including a station in Atlanta called WTCG that became TBS. Looked like this. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in a rural part of Connecticut, and it wasn't even until the late '90s that we were even able to get cable - prior to that the cable company said it would be too difficult / expensive to install it along our out of the way road. We had some sort of big antenna outside the house that was on a rotator with a button that we could use to turn it to try and pick up stations. All we could pick up were the local ABC, CBS, and an independent station. Maybe if we were lucky and the weather was decent we could just barely get the local FOX station.</p>
<p>My dad was always old fashioned, though. We had a rotary phone up until the late '90s too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandparents had the next model of that; it had a three-way selector, so you could have three times as many channels as buttons. It was still connected by a long wire, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well earth tones were the thing, sort of a reaction to the bright 50s and 60s colors. And of course smoke yellowed everything.</p></div>		</li>
