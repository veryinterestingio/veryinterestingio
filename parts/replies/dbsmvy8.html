<p>You're assuming it has no borders. Meaning either it is infinite or it is finite but a closed loop. In other words the 3d shape of the universe curves through 4d space so that while the amount of space might be finite there is no edge.</p>

<p>My mind blew up here...</p>
<p>Edit: it's the 4D space that I still have trouble understanding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Picture the surface of the earth. Does our planet have an edge that you can fall off? No, its surface is unbounded even though it's most certainly finite. You can consider other shapes as well, such as a donut shape for instance. It holds equally true for the <em>inside</em> surface of a sphere or donut. Then, sort of... add a dimension, and consider that the <em>volume</em> we're currently inside doesn't need to have an edge, even if it's finite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is we can comprehend that the Earth is curved. We can imagine the reason why we can circumnavigate it without issue. </p>
<p>The universe though... I can't imagine what 4D space would be. I have no frame of reference for that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not actually that hard to understand. Think of the surface of a sphere. It's a 2d shape that curves through 3D space. There's a limited surface area but no edge. You can't walk off the edge of the earth just by moving across its surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong please but isn't the 4th dimension time? So 4D is basically a 3D + animation? i.e. in this case an animation of an expanding sphere. Or am I misunderstanding something?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the universe is finite and unbounded and topographically simple enough then yes object travelling forever in linear motion might eventually arrive back at its initial spot but the object might not have enough time to do so. Even if the object is a photon it can only travel at the speed of light and the distance it has to travel is unknown but has to be at least many hundreds of billions of light years. And it is not guaranteed that the universe will last hundreds of billions of years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have completely neglected to consider that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and no photon will ever escape its observable universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure how the universe could expand at an increasing rate though. Wouldn't that mean that energy would have to be put into the system? Even if it has enough energy to escape eventual collapse /Big Crunch wouldn't it still slow kind of like matter escaping the pull of a black hole?</p>
<p>I like the blueberry muffin analogy where you put dough in the oven and all the blueberries are close together and as it rises and bakes the blueberries move away from each other while the whole expands. The edges of the muffins are like the edges of the universe but expanding at the speed of light from the point of the Big Bang while the blueberries are matter/galaxies in the universe. </p>
<p>I would think redshift would be an indicator that the universe must be noncircular/looped or it could just be that we can't see past the halfway point of what is out there or else it would be blueshifted. Maybe someone could shed some light on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rate of expansion over distances is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble's_law" target="_blank">constant</a>. If you are one megaparsec (Mpc) away from an object, the distance between you and it will grow at ~67km per second. So that means one second from now, you are now 1Mpc + 67km away, and so slightly more than 67km will grow between you and the given object. </p>
<p>Think of it like a space ship accelerating through space. It takes the same amount of energy to accelerate from 0-100km/s that it does to go from 100-200km/s (if we ignore all gravitational and relativistic effects, and there is no drag).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true I have, and so that adds in a whole other set of assumptions. However my understanding is that</p>
<p>a) we do not know for sure that the universe will continue to expand at an accelerating rate or indeed at all</p>
<p>b) we think that if the universe is indeed finite and unbounded as OP assumes, then it will probably stop expanding at some point.</p>
<p>So I think it was a reasonable simplification to just fold expansion into the whole finite/infinite section.</p></div>		</li>
