			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The extra length of the optic nerve is what makes it so that if the eyeball is popped out, it can still be put back in and functional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that work, anyway? How do the eye muscles grip and turn the eye so precisely if they’re not actually anchored to it? If they don’t put the eye back at the exact right angle, is your vision wonky and tilted until your brain adjusts? (I know people will adjust within a few days to wearing goggles that flip everything upside down, so I assume they’d adjust here too.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscles are indeed anchored or attached to the eye ball itself.  Muscles are more stretchy than nerves, but if the globe is displaced too far, it can certainly damage the muscles.  Then it depends on how much and what kind of damage to how many and which muscles.</p>
<p>The end result can be constant double vision for the rest of your life, all the way down to a few of days of intermittent diplopia (double vision)  and then no problems ever again.</p>
<p>The &quot;vision software&quot; can only do so much to fuse the two pictures into one picture if there are misalignment problems.  The people who wore the upside down glasses had no physical damage to any of the musculature, or any misalignment between the right picture/eye and the left picture/eye.  So, not really an apples to apples comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your brain has 12 cranial nerves that control all of the motor and sensory functions of your head and neck (and one that controls smooth muscle in the gut). Of the 12 cranial nerves, 3 are responsible exclusively for movement of the eyes (cranial nerves 3, 4, and 6). The optic nerve is cranial nerve 2 and it controls actual sight, so 1/4 of all the cranial nerves are dedicated to the eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could see where one would get the idea that the muscles aren't anchored to the eye; you can pull your eyelids wide open and roll your eye around and all you see is sclera. It's easy to think of the eye like a ball bearing rolling around in a socket.</p>
<p>But the muscles attach (insert) pretty much right behind the fleshy base of your eyelids - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraocular_muscles" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraocular_muscles</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>It's an fMRI of a person glancing sideways. You can see the optic nerve as a a dark gray bundle coming out of the back of each eyeball.</p></div>		</li>
