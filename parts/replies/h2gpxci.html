			<div class="markdown"><p>I recommend that you bring something physical (like a printout) with the color you want to match. CMYK and Pantone works for a printer. Home Depot made me find the color swatch with the right color and give them the code. </p>
<p>Do not use a computer or phone screen.  Those glow which radically changes how you interpret the color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Odds are the employees aren't trained to use the equipment and software. They probably can't manually enter values into the machine, but there may be a device attracted that will match an existing color. WalMart has one, but I don't think anybody in the store is trained to use it.  The dude making you grab a color Swatch probably only knows how to mix paint by going off of the code on the swatch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tail onto this, most paint stores use about 10 tints, some are only interior (if you use them outside the pigment breaks down rapidly in the sun, so that bright yellow wall will become a dull maybe green tinged)</p>
<p>Computer screens also are different, so if you actually want a colour to be 99% close, you should bring a physical of it. And if it is an extreme colour - like super vibrant green - its best to use their colour selection and pick something close.</p>
<p>Most paint store workers are part timers and paid below 20$/hr with one manager that likely has a business degree. Many wont know about long term of that colour and many won't care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think their education has anything to do with them replicating the color. They're not the engineers that created the machine that mixes the paint. They trained to operate machines that are designed to work one way, and that is either by having the machine scan a sample or use a code from the samples. To automatically mix the paint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any random color picker can do that. The problem is that color on a screen isn't the same as color in real life. What you look at in the dark on least brightness isn't the same color you see in high settings on a bright sunny day. Fluorescent vs LED lighting, ditto.</p></div>		</li>
