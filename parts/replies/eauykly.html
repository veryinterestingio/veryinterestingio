			<div class="markdown"><p>It can't be cured. Letality is almost 100%, with a handful of people surviving it (mostly with irreversible brain damage).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It can be treated for up to 10 days after exposure with a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and the earlier you get it, the higher is the probability that it works. The same method exists for HIV, and the &quot;morning after pill&quot; works the same way basically. There is also a vaccine against rabies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a vaccine against it because if you're bitten by something rabid, the virus can stay dormant in you for quite some time, it can be months before symptoms start showing. If you get vaccinated before then, your body will kill off the virus before it kills you. Once symptoms start showing, though, it's too late.</p>
<p>There have been <em>fewer than 10</em> people to ever survive rabies once symptoms start showing up.</p></div>		</li>
