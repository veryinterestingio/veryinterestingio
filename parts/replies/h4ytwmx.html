			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive a fuel tanker. In my region, the only branded fuel is Shell, Mobil/Exxon,and Chevron/Texaco and Quick Trip. All the other fuel that is in the top tier link listed above is considered “community additive.” Meaning there is nothing that differentiates the fuel from station to station. Costco, Sams club, circle k, 76, all use the same fuel. However, Costco does use their own additive that they blend on site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome that is really good to know. Additives make a huge difference especially on port injected vehicles where they help clean the intake valves. On direct injection engines detergents are also important since those injectors aren’t cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain high octane gas is actually made with a separate process since it's difficult to remove all of the components that cause knock in a cost effective way, as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkylation#Gasoline_production" target="_blank">alkylation of isobutane with low molecular weight alkenes</a> to produce premium gas. This is also the primary reason regular and premium gas don't track each other in price as well as 87 and 89 do. They're a separate process with a different feed-stocks so factors affecting one don't necessarily affect the other the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting…that makes sense. Our Kia recommends premium and I get it because I dip into the turbo a lot. Our Mazda gets regular since that’s what the manual says it needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pre-ignition is different from detonation. I have never heard of pre-detonation.  Although I do know of detonation induced pre-ignition.  Is that what you mean?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right. I thought pre-ignition and knocking were the same thing. They’re related but different. </p>
<p>I’ll make a correction to my post</p></div>		</li>
