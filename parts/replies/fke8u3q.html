			<div class="markdown"><p>How? I'm gonna need to see the method of infection because unless you are intentionally infected, that's impossible to know the exact time, &quot;they&quot; only actually know the suspected times of infections, they just know the chances of the infections happening a different time to be very very slim but still non-zero numbers.
And that's what he's asking, how can you know the &quot;exact&quot; time someone was infected?(unless they were intentionally infected). </p>
<p>You can't because they COULD HAVE been infected by interactions with a 2nd infectious host previously or after the suspected infection. You can't completely rule out the possibility, it's definitely a non-zero number but with each suspected infection, you definitely diminish the chances based on the established suspected symptomatic period of each of those cases.</p></div>		</li>
