			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to be fair, web slinging doesn't actually come from Spiderman's spider powers (in most depictions). They're specialty created devices he puts on his wrists....but maybe if he combined it with cheez whiz....</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.  They’re forcing the spider to risk going to a more contested feeding location.  It’s a risk because other spiders will gladly eat them so they’re going to have to fight for their survival at that point.</p>
<p>Of course if the spider just keeps making new webs in the same spot you might just want to let him leave his web up.  He’s obviously catching a lot of food in that spot to warrant constant rebuilds.</p></div>		</li>
