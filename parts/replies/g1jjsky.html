			<div class="markdown"><p>Just out of curiosity, when we're talking IQ, do we mean the WAIS IQ test that measures verbal, perceptual, processing speed, and working memory? I'm not in psychology but wouldn't depression affect working memory and the kind of focus needed for verbal and perceptual reasoning since it impairs executive functioning? </p>
<p>Also, I think that knowing what they're testing, and how, and why, on WAIS will affect your scores. If you understand the structure of the test you're better able to answer/perform in a way that fits the test.</p>
<p>I had a WAIS administered a few months ago and also did before/after retests in two of the subscales as part of a medication trial for ADHD. My working memory improved by 23 and my processing speed by 3. I think there are factors that can definitely change the scores drastically, including that I was less anxious the second time. </p>
<p>I had done a WISC as a child and my score was significantly (more than one standard deviation) lower. I'm highly educated now and in a better socioeconomic class, so I do think that you'll find there may be more variability than you might expect over a lifetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, such factors can positively influence IQ, good for you! :) I meant tests such as WAIS, yes. We must not forget that one IQ test is not a reliable indicator of your “intelligence”, the construct’s definitions vary and the test results too, depending on factors such as education, mood... as you would not ask a person to lift a weight if their arm is injured, you would not guess at a person’s “innate” IQ when they’re dealing with clinical symptoms.
If that is the case, such a test is used to determine which executive functions are impaired and should be attended to in therapy (as might have been the case for you) :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I overall am not a fan of testing, since it's so incredibly variable and only a small portrait of an entire person. It's a little scary how much weight people still give IQ tests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m ashamed to say I don’t remember much of what was said about IQ in my psych intro class (other than its relative stability and beginnings as a developmental rubric, and so on), but I was under the impression IQ was, in part, a function of the ability to learn (on top of integrating and using various kinds of information, etc)? If depression potentially affects the ability to learn, would this not show up on an IQ test, however marginally?</p>
<p>Or is your point that you could <em>have</em> an IQ of X, but because of depression, you may <em>test</em> at X minus Y points?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what I meant, yes (X minus Y points) :)
Maybe it’s a different question if one is clinically depressed for longer periods of time since childhood / early teen age, where a lot of learning takes place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well so one interesting thing I think I may remember right is that depression is associated with lower hippocampal volume. I can’t help but wonder if this would have a statistically significant effect on the ability to learn or retain information, which I would think would contribute to the former idea of it actually affecting one’s innate (rather than tested) IQ. What do you think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's really important to remember that as a concept, the average IQ is 100.</p>
<p>From that baseline we can generally measure certain positives or negatives, but simply because we are measuring them in the format of a test we are going to require that 'learning new things,' is correlated to IQ.</p>
<p>As a simple example lets say I want you to say the alphabet backwards. You may have never done this before, but we're asking you to do it, and you need to learn how on the spot.</p>
<p>It really isn't that hard to do, but it isn't something your average person has memorized, or is prepared for. Therefore the ability to do it without warning would generally correlate to people who skew o the higher end of the IQ.</p>
<p>IQ is a fairly worthless measurement. I mean, to a point it seems semi-important, but after that point (around one standard deviation above 100) you really get into strange territory. Is someone that is three standard deviations actually smarter than someone who is two standard deviations? Are either of those people smarter than the person who is only one standard deviation ahead?</p>
<p>Even still, certain geniuses are only geniuses in specific fields, and otherwise total rubes. Comparig yourself to someone who has a seemingly natural relationship to a specific field is sort of insane.</p></div>		</li>
