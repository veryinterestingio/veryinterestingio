			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, about 75% of the amino acids are the same between the two. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166309/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166309/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166309/</a></a></p>
<p>Most antibody epitopes are a handful of amino acids that make contact, like 6-7 amino acids. So most antibodies will contain a mutation within their binding epitope, and they may take a hit to binding efficiency, but there will be a handful that bind perfectly fine, and a lot more that bind *just enough* to activate the B-cells and kick off affinity maturation that will let them mutate to bind the new sequence.  So you may get to effective immunity against the new virus a *lot* quicker than someone completely naive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, this family is all very similar. It causes a ton of colds every year, its NORMALLY well behaved. This kinda suggests that we are in the process of wiping out at least some yearly endemic colds.</p>
<p>am I wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like czyivn said, yes around 75% sequence identity. Their RBDs also have \~75% sequence identity. The two spike proteins have very similar structure. Some antibodies will recongnize both spike proteins well and other antibodies will not, determined by how similar the specific binding regions are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said, a slew of papers out today in Cell demonstrated that the antibodies generated by the mRNA vaccines <em>does</em> <em>not</em> effectively neutralize CoV-2 variants that were detected in the UK and South Africa. This may necessitate booster shots that encode the mutations in the S protein</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's essentially two arms to the &quot;adaptive&quot; immune system (the ability to recognize foreign agents after a previous exposure).</p>
<p>The first is pretty easy to measure, somewhat difficult to interpret, and is most familiar to lay people - the B cell antibody response. Easy to measure because you get some cells, add antibodies that you can get easily from serum, then virus and see if the virus can kill the cells. Hard to interpret because we don't have a great way to assess what levels of protection in the lab equate to protection in a human, and it's likely different from person to person.</p>
<p>The second is harder to measure, maybe a little easier to interpret? and most lay people have no idea it exists - the T cell response against infected cells, where T cells recognize infected cells and then target them for killing. Testing T cell responses requires finding specific T cells in the white blood cell fraction, infected cells, and another subclass of T cells that kill infected cells and it's a really technical test to set up. Reading it is a bit easier, but still can be a challenge to interpret.</p>
<p>It's a bit like the air force patrolling and targeting enemy fighter jets and ground troops (B cell response) vs. The army going house to house to find an enemy (T cell response).</p></div>		</li>
