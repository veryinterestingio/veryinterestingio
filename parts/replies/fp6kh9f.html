			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is key.  Many people may hang onto their usual stimulating behavior (excessive junk food &amp; gaming, twitter/facebook/youtube/netflix browsing, etc.) while also attempting to build good habits like working out regularly, but find that the newer, positive behaviors just won't stick.  They try and try to no avail.</p>
<p>Pointing out that the key to adding in these positive habits is to make room, to get bored, by removing your currently unhealthy/over-stimulating behaviors, is very helpful <em>and novel</em> for many people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  In other words, &quot;dopamine detoxing&quot; is entirely effective.  Only the name isn't technically scientifically accurate, but calling &quot;dopamine detoxes&quot; pseudo-scientific just because they used a catchy name with alliteration, when in fact the practice itself is perfectly effective and very helpful, is in itself misleading and damaging.</p>
<p>It's similar to those &quot;independent fact-checkers,&quot; wherein you'll sometimes see an entire body of writing labeled as 'MISLEADING -- FLAGGED BY INDEPENDENT FACT CHECKERS.  Then you read into the reasoning for its misleading' flag, and find that their reasoning was a statement or two the author made that &quot;could be considered subjective,&quot; or that one date was off by a year, or something similar.</p>
<p>In other words, it preys on sending everyone away with a big, &quot;NOPE THIS IS FALSE NOTHING TO SEE HERE,&quot; announcement, but digging into it finds that they just had a vested interest in seeming more educated and nitpicking effective behavioral changes for the sake of flaunting their knowledge of chemistry.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's like having redditors tell you that meditation is &quot;pseudo-scientific bullshit&quot; because you don't know the exact neurochemical processes behind its benefits, even if you, and millions of others, have experienced them for years.</p></div>		</li>
