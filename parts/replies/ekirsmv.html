			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are right. I wondered the same thing last year and researched it pretty well. I saw the types listed as &quot;butterfly&quot; and &quot;mushroom&quot;.  Mushroom is used for commercial popcorn like those in the Christmas cans of flavored popcorn because it has fewer little &quot;wings&quot; that would break off and settle to the bottom as a result of handling the product.  The butterfly type is more crunchy though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once worked at a popcorn place and had to explain it to a guest. He thought it was made of actual mushrooms.</p>
<p>Then again... the people coming there for that shit weren't exactly geniuses...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it also has to do with the moisture content in the kernels being ideal for the heat they will be popped at. Large scale manufacturers probably have it down to a literal science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk if this is the same thing, but my mom gets some weird heirloom type popcorn. It basically has no shell (after it's popped), is slightly smaller than whatever regular popcorn is (the kernel pre and post popping is smaller), but otherwise tastes the same/better. And no risk of anything jabbing your gums. Legit the best popcorn ive ever had. Even better than movie theater stuff.</p>
<p>Iirc... my dad heard about this popcorn on NPR or something. I also think it comes in black and yellow or black and gold plastic bag packaging (i might be wrong about this). You have to cook it on the stove though. I cant remember if they ordered it online or maybe found it at a whole foods somewhere.</p>
<p>Edit: this is it... hiiigghhly recomend</p>
