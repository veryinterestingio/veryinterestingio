<p>Well take that and realize that if there's something that can be bet on it will be. In general all it is is people taking massive amounts of data to bet on things with the largest return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hedge fund characterization isn’t correct. It’s a blanket legal structure and you can’t define it as a vehicle “to take excess risk and not get blown up” (paraphrasing)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, tho the structure basically exists because HFs want to take more risk. So you create a private partnership and make everyone sign on that they know they might get blown up, whereas with mutual funds you can't really do that, and obviously insurance companies / banks would default on their clients which would be a disaster (also, regulations make sure they don't even have the option to take stupid risk).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone interested in the quant field, how important is understanding stochastic calculus? To my understanding, a high degree of math and statistics is required to fully grasp the pricing of certain instruments.
For reference, I am university grad with a degree in statistics with some finance knowledge (ie. put-call parity, basic models like Black-Derman-Toy) so I would say I have a decent understanding of math and statistics but no formal education on stochastic calculus. Would appreciate any kind of insight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So as far as interviews / breaking in go, nice to have but not critical. Read through Heard on the Street to get a feel for your typical technical questions. They will focus questions on your background, so as a CS guy my questions were on algos with some probability mixed in, but math / stats will push stochastic calculus more.</p>
<p>As far as in the job, depends on what sort of product you are in. As a rule though, you are applying the math vs deriving it, so you need to have learned it at some point but it's not like I spend my days writing math equations.</p></div>		</li>
