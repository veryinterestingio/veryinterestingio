When we get a clinical scenario we HAVE to rule out the dangerous stuff because it can be time sensitive or you may end up spending 6k to diagnose something we can't treat.  Kudos to her for jumping to neurologic and moving from there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You spelled osteoarthropathy correctly and in case you were wondering/curious (I had to double check my notes - studying to be a vet tech) Osteoarthropathy means disease of the bones and joints</p>
<p>Osteo - bones
Arthro - joints
Pathy - disease</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah the condition the vet suspected she had was (and this is obviously me paraphrasing) basically where the temporohyoid bone in the (I'm pretty sure) middle ear near the guttural pouch becomes brittle for whatever reason and fractures. She didn't have that condition, but she had somehow fractured that bone. Neurologist said possibly she reared and flipped over which is odd because she's a pretty chill horse that typically keeps all 4 on the ground, and there was zero sign of trauma like swelling or broken skin. They couldn't do surgery because of the hematoma, it was right next to the carotid artery and they were worried about her bleeding out. Guttural pouch infection was a big concern because holy shit those are awful to deal with. We also discussed removing her right eye because she couldn't blink and we were looking at possibly months of recovery.</p>
<p>In the end I opted to take her home with a metric fuckton of meds, steroids, antibiotics and ophthalmic ointment. I did the eye ointment every 2 hours for a couple weeks to keep the eye from drying out and just when I was ready to throw in the towel and schedule surgery I saw her blink. She started regaining movement in her jaw and I was able to wean her off her &quot;hay cube soup&quot; diet, then one day I saw her ear move. We weaned her off the prednis. The hematoma resolved on its own and the bone fragment was absorbed so no surgery ended up being needed at all. Now her right lip droops just a tiny bit other than that she healed up prettyuch 100%.</p></div>		</li>
