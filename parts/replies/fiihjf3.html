			<div class="markdown"><p>The Starlink satellites are not in geostationary orbit, they are at a much, much lower orbit. This means in most circumstances the round-trip time via Starlink will be far lower. 350km orbit vs. 35,000km geostationary.</p>
<p>Instead of having a large diameter cone from high orbit to project coverage over a wide area, the Starlink satellites are set up in a loosely spread &quot;net&quot; over the coverage zone so there will always be multiple in connection range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition they also plan for Starlink to communicate directly from satellite to satellite which can be faster than going through a meandering network of cables and routers buried in the ground.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This means they're much closer to earth, and thus solve the problems with latency with satellite internet.</p>
<p>The advantage of geostationary satellites is that they stay in the same position in the sky, so you can point a (fixed) satellite dish at them. Low Earth Orbit satellites go whizzing past in the sky - so you either need a lot of them in a long line (which is what Elon Musk is doing), or you need really expensive satellite dishes which move with the satellite.</p></div>		</li>
