<p>So i guess we look for movement or some weird reactions but that’s too difficult.</p>
<p>Also we kinda know that other planets have similar...materials and substances to earth. I don’t think there is many or literally any new outside substances.</p>
<p>Therefore we can say other planets and if life exist, it should be similar to the way we are living.</p>
