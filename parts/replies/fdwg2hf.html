<p>&quot;The Great Mambo Chicken have completely taken over the lab now.  They rule over us humans with an iron claw, imposing their will through their brute strength and overwhelming agility.  Our only choice now is between becoming their loyal servants or a delicious 12 piece combo meal.  Science finally went too far.  May God have mercy on our souls!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>UC Davis researchers have found that animals in a centrifuge, which in past experiments have included fruit flies, rats, and early on, primates and even chickens, can eat, drink, and otherwise function and adapt to their hypergravity environment over time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the same way, but translates to plant parts.</p>
<p>Instead of muscles, they grow stabilizing tissues. Scientists were growing trees in a bio dome and they kept collapsing, despite being really healthy. There wasn’t any wind blowing on the trees to get them strong enough to support their own weight.</p></div>		</li>
