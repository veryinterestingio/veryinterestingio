<p>We've gotten good enough at avoiding birds with airliners</p>

<p>How does that work ?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Combination of a few things. Teams on the ground (Bird Teams) who have the job of spotting birds around the airport and getting them to move by use of canons/guns to scare them off. </p>
<p>Visual reports by controllers in the tower cab who can then relay the info to bird teams and the pilots. If a flock is large enough it even comes up on their radar screens.</p>
<p>Us in the flight deck. We have a pretty good view up front and when on approach can usually see larger flocks or larger birds. We can maneuver to an extent and slightly adjust our flight path. Birds will naturally dive when facing a threat, so if I'm eye level with a bird(s), I'll level out or arrest my rate of decent in anticipation that the bird will move out of my way.</p>
<p>Lastly, hitting a bird really isn't a big deal at all. I've hit them numerous times, in small little Cessnas, all the way up to my current airliner that I fly. Hitting a bird in a plane is like running into a large bug, or...a bird, with your car. You're going to get blood/guts on the aircraft, and maybe a small dent if that from where it hit, but that's about it.</p>
<p>Our concern is hitting a massive flock which is usually visually spotted and reported way before we get there. Even if I only pass by a few sea gulls when landing, I always make a report with type of bird and altitude/direction they were going, so the guys landing behind me know where to look.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can confirm, birds are just big messy bugs. Very rarely do they cause damage. Unless they hit the nose dome. Thats where they do most of the damage as its just fiberglass.</p>
<p>If they hit the engine we generally have to do a more thorough inspection. But more often than not when we hear about a bird strike we just grab some alcohol and a scotchbrite pad.</p>
<p>Stupid big messy bugs... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Airports have bird detection systems that are a mix of cameras and radar as well as employing people and dogs to keep the airport free of bird. They're mainly trying to avoid flocks of birds rather than every single one. If you encounter a single bird in the sky it's probably not going to hit anything critical, if you encounter a flock then odds are one of them will hit something important</p>
<p>US 1549(the one that landed in the Hudson) flew through a flock of geese which is why it lost both engines</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The FAA says there were 14,400 wildlife strikes at airports in 2017, with 15.8 million flights per year that's roughly 1 in 1000 odds. Damages due to bird strikes are estimated at ~$400M per year and with a jet engine costing close to $10M it's probably in the 40-400 range, or about 25 engine hits per million flights</p></div>		</li>
