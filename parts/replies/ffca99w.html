			<div class="markdown"><p>In space, if you aren't concerned with recovering the air, you can just use valves that restrict the flow.  Seal the lock and either open a valve that vents it to space or open a valve that vents it to internal atmosphere (but not both at once), wait for it to equalize.</p>
<p>If you want to minimize air losses, you can suck the air out with a vacuum pump (or pre-pumped vacuum bottle) before venting it to space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, assuming the door swings open towards the high-pressure side, it'd be physically impossible to manually open the door while there is any significant pressure differential. Assuming the door has a 2 m^2 area and the handle is 1 m away from the hinge, you'd need 10000 Newtons of force to push it open even against a 0.1 atmosphere pressure difference.</p></div>		</li>
