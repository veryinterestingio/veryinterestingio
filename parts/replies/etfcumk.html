			<div class="markdown"><p>An important difference between our moon and Phobos is that our moon is much farther away, and therefore orbits much slower.  Earth rotates faster than the moon orbits, which means that the tidal drag that Earth exerts on the moon is adding to the moon's orbital energy.  On the other hand, Mars rotates slower than Phobos orbits, so the tidal drag from Mars is removing energy from Phobos' orbit.  So our moon is spiraling away, and Phobos is spiraling in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit" target="_blank">Roche Limit</a> is generally accepted as the delimiter between &quot;moon&quot; and &quot;rings&quot;</p>
<p>The moon is already well outside this limit, and the tidal forces the Moon exerts on the Earth are actually working the other way, as the displaced water slowly increases the Moon's velocity.  This is on an astronomical time scale, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question- yes!!</p>
<p>The key to understanding this is that there is a feedback loop, and the direction of the feedback loop is dependent on the speed a planet rotates and the speed the moon orbits. To understand this feedback loop we need to know a few things. </p>
<p><em>#1</em> The first thing to know is that tidal forces transfer energy (in the form of rotational momentum) from one body to another, and vice versa, due to the whole Newtonian “equal and opposite reactions”</p>
<p><em>#2</em> The second thing to know is that, as a rule, the farther away an object is from its parent body, the slower it orbits. </p>
<p><em>#3</em> The third thing to know is that if you accelerate an object in orbit, it’s orbital path gets bigger (and so it gets farther away from its parent body- this is how a spacecraft orbiting the earth leaves earth’s orbit!)</p>
<p>With these three facts, we can figure this out.</p>
<p>The Moon: Orbits Once a Month
The Earth: Spins ~30x faster than the moon orbits. </p>
<p>The fact that the Earth spins faster than the moon orbits means (thanks to #1) that the tidal force of the moon is slowing the earth’s spin down (to bring it closer to once a month) and the tidal force from the Earth is speeding up the moon’s orbit (to bring it closer to once a day)... or at least, it’s trying to. </p>
<p>However, as the Earth’s tidal force speeds up the moon, the moon’s orbital distance increases. (Because of #3)</p>
<p>Because of rule #2, As the orbital distance increases, the orbit of the moon slows down instead of speeding up! This means that even as the Earth’s spin is slowing down a little due to the tidal force from the Moon,  the relative speed differential is getting bigger! This causes the process to continue, and is why over the past 4 billion years, as the Earth’s day has gotten longer, the moon has drifted away!</p>
<p>Okay, now that we understand the Earth’s Moon... let’s take a look at Mars.</p>
<p>Phobos orbits very close to Mars, which means it orbits very fast. Phobos orbits so fast, in fact, that it orbits faster than Mars spins!</p>
<p>Phobos: orbits every 7.66 hours
Mars: orbits every 25 hours. </p>
<p>This means that Phobos’s orbit is slowing down, due to tidal forces from Mars. But as Phobos is “slowing down”, it’s orbital distance shrinks, so it speeds up. This causes the tidal forces to continue to drag it down, until it gets within the Roche limit and on the surface of Phobos, the gravity of Mars is greater than the gravity of Phobos. When that happens the moon tears apart and forms a ring, or possibly holds together long enough to get dragged down in large chunks, causing a full-on impact.  </p>
<p>Hopefully that explains the difference!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something I know just a little bit about...</p>
<p>If you're using an object at Mars's orbital distance as a jumping-off point to colonize and/or mine the rest of the solar system, then yes, it does make more sense to go to Phobos. So in The Expanse, Ceres is effectively the Belter capital and it's where many of the belt mining ships stop over. But in reality Earth - Phobos, Mars - Phobos, and Phobos - most of the asteroid belt is lower delta V (and therefore cheaper) than Earth - Ceres, Mars - Ceres, and Ceres - most of the belt, respectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BBC ''The Planets'' has an entire episode on Saturn and it discusses exactly that. The mystery was why the rings were reflecting so much light back and why they weren't covered with dust. The discovery was that they were <em>relatively</em> new and there was not enough time for the dust to set in and turn them dark. But they will vanish pretty quickly, just like you said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC they said about 100 million years ago one of Saturn's moons went past the Roche limit and was torn apart by tidal gravitational forces, creating the rings. Cassini discovered that Enceladus was adding new material to the rings but that material from the rings was falling into Saturn much faster than Enceladus could replenish them, and they will likely be gone within another 100 million years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Saturn's rings should be gone in the next 100 million years.</p>
<p>In around the same amount of time, Earth is likely to be hit with an asteroid comparable in size to the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. </p>
<p>In about half that time, the moon Phobos will collide with Mars, and the Canadian Rockies will erode to a plain.</p>
<p>There's a lot more interesting predicted events listed in the link below. It's difficult for some of these predictions to be specific and accurate since they're so far in the future, therefore a lot of them are more of a broad estimate.</p>
