			<div class="markdown"><p>Feynman became most known because of that demo but it wasn't like he cracked the case. </p>
<p>nasa and the SRB vendor Thiokol knew the hazard of the cold weather launch including brittle oring failure. It had been identified for a decade as an issue. Feynman most profound comments were on the NASA culture that allowed the launch to go forward despite the risk due to normalization of deviance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story: it was Sally Ride that actually first suspected the O-rings. It was believed she wouldn’t be taken seriously so the idea was planted in Richard Feynman’s mind (like Inception!).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the investigation was extremely sensitive, and Ride chose to leak evidence to an Air Force General, Donald J. Kutyna, who was then able to pass the information on to physicist Richard Feynman. Feynman, as a free agent, could then bring the evidence to light without fear of damaging his career, to ensure that life-saving changes were made to future shuttle designs.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a really amazing story. As relayed by Kutyna to Popular Mechanics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sally Ride and I were walking together. She was on my right side and was looking straight ahead. She opened up her notebook and with her left hand, still looking straight ahead, gave me a piece of paper. Didn't say a single word. I look at the piece of paper. It's a NASA document. It's got two columns on it. The first column is temperature, the second column is resiliency of O-rings as a function of temperature. It shows that they get stiff when it gets cold. Sally and I were really good buddies. She figured she could trust me to give me that piece of paper and not implicate her or the people at NASA who gave it to her, because they could all get fired...</p>
<p>I wondered how I could introduce this information Sally had given me. So I had Feynman at my house for dinner. I have a 1973 Opel GT, a really cute car. We went out to the garage, and I'm bragging about the car, but he could care less about cars. I had taken the carburetor out. And Feynman said, &quot;What's this?&quot; And I said, &quot;Oh, just a carburetor. I'm cleaning it.&quot; Then I said, &quot;Professor, these carburetors have O-rings in them. And when it gets cold, they leak. Do you suppose that has anything to do with our situation?&quot; He did not say a word. We finished the night, and the next Tuesday, at the first public meeting, is when he did his O-ring demonstration.</p>
