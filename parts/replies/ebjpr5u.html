<p>KMOX was one of the first radio stations to called an international radio station. &quot;It's signal could be heard as far as New Zealand and the Arctic Circle and it's signal has been picked up in Scotland and South Africa.&quot; <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMOX" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
<p>Fun fact one of the reason why there's so many Cardinals fans in the Midwest outside STL is because 1120 broadcasted their games, and during the night when the games were usually held, the clouds bounced the signal further extending the range and also the distance Cardinals fans can be seen from STL!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like there should be a flare for actual five year old explanations. Like this sub does a great job of simplifying answers to our questions, but still feel at a somewhat advanced reading level, like middle or high school level. </p>
<p>Sometimes I really do wanna go back into that 5-year-old-me mindset and learn about all the things!</p></div>		</li>
