			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I should also add that there are far more than 3 states of matter. The three you're familiar with are by far the most common states on Earth, but plasma is also sometimes present here as well. In more extreme settings you can have other, more exotic states.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are also chemicals that, under normal circumstances, will break down or react long before they reach a different state of matter (for example, wood will burn before it melts).</p>

<p>Does that mean that wood in a vacuum could actually melt? Or will it still turn to carbon when it gets hot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood might be a bad example because it isn't a single chemical but a mixture of them, each with it's own reactivity and properties. Wood is mostly sugar-based compounds which means it's mostly oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. A vacuum wouldn't do it, but if you heated wood WITHOUT ADDITIONAL OXYGEN you'd get a mix of random volatile gases along with some liquid hydrocarbons. </p>
<p>So... no can't really liquify wood as &quot;liquid wood&quot; but by playing with temperature you can turn wood in liquid... which is not...wood... does that make sense?</p></div>		</li>

<p>At normal pressures, you'd get coal. This is precisely how charcoal is made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Wood&quot; is extremely complex as it's not just one element or compound. Each compound in it would go through it's states and potentially react with the others. Seeing as wood is mostly carbon and water. Visually you'd see it turn into charcoal(carbon). Heating it further would result in carbon evaporation. I don't believe pure carbon in liquid form has been experimentally achieved on earth with any stability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't melt. It would decompose into smaller compounds when you heat it. Wood is a mixture of lots of things, and such a mixture mostly wouldn't have a defined melting point to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(Water would show the same behavior at lower pressures, going right from ice to vapor without a liquid state. </p>

<p>This is exactly the way the process of freeze drying works to remove all of the water and yet retain the shape of freeze dried foods.</p></div>		</li>
