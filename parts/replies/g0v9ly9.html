<p>Thus only 20% of people with coronavirus antibodies reported having had a symptom of COVID-19, such as high fever, runny nose, nausea, sore throat, diarrhoea or chest pain.</p>

<p>I can see this is a direct quote from the link, but I don't understand it. Doesn't everybody get runny noses fairly frequently?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WHO actually doesn't state runny nose as a symptom at all. In Estonia we have to keep track of it, too. It has been looked at like any other COVID symptom.
You shouldn't get runny nose too frequently unless you are allergic or have it as something chronic (as many nordic people have because it's cold and moist most of the time)</p></div>		</li>

<p>many people with a- to low-symptomatic infections don't produce antibodies</p>

<p>uh, what? Got any actual medical sources on that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, wrong, my data was outdated already (damn this moves fast, I can't keep up anymore)</p>
<p>Asymptomatic people do produce neutralizing antibodies, at least IgM in useful amounts, but become seronegative again faster and more commonly than symptomatic people. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6</a>  That was where my wrong information came from, the time by when people are tested matters. 2-3 months later is too late. </p>
<p>But, that was new to me too, a longer-lasting T-cell response was found even in asymptomatic people who didn't have antibodies. That could be enough of an immunity to protect against recurring infections. Still needs to be followed up on, but could be good news. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.174888v1" target="_blank">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.174888v1</a></p></div>		</li>
