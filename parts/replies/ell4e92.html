			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably could, but many pages wouldn't work at all if you block out all the scripts.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: because there are so many questions on this reply: a well-done web page would of course work also with scripts disabled – possibly with a somewhat reduced functionality, but still. Unfortunately, not all web pages are well-done :-(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been using adblock plus and a script blocker basically as long as there's been ads and scripts on the www.</p>
<p>In the last few years I mainly use scriptsafe, but sometimes noscript.  </p>
<p>The idea that a lot of the web won't work without scripts is BS.  </p>
<p>For maybe 95/100 websites I either don't have to enable any scripts, or enable only the top level domain.</p>
<p>For another 4/100 I have to enable a couple of subdomains.  </p>
<p>The last 1/100 is such a clusterfuck of scripts going infinitely deep that I end up saying &quot;Y'know, I didn't really need to go there anyway&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Once in a while I use somebody else's computer, or use mine on a fresh install forgetting to install the adblocker and script blocker, and OMGWTF!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Often you need to whitelist some script in order to get the page to work. In that case, you can just use ublock to hide the nagware message (using the &quot;element picker&quot; button).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait so this clicks every ad? That would get a lot of peoples websites banned from Google Adsense or other services. This means small websites with 1-3 people teams would get not just no income from you clicking ads (as with Adblock) but also get permanently banned and forcefully taken away the ability to make any money.</p>
<p>That seems like a jerk approach</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AdNauseum is a silly kneejerk reaction which seems like a good idea, until you actually think about it.</p>
<p>First of all, no privacy. Clicking every ad means every ad is loaded, which means the ad is still tracking your browsing habits perfectly. (You can't generate valid clicks otherwise.)</p>
<p>Second, detecting and handling someone who clicks every ad (or even just more often than normally) is really simple if you can only be bothered to do it (which Google obviously can). All you need to do is to look at the normal distribution and any behavior/data outside 2 or 3 standard deviations can simply be ignored.</p>
<p>Then the second step is to look at the bigger picture using machine learning which, again of course, Google certainly does. I have advertised with Google and every now and then you automatically get some of the cost of clicks subtracted because Google figured out it was fake.</p>
<p>Which means that, you might be a bit annoying possibly, but it really doesn't affect the site showing the ad, Google or the advertiser in the end. I mean, the least AdNauseum could do if they thought about it would be to click a small random percentage of the ads or something, that might at least be a little tricky. (But you're up against Google so no, not really.)</p>
<p>Additionally, if you put on your tinfoil hat, Google can now easily know that you're one of those assholes who click ads out of spite, which means you actually have less privacy and when Google takes over the world you'll be a prime target for elimination =P</p>
<p>Edit: Also it might be interesting to know, while Googles ad platform still works on a &quot;cost per click&quot; model, it's now tied very closely to &quot;leads/acquisitions&quot; (if the advertiser enables and configures it). Basically, the advertiser will tell Google each time they get a valuable action from a user (like making a purchase, or signing up for something) and how valuable that action actually is. How much the advertiser is willing to bid for a click is then automatically adjusted according to this.</p>
<p>If a sign up is worth 2 dollars and 10% of ad clickers sign up then the advertiser automatically gets 20 cents as cost per click max bid. Users who always click (because of AdNauseum) but never go trough with anything will simply lower the cost per click, and the advertiser would effectively pay the same per number of sign ups in the end. (Assuming Google actually counted those clicks.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It still has to prevent the script that's detecting the blocked ads from going to the mirrored page.
But then we could just remove that without doing any extra steps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm probably missing something, but it seems like one way to ultimately solve it is to load the ad, but simply show a blank area where the ad would be (instead of removing the area). Then, I assume, the anti-ad-blocker wouldn't be able to figure out that the ad was blocked.</p></div>		</li>
