<p>Some people even invented flavored water like that, it's normal water but you drink it with a flavor perfume under your nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never seen the kitchen removed from the softened supply. Around here, the refrigerator is the only thing on hard water. Or maybe a separate drinking water tap. But the kitchen faucet itself is on softened water so the dishes rinse clean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine is set so the cold supply at the kitchen sink is not softened water. This is done for drinking purposes. Ironically, when I got the new refrigerator I put that supply on softened water to avoid mineral deposits. It supplies drinking water as well as ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that there is supposed to be either a hard water tap or a RO tap in the kitchen if you have a whole house softener. It would make sense if the refrigerator (with a water dispenser) is the dedicated tap for this purpose instead of the sink itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how you grew up. I grew up in a house where barely anybody washed the dishes, and grew up to abhor kitchen sink water because of it. It took getting a filter and a carbonation machine to actually drink water that didn't come from bottles.</p></div>		</li>
