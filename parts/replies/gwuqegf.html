			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't we deal with this problem with bigger microscopes? Like if a camera is too close to your nose the camera might not be able to focus your ears or something just behind you. But if you take a picture from further away  with a good res camera than you can focus more stuff since relative distance of your-nose-to-camera and your-ears-to-camera is very close now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, you could zoom out the microscope (ie, take an image from further away), but that kind of defeats the entire purpose of a microscope.</p>
<p>Remember that the camera on your phone is just auto-focusing based on the distance to whatever it thinks you're pointing it at. If you put it too close to your nose, the phone thinks you're trying to take a picture of your nose so it focuses on that. If you're able to manually adjust the focus, you could set it so your ears are in focus instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The refractory nature of water (assuming this is the most common medium on the side) might cause the “step back” to not totally resolve the relative distance (read: relative visual/focusing distance, whatever the technical name for that might be) between the specimens suspended at varied distances from the lens, unlike the nose ears example which involves only air between objects and the lens. A guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the second question is quite the conundrum of a yes/no :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Weren't they suppose to move on a 3D space and we should see them changing their size because they move closer or further from the lens?</p>
