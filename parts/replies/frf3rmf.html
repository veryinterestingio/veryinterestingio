			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure of the specific pathways to be honest with you. I’m assuming certain conditional changes trigger the cells to make proteins that alter the expression of the plastids DNA. My botany training thus far is a bit limited so I’m not sure on specific details. </p>
<p>One cool is example is the de-etiolation of amyloplasts into chloroplasts via sun exposure. That’s a classic example of plastid conversion.</p></div>		</li>
