<p>So, to be technical about it, there really just isn't a good or accurate way to describe human vision in PPI.</p>

<p>That may be, but there has to be a limit beyond which it no longer makes any practical sense to go. It may be hard to define as a formula, but you could test empirically and find a screen resolution beyond which no test subject ever notices the difference. Everybody shoot for that limit and then stop developing in that direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but there's no need to give up. </p>
<p>For example, say it's a laptop. The distance is arm's length. The size is no bigger than large laptop screen. Now find a resolution beyond which no one ever notices the difference. The end. Never waste your money buying a laptop with a higher resolution.</p>
<p>Same with a wall screen. Pick an average size and average distance based on actual viewing habits. Find a resolution beyond which no one ever notices the difference. Take it a little higher to cover outliers, edge cases. When everyone stops noticing the difference, you're done. </p>
<p>And so on. There have to be limits beyond which it just doesn't matter to the human eye and brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well kinda, think of a VR headset, make the screen fill your entire field of view.</p>
<p>Assuming the guy above us right, 575ppi at 1ft is right. You have a horizontal field of view of 210° and vertical of 150°. Do some math and at one foot you would need a 44x31.5 inch display to fill your entire field of view.</p>
<p>Then you would max your eyes out at 23,300x18,100px. This is roughly 51x the number of pixels on a 4K display. But it's an upper limit in the resolution of any display, the only conceivable situation that could use a higher resolution is a room that you can turn your head and don't expect to see everything at once. Also, it doesn't matter the size, as this display exceeds your eyes unless you are so close you can't see the whole display.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting thing is that many perceptual properties which we might intuitively believe should behave in some sort of step function (i.e., I can see pixels up to point 'X' and there after I cannot see pixels) don't in fact exhibit this pattern. </p>
<p>It's much more common for the result to be a sigmoid function, where the probability of detecting pixels drop-off asymptotically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a formula that defines a hard upper  limit. The rayleigh criterion, which is a formula used in optics and astronomy that describes the maximum distance an object or light source can be from a telescope of known aperture before it is physically impossible to discern if it is one object or two. no matter how much magnification is used. So if we know the maximum dilation of a human pupil we can calculate the maximum resolution is is physically possible for any eye, no matter how sophisticated, to be able to resolve two pixels instead of one.</p>
<p>Whoich is obviously going to be much higher than the actual limit for human eyes. But its kinda cool that there is a maximum we can calculate that would be too much even for the most perfect hawk eyes</p></div>		</li>
