			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered if we could get more accurate weather models if we increased the amount of sensors/stations we have collecting data. </p>
<p>Assuming everyone who has this model phone was sending their data along with their geolocation back to the cloud would this information actually be useful to weather forecasts? </p>
<p>Assuming this type of technology expands what other sensors would it make since to put in a phone that could help refine weather models?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently some of this data does make it into models, it's not widely accepted mainly because the accuracy cannot be verified to a level that the QC would accept. But if enough people have calibrated recently and have it still for a long period of time, left on a desk at work, for example, it can be used but with a smaller weighting. They can also use it in verification work, if they have enough sensors in an area the averages should help make the models better but again we're talking errors on errors so it's still not a reliable source of data for modelling purposes. A personal weather station set up, calibrated and certified would be more likely to be used than just your phone's reading.</p>
<p>As for other data, it's unlikely, from what I gather from the verification teams the only thing they regularly use from the routine observations at a certified weather station is the pressure and temperatures. Temperature on a phone is too influenced by your body or room temperature for it to be accurate enough most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what FancyDuke has said, over-the-horizon radar and weather satellites give much better information than a collection of local sensors.</p>
<p>In addition, pressure drops occur for fronts coming in over the next few hours. If you live in a moderately populous area, chances are there is a weather station with radar that can track incoming fronts already, so the phone data will be clustered in areas where we already have high quality radar data.</p>
<p>On that note, weather radar means that morning weather predictions tend to be quite accurate. Same-day forecasts are now over 90% accurate, and even four or five day forecasts are quite good. However, the innovation that has pushed accurate forecasting farther into the future is primarily improvements to modeling, not a lack of data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spent a couple years trying to do this with our startup, PressureNet. It was tough to get weather companies on board, it was tough to try to clean the data enough to be used in rigorous weather models. Turns out there were other unanticipated applications for the data such as hyper local altitude measurements for indoor position tracking (think retail analytics in malls). It was a fun project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Helicopter Pilot here, we are constantly updating our altimeter based on whatever weather reporting system we happen to tune up as we're flying by. Using that information, we can have a general idea of how fast weather may be moving into the area. For example, a change of an altimeter setting 30.00 (inches of mercury) to 29.99 over the span of an hour generally means weather is changing slowly. Now if it goes from 30.00 to 28.90 in the course of an hour means pressure is dropping rapidly and that bad weather may be coming in fast.</p>
<p>This is just a simple tool to help us make decisions on weather, using still of course observed weather, radar and forecasts etc.</p>
<p>Using your phone in this way would be great when you're out hiking, or otherwise going to be outside for a while. Noticing a steady drop in pressure can help you clue in that it might be time to head back inside sooner than later.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does the lift in flight affect cabin pressure and so altimeter readings? You might notice a change during takeoff and landing.  </p>
<p>Or is the altimeter sensor at the tip of the tail?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wait, if they're hiking, they're going up in altitude, which means a pressure drop is expected. </p>
<p>i can even see my smartphone sensor values increase and decrease as I go up  and down elevators, lol. they're very sensitive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure he doesnt mean actually looking at, but looking at coming later. For example if its a suuuper windy day but clear out you might wonder if its gonna storm later. Check the thingy, pressures droppin, windy cuz storm clouds are gonna be blowin in, boom. Pressure rising but windy, no storm comin but a warm front instead. Boom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, pressure tends to drop before you can see the storm right? Some storms come on too quickly, but for most of the year this works.</p>
