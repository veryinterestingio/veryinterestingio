			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really curious. Even when considering how weak force and gravity, by themselves, allow for very rare interactions, why is it so unlikely that they will not collide with another particle, when shot through objects of considerable size (I remember CERN shooting them towards the laboratory under Italy's central mountains), taking into account the sheer numbers of other particles?</p></div>		</li>

<p>So when you say 'sheer number of other particles' I assume you mean the particles in the 'target' rather than the particles in the beam (because to get measurably high reaction rates for rare reactions we just make beams of ridiculously big numbers of neutrinos!).</p>
<p>When you think of collisions, I bet you're imagining something like shooting bullets randomly in a really dense forest and thinking &quot;it'll hit a tree trunk eventually because all I see in every direction is tree trunks!&quot; The reality of particle physics is so much more subtle, and depends on things like the 'strength' of the force and the abundance of things to interact with and the energy of the beam and even how <em>likely</em> an interaction is at that <em>specific</em> energy. </p>
<p>For example, consider the silicon and oxygen atoms in transparent glass. The spacing between atoms is about 1.5 angstoms (10^(-10) meters) while the nuclei are about 2 to 3 femtometers (10^(-15) meters). This means that in glass more than about 60,000 atoms thick (which is only 0.01 mm!) there is a nucleus on <em>every</em> line of sight through that glass. So why doesn't this stop visible light? The visible light simply doesn't 'care' about the nuclei! The energy of visible light is so low that it basically <em>can't</em> interact with the nucleus.  Ultimately, the transparency to visible light is about the structure of the electron shells (and all of chemistry).</p>
<p>I know this is a rough analogy which isn't exactly about neutrinos, but I think it gives a sense of how the particle physics is so incredibly nonintuitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazing explanation and illustration. What really caught me by surprise is that a 0.01mm thick layer of glass is 60000 atoms thick. Which is about the same thickness as a thin sheet of plastic wrap. That's the first time I feel like I can grasp the size of an atom. It's somewhat measurable as opposed to being so small that it's impossible to imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fascinating.  I've always considered the matter we experience very sparse/not dense, when you consider things like neutron stars.  But it's interesting that because of the sheer volume of them, they take up a lot of surface area.  Thanks for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The very non-scientific explanation I liked (and which leaves a lot out for an aha moment of clarity) is that a beam line of neutrinos sent to a target is still basically like throwing a small handful of sand through a spiderweb (most atoms are empty space) and you still only get a couple of the interactions. We send millions a day to NoVa and Minerva in Minnesota from Fermilab, and we still only get a handful of measurable interactions per week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weak force interactions have an extremely small range -- within the nucleus. Furthermore , without going into detail it's very unlikely for an allowed weak force interaction to occur in a stable atom due to conservation of energy .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm fascinated by how our instrumentation can now detect big stellar events using three new technologies <em>besides</em> optical, all developed over my own lifetime: </p>
<p>neutrino astronomy</p>
<p>gravity-wave astronomy</p>
<p>non-light EM astronomy (radio, x-ray, gamma ray)</p>
<p>Most interesting to me is how information about a stellar event arrives at different times (IIRC, neutrinos arrive before the EMs and after the gravity wave) and what this data distribution over time tells us about stellar event structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrino beams are easy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Underground_Neutrino_Experiment" target="_blank">DUNE,</a> for example, uses an accelerator that smashes protons into a target which produces particles which decay into neutrinos. They angle the beam down into the ground to shoot the neutrinos through the earth from <a href="https://www.dunescience.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/LBNE_Graphic_061615_2016.jpg" target="_blank">Fermilab in Chicago to a neutrino detector in a mine underground in South Dakota, because it's not like the rock gets in the way!</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating! Just for clarity - after reading the wiki, it seems like this beam isn't set to start until sometime in 2026, with final implementation in 2027 or am I reading that wrong? </p>
<p>Thanks for sharing, it really is awesome to be able to learn about this stuff on a random sunday whilst cruising the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is going on this very moment. There are several accelerator neutrino sources, the main ones in USA are the NuMI and BNB, both at Fermilab. The BNB (Booster Neutrino Beam) has lower intensity and the neutrinos it produces are studied in a relatively low beamline (~km). NuMI, on the other side, has way higher intensity (I think one order of POT more, aka the number of protons that are shot on the target) and it is most suitable for long baseline experiments (NoVA for instance). Out of the US, you should go to Japan and the J-PARC neutrini facilities.</p></div>		</li>
