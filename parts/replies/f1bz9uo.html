			<div class="markdown"><p>Math moved beyond that a long time ago; its it's own thing now. Or put another way, math is <em>one component of</em> the language we use to describe the universe.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we could find out that relativity is wrong, and not a single math theorem would be invalidated. Some might be less important, but anything that's been proven will still hold true. In contrast, one of the central tenets of natural sciences is that <em>nothing</em> is ever proven: only corroborated until you have a high degree of confidence.</p>
<p>Science uses observation and logic (ie math) to form hypotheses and predictions, and that whole bundle is the language that describes the universe.</p></div>		</li>
