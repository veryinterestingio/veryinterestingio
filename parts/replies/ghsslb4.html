			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the same basic principle used by lots of online outfits. </p>
<p>See, when you make the supply of a product or service exclusive to your company, we have a word for that. It's called &quot;a monopoly&quot; and it's illegal. The authorities will break up your company (in theory) when that happens.</p>
<p>So instead of monopolising supply, companies have started to monopolise demand. That is to say, they are making <em>customers</em> exclusive to them, rather than products. This is what Amazon, Facebook and Walmart try to do. They hoard all the customers, wall them off and then squeeze suppliers for money in return for access to those customers.</p>
<p>It's a legal monopoly; authorities still haven't caught on yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not that they havent caught on, its that the conditions by which it is by a legal definition 'anti-competetive' are pretty specific.</p>
<p>For instance, Microsoft sort of got dinged for with the whole netscape/ie thing because they were leveraging their total domination of the desktop os market to kill off a competitor in another space. One of the reasons they lost that judgment was that it was determined consumers really didn't have a choice in OS besides Windows. You cant really make that argument for amazon or wal mart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>.... That's not a monopoly though. If you're pulling in and keeping all the customers because you offer the best service... Then you're just providing quality business.</p>
<p>If customers can still choose other places (as a downgrade) then you don't have a monopoly. You're just the best business that offers that service. There has to be &quot;the best&quot; by definition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really following you. It is not illegal that Apple is the only company that sells iPhones. And it wouldn't be illegal if they made an exclusive contract with a store chain so there was only one store that sold iPhones either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honey will also be collecting data (across multiple businesses) about what offers users actually went for, and what price points sold the most, so they can build predictive models of what types of products and price points would be good candidates for future offers.</p>
<p>This could be applied both generally (what kind of offers are popular in general) and specifically to <em>you</em> (what kinds of offers have <em>you</em> gone for in the past?  We'll offer <em>you</em> similar discounts/products at other participating stores.)</p>
<p>And (at least in theory) they could also sell the data they collect about you and your purchasing habits to other advertisers.  I'd have to sit down and sift through their user agreement to see if it mentions anything about that, although it is a popular practice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That aside, there are several site I shop on that don't advertise coupon code that honey has gotten through user submissions (from email ads and such)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you always have ad blockers running while you shop?  I don't have any inside info or anything, but I would expect Honey is using similar technology to track user activity with their program, and they probably reserve the better discounts for users who engage frequently or in more profitable ways.</p>
<p>But if you're running an ad blocker, their data collection about you will be limited or non-existent, so you'd likely only get to &quot;entry level&quot; offers, forever.  As far as they know, every time is your first time.</p>
<p>Not trying to preach the wonders of ad tracking or anything (it's BS I agree), but this is what happens when you block it.  The ads don't stop coming, they just stop being <em>personalized</em>.</p></div>		</li>
