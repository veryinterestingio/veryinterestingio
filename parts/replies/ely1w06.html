			<div class="markdown"><p>To further ELI5:</p>
<p>hold you hands out wide in front of you. Imagine everything within your arms appearing in a photo. How small would the moon be in that photo?</p>
<p>Now bring your arms closer together centered around the moon and imagine this is a new photo. How big would the moon be in this new photo? Bigger right?</p>
<p>This is effectively what happens in a wide angle and a telephoto lens photo. </p>
<p>Your eyes work a little differently in the sense that they have a wide field of view, but your brain is better at selectively focusing on something in that view - like the moon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think that is a part of it.  The other thing is that things in a photo seem smaller because the photo is smaller.  If you blew that photo up so it took up your eyes whole field of view, that moon would look the same size it does IRL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more than just a part.  It is my understanding that a 55mm lens has roughly the same field of view as your eye, which is why it was so commonly used in SLR's before telephotos became the standard lens of choice.  </p>
<p>Take a  shot of the moon with a 55 mm lens and it still is just a tiny dot.   The rest is perception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain is good at isolating information that you see which is why you think you’re seeing a great “picture” of the moon. </p>
<p>A camera isn’t as biased when it takes a picture - everything in the field of view gets an equal importance. </p>
<p>Photographers are good at looking at a scene and understanding how a camera will see that scene. Small distractions like garbage in the corner of the shot or a pipe sticking out behind your head ruin a photograph but you don’t notice them when just looking at a person. That’s your brain being selective about what it’s focusing on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: the &quot;tele&quot;- part of the word &quot;telephoto&quot; comes from Greek, and it means &quot;distant, far.&quot; It's the same root as in &quot;telephone,&quot; &quot;teleportation,&quot; and &quot;television.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Photograph&quot; also comes from Greek roots, specifically &quot;light&quot; + &quot;recording.&quot;</p>
<p>So when you use a telephoto lens, you are literally creating a <em>recording of distant light.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here! Realizing the relationship between languages and how they share similar prefixes/suffixes helps so much when reading. It's fun when you can identify country of origin and then get towards literal meaning. Can't say how maybe times I've gotten by using elevated &quot;context clues&quot; like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A small photography pet peeve of mine, telephoto =/= zoom.</p>
<p>Telephoto is a long focal length narrow field of vision lens used for taking pictures of objects at a great distance.</p>
<p>Zoom is a lens that can change focal length.</p>
<p>Not all telephotos have zoom. Not all zooms are telephoto. However, many telephotos and zooms are the same lens, as they are typically from ~35 to ~200 mm as to be most useful to a hobbyist photographer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know, that’s why I mentioned it in ( )! Some people who haven’t heard the word telephoto know it as a “zoom lens”. At least back when I was 5. Kids these days are smarter.</p></div>		</li>
