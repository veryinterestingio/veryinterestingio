			<div class="markdown"><p>I made a comment above, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/bgipdq/eli5_how_do_websites_know_when_you_are_using_an/ellhux3/" target="_blank">here</a> in reply to another comment in this same reddit post. I'll quote myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anyone else is also interested in further information on ad-blocking beyond just AdBlocker style extensions/apps/scripts/etc, you should give /r/pihole a check. Pi-hole uses a Raspberry Pi as a DNS for your network. A DNS looks up the IP address of websites - and the addresses of various elements loaded into a webpage - such as ads. When a blacklisted (ad/malware/untrusted) address is queried the pi-hole will give your browser a false (or broken) IP address so that nothing is returned to you - effectively removing the ad entirely. Since the object isn't blocked in the same way AdBlocker will block them, the website will (usually) see that you have actually queried for the ad, but it does not detect that loading failed, thus effectively allowing you to avoid anti-adblocking.</p>
<p>The pi-hole DNS doesn't block, it gives you the wrong address so ads are simply not loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, there doesn't seem to be a way for people/companies to detect this, and considering it could always just be a routing/network error that's causing it and not a &quot;blocker&quot;, <del>it's</del> I'm not certain they definitely could stop it. But I'm not a big networking guy, so maybe they eventually will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My usual solution is to turn off javascript on the site, so only the js in my adblocker is running. Most websites work just fine without it, and only a few cosmetic features are missing.

<p>This is <em>really</em> counter to my experience. I guess it depends on the types of websites one tends to visit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a stretch. Web apps like Spotify use lots of JS, it didn't mean it slow. Any site programmed in React or Vue uses JavaScript.</p>
<p>If a site needs JS to run it isn't slow, it's complex.  If a site is slow it is because it uses lots of JavaScript that it doesn't need, and that JavaScript is badly programmed. If the site <em>needs</em> the JavaScript for functionality, than it probably will be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because adblocker is stopping those from loading? :D basically you'd probably see an empty window and as an end user you'd have no clue as to what is going on, a window explaining what's going on would is better.</p>
<p>You could manually put an ad there i guess but that wouldn't count towards the clicks you're getting paid for. Not to mention you'd have to switch ads manually wich is also not practical. Specifically the thing that makes ads apear is targeted and you need that to get clicks on them for wich you get payed.</p></div>		</li>
