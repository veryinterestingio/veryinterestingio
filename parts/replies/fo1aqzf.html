<p>Using one of those to measure the temperature of something aluminum is like asking what color is a mirror.</p>
<p>I have a grill with an outer sheet of aluminum.  Even when the grill is fully fired up, one of these will tell me that it's still ambient temperature</p></div>		</li>

<p>Everything emits infrared radiation as long as it's above absolute zero and if it gets hot enough it starts emitting visible light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A small correction/elaboration, any object that is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings (i.e., Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) will emit light at a frequency dictated by that object's temperature- Blackbody radiation. Those frequencies can be anywhere from the longest radio waves all the way to gamma rays (although &quot;hard&quot; UV or &quot;soft&quot; X-rays are usually the highest you'll find in nature since the Big Bang).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/pm_me_all_ur_money gave a correct technical description, but let me give a more qualitative one. The frequency (or wavelength; they are inversely related) of light tells us where the Electromagnetic Spectrum it lies. Very long wavelengths (small frequencies) correspond to radio waves- very short wavelengths to gamma rays. In between (from long to short wavelengths), there are microwaves (yes, <em>that</em> microwave), infrared, visible (the teeny tiny part that our eyes can perceive), ultraviolet (UV), and X-rays (yes, <em>those</em> X-rays). If you zoom in to the region containing X-rays and UV, there isn't a hard demarcation between them, so we give them names like &quot;soft X-rays&quot; or &quot;hard UV&quot; to mean light that is inbetween what we normally call X-rays and UV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah! Is that why the first color something hot becomes is red? It's the lowest frequency visible light? And the reason we never see it turn blue, for example, (and instead turn white) is that it always emits every lower frequency light, just in addition to whichever frequencies are unlocked by an even hotter temperature? And if you had blue plastic film, you'd be able to see the hot object give off more and more blue, the blue that is usually combined with green and red when the object becomes white hot. Can something become so hot that it gives off uv rays?</p>
<p>Man, science is fun to think about</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's why things start glowing red hot first.  You wouldn't necessarily see blue because it would emit all other colors as well and just start glowing white hot.  Certain metals will burn hot enough to start emitting UV light like flares.  That's actually how some modern missiles distinguish between a flare and an enemy aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, yes and yes.</p>
<p>Anything hotter than 1500-ish Kelvin starts to emit UV light (but it's not really noticable until the object hits 4000K)</p>
<p>At 5500-ish Kelvin the object appears a very pure white because  it emits heat radiation evenly across the visible spectrum, but much of the radiation is in the UV or infrared range.</p>
<p>At 8,000K it will appear blu-ish, but emit the majority of its heat radiation as ultraviolet. This colour will become a more saturated blue as it heats up, until at 40,000K it will be a pure blue inferno. This is why stars with a very hot surface are called Blue Giants (theoreticly there will also be blue dwarfs one day, but the universe isn't sufficently old)</p>
<p>At 6,000,000K or more the heat radiation consists mostly of X-rays. So even if the sun didn't get its power from Fusion there would still be X-rays at the center of the sun because it's so hot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of these style of thermometers will have a cone diagram on the side referencing how far away the object is and how large the sample size will be (mine has a 1” sample circle at 8” distance, 2” circle at 16”, etc)</p>
<p>You dont have to be very far from the front if the thermometer before the laser point is included in the sample area</p>
<p>The laser is very low energy and wont change anything in the time it takes you to get your reading</p></div>		</li>
