			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: yes the socket &quot;moves&quot; </p>
<p>Bone throughout your body is constantly destroying and replacing itself, including the bone in your jaw. </p>
<p>Orthodontists use this to their advantage by applying pressure to the teeth (and thereby to the ligaments and bone) to amplify bone destruction in the direction we want the tooth to go.  The tooth slowly moves into the space created as the bone is destroyed and new bone is deposited on the back side of where the tooth used to be.  So, over time, the position of the socket moves as the tooth is moved through the bone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why then, after having a brace and going through that process, do you need to continue to wear a retainer at nights the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Otherwise your teeth revert to the previous positions, why don't they stay once the bone has been destroyed/deposited on the relevant sides?</p></div>		</li>
