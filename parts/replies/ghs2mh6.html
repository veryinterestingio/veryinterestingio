			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, I grew up in Midwest America and was in HS choir. We did a lot of older choral music (not much modern/musical/pop type music) and our choir director always told us to think about singing with a British accent. It particularly helped to avoid the nasally sounding short A sound that is prevalent in the Midwest. We didn’t actually sound British when we sang, but it helped with rounder, fuller sound.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Over Barcelona today, the famed reindeer was hit by a flock of seagulls and a 747.
Eyewitnesses report that the reindeer in Spain was hit mainly by the plane.</p>
<p>(not my joke, in case anyone thinks it was! Colin Mochrie on the US Whose Line Is It Anyway gets the credit!)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Listen to The Pretenders or The Corries to hear the Scottish accent in their singing.</p>
<p>Listen to Parikrama to hear the Indian accent. Or Bhim Niroula to hear the Nepali accent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I guess each genre kinda has its own preferred sound and singers are always intentionally changing their voice to suit it. Same goes for a lot of pop, jazz, R&amp;B etc, often their singing voice is just put on and sounds pretty different to their actual speaking voice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not that they're alt-rock. I think of them as pop-rock. But I don't know music genres. Either way they're a good example of an American rock band sounding British.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because their singer specifically tried to sound British at first for the first album but stopped after and went back closer to his natural voice. If you listen to later stuff, he doesn't sound British.</p></div>		</li>
