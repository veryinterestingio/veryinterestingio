			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. To add to this: that defense mechanism specifically is your saliva, which has antibacterial and antiviral properties. Your saliva (and the warm/wet environment of your mouth) promotes faster wound healing, which lessens the risk of getting an infection. The inside of your mouth is probably the least likely place an infection could survive and spread.</p>
<p>ALSO, rubbing alchohol tastes nasty. Considering how unlikely it is to get infected there it's just not worth the trouble to swab it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to adding to this, prior to getting an injection in your mouth the dentist does have you gargle an antibacterial rinse. Or at least, mine does. Is that the norm?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in dentistry. Honestly, it's mostly dentist preference. I teach in a dental assistant program and we teach students to give patients a mouth rinse, but none of the dental offices I've worked in have done it. And only since COVID have I been asked to use a mouth rinse at my own dental appointments. For any dentist or hygienist who does ask patients to rinse, it's mostly for their own protection or peace of mind. And maybe just for the fact that a lot of people don't brush their teeth before their appointment and have stank breath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a pharmacist, I've dispensed lots of prescriptions for antibiotics to take before a dental procedure to prevent infection, particularly endocarditis (Bacteria will enter the bloodstream from the gums and sometimes find their home in the heart tissues.). Also related, antibiotic eye drops. We don't do alcohol swabs on eyes. They did however dump a lot of different drops and solutions into my eyes prior to my surgery both for numbing and for antibacterial properties.</p>
<p>I don't see why a gargle wouldn't have the same prophylactic effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a reason animals do it and we sorta instinctively do it when we stick small cuts in our mouths (I know not everyone does this, but I know I for sure do it without even thinking).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think its good to remember that &quot;practical benefit&quot; here is... &quot;as opposed to dragging your wounded ass around in the outdoors, without even the benefit of soap&quot;. </p>
<p>Without any notion of first aid, without clean water, without antiseptics. Possibly without even the ability to lay up a few days and stop seeking out food.</p>
<p>In that case, sure, maybe licking your wounds is keeping them cleaner than the alternatives available to animals that don't have the ability to string together abstract concepts and come up with a more robust and evidence based treatment plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have potential pathogens in our mouth which could infect a wound and cause abscesses (e.g. strep milleri species). Animals carry more potential pathogens like pasteurella and capnocytophaga so never let them lick a wound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually happened to my dad at the dentist. He got a shot of Novocain in his gums and ended up in the hospital with meningitis that evening. He was on chemotherapy and should have been premedicated with antibiotics before the dentist did anything like that but they missed it</p></div>		</li>
