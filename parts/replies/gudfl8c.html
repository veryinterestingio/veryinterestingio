			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your explanation of fasting. I’m curious how it’s carried out over the month. Is it like between certain hours? Prohibited foods? Do children participate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many children want to participate...but their parents have to trick them to eat. </p>
<p>It’s basically dawn to dusk. If you are unwell, then there is no requirement to fast. However, in that scenario, people often do something like giving up chocolate, or drinking less coffee so they feel like they are participating. </p>
<p>They also make a charitable donation if they can’t fast too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s done from Subh Sadiq (true dawn or morning twilight when the morning light appears across the full width of the sky) to sunset. You can’t eat anything at all. Children fast from puberty ie the boys first wet dream or the girls first period. You don’t have to fats if you’re sick,pregnant, on your period travelling etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on which school of theology you follow, you might fast from sunrise to sunset, or between two specific prayer times. You're meant to avoid all food and water, though you're also meant to default to health. If you break your fast for any reason, you just make it up after ramadan with an extra day or two. So if you're sick, particularly stressed, travelling, etc you can skip a few days. And if you're pregnant, a kid, or have a medical condition, you're straight up exempt</p></div>		</li>
