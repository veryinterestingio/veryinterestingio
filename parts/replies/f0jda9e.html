<p>Ordinarily, as you go up in altitude, the air gets less dense (an effect of gravity). But on a sunny day in the desert, the heated air at the surface expands and becomes <em>less</em> dense than the air above.</p>
<p>Now <em>refraction</em> comes into the picture. As light travels through a medium of varying density, it gets refracted (i.e. bent) <em>toward the more dense region</em>. With that low-density region at the surface, light coming down from the sky gets bent <em>up</em> and hits your eyes instead of the sand. In other words, the surface layer acts like a mirror.</p></div>		</li>
