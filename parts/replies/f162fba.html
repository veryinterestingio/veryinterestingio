			<div class="markdown"><p>So, during CLS (combat life saver) we're actually taught c-a-b, instead of a-b-c.</p>
<p>It was basically determined that them having blood is more important than breathing.Deal with the blood loss, control their pulse, and then worry about air.</p>
<p>Edit: With that said, it was almost 10 years ago when I learned this... So this may be outdated too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Active army medic here, you're mostly right! The bleeding control comes first. The reason isn't necessarily because the blood is more important, it's because bleeding from an extremity is so much faster to treat and easier to prevent by taking 30 seconds to put a tourniquet on. There's a few more complicated reasons too, but that's the nitty gritty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned it same as you, and I did CLS course in 1998. Keep the blood in, and I’ll clear your airway and/or get you breathing again afterward. Neither of those matter if your blood is all on the outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>checking pulse can take upwards of a minute if you can't find a good vein. If they're breathing, their heart is pumping. That's what I learned last year during first aid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, at least in the military the new hotness is</p>
<p>M - Massive bleeding
A - Airways
R - Respiration
C - Circulation
H -Hypothermia</p>
<p>Obviously, bleeding out is a big danger in a gun fight, but preventing Hypothermia and administering antibiotics as quickly as possible has saved a lot of lives. Hypothermia can occur very easily even in really hot weather if you've lost a significant amount of blood</p></div>		</li>

<p>Our &quot;standart procedure:
(C) ABCDE
(C) - stop critical bleeding
A - Airways / clear them
B - Breathing / deep? / sufficient? / rhythm?
C - Circulation / pulse / RR
D - Disability / neurological deficit stroke etc.
E - Exposure/Enviroment / Risks / hypothermia etc</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>
