			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what OP is talking about and the weed = schizophrenia thing is misrepresented here but it is based in truth.</p>
<p>They essentially want to scare you off of doing the drugs, one of the most prominent examples that they push is that weed causes schizophrenia. In saying this they are shooting themselves in the foot, because it's hard to believe and those who do try weed see that it isn't really true so they believe that everything else they were taught was a lie, making them more likely to try the harder stuff.</p>
<p>But, the grain of truth lies in that weed can really fuck with people who are predisposed to mental illness and seeing it happen to someone is fucking heart breaking. It's made even worse when MDMA is taken by someone who is predisposed. My flatmate was already really unsettling to be around, talking to himself in the mirror and being very childish and obvious with his lies, getting very angry when getting called out on them. smoke shitloads of weed over 2 weeks then finishing off the stash with 400+ mg of MDMA ruined him. He started talking to himself in front of others, he'd even talk to himself about you, talking shit about you to himself, not seeming to care that the person he's shit talking is in the same room as him. After that he got really bad, he'd make me doubt my own sanity with how insistent he was about his lies and how defensive he got whenever I asked him to do something simple, like not take my food or that he use the toilet brush after he had a shit. He started acting threatening and I had to tell his family that I didn't feel safe living with him and that I felt he would need to be institutionalised if they couldn't help him because I was at my wits end.</p>
<p>Worst part is that my flatmate knew full well that weed made this worse. He knew he had schizophrenia but he despised doctors and thought that the concept of mental illness was dubious at best, thinking he could just deal with it through willpower alone. In reality, he just dived further in to paranoia, drove all of his friends away, which made him more paranoid, so he smoked more weed as he got more bored and on and on until I was a hair's bread from having him committed before he got violent with me or someone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did not claim it induced it and neither are most of the people in this thread. Do you not know what 'predisposed' means?</p></div>		</li>
