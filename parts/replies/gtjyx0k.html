			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun fact: Apple had to change their &quot;random song&quot; algorithm because people would complain that sometimes they got the same song twice in a row. Obviously if you're &quot;randomly&quot; picking a number between 1 and 100 sometimes you'll get 55 twice in a row, but people didn't like that so they made it kind of random but not actually random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a trick that can be exploited for parties and educating students.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have them choose a &quot;random&quot; sequence of heads/tails.  Like 20 of them.  (Don't show the instructor)</li>
<li>Have them flip a coin 20 times. (still don't show)</li>
</ul>
<p>Provide both sequences and have the instructor pick.</p>
<p>There's a bit under 50/50 chance that a set of 20 coinflips produces 4 heads or tails in a row.  If you go longer, the chances of runs like that go way up.  Meanwhile, humans choosing &quot;randomly&quot; really dislike repeating the same thing, and usually won't generate them.  In other words, if you see a run of 4+, that's almost definitely the actually random one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know its anecdotal, and I know humans are really bad at recognizing randomness, but I swear Spotify's random shuffle is skewed towards hits. I have a 10 hour playlist and it plays like 35 of the same songs over and over again to where I get sick of them. I would chalk it up to coincidence EXCEPT that those 35 songs happen to be the top songs of each of those artists, while I have all of the entire albums on the playlist.<br />
That is a coincidence that matches up just a little too perfectly to financial interests for me not to be suspicious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with Apple's &quot;shuffle&quot; is how it treated files and folders.</p>
<p>What it ended up doing was randomly picking a top level folder which is usually &quot;artist&quot;.  Then within that Artist folder, it would pick a random folder which would probably be Album.  It would do this down the folders till it found a file, which would be a song.</p>
<p>This seems fine as a concept, but in reality, not many people had a bunch of full albums from a bunch of different artists.  So if you had 5 songs from a single album and 1 song from a completely different artist, you still had a 50/50 chance of hearing that 1 song if you had shuffle turned on because the first random pick is artist and you had just 2 for it to pick from.</p></div>		</li>

Each computer has a clock in it, and it knows the amount of time elapsed since a fixed starting point (i.e. 1st Jan 1970). Narrow that down to a number of milliseconds and you'll get a pretty good number to start from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, some CPU hardware has random number generating ability.  Many OSes will gather 'random' data as you use a computer (e.g. mouse movement, processes running, etc.) and 'mix' this in to the seed and/or the OS's random number generating system calls.</p>
<p>An important piece of information (math rule) is if you mix a random number with a non-random number, you get a random number.  So you can mix anything in and will not be worse off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to weigh in that pseudorandom numbers are great.  Pre-packaged pseudo-random number generators supplied by programming languages are all you really need for 99% of the uses of a random number generator in your code.  </p>
<p>If you need to add random fluctuations to your scientific code, if you are doing Monte Carlo simulations.  If you want to generate a random subset of a larger dataset.  If you just want to generate noise.  If you designing a card game and want to shuffle your cards.  If you are generating random backgrounds for a video game.  DO NOT BE AFRAID of pseudorandom number generators!  You can even hardcode the seed used in your generator for quality testing which helps stabilize the rest of your code.  Then toss in a call to 'timer' or 'clock' as the seed when you are in production.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are having philosophy discussions about what 'random' really means then have at it.  Or if you are designing ultra secret passcodes and expect your system to be attacked by hacker geniuses then go ahead and go to the extremes.  Otherwise just call your simple pseudorandom function call and don't worry about the series of lava lamps filled with radioactive cesium whose decay is measured by geiger counters run with floating-wire voltage.  You probably don't need it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>shuffle your cards</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's actually pretty bad for card shuffling because there are so many actual possible shuffles. Pseudorandom number generators typically have a 32-bit seed, meaning there are \~4,000,000,000 possible sequences of numbers generated and as many possible shuffles created. That seems reasonably big. But there are in fact \~80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 actual possible shuffles. </p>
<p>In fact, if cards are shuffled using pseudorandom numbers only, you could figure out the entire shuffle just from seeing a few of cards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would you need to calculate the whole shuffle at once? Can't you just do something like random number between 1-52. That's your first card. Then random number between 1-52 and rerun if first card is selected. That's your second card. And so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even, for stuff like Monte-Carlo, you could be better off using something like a Sobol sequence, which is completely deterministic, but it is designed to cover the range of values as uniformly as possible (without being grid-like). So yeah, as you said, more random is not necessarily better.</p></div>		</li>
