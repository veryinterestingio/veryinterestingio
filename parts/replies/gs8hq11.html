			<div class="markdown"><p>The one thing I would add to this account is just to address a common misconception. As you note, the person who cast the shadows would be covered in terrible burns immediately. But they would not be — as many would imagine — &quot;vaporized.&quot; They instead died horribly and would have left a horrible-looking corpse. (The only way a person could be literally vaporized by a nuclear detonation is if they were extremely near to the fireball itself, which wasn't possible at Hiroshima or Nagasaki because they were detonated at a significant altitude.) </p>
<p>The reason that you don't tend to see photographs of horrible, burned corpses at Hiroshima and Nagasaki is because the very first thing the Japanese did, as part of their relief efforts to the cities, was organize mass cremations of thousands upon thousands of corpses. This was done for both reasons of culture and public health. But it means that the photographs of the bombings (almost all of which were made weeks or months after the attacks) have a &quot;sanitized&quot; look to them that can be misleading. Here is one of the <a href="https://twitter.com/wellerstein/status/951901254380376064" target="_blank">rare photographs</a> of a cremation team, along with a later painting of the activity.</p>
<p>Your post doesn't contain this misconception, to be sure. But I always feel it is worth pointing out, in part because of the simple science of it, but also because when people believe that the bombs sort of just erase people from the Earth, it can almost make them seem like a &quot;good death,&quot; rather than agents of incredible suffering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the stories from those bombings that stuck with me the most is from Shuntaro Hida. He was a doctor treating a little girl in a village outside of Hiroshima when the bomb went off. As he was making his way to the city he came across a shambling crowd of people walking alongside a river. His description of that crowd is something from a horror movie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend's father in law was a Korean pilot stationed in Hiroshima. He was was close enough that the blast threw him far through the air into a canal. And that's all he would ever say about it. He helped out there for a time, and then took over a month to make his way home to Korea. Once there, he refused to leave his family home for over a year. The poor guy had ugly PTSD. </p>
<p>I always wanted to interview him about his time in the Japanese military and afterwards (he was trained at one of the Japanese military academies and spent the first months of the Korean War in the mountains, evading North Korean troops), but his biggest desire was to forget everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am surprised nobody has mentioned the famous manga Barefoot Gen. A very graphic account of the bombing by a survivor who was 8 at the time. Far more personal and harrowing than anything else I've read about the incident. Book 2 &quot;the Day After&quot; is a particularly distressing, and stays with you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it was the opisite. People thought the heat was enough to vaporize them, and the ashes were propelled away from the blast 'progecting' their remains onto the surfaces. I remember a short story be bradbury? That im pretty sure predates terminator 2. It described the above process. Terminator 2 just went with the popular conception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While many died of terrible terrible burns, we can at least take solace that the man on the steps likely didn't suffer in this way.</p>
<p>The site of his shadow was located 260m away from the hypocenter of the bomb. This means the shockwave would have hit him less than a second after the flash and likely killed him instantly given this proximity.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how far away from the blast these shadows were able to form, but light intensity dispersion follows the inverse square law. I think (and hope) most victims close enough to form a shadow would have been close enough to be killed by the shockwave, which means they wouldn't have suffered for more than a few seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, surely, yeah? The blast leveled so many buildings, I have a hard time understanding how someone could be left behind alive long enough to suffer. I understand buildings have a large area which makes them susceptible to forces but still, people are a lot more fragile</p></div>		</li>
