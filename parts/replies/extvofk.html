<p>In case of trees, it's quite possible that a tree can &quot;see&quot; the birth of its great times n grandchildren. If that's the case, some significant differences can occur.</p>

<p>This is what I was wondering. People are explaining the basics of evolution to me (which is fine, the more knowledge being shared the better). But I was more asking if any of these extremely old creatures have lived long enough where they've been alive for enough generations of the same species (though not necessarily their own offspring) where you could observe differences between the old individual and the newest generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there’s an argument to be made that if a species actually has such a long lifespan (in practice, and not just some variation of “doesn’t die of old age and therefore theoretically their life span is long”), then that species is very well adapted to their environment and therefore would not expect to see any significant evolution in their descendants. </p>
<p>Even more specifically, if any individual lives particularly long then we might argue that said individual is particularly well adapted to their environment and therefore not only would we not expect their offspring to be different from them, but we actually might expect <em>everyone else’s</em> offspring to become <em>more similar</em> to that individual over time, rather than less similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re falling into the common trap of thinking that evolution is efficient, when it’s <em>really</em> not. Mutations occur randomly, so the degree of difference between a parent and its’ offspring isn’t predicted by how well-adapted or maladapted the parent is. Similarly, evolution does not naturally select for the <em>longest-living</em> individuals, but the most successful <em>reproducers</em>, and mutations are only removed from the gene pool if they stop the individual reproducing, not if they simply make its life harder.</p>
<p>To illustrate, if a long-living parent (genotype p) had a 500 year lifespan and produced one offspring every 100 years, but its first offspring (genotype o) was born with a poorly adapted mutation that cut its lifespan to only 50 years, but also allowed it to produce 10 offspring in that time, then, assuming no other mutations in any other offspring from either group, here is how the genotypes p and o would proliferate...</p>
<p>At t0, (p) = 1 | (o) = 0</p>
<p>T100:
(p) = 1 | (o) = 1</p>
<p>T200:
(p) = 2 | (o) = 81</p>
<p>T300:
(p) = 3 | (o) = 6561</p>
<p>T400:
(p) = 4 | (o) = 531,441</p>
<p>T500:
(p) = 4 | (o) = 43,046,721</p>
<p>At t100 we have a 50/50 split of genotypes, but just 100 years later, 97.6% of the population has genotype O, and by the time the original P parent dies it’s genotype makes up only 0.00000009% of the population.</p>
<p>Evolution does not select for the most successful survivors, but the most prolific and successful reproducers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if anyone will see this, but trees can mutate faster than animals. They have a lot more segments of DNA compared to animals that can move and cause interruptions in genes called &quot;transposable elements&quot;. Plant genomes are also much larger than animals and contain many of these elements. It is arguable that this is why you may see deformations in leaves and especially the fruits of plants.</p>
<p>Edit: My labs bioinformatician is looking at these elements in humans and their role in cancer. This individual studied conifers before moving to cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still not an answer because it's all speculation on what's possible based on people's narrow views of how selection works(top comment currently says it would take thousands of years/generations despite us having directly observed otherwise like with the peppered moth colors or elephant tusk size). </p>
<p>Nothing has been cited to direct prove or disprove OP's question and examples.</p></div>		</li>
