			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't necessarily break the a1 b1 entanglement afaik. But being entangled doesn't mean two quantum states are the same; it could just as easily mean they are opposite; or any other similar relationship.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When two things are entangled, the entanglement is always going to be of the same type.  Either they are always the same or they are always opposite.  They can't switch types otherwise they would no longer be entangled.</p></div>		</li>
