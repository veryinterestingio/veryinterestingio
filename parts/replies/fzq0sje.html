			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom will go dead silent when fishing for a word. Which is already inconvenient, but she'll also go silent when she's finished a sentence, but supposedly not the entire thought.<br />
She will give no outward indication that she has anything more to say. She doesn't look around as if fishing for a word. She doesn't drop her shoulders or get this frustrated look as the literal minutes pass without successfully finding the phrase she's looking for. She doesn't adopt any recognizable thinking pose.<br />
She gets irritated when Dad then figures that she must have been done because it's been five minutes since she said or implied <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>I've almost picked this up from her when I'm really tired. I absolutely hate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother will tell a story, then wait for a reaction, then <em>tell a bit more of the story</em>. Fair enough, but she does the same thing reading out news - she'll read a bit, then go silent, then a while later she'll add a bit, and then silence again, then refer back to it... Like, read the dang news THEN discuss it - i don't need a live <em>but staggered</em> commentary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is it also serves as a bit of a nervous tick while public speaking. Speakers who get very nervous can start to lose their train of thought but feel they need to fill every second of their time with something, so these &quot;uhhs&quot; and &quot;umms&quot; serve that purpose while they search for the next word(s). Unfortunately it can become overwhelming and distracting to the audience. </p>
<p>I used to suffer from this myself until I took a public speaking course with a really awesome instructor who demonstrated  his speech with those fillers and then without them, instead using silent pauses. To a nervous speaker they might perceive their own 1 or 2 second long pauses to be long deafening silences; To the audience these pauses are in fact barely noticeable. </p>
<p>Eventually, as you gain confidence speaking publicly and move away from those filler sounds it helps you get into a cadence where you speak a sentence or statement and then incorporate these silent pauses to your advantage as a means to separate your points and draw the audience attention into what you're saying. Those pauses actually give the listeners time to retain and digest what you've said before moving on to the next point, whereas a constant stream of sound can become exhaustive and even cause your audience to lose focus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its two different situations. In public speaking, its not a conversation, and you are expected to know what you are presenting. The fillers make it seem like you arent well versed and the audience doesnt need to know that you arent done speaking. A pause in a presentation isnt an invitation for someone else to begin speaking.</p>
<p>If you were talking on the phone and just paused instead of used fillers, the other person might think you were finished with your point or were disconnected. Like most things, its something that has a purpose but cant be used universally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same learning experience in a public speaking class, and wasn't ever really taught the importance of keeping &quot;uhhh&quot; and &quot;umm&quot; in regular conversations to, as many answers have explained, express that you aren't done talking. I don't know if I ever realized that was why I was getting seemingly interrupted so much, because I wouldn't &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;um&quot; to keep the floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I learned in high school forensics is standing in front of people to speak really warps your perception of how fast you're going, at least until you're much more comfortable with it. For a novice, no matter how slow you sound to yourself in your head, you're actually probably still going too <em>fast</em> to be understood effectively by the audience. Slowing down your pace will give you more time to think, settle the nerves, and sound more natural to the audience.</p></div>		</li>
