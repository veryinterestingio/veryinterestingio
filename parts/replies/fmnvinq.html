			<div class="markdown"><p>Our sun has been getting increasingly hotter and more luminous over its lifetime. It will continue to do so in the future. It will become too hot for our planet to sustain life way before it goes into its red giant phase. Still a really long time, 500m to a billion years, but we won’t have to wait until the sun becomes an actual red giant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say 'phase', I'm assuming you mean when the sun moves off the main sequence and becomes a red giant. However, the sun's luminosity is increasing over time so scientists predict that between 1 billion and 4 billion years from today, the increase in luminosity will cause a runaway greenhouse effect, boiling the oceans dry. The sun is predicted to begin it's red-giant phase around 5.5 billion years from today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be surprised if humanity survived even 10 million years as a modern society, let alone a billion.</p>
<p>As for influencing the lifecycle of the sun, you're very much out of luck. It's basically a giant ball of hydrogen and helium constantly undergoing fusion reactions, and it's therefore burning through vast amounts of hydrogen every second. There's not much we can do about that.</p>
<p>I mean, if you can figure out some way of supplying the sun with a constant flow of about a million tons of hydrogen per second, congrats. Then you'll just need to figure out how to do about a billion times that.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm vastly simplifying this, but essentially it does boil down to &quot;Sun run out of hydrogen =&gt; Sun will get closer to end of its life&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the technical solutions to the sun getting hotter proposed seem rather extreme to me (such a s star lifting). I think I much more practical solution would be to shield the earth from a certain percentage of the radiation. A giant umbrella sounds crazy but a large swarm of tiny orbiting particles seems very possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>About 60% of the water Earth had when it formed has been lost to space.</p>
<p>(This is based on the fact that regular hydrogen/water is lost to space more easily than deuterium/heavywater and hence the higher occurrence of deuterium than would otherwise be expected))</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape" target="_blank">Thermal escape</a>; hydrogen is light enough that a significant fraction of the hydrogen molecules in Earth's upper atmosphere are travelling at greater than the escape velocity of 11km/s, so if nothing gets in their way and bounces them back down into the atmosphere, they can just keep going into space in a kind of gravitational analogue of evaporative cooling.</p>
<p>Heavier atoms and molecules move more slowly for a given temperature, so fewer of them make it above escape velocity and they're easier for a planet to hold onto.</p></div>		</li>
