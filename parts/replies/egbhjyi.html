<p>I dunno about that cookie dough description for internal deformation though hahaha. I love glaciers, and I love cookies, but I don't see the connection. Can you expand on your example? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cookie dough is said to be plastic* - put pressure on it and the dough flows away to areas of low pressure. Apply continuous pressure to the dough and the dough undergoes plastic deformation - its shape has permanently changed.</p>
<p>Ice behaves like cookie dough when put under continuous pressure. Deep in the glacier, ice flows slowly towards areas of low pressure. The deeper you go, the more plastic its behaviour. However if it receives a sudden shock, it will behave in a brittle manner and shatter.</p>
<p>The Earth's interior behaves in very similar way. Below 10-15km rocks can deform in response to pressure rather than shatter. Which means the deep Earth is pretty counterintuitive - the Mantle is blazingly hot, but pressure means it is solid - however it can still flow which drives plate tectonics.</p>
