			<div class="markdown"><p>Precheck is run by the TSA it’s $85 and last 5 years. You have to submit to a background check and they can revoke it at any time. Definitely worth the money. If you fly once a year it’s 17 dollars round trip which is so worth the hassle of getting to keep you shoes, jacket, belt, necklaces and watch on you. Plus you always get a metal detector and you get to leave electronics in your bag!! </p>
<p>I think this should be the standard and not the exception though. But if you have a relatively clean record it’s worth every single penny!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have Global Entry and it's awesome. I got it as airlines phased out rewarding elite/frequent travelers with a free PreCheck on their boarding pass.</p>
<p>But imagine an America in which politicians didn't get to slide through PreCheck, but had to wait in line 20 (whassup Los Angeles), 30 (hello Miami), 40 (howzit Dallas) minutes with the hoi polloi, take off their shoes, remove their electronics, go spread eagle for the scanner, wait while their bag gets put back a second time, keep an eye on their now-separated valuables, gather their stuff and try to put electronics away without getting in other people's way, then walk in their socks to share a crowded bench so they can put their shoes back on. Imagine if they didn't get to wait in the gold or platinum lounge, imagine if they didn't get to board the plane first, maybe even had to gate check their carry on (Heaven forfend). Imagine Congresspeople having to do that twice a week. I'm guessing they'd be pretty quick to tell airlines, airports, and the TSA to knock some of that shit off.</p>
<p>At a minimum, TSA should shut down PreCheck at Dulles during the partial government shutdown.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It should be the standard, and then we should use profiling to select people for what is now the standard screening. But you mention profiling, and people get crazy about it, and think its evil. So instead, everyone gets the mid level of scrutiny, except the highest risk travelers. And then to get the lowest level of screening, you need to apply for a special program, where they still profile you, but do it as a whitelist.</p></div>		</li>

You have to submit to even more thorough background check and two interviews with the CBSA and CBP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 1. Why don't they make you remove portable chargers? I have a massive one that I compare to a laptop battery that I've brought through security a dozen times in 3 different countries and have never had to take it out of my bag. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4 isn't horseshit once you really think about it. The $85-100 you are paying covers the background check the government does on you when you apply. You are proven to be a trusted traveller at that point. It proves you have no criminal record and are a US citizen or permanent resident. It also registers you into a biometric database of &quot;known travellers&quot; meaning they can keep track of you much easier while in an airport. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got through the background check despite working as a human rights researcher in Afghanistan, which put me into direct contact with “extremists.” It’s not THAT thorough.</p>
<p>I mean, I’m no security threat but I honestly expected to not get through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like you don't still have to go through security as a trusted traveler. The point is that you have been vetted more than most others entering the airport and you have been thoroughly identified. It's hard if not impossible to try to fake the identity of a person who is in the known traveller database. A lot of the extra trust is in that they can fully trust that you are the person you are claiming to be when you enter the airport.</p></div>		</li>
