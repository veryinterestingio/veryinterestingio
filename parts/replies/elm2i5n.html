<p>No, some boxer briefs on a summer day are probably fine...I've heard of people keeping it against their skin in their boot or other concealable place against the skin.  You can even find some uh, devices that will hold and store it in a warm place, like an elastic band around your tummy with a pouch connected to a tube, or a lifelike penis for supervised tests.</p>
<p>Life uh, finds a way...</p></div>		</li>
