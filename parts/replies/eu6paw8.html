			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is generally correct. Many believe our memories are like a tape recorder, if you remember something, you remember it exactly as it happened. This is simply false, our memories are our internal storage of our PERCEPTION of an event, and it is influenced by many factors and each time you access that memory, it changes slightly. </p>
<p>Over time this can result in memories of events that never happened, or that you were never at (but maybe saw on tv or heard about).</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why you can totally make up a story and if you say it several times to several people your brain will perceive it as a true story. </p>
<p>Also some messed up research was done on this and they found out that they can conceive people of traumatic experiences even though they haven’t gone through it. The human brain is very interesting.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some memories don't ever get stored. If our brain doesn't consider it to be &quot;important&quot; enough it might never make it from our short term memory to our long term memory.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But more often it's not a case of the memory not being there anymore it's that our brain has difficulty finding it. Different memories will have different &quot;strengths&quot; based on how often we use them, how many other memories they are associated with, how important we consider them, etc. Strong memories have lots of pathways leading to them, weak memories don't have many. </p>
<p>Which means when we're trying to remember something if it's got lots of pathways it's easy to find, if it doesn't have many it can be harder and our brain just gives up (i.e. we &quot;forget&quot; that memory). It's still there, the brain just can't locate it. It's why sometimes you can completely forget something but then when you hear or see something associated with it that memory &quot;comes back&quot; - for e.g. not being able to remember the words to a song, but than when you hear the song you do remember them and you can sing along. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Picture the brain like a very messy room full of a bunch of different files. All the files you use all the time and are important are in nice neat piles at the front of the room and easy to find, but everything else is just chucked in one big messy pile at the back of the room and trying to find that one specific file you're looking for is much harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain is poor at memory extraction. Technically, everything we've ever known can be remembered. But the brain sucks at recollecting those memories, so it just overwrites the areas that are easily accessible to it and discards memories that have never been recalled. That's why rote memorization and repetition tend to stay longer with us. The more you access the memory, the more the brain will protect that memory. Unaccessed memories are overwritten since the brain thinks it's useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it's similar to how you could pretty much always add another photo to a hard-drive as long as at a certain point you started reducing the resolution of old photos.  For practical intents you'd never lose a photo, especially not ones you recalled frequently, just fidelity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering some people have memories that let them remember something &quot;clear as day&quot; if they revisit it enough times. Like, their birthday or their name, the only way to reduce resolution of memories would probably be reducing all the details. IE an incredibly detailed memory where you'd know the exact size of a room, distance of the furniture from the walls, objects in the room, colors, the shading, light, everything.</p>
<p>Each detail, is a memory. If you can &quot;overwrite&quot; a memory for something else, like the name for the chair you sat on, that entire experience itself lost a bit of quality. If it loses enough detail, you can hardly remember what even occurred in that room other than one day, you visited a room, then eventually left.</p>
<p>However, if it's the connections that give it strength, this implies that every cell contains a memory. You may lose a memory if you can't gain it ever. Not remembering specific details means you just can't fit the info you're gaining. Though, you only have so many brain cells, so you'd eventually you could run out of it if you had enough things to remember. And actually chose to remember them ever, rather than exist parallel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>your brain is a crazy cool organ but it takes a lot of shortcuts in the way it filters input and stores that information. those shortcuts can also be used to make you think you're perceiving things that you're actually not, and recognize things that don't actually have any memory of, and give you a false sense of confidence when recalling events or visual images.</p>
<p>just asking you to describe the paneling and using suggestive language whenever you're unsure of a detail, I guarantee you can be convinced to paint a significantly different image in your head and change the memory you have of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind how many &quot;inputs&quot; your body has. Visually, tactilely, nasally, each of those is a type input and how mean nerve endings you have of each. You refreshed that input in your old house often.  So you formed very solid pathways.  Each time you interacted with those, in one way or another, it reinforced the memory.  It also associated it with other memories. Those memories can cascade. </p>
<p>everytime I smell sunkist orange, I remember a girl i dated in high school.  I remember walking down her dirt road, and the way the sun glinted through the dirt clouds (after cars passed). I remember the tall grass in the ditches. But when I try to think harder about specific details of this large area, my memories start to fracture into other memories. They cascade into different memories. When i was thinking about the trees in her front yard, my mind lept to shade trees of the souther states, similar to big magnolias.   Those memories cascade. </p>
<p>The funny thing about that memory cascade is that it also becomes just &quot;thought&quot;. It becomes an amalgamation of thoughts that recurse and become new as they blend.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A 1996 study of 52 individuals who underwent the surgery found that 96% of patients experienced reduced or completely ceased occurrence of seizures post-surgery. Studies have found no significant long-term effects on memory, personality, or humor, and minimal changes in cognitive function overall.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't really remove half the brain, at least not commonly, but rather sever the corpus callosum. Which is why you get the whole field of study that is 'split-brain' patients. They do indeed not report any differences themselves, and perform just fine on tests, but they are not exempt from displaying a few odd traits (like confabulating when giving information to the &quot;Secondary&quot; brain only and asking about it).</p></div>		</li>
