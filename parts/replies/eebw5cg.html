			<div class="markdown"><p>From the time I was 12 to about 40, when I had short hair there was an even mix of people thinking I was a boy at first glance. I would say I used to have a strong jaw/ androgynous face. </p>
<p>But I’ve hit the middle-aged lady moment where my neck has changed. My jaw line is softer. My chin is getting that blorpy flesh situation underneath it. And now, no matter how short my hair is or how androgynous I might dress, no one mistakes me for a boy. </p>
<p>So I’m going with strong jaw as a masculine feature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the concept of a tom boy, is a visibly feminine person acting like a visibly masculine person. No one actually mistook the tom boy as an actual boy. But I just saw something fly over head and have to go investigate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree! Happy cake day! And your chin is not blorpy! I was always confused for a Girl when I was younger and my Mom and I would get the “Can I help you Ladies with anything”. Then as a teenager my Fiancé and I would get the same. My jaw developed at like 25 and now the long hair just makes me look like I know where to score the good weed. Haha. Cut it off. But I miss it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would eyebrows fit into that? They aren't part of the actual facial structure so to say, they aren't like jaws where they're wholly based on skeleton shape and size, but they're genetic and also a very common way to tell (males have larger eyebrows). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The location, pitch, and shape of eyebrows is influenced heavily by the underlying bone structure of your brow line.  And the brow line itself is almost as heavily influenced by male hormones as the jaw.  So indirectly, yes.</p>
<p>Thick eyebrows on top of a feminine brow structure will still look more feminine than thin eyebrows on a masculine brow structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brow, maybe. Eyebrows can be shaped. A strong brow is a more male dominant trait IIRC</p></div>		</li>
