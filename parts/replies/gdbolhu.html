			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but is it actually popping or snapping to make that noise or are we literally just hearing the ear drum move itself and because itâ€™s right in our ear and moves quickly it comes off as a popping sound?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I mean it's basically the same thing; a pop from a balloon is a pressure wave on the outside of your head, like a little tame shockwave, and a the pop you hear from your ears adjusting is an even smaller little pressure wave inside your head.</p>
<p>But yeah you're right, because the source is inside your head, the pop is louder, even though it's of smaller intensity, but it's not that it <em>appears</em> to be a pop, if you get what I mean, that's just what a &quot;pop&quot; is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The popping sound is like when you take a cork of a Champaign bottle, the pressure seal is in your sinuses. It's very useful for diving for example, and for high altitudes, and on aeroplanes. When people dive and go on planes, their inner ear can implode/explode if their sinus is blocked. The pop is a sudden displacement of air in the sinus to equalize the pressure, when air jumps from the eardrum into the inner ear when you open the sinus valve by yawning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain why do I sometimes have constant poping and air floeing sound in my ears when going out? It's annoying in a way that i Hear myself inside (louder like on a mic or something) and i have to do that  manuvear where i close my nose and &quot;blow&quot; in it so I hear another pop?
In short - can your ear presure stabilizator &quot;break&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can have weaker soft tissue in that area, it's very variable. Best not to 'pop' the ears if you can, but make yawning type movements instead to help the pressure stabilise more gradually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, I don't know. It seems plausible to me that some of the same things that cause inflammation of sinuses when you have a cold might cause problems in the actual tubes that connect to your throat, which could constrict things in there, a bit like squeezing a balloon from the opening, but that's just a guess.</p></div>		</li>
