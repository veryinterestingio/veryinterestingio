			<div class="markdown"><p>I've recently seen a talk about the life forms in the deep suboceanic mud. They not only have DNA and RNA, but aren't even alien to our evolutionary provenance. Still, due to the different environment, they indeed seem to live on a different timescale (outlandishly slow).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The methane-based lifeform theories propose methane as a substitute for water, though (obviously it can't substitute carbon, since methane is a carbon based molecule), right? The methane acts as a solvent for hydrophobic molecules and would basically see the inversion of the &quot;oil&quot; and &quot;water&quot; interactions that exist in our own biochemistry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, yes. It's a bit more complicated, because the membrane-forming molecules are chemically different than the molecules that form membranes here on earth. These molecules would not be stable in a watery environment. Titan is a good example because it bridges well from known chemistries to unknown chemistries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. This is exactly where I plant my belief on alien life. We would go so long without recognizing intelligent life because of how strange it was that we will swear we are alone in the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's intelligent, but we can't understand it, are we made any less alone by knowledge of its existence? This is why I describe the questions that follow as fraught: being alone in the universe is one thing, but being in a universe filled with intelligent life that we have no chance of understanding or interacting with is a much deeper level of existential nihilism for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To exist ontologically or to be perceived as existing are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>I think the original question begs the notion of pointing out how obscure and truly <em>alien</em> life and intelligence can be in the universe.</p>
<p>The thought to ponder is no different than wondering what sound a tree makes when it falls in the woods when nothing is around to hear the noise.</p>
<p>The singular point I try to open others to is that we could have perfect examples of living, intelligent beings all around us in the galaxy and universe but we prefer to glare down this subjective filter and make assumptions because they lack familiarity. To me, that will cause humans so much needless pain in the search for life in the universe.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm so glad that there are others that share my perspective that aliens are bipeds and aren't essentially permutations of the human configuration.</p>
<p>The universe is so much greater than that, yea?</p></div>		</li>
