<p>Hot food = vasodilation (is this a word in English? I mean your blood vessels expanding slightly) = clear nose = mucous runs out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it all hot (temperature) foods or just certain kinds?</p>
<p>I wonder if it’s certain types that, as they are hot they tend to be steamy, which could be capturing small amounts of chemical elements (that cause bodily reactions as others have described in this thread already) within that food. Since steam rises, that steam is going straight up your nostrils (since you obv eat with your mouth).</p>
<p>Source - my brain trying to prevent me from doing real work and putting my thoughts into EL5 reddit posts :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Come to think of it perhaps it’s more common in liquids - like soups and stews. That might explain it then, if that’s the case, being a result of the steam like you mentioned? I’ll have to pay more attention to which foods it happens with</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve noticed that myself, also why I thought of it.</p>
<p>If I eat hot soups or freshly cooked noodles, if they have ANY spice in them my nose get a little bit runny. However if I eat those noodles cold, no runny nose at all.</p></div>		</li>
