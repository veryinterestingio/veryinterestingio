			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really matter, to be honest. The estimated number of humans 200,000 years ago is between 10,000 and 30,000, dipping as low as potentially 1,000 humans at one point. Counting all the way back to 200,000 years ago would only bump the data up by half a billion or so at most, so 0.5% increase.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow really? What points to that as a possibility? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Homo Sapiens as far back as 200,000 years ago, maybe even farther, were anatomically similar to humans today. They could probably breed with current humans, but there is also evidence of interbreeding between several species of Homo.</p>
<p>But behavioral modernity of humans didn't develop until about 50,000 years ago. More advanced tool making, grave sites, use of fire, and other human activities became much more common after this time. The current leading theory is a small genetic change spread through the human population around this time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the tremendously imbalanced distribution of the population means that adding in that additional 150,000 years actually wouldn’t change the numbers by a whole lot. Going by <a href="https://www.prb.org/howmanypeoplehaveeverlivedonearth/" target="_blank">these numbers</a>, 50000-8000BCE was about 1b cumulative total. Assuming that held true earlier (the numbers would likely be lower), that only adds 3b to the lifetime population. So you go from ~108b ever to ~111b. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shouldn't a small genetic change leading to such an event <em>also</em> pop up occasionally as a genetic disease/disorder - individuals who do <em>not</em> show behavioral modernity - when such gene is defective?</p></div>		</li>
