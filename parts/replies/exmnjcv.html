			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I can't imagine it's cost effective to keep enough goons on hand to break that many legs to afford collecting afterwards.  I mean, shit, You can't even pump gas and then pay for it any more, for obvious reasons</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, all horse tracks. Horse betting is very fast and is cash up-front, so the slip is a record of the transaction.</p>
<p>You go to the bookie, list off your bets, and you get a slip of paper for each bet, listing what you put on (Exacta 2 4, Win 8, Trifecta Box 3, 5, 1, etc.)</p>
<p>And if you're me, you bet a Superfecta with $20, except you can't decide which order to put the last two horses in so you flip a coin, and then all your horses come in in order except the last two, which are reversed. So close to an insane amount of money :(</p></div>		</li>
