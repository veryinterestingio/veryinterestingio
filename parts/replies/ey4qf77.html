			<div class="markdown"><p>A chem teacher for my friend's class in high school was sick the day they were doing esthers, so the rather oblivious elderly physics teacher we had subbed in. He ended up mixing two of the wrong chemicals and created this absolutely horrendous smell that caused most of the class to instantly puke, or run from the room to make it to the bathroom. The smell spread and triggered the same reaction from two other classrooms so they had to shut down the entire wing for the day till the smell cleared. It was hilariously awful</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Butryic acid is actually what gives vomit it's characteristic smell.</p>
<p>It's also an off flavor for beer (if you really screw up, anyway), and we used it in a beer off flavor tasting kit.</p>
<p>The dose was supposed to be measured to something like 3-4x taste threshold, which SHOULD have been so subtle you had to try hard to notice it in the spiked beer. </p>
<p>In the other flavors we all struggled to identify the correct oddity because of the subtly, but with butyric acid everyone lifted the glass, got it about 6 inches from their mouths, put it down, and everyone said &quot;butryic&quot; in unison. </p>
<p>It is such a rotten, horrible compound that is about as subtle as a glass full of vomit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: and p-menthane-8-thiol-3-one. Even if it’s in a beer that’s supposed to be just black currants, all I get is straight cat urine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Watermelon splitting (or exploding) can be caused by the “exploding gene,” which is found in many of the heirloom varieties, or from increased water turgor in the watermelon. Sometimes just placing the fruit on a surface, bumping it, or touching it with a knife will cause an immediate pop on the side.</em> </p>
<p><em>Of course, the other reason watermelons can split is because of bacterial infections inside the watermelon. Like many fruits, watermelon are susceptible to certain decay organisms and wild yeast. When this happens, it can lead to a fermentation process inside the watermelon. Pressure can build inside, causing the watermelon to split and erupt like a volcano or to foam uncontrollably.</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>Dunno why we don’t have cavendish flavourings available though, maybe it is actually fairly complex. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a myth that is constantly spread on reddit. The flavoring comes from Isoamyl acetate which was isolated almost 100 years ago and identified as the main compound in banana. This over time became &quot;iconic&quot; or a flavor expectation in candy.  The Gros Michel is still around just not easy to come by. It tastes stronger and sweeter sure, but it doesn't really have a higher Isoamyl acetate rate than the Cavendish.</p></div>		</li>
