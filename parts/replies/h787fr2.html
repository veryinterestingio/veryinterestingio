			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean... technically the body is just full of blood (i.e. every cell needs the stuff to survive) , but at the ELI5 level, it doesn't make sense to go into the details of the vasculature system like the branching of the arteries all the way down to the capillary-beds.</p>
<p>I thought about comparing your major arteries (aka where &quot;most of the blood is&quot;)  vs a sponge (aka the arterioles -&gt; capillary beds -&gt; then venules), where THERE IS  blood/liquid present, but unless you squeeze it out the blood will likely just stay there and hang out). It's the pressure that makes you 'bleed' and areas of low pressure (like capillary beds) just don't bleed at the same rate as arteries. But I wasn't sure if that was ELI5 material. haha</p>
<p>Edit: forgot a detail</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>True and not true. Cells don't need to be right next to blood vessels to survive. They can survive around 100 microns away from a capillary from short range diffusion. </p>
<p>But that's a bit of a nitpick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all the surgeries I've been a part of (standing productive member of the team, not the unconscious guy on the table), the common practice is to cauterize (aka burn shut) the smaller bleeding vessels. I can't remember a time we used suction for blood flow.</p></div>		</li>
