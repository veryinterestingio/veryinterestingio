<p>glass can retain heat for much longer than plastic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that true? A search gives me a higher specific heat for polycarbonate (1200 J kg^(-1) K^(-1)) than for glass (500-850 J kg^(-1) K^(-1)).</p>
<p>It is true, however, that a plastic cup is much lighter than a glass, so in terms of volumetric heat capacity (which might be more appropriate for what you put into a dishwasher), glass is a clear winner.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm probably wrong, but I would also expect a glass utensil to absorb and release heat much faster than than a similar polycarbonate utensil, and as a consequence I would expect it to exit the wash hotter and to release its heat into evaporating water faster than the plastics. WOuldn‚Äôt that help the water evaporate quicker?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A material has different properties that deal with heat. You have &quot;specific heat capacity&quot; which means how much heat (energy) can be stored in that specific material without things going funky (melting or deforming). Then you have &quot;specific heat transfer&quot; which is a constant that dictates how fast a specific material transfers heat. With a formula you can figure out how fast energy transfers between the glass and the water and the plastic and the water (as air kinda sucks for transferring heat, it is important but rather insignificant comparatively).</p>
<p>In short: plastic has a higher specific heat capacity than glass however its specific heat transfer sucks so it needs a longer time for the heat to be stored in the plastic than to store it in glass. </p>
<p>True EILI5: Yes you have a bigger bucket, but you only have a trickle of water whereas with the glass you have a smaller bucket but a hose to fill it up with. Time is the constraint here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your polarity! This is an awesome explanation that makes perfect sense. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve wondered about too, as plastic food storage containers always come out of the dishwasher very wet, while everything else is dry, it is quite annoying. And I use a lot of reusable plastic containers.</p>
<p>I‚Äòd always thought was something to do with Rinse Aid helping break surface tension, due to it‚Äôs ability to spread the molecules rather than them beading. And your explanation ties in with that, right? I based understanding Rinse Aid on knowing a bit about dark room photography where a wetting agent gets used to disperse surface tension.</p>
<p>The next question is... how much Rinse Aid or Wetting agent is too much for humans to ingest? What effect would consuming too much have?</p></div>		</li>
