			<div class="markdown"><p>correct. will also add that flu viruses tend to go from east to west. So scientists predict which will be the dominant flu virus in the coming season by looking at what dominant in Asia this season (among other things)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current models state that Influenza viruses comes from aquatic birds around the world, but can get human-specific mutations while infecting pigs and poultry in SE Asia.</p>
<p>Since birds have a different immune system (with less specific antibodies that make the infection asymptomatic) and a different route of infection (oral-fecal), they just have to shit while flying over a pig farm to contaminate their water.</p>
<p>Also, the genome of these viruses is just like Lego pieces, so they can exchange pieces while co-infecting an animal, normally pigs, while getting random mutations to avoid our immune system. Thus, a strain can get both bird and human specific segments, or just use very old pieces from the 1918 Flu epidemic, and that's when we get highly pathogenic strains (HPAIV) rendering the flu a ducking nightmare to analyse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there are inconceivably many possible variants  and we can only reliably make vaccines for strands that are already in circulation. We do our best to predict, from the ones that we know are in circulation, which are bound to spread the most and make vaccines for them.</p></div>		</li>
