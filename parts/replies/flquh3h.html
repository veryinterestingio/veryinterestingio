			<div class="markdown"><p>Your brain uses your eyes to help you not fall down. If you lean too far to the front or the back or the side, you fall down. Your brain measures how far away things are using a triangle. It uses the triangle to know how far you are leaning toward the ground. One side of the triangle is the line between one eye and the other. The other sides of the triangle are lines from each eye to the thing you are looking at. </p>
<p>Look at a place on the ground and imagine the triangle between your eyes and that place on the ground. Lean forward like you are going to fall. Imagine the long lines of the triangle getting shorter. When they get shorter, your eyes have to point more in. Your brain measures this, and it knows that your eyes are closer to the place you are looking at. It can tell that the distance has changed.  It knows that you are closer to the ground and farther forward. </p>
<p>But if you look at something really, really far away. The long lines of the triangle are really really really long. Your eyes aren´t looking forward and in, they are basically just looking forward, and the difference between something that is kind of really far away and something that is really really far away is too small for your brain to measure. It still feels like you are just looking forward the whole time. </p>
<p>You can see this in the mirror. Go to the mirror with a friend. Have a friend hold his finger out in front of him and look hard at it. Then have him move his finger closer and closer until it is touching his nose, looking really hard at just his finger the whole time. Watch his eyes in the mirror look more and more in as his finger gets closer. Imagine the triangle his brain is using to measure how far away his finger is from his eyes change as he is moving it. </p>
<p>Now, have him stand as far away from the mirror as he can. You stand near the mirror. Have him watch you move your finger as close to the mirror as you can and as far as you can, without taking a step. Watch his eyes in the mirror. You will see they don´t have to look in at all to watch your finger. Since his eyes don´t go in, his brain can´t measure how far your finger is from his face as well. If you tried this standing really far away, his brain would only be able to measure that your finger was really far away. It wouldn´t know if it was 1000 feet away or 1010 feet away. </p>
<p>That´s why, when the ground is 1000 feet away, your brain can´t use it to know where your head is or if you are leaning too far over and will fall. You have to use your balance instead, or look at something closer to you. That´s why you should practice balancing with your eyes closed every day, so that your brain can learn to use your balance when your eyes are not helpful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes measure stuff and help position body relative to stuff for balance. </p>
<p>Hard to accurately measure far away stuff.</p>
<p>Hard to measure stuff that is under you without moving your head to see it.</p>
<p>Head forward past feets =/= balance.</p>
<p>Far away ground oh no!</p>
<p>Gotta use body to balance only.</p>
<p>This is hard. This is not what body is used to.</p>
<p>Practice sometimes maybe?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you are standing on a high cliff, your eyes have a really hard time telling the difference between 1,000 feet and 1,006 feet.</p></div>		</li>
