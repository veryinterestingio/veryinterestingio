			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure it is. Dreams happen in the REM (rapid eye movement) phase of sleep. Your eyes actually move while you are watching that dream, as is obvious from the name of the phase. You may also experience some small limb movement, i.e. twitches. Thatâ€™s your dreaming brain trying to control them and failing.</p></div>		</li>
