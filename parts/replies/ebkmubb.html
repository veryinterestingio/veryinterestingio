			<div class="markdown"><p>Not 100% sure of the correct answer on this, but I would guess your legs considering they have such large muscles and they must support your body weight. My sister had foot surgery &amp; after 6 weeks of crutches her leg was significantly thinner than the non injured one </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any recommended exercises to make the thinner leg gain muscle  same as the other leg. I have the same thing now after I had a surgery and couldn't get the thinner leg bulky lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All skeletal muscles gain and lose myofibrils depending on their frequent use.  More you use those sets of muscles, the more nuclei the cell has, the quicker they grow, and slower they shrink.  As for which sets of muscles people commonly lose strength in, it's whichever muscle you don't use.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Too much of anything is never good. In this case it's to much time spent not using your voice. This can be the case with any part of your body. I wouldn't say there is an easier muscle to degenerate faster than another as it takes dramatic examples to see these degenerations take hold. The example above was over a 12 year span. Doing anything for that long has side effects.</p>
<p>I bring this up because there's several cases where we can see physical traits developing without proper oversight. Working in a rice field for years, always hunched over, will impair the workers from standing completely upright. Heavy rice cultures show this, predominantly Asian. A famous case of 'raised by wolves' had a young girl on all fours for years of her youth and could never fully extend her legs as the tendons grew in this manner. You can see this more commonly with cast wearers, as where one limb is much smaller than the other when the cast is removed.</p>
<p>Through repeated use, or not using, the body does weird things and I wouldn't claim any one muscle will degenerate faster than another. You may see your thighs degenerate slower, but that's mainly do to it already being huge and having more mass to lose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't have even considered the laryngeal muscles. The worst I thought would happen is you lose a bit of muscle tone or the movements for language become unfamiliar and it causes you slur your words. That guy's body was very committed to the vow. </p></div>		</li>
