			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the sledgehammer analogy. It's almost like antibiotics are like a bullet and germs have the ability to develop body armor over time to stop the bullet from affecting them and increase the likely hood of survival. But if you take a huge sledgehammer shot to the chest even while still wearing body armor your going to have some broken bones, internal bleeding, and sooner or later death if the shot was good enough (ie 70% alcohol). Idk just what came to my mind when I read that.</p></div>		</li>
