			<div class="markdown"><p>My visualization sound exactly like OPs. I always describe it as a flash of the general shape of the thing. I came across a post a couple weeks ago about if people’s inner voices changed with their voice as they went through puberty. That made me realize I also can’t recall sounds. It’s kind of the same, I can create a vague memory of how something sounds but it fades really quickly. My inner voice has no sound, it’s just thoughts in word form.</p></div>		</li>
