			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, the Tarim basin in northwest China has produced large numbers of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarim_Mummies" target="_blank">extremely well preserved mummies</a> due to the area having a perfect combination of saline soils, incredibly dry summers and freezing winters, with the bodies often buried in tombs or exposed coffins. Politically, the mummies can be very controversial, as they are neither Chinese or Uyghur and appear to be early Indo-Europeans.</p></div>		</li>

I went through a phase of being completely obsessed with the Silk Road, and this was by far the most wonderful gem I found while checking out everything readily available about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun fact about the McMurdo Dry Valleys: they’re generally considered the driest place on earth. No ice from Antarctic glacial flows can get into them because the mountains surrounding them are so tall. And they only get ~100mm precipitation annually, but that precipitation doesn’t stick around because of 320km/h  (200 mph) winds in the valley that blast it away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking from experience, lots of ice and snow sublimates in the Dry Valleys as well as around McMurdo and the rest of Antarctica, but ice still melts in the summer with direct sunlight. Temperatures actually get pretty warm and there is liquid water occasionally standing around. </p>
<p>Check out Lake Hoare and Lake Chad in the Taylor Valley. They've joined due to glacial ice melt even though they used to be two distinct lakes.</p>
<p>I think one of my first posts ever on Reddit was a pano of the Taylor Valley.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't that special, happens everywhere. If you're watching a pile of snow over several days, with temperatures constantly below zero, you will notice that it shrinks. You won't find any water or ice, the part of the snow that's gone evaporated. This will happen anywhere where the air isn't saturated with water vapor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the question arose from the Chernobyl incident, radiation sterilized everything and the one workers body was never recovered. Indeed it would have naturally dehydrated if it wasn't burned or torn apart. There was an incident at a US test reactor where an explosion pinned a man to the ceiling through the groin, he was up there several days with zero decomposition.</p></div>		</li>
