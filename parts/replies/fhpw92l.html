			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, and usefully, most apple trees (commercially planted or purchased) are grafted to a different variety's or species' rootstock, and though you have genetically identical trees above ground, different rootstocks give you very different characteristics in the trees themselves.</p>
<p>There are dwarf and semi-dwarf rootstocks for example that affect the size of the tree.  So you could have 3 different tree &quot;tops&quot; that are all clones of tree A, but grafted to 3 different rootstocks, which would then result in three different sizes (and other characteristics such as disease resistance) of mature trees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a guess, but I would imagine different rootstocks have different relationships with soil bacteria and fungi, a tree's microbiome if you will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. There may be very minor random mutations that create small amounts of variation over generations, but there is no genetic recombination and this is the primary source of genetic diversity in species that take long periods of time to reproduce (like trees).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even worse with apples, since not only are the apple-producing bits of the tree clones, but they're typically grafted onto a different type of apple tree. So you can have multiple different genomes all in one tree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the genomes stay in their area in relation to the graft point? Or is genetic material transported throughout both plants?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It stays put. Any new branches that grow below the graft union line will have different characteristics than the scion. The same principle is why cancer in trees just produces a burl, and doesnt metastasize and kill the tree.</p></div>		</li>
