			<div class="markdown"><p>yep, Filing my taxes is basically just looking over an electronic form, correcting any mistakes(I have only had to do it once) and hit submit. Granted I don't have many deductibles, so there is little for them to get wrong).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The secret in America is to make it as confusing and difficult as possible to make people hate it. Then you run your political campaign on how bad and confusing it is, promising to fix it or simplify it. Then do nothing about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if you run a business, or have complex tax paperwork, you should always have an accountant look over everything to make sure.</p>
<p>But as a student who only has a checking account, where I live I just get a pre-filled tax form, I make sure it's about correct (which it always is, because our tax service knows how much I get paid, how many loans I have, what interest I've paid etc.), and I send it in.</p>
<p>My tax paperwork takes about 30 seconds to complete most years. Maybe 5 minutes if I need to change some fields because I got a new job.</p></div>		</li>
