			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a social worker, not in homeless services but in chronic illness services. </p>
<p>Several of my clients are homeless when they begin services though due to the cost of treatment before we get sent their referrals and work on helping with that. I have previously written letters for my clients to help get an ID stating that they are currently without housing, they stay at this place, and use our agency as a mailing address. </p>
<p>For example</p>
<p>&quot;To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>This letter is intended to verify place of residency for John Doe.</p>
<p>John Doe is currently receiving services through &quot;agency name&quot; and I have worked with them in this context for such and such time.</p>
<p>John is currently homeless and staying at the tent camp under the bridge at X and Y streets. Their mailing address is &quot;agency address&quot;.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions, please reach out to me at XXX-XXX-XXXX between the hours of 8am and 5pm.</p>
<p>Regards,
-Name, credentials&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know because I didn't work the shelter/long-term services side of our programs. So this is speculation on my part. But in the US, everyone has a birth certificate on file with the state/county where they were born. And a quick google search tells me that in order to obtain a copy of someone's birth certificate, they need: their SSN, date of birth, and/or provide a copy of your driver's license, passport, or other valid photo identification to prove your identity, <em>or a sworn statement proving your relationship to the person whose certificate you're ordering.</em></p>
<p>So my guess is that if SSN and DOB alone isn't enough, the social worker would need to sign a statement that they are the client's caseworker and that the client has no other ID.  Then with their birth certificate in hand, they could use that to get an ID and everything else. As for the costs involved, agencies like this typically have a small fund set aside for clients to get needed documentation. </p>
<p>Now, what they'd do for someone who doesn't have or doesn't know their SSN, I don't know.</p></div>		</li>
