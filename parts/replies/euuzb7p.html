<p>I would expect all 20 oz bottles of coke to have the same barcode in the US.  It should all be one coke SKU.  Grocery stores don't want to have 40 different skus for a 20 oz bottle of coke in their systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be very much the case but not always. Often new barcode is assigned to a production batch (keep in mind that for CocaCola this production batch might be in milions of bottles).</p>
<p>This way for example when the price raises a new batch is created.</p>
<p>So it'll not be 40, but might be 3-4 codes for one product size</p></div>		</li>

<p>The price of a bottle of coke is not encoded in the barcode.  Pricing is up to the retailer, and can change independent of the UPC.</p></div>		</li>
