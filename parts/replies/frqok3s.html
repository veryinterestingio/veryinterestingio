<p>There are numerous US States that don’t charge income tax or tax deferment to corporations for 20+ years to open a business in the state to stimulate the economy &amp; provide jobs.  It’s basically the same principle, except overseas.</p>

<p>Edit: I do not agree with the practice in any way, but this is the line of reasoning used to justify the practice by big business.  I believe it is completely parasitic, and morally wrong and the largest reason for income inequality in the world.  But it is, however, completely legal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time, what has kept these tax havens in existence, was British culture and tradition. Almost all of them are or were British Commonwealth countries. Britain didn’t want to crack down on them for stuffy obscure nonsensical reasons that always reduced to, a lot of upper class British people made a lot of money out of the system, and were good at coming up with excuses for keeping their pockets lined. And the United States wasn’t going to kick a commonwealth country out of the world financial system. </p>
<p>If you want a nice rabbit hole, google HSBC and bearer stock companies. It’s a kick!</p>
<p>Before Trump, the Obama administration and Western Europe had reached a consensus on cracking down on all of this shit and the financial services companies that enabled it.</p></div>		</li>
