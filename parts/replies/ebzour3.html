			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in fire country in CA, been evacuated once and had two fires practically next door that the awesome Cal-Fire crews put out before burning our home. You need to live here and follow the fires closely for a while to truly understand it.</p>
<p>During this year, the fires here had ideal weather conditions for a catastrophe; lots of high winds while the fires were being fought. But even with conditions ideal for the fire crews, forest fires are hard to stop. The fires make their own winds, and can carry embers and even burning branches for hundreds of feet on the best day. One of this year's fires created winds of 140 mph, with fire vortexes that rose hundreds of feet high. When a wind of 140 mph has burning branches being sucked up to hundreds of feet high, then blown by those winds, you get new fires way, way beyond any firebreak humans can make.</p>
<p>Besides, creating fire breaks across 100 million acres of forest would take more workers than the entire country has free, and would cost more than any government could afford. And it still wouldn't be enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That shouldn't be a problem in dry, windy southern California!</p></div>		</li>
