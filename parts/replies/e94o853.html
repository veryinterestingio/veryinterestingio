			<div class="markdown"><p>The gunpowder plot was believed to involve 2500kg of powder.</p>
<p>For a real-life comparison, the &quot;Battle of the Crater&quot; during the US Civil War involved the use of 3600kg of gunpowder buried 20 feet below a fortified trench occupied by the Confederacy.</p>
<p>The detonation resulted in an oblong crater that was about 52 meters by 37 meters, and 9 meters deep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the fact it was buried under a trench create a high-pressure environment that would amplify the damage? Would it be possible to replicate in the place Fawkes' gunpowder was at? Black powder is much more slowly burning than TNT, and how sealed the environment is could be crucial to determine the built up pressure, and thus the damage.</p>
<p>There is a historic basis how meaningful this is, albeit on a smaller bomb scale. During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_plot" target="_blank">20 July plot</a>, several German officers tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler using a briefcase bomb. To avoid setting off metal detectors, they had to use plastic explosives wrapped in paper rather than a metal casing, despite the fact that at the time of WWII, plastic explosives were not as advanced or high-pressure as later explosives like C4. They expected Hitler to have a conference in a bunker and had the bomb placed there, where the sealed environment would act like one big casing, allowing the bomb to build up pressure that would kill everyone inside. But instead, Hitler had the meeting in a regular building, with windows and other gaps. As a result, the detonated bomb dissipated its explosive force, and Hitler survived the explosion, albeit with some injuries like a shattered eardrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would have been a major issue. Some of the powder would have detonated, but much of the gunpowder would have been dispersed and burned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an enclosed environment, the TNT equivalency for black powder is about right as an estimate of the damage it would cause. The pressure would cause the reaction rate to go up high enough that it would almost certainly be a detonation. Contained black powder can do real damage. </p>
<p>If you want a laugh, lookup &quot;anvil shooting&quot; on Youtube. It's mental.</p>
<p>This Hitler thing is really interesting. Human bodies are remarkably resilient to short duration overpressure and laymen tend to underestimate just how fast pressure drops off with distance. Without an enclosure like a room to reflect the pressure back or some sort of shrapnel, straight up lumps of high explosive are remarkably ineffective at killing humans for how much energy there is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s still very visible today too. Petersburg National Battlefield is one of my favorite historic sites to visit. One tour guide stated a black regiment was supposed to lead the attack, but fearing a PR nightmare orders were changed just before it began. This lead to some of the confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2500kg of gunpowder is roughly equivalent in explosive power to 1250kg of TNT (i.e. it has an RE factor of 0.50) or 2750 pounds of TNT if you want to use the Imperial system.</p>
<p>To get some perspective on just how large that is, watch some cratering charge videos. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS2GG5HFWrk" target="_blank">this one</a> they first detonate a 15 lbs shaped charge to dig a hole, then they place a 40 lbs cratering charge in that hole, tamp the earth on it, and detonate that (0:55 in the video). That's what 40 lbs looks like in loosely tamped earth.</p>
<p>A 2750 lbs charge in the equivalent of well-tamped earth would blow the roof off the building and make a nice swimming pool sized crater.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just for reference of what an explosion does to a building that's created specifically for withstanding attacks.</p></div>		</li>
