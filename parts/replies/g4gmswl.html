			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately way more boring than the boofing answer. I had a double whammy of GERD induced difficulty swallowing (where acid reflux does some damage to the esophagus) which triggered a severe anxiety episode during the peak of Covid. In the space of a month I went from sporadic swallowing difficulties to literally fearing every grain of rice and nano-sip of water. Known as pseudodysphagia, it is the fear of choking.
At my worst I was managing to drink less than 100ml per day, and around 100 calories. Lost 28 pounds, a lot of it muscle mass, and I could feel my body shutting down. As my mother, who is ill with leukemia, was shielding and I was staying with her at the time,  I was extremely concerned about going to a hospital and picking up Covid and I knew I needed a better solution than to keep visiting for an intravenous so in desperation I opted to use proctoclysis - botty water. Took 2 weeks of 2-3 litres daily with hydration salts to get back to normal while I dealt with the phobia but the day I dribbled in my sleep for the first time in months after having had a mouth like the bottom of a budgies cage made it all worth it. Still, 2/10 would only recommend if facing death.</p></div>		</li>
