			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it depends on the type of hearing loss. I wear hearing aids but only because i have scar tissue on my ear drums, so it was never a degenerative type of hearing loss, but it resulted from poor surgery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parent of a child with unilateral hearing loss. She has adapted to listen with her one good ear. It's true, her audiologist confirms the fact that her brain gets lazy and doesn't want to try to listen to the bad ear, just the good one. She refuses to wear her hearing aid in her bad ear. </p>
<p>Her audiologist doesn't mind her refusal to wear her hearing aid, she just tries to explain there may be problems down the road if she has to wear a hearing aid in both ears. There may be a surgery that will correct her bad ear, but we have to wait until she's done growing. The problem lies with the bones in her inner ear not growing properly. Her problem is considered a birth defect as she failed her hearing screening while in the NICU.</p>
<p>tl;dr My daughter's inner ear was malformed during gestation and she has hearing loss in her left ear and refuses to wear a hearing aid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true for every corrective system humans use.  Vision is the most frequent with contacts and glasses, but we have more technology assistance in other areas every day, such as prosthesis.</p>
<p>Doctors typically prefer to slightly under-correct.  You want the body to continue to work a little bit, to continue to exercise and work and make an effort. Many body systems will atrophy, including your hearing. Everything in your body, including the ears and brain have a 'use it or lose it' nature.</p>
<p>There are listening exercises to focus on particular sounds which can help both the ear and the brain. It won't fix all the problems but like all exercises, there are benefits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a way to reduce inevitable hearing loss? My family develops hearing loss quite severely, my grandma has really bad hearing and both my father and uncle have hearing aids, both are just past their 50's. Me and my sister are also kind of loosing hearing, not to the point that we need aids obviously, but it's definitely a thing.</p>
<p>I personally can't really hear anything past 12k Hz, so if you have any tips to at least slow it down a bit, I'd really appreciate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Avoid loud music and noise, and protect your ears when you can't avoid that by wearing earplugs to concerts, use earmuffs when working with tools, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it caused by something like Menieres?</p>
<p>Mine is/was.  The hearing loss from Menieres can be slowed but not stopped.  Once it's gone, that's it.  Back when I could hear, it came in waves.  I'd lose maybe 5% each time a wave came in and back out.  Apparently it's destroying the little hair things each time and so it cumulative.</p>
<p>But if you can prevent a wave from forming, then you can kick that next loss down the road further.  It's hard to do but I went maybe 4 months without symptoms.  Commit to a low sodium diet (<strong>extremely</strong> low), limit stress and take potassium supplements before it's too late.</p>
<p>I'm was deaf by the my early 30s cuz of Menieres so if you're reading this and think &quot;wow I get dizzy a lot&quot; and &quot;boy it feels like there's water in my ear all the time&quot; and &quot;WHAT DID YOU SAY???&quot; then go see an ENT.  20 years ago it was hard to find an ENT who could diagnose it.  It's pretty well recognized now.  Go back if you're still not sure what's up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lack of exercise to anything makes it wither, I suppose.  Are there any cases of that not being so?  </p>
<p>I know a girl who brushes her teeth like 5x/week and she's never had a cavity in her life.  I always wondered if there's so much plaque that she's developed a barrier from additional plaque.  Like how a hoarders carpet can only get so dirty because eventually the filth is just sitting atop other filth.</p>
<p>Similarly I know a girl who washes her hair with actual shampoo stuff like once a month, if that...  she just does a daily rinse with water only.  Her hair is like that of a goddess though.  Not oily or breaking or anything.</p>
<p>Basically, are hygiene products a lie Big Smelly is selling me to keep me needing more?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a drug given to people with heart trouble to help their heart beat. It ended up weakening their heart. Then they discovered something that interfered with the heart beat and it actually would help people get better. I think they’re called MAO inhibitors but I could be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hearing loss typically gets worse over time. How fast your hearing loss progresses is typically unaffected by wearing hearing aids - the same decline would be seen if you didn’t wear hearing aids.</p>
<p>Wearing hearing aids <em>does</em> preserve the functioning of the parts of the brain that receive and interpret sound. Even though wearing hearing aids doesn’t prevent your actual hearing from getting worse, it’s much better for your speech understanding and brain function to be wearing hearing aids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was just going to say this. The brain cells that interpret sound and parse language start to die off with an insufficient supply of sound. People often wait to get hearing aids until years after the hearing loss is diagnosed. Then they get hearing aids and everything sounds like “BLAH BLAH BLAH...”. Then the person complains that “hearing aids don’t work”. Well, in this scenario it’s true. Hearing aids can’t be adjusted to compensate for the lost brain function. Moral of story: get your hearing checked if you even think you have hearing loss. If hearing loss is diagnosed get hearing aids right away. Wear them religiously, all day, every day. </p>
<p>Today’s hearing aids are fantastic. I can’t feel them, they’re almost invisible, they do cool Bluetooth things as others mentioned. And I can hear. :-)</p></div>		</li>
