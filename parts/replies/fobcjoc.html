			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be my hypothesis too - but I don’t think this has been confirmed true. A related question worth thinking about - if you have a mild case, what are your chances of having a mild case the second time you get it? If once mild always mild, then there is a more optimistic road to recovery where severe cases build immunity, and those with mild cases deal with an extra cold every couple years until a vaccine comes out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a terrifying prospect, because that means that the people calling for only the most at-risk populations to self-isolate are essentially calling for a course of action that will ensure that the most at risk will never be able to stop self isolation. By delaying swift, consistent, and total action to halt the spread of this virus, we've basically doomed ourselves to it burning through the entire global population, potentially for years if we don't find a vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's still providing immunity post infection, though, it's just not lifetime immunity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s true - I specifically latched on to OPs description of an alternative mechanism to viruses having to evolve to re-infect us.</p>
<p>But I would say we are both correct, we are just correct at different times post-infection!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey thanks for taking the time to answer.</p>
<p>I didn't realize you could get the same cold virus after a couple years. I assumed you were only immune because it mutated over that time frame. That is interesting information, based on that it seems like if vaccine efforts fail (hoping they do not!) the coronavirus could settle into a similar situation as the flu  then where after a certain amount time (how long nobody knows) enough people have a bit of immunity that it doesn't spread as rapidly but you're always vulnerable, just not as vulnerable as now since it's a new virus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely agree here, the use of adjuvants or a particularly immunogenic source of &quot;infection&quot; such as an adenoviral associated vector could provide a hugely more productive (effective) immune response.</p></div>		</li>
