<p>It could also be that heating the water boils off any dissolved gases - e.g. chlorine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't you basically control for that by 1) comparing plain boiled water to water straight from the tap, and 2) comparing brewed coffee to cold brew, or cold brew made with pre-boiled water vs. cold brew made with water straight from the tap? </p>
<p>Edit: the water straight from the tap under (1) shouldn't also be boiled, oops</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: PFAS is measured in the parts per trillion so would that ever be the reason for the “chemical” taste? Or is it more likely the treatment chemicals? That would be my guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would tend to agree that the PFAS wouldn’t be detectable by taste. It’s also highly unlikely that they would be removed during the coffee making process. There is a small group of PFAS compounds that are “volatile” (more so than other PFAS) that may be removed to some degree by boiling. During the filtration through the coffee, some long-chain compounds may also be removed. But the vast majority of PFAS compounds will end up in the resultant coffee.</p></div>		</li>
