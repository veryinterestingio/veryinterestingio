			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. </p>
<p>Why do 3 photons result from the aligned spin scenario?</p>
<p>I was under the impression that anti-aligned spin states are more energetic because they are storing potential energy from the B field. </p>
<p>Is this incorrect? Or is something more subtle going on here? </p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can provide!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reaction has to obey conservation laws. In the case of your question, photons have a spin of 1, and positronium with aligned spins have a spin of 1. This means that you cannot produce two photons and conserve angular momentum.</p>
<p>Since you cannot produce only one photon after annihilation (to conserve linear momentum), the annihilation produces 3 photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what is the spin on 3 photons? I’m having s hard time seeing how 3 spin-1 particles can be produced from a reaction using only a spin-1 particle. </p>
<p>Can’t really grasp how angry lad momentum is being conserved here :(</p>
<p>Edit: lmao didn’t see the spelling errors. “Can’t really grasp how energy and momentum is being conserved here :( “ </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so if the answer is &quot;the reaction produces three photons because two photons wouldn't conserve angular momentum&quot;, then why doesn't the reaction produce, say, five or seven photons instead?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Think of it this way: if the spins are anti-aligned the B fields also point in opposite directions and the resultant is zero. If they are aligned then the B fields add up resulting in a higher potential.</p>
<p>In spectroscopy this is called spin-orbit coupling and is what gives up and down electrons slightly separate spectral peaks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Excerpt for the lazy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Schrödinger equation gives only the stationary states (the ground state and the excited ones), which live forever. It cannot describe, therefore, the annihilation process, but it is able to describe the positronium before the annihilation takes place. This equation for the positronium is identical to that for the hydrogen atom, except that the reduced mass changes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideally I wanted to see how a single equation could describe the positronium, the annihilation and the subsequent photons, but I guess that becomes too complicated and maybe not worth expressing as a single equation! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't need to speculate, there are experiments testing the chemical properties of positronium.<br />
Basically, it acts like hydrogen. It can form something like an H2 molecule, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positronium_hydride" target="_blank">PsH</a> . Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di-positronium" target="_blank">Ps2</a> has been studied. It should also bind to halogens like hydrogen does.</p></div>		</li>
