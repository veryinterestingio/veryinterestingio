			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And to be clear it <em>is</em> done on large scale in certain places.</p>
<p>Interestingly it is much more efficient to apply desalination techniques to greywater than seawater due to the lower dissolved salt content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small amounts are trivial. Enough for you and your family in a survival situation can be made with a few plastic bottles and a sunny day. You cut the bottom out of one, the top out of the other, nestle them together in the right way, fill the bottom one up with saltwater and leave them out in the sun.</p>
<p>Sun evaporates the saltwater, leaving the salt deposit in the bottom of one, and the evaporated fresh water has clung to the outer shell of the other. Bam, fresh, clean water with almost zero effort and no monetary cost.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Doing it quickly or in large volumes is where things get difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/saywherefore" target="_blank">saywherefore</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes we could, but most places don't have the infrastructure to transport seawater inland and supply it to houses. Also sewage treatment plants aren't set up to deal with salty water which is for example more corrosive. Not to mention that those sewage plants often discharge treated water into e.g. rivers which wouldn't take kindly to large amounts of salt.</p>
<p>So there are infrastructure barriers to implementing seawater (or even unpurified rainwater) flushing of toilets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a really great idea.  Running a second set of water pipes to every building in a city is a huge task.  u/saywherefore points out some of the downsides, but if it cuts a city's fresh water usage in half it could be worth the effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are your thoughts on this <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/israel-proves-the-desalination-era-is-here/" target="_blank">Israeli water desalination</a> plant? I saw this on TV a while back and I seem to remember that they claimed to be able to produce a liter of clean water for 6 cents USD. I can't prove that claim with a link thought. </p>
<p>Main question: why could this not be done anywhere else? If you look it up, there's quite a few articles on this particular faculty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but where I live water is less than 0.1 cents per litre. And that includes the cost of maintaining the infrastructure to get it into my tap. Most of the world can’t afford 6 cents a litre.</p>
<p>In any case large scale desalination is much more widespread than people think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. 6 ct per liter of water for <em>drinking</em> may sound cheap if you are used to buying bottled water for 10 times as much. But remember that freshwater is mainly needed for irrigation, to grow food crops, not for drinking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's over $115 per person a month just to shower daily. Now start adding up laundry, dishes, gardening?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll try and look up what it actually cost. I know some people that live in Israel. As I mentioned before I’m not sure it was six cents it may have been substantially cheaper it may have been $.60 for 1000 L I honestly don’t remember except the number six was in there somewhere. I’ll post a link if I can find it</p></div>		</li>
