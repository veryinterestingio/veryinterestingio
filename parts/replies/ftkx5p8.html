<p>Do you have any thoughts or ideas on how the allocation of &quot;memory space&quot; might work? </p>
<p>ANNs are primitive and don't do any kind of allocation, they effectively fill up all of the space they have even if it's not required (and we have to manually cut the size down to fit the actual problem during training, and compress it afterward). It strikes me that human memories are able to form without overwriting unrelated memories, so they would surely take up new physical connections within LTP, but how would the brain prevent using an excessive amount of &quot;fresh&quot; neurons to commit a new memory?</p>
<p>From a computational non-NN side, we might index memories based on their contents to ensure they are only in one place, which seems like it would have the same effect as LTP for a <em>pattern</em> of connections. However if the memory is fully distributed it becomes difficult to see how related memories don't just all overlap entirely, and how mundane memories (such as what we did yesterday) are still formed distinctly. Brain areas also seem to grow as they &quot;run out of space&quot;, is that just biomass from increased connections or do they actually appear to need new neurons that would need to be &quot;allocated&quot;? Gah, so many things I'd love to know.</p>
<p>The other thing I'd love to know more about is how different parts of the brain effectively &quot;communicate&quot; but that's something I've yet to read into in more detail, I've been more interested in the memory part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, what is actually being stored?  </p>
<p>Is it just a bunch of chemicals that the brain somehow interprets into feelings, smells, pictures, etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't know what's stored or even if anything is actually stored. Your memory is more the connections between certain neurons in your brain. For example when someone says the word chocolate, it fires up a part of the brain due to the audio trigger of the word chocolate. This part of the brain is connected with several other parts in your brain, for example the part that regulates taste, which also fire up. As a result you now &quot;remember&quot; the taste of chocolate, without actually having eaten any of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only representations are stored (of the actual real objects).<br />
How eyes work is very close to this mechanism.<br />
Shapes based on contrast with a factor of value, determines the place for later (fast) use.</p></div>		</li>
