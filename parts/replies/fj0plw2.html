			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically it was both, but again cancellations were surprisingly rare. The overwhelming majority were due to people not checking in, or checking in, but then not boarding the airplane. (Presumably in the Majority of those cases they checked in online a few days before the flight and then for whatever reason didn't show up on time/ at all)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some would be missed connections.  If you missed a flight out of Airport A flying to B, or that flight was delayed, you might not arrive in time for your flight from B to C.</p></div>		</li>
