			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to follow up, thatâ€™s the alcohol in the dry erase dissolving the permanent marker allowing it to be removed.</p>
<p>If dry erase boards are old or the marks left long enough, similar effects happen with ghosting or inability to erase - and simply going over it with a new dry erase mark allows erasure. Pretty cool!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do this on purpose on our &quot;planning window&quot; at the office. The table lines were written in permanent &amp; the tasks that were erased weekly were in dry erase markers. Then when I switched offices I used dry erase to erase the &quot;permanent&quot;.  I was looked at like a super hero by the guy moving in to the office.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its actually the solvent in the marker that is doing the work.  You could use another marker, but that may leave more dye or residue.</p>
<p>Buy yourself some Blender Markers!!  They are available at art supply stores.  Its literally a blank marker that is full of solvent.  This will allow the marker on a surface to become fluid again, but without using up another marker.. :)</p>
