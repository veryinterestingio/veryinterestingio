<p>I mean, it's not supposedly. A gave B money with the intent of getting it back, B had the advantage of that money for part of the year and then returned the same sum at a later date. That's the definition of an interest-free loan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I was covering my butt in case someone came buy and said &quot;the gov doesn't spend that money it just sits there until they pay you back. I don't believe that for a second, but since I don't know for sure, I won't say stuff I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people use their tax refund as a makeshift savings account because they don't trust themselves or have the discipline to save money themselves.  It should be noted, however, that this is the worst possible way to save money since you don't earn any interest at all on the amount you overpaid.</p></div>		</li>
