<p>Sir Isaac Newton was allegedly responsible for the earliest measurements involving gravity, which involved two balls of different size / weight being dropped from a height at the same time and seeing which landed first.</p>

<p>I've always seen that attributed to Galileo with an image, potentially a legend, of him dropping things from The tower of Pisa. Newton later contribution being extending the local Galileo's gravity to astronomical scale and deducing Kepler's laws as a consequence.</p></div>		</li>
