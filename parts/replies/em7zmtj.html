			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really about how it looks to a human though. It's how many bits you would need to precisely describe that blue sky in perfect detail. It's a lot. True, you can get a sky that looks identical to a human with just a few bits by just saying 'this is all sky-blue'. But in reality, the information required to describe it and therefore the entropy is very low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the painting has been downsampled to 8-bit color or something, the number of unique colors between two photographs of the same resolution shouldn't be very large. The major difference is more likely to be how ordered the colors are.</p>
<p>If you took all the shades of blue in a photograph of the sky and mixed them up randomly, that would certainly have high entropy, but in an actual photograph of the sky, the colors are very highly ordered. They describe some sort of gradient. Probably not a linear gradient, but still a gradient that could be captured with a moderately complex algorithm, which would then allow you to pretty accurately predict the color of any pixel adjacent to one you had just sampled. So that would be low entropy and low information content.</p>
<p>In a painting of some scene, you might be able to predict the color of adjacent pixels sometimes, in cases where you sample two pixels that are both from the same object, but adjacent pixels can also be radically different, particularly at the edges of objects. The algorithm needed to predict pixels in this cases would have to essentially be a hard coded version of the painting itself, at least along all the edges. That would be higher entropy since you will have less success predicting colors or need a more complicated algorithm to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only justification I can think of for the painting to be simpler is that the painting has less unique colours. By that I mean if you consider the pallet the artist used then you can say that every red is the same red, etc. While the sky is made of infinite shades of blue. So in a raw data way the painting is simpler, but the blue sky is much easier to compress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did he not address this exact issue already with the &quot;monkey brain&quot; point? He said that yes, technically it could be true that there is more info in a HD pic of a blue sky VS a low-res painting, but that is only a technical trick in how we apply/measure resolution.</p></div>		</li>
