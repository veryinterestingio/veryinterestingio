			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: Julius Caesar didn’t have his own first name either-his first name was Gaius, one of only a few first names available. Julius was his family name!</p>
<p>So... I guess that extra sucks for older Julia and younger Julia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was in the past, but not anymore. A lot of our surnames show this though, the most common surnames are things like Johansson and Andersson, which literally mean &quot;Son of Johan/Son of Anders&quot;, common male names in Sweden. But nowadays they &quot;work&quot; like any other surnames.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Icelandic last names are real family names, they are just patronymic. I don't think you should include them in that list. It's completely different than being from Java, where even official documents may only use a single name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other parts of Indonesia also. Maybe not all, but my brother in law just has a first name. My wife's name is an acronym. Her dad has several different first name/last name pairs he goes by. They have no family name.</p>
<p>They're from Sumatra and Borneo.</p></div>		</li>
