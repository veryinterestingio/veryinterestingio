			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't really that people are forced to spend &quot;urgently&quot;, it's more about the fact that, if the economy enters a deflationary spiral, that's pretty much it. In economics, a deflationary spiral is considered to be probably one of the worst things that can possibly happen, because, past a certain point, there is no way to escape it - you just have to let the economy crash and burn. Therefore, the central banks target a slightly higher rate of inflation than zero - so they have some room for manoeuvre. Also, the most common inflation target among first-world countries is about 2% - this is far too low to considerably impact people's short-tun spending.</p>
<p>TL;DR - central banks <del>good</del> essential</p>
<p>EDIT: okay, that last statement was very controversial, apparently - people like to create enemies for themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Centrals banks aren't &quot;good&quot;, they just have an essential role in the economy. Right now they grant very low intrest loans to banks that make a huge amount of money by investing that money. If the central banks gave people money (or low intrest loans) directly, it would benefit most of the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Central banks use a rigged CPI to show their ‘inflation’ that is nowhere close to the actual inflation felt by the working class. There’s a reason why real GDP has grown while real wages have flatlined. Also you say inflation doesn’t impact people’s short term spending however it does impact long term savings and punishes economic actors for being fiscally responsible and saving. This house of cards works till you have something like corona and no one has any savings to sustain themselves off of. This and artificiality suppressed real rates have massively contributed towards the overconsumption in the western world which has been a large factor in the destruction of our planet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I know bread will be in sale later this week, there's no reason why I'd go to the market to buy bread today. Now imagine that on a daily basis with every single product out there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for actually explaining some of the complex things involved, such as the why prices rising makes people shop sooner, but I honestly don’t do this as a consumer. The only thing that actually fluctuates daily is gas, and if I need if, then I’ll buy it when I need it, regardless of the future of it, Bc if I need it now, I’ll also need it later, and will have to pay more for it later too. But I just can’t really think of examples of inflation in my 20 years on earth, besides maybe college.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less spending for daily expenses and more to encourage investments in stuff. People who have the money to spend are more likely to put it into investments of some variety than keep it in their bank account, since with inflation, if you keep money in the bank, it loses value over time.</p></div>		</li>
