<p>Hardly any safety equipment etc, they were at the disposal of the rich to get it done that quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sagrada Familia has had quite the history associated with it. Gaudi took it over as chief architect in 1909, died about 15 years later, and then one of his assistants took it over.</p>
<p>During the Spanish Civil War, however, anarchists set the crypt on fire and destroyed a lot of the plans and models that had been developed and showed Gaudi's original plans. They were even going to dynamite the work that had been done on the Nativity Facade, but for some reason didn't go through with it.</p>
<p>I think they had to pause construction for a while after the Civil War, but I'd need to do more research on the timelines.</p>
<p>The funding of the construction is done primarily through ticket sales and donations, which also adds to the cost. I think the 2026 timeline (100 years after Gaudi dies) is mostly due to the advances in construction and modelling - when I was there a couple of years ago I spent a lot of time looking at the models and reading about the challenges they've had in actually putting the different pieces together from what remained of the vision, and 3D modelling technology was a big help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing that should be mentioned is that while Gaudi left behind detailed models and drawings, they were destroyed during the Spanish civil war by anti-catholic anarchist rebels.  </p>
<p>By the end of the war 40 churches had been destroyed, and 12 of the people working on the Segrada Familia project had been killed.</p>
<p>Yes La Segrada Familia has taken a long time to build, but there are good reasons for that.  It's a building entirely constructed out of masterwork pieces - the kind of artwork craftspeople spend their entie lives trying to create. Every detail of the building is supposed to be spectacular because it's supposed to be the ultimate example of dedication to God.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like Marcon is actually looking to circumvent some of the usual channels to speed things along which experts in the heritage field warn against.  Still, it could be years before they decide on a course of action.  And then, of course, like you said it would no doubt be a lomg and slow restoration on top of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a major risk of having a gigantic budget, a ton of social pressure to get things moving and lot's of architects, engineers, construction companies and authorities trying to get a piece of the pie. I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up massively over budget, with a ton of mismanagement and a formal investigation into where all the money disappeared to.</p></div>		</li>
