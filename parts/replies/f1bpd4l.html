			<div class="markdown"><p>Mathematics would be so much easier to deal with if we used base 12 instead of 10. 10 is divisible by whole numbers* for 2 and 5 while 12 is those plus 3 and 4 allowing us to more easily/cleanly divide numbers into 3rds and 4ths.</p>
<p>*I'm excluding 1 and the base itself for simplicity</p>
<p>edit: Oops. As pointed out, 12 is not divisible by 5 - but trading it for 3 and 4 is worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely believe you, but can you explain to me why it wouldn't be 4.5? I suspect I'm still thinking too base 10-y..</p>
<p>Is it because each &quot;1&quot; is made up of 9, rather than 10.. so.. but then my thinking gets fuzzy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is 4 and a half, but the &quot;half&quot; part is half of nine, which is 4 and a half again.. so half of nine in base 9 is &quot;4 and a half&quot; but that half equals 4 and a half &lt;--- there's another half so that equals 4 and a half &lt;--- again, etc so it's just a bunch of 4's. Maybe that helps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember long division back from elementary school? Instead of carrying a 10 when you need to move over, carry a 9 (because we’re in base 9) and you should get the right answer.</p>
<p>Edit: similarly when adding, when you get to 8 and add 1 more, you get 10 ( 1x9 + 0 decimal) and all the way up to 18 (1x9 + 8 decimal) where again you go straight to 20 (2x9 + 0)</p>
<p>If that makes any sense...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shooting from the hip, base9 10 = base10 9. Base9 11 = base10 10. You essentially lose the digit 9 as it is never needed. When you count to “9” you only need the digits up to 8.</p>
<p>E: what makes it a bit fucky is the base is an odd number, so dividing by 2 is a pita.</p></div>		</li>
