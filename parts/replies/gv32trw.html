			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. There is evidence of grieving behaviors in animals, including in dogs. There is also evidence of empathy. Whether empathy and grief are instinctual depends on how you define instinctual. There are likely benefits to mourning and empathy that led to the evolution of these traits. But the same argument could then be made that these behaviors in humans are also instinctual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. If you think about it from the dog's perspective, they can read human emotional cues really well and are considered empathetic to us because of our long shared-evolutionary path. It's possible that they do can feel sadness and grief and so maybe they recognize that in the humans they've evolved to pay close attention to? Super interesting, more research is needed!</p></div>		</li>
