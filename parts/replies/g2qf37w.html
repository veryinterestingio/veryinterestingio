			<div class="markdown"><p>One big difference between the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 is how the number is calculated. The Dow uses an average price of the 30 stocks*. Meanwhile the S&amp;P uses something called market capitalization, which ELI5 is how much the company is worth, so big companies like Apple get a much larger say in the value than a smaller company like Kohls H&amp;R block have little effect.</p>
<p>*the Dow divides by a number because of things that happened in the past that would throw the comparisons to previous values out of alignment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. This guy gets it. The Dow is mostly reported because it is tradition and people know the meaning of the number. The S&amp;P is a far better metric of the market so if you are just starting it is better to focus on the S&amp;P.</p>
<p>Side note: you should also check out other metrics such as the Russell 2000 to gauge different parts of the market.</p>
<p>Edit: the reason the Dow is not good is because underlying stocks split and go thru various other corporate actions that distort the price and thus distort the Dow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Dow historical price is adjusted for these splits. It's also from a day when you had to calculate the index by hand so adding up 30 stocks was a lot easier than weighting 500.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the same time, the Dow and the S&amp;P are so highly correlated that it doesnâ€™t really which one you choose, especially since the only use for them is getting a rough measure of the state of the market and the underlying economy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Dow uses the price of the 30 stocks with each getting an equal weight</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite right; the Dow tracks a virtual portfolio consisting of a single share of each of the 30 stocks, so it's really a price-weighted index, not an equal-weighted index.</p>
<p>An equal-weighted index would set the index shares based on the share prices such that each stock would have an equal &quot;index market capitalization&quot; in the virtual portfolio, and thus an equal % weight influencing the return of the portfolio (although starting from the point in time when the weights are set, each stock's weight then drifts up or down depending on how its performance compares to the rest of the portfolio, which is why rebalancing is a thing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that stocks can be removed from the Dow. For example, in 2018, General Electric was booted off in exchange for Walgreens, and just today, Salesforce, Amgen and Honeywell were added, replacing Exxon-Mobil, Pfizer and Raytheon Technologies.</p>
<p>This seems a bit contrived to me. Although I'm sure they do it in a way that doesn't skew the numbers <em>at the time</em>, they are preemptively dropping faltering companies so that the average doesn't drop. So in that sense, is the average even meaningful over time?</p>
<p>Edit: let me give an example. Let's say that you decide to create a &quot;weight index&quot; for a city. You pick 50 residents and track their weight over time. One of the residents loses his job as a waiter and becomes a toll-booth operator, and starts to gain weight, so you decide to remove him from your index and replace him with someone else. Then, another of your residents just starts gaining weight for no reason, so you decide to replace him too. </p>
<p>Each year, you wind up replacing a couple of residents for those reasons.</p>
<p>Is it appropriate, after 10 years, to say &quot;see, the residents of this city are really controlling their weight, just look at the index!&quot;? Of course not - the makeup of the index is being manipulated to make sure that the weights remain consistent.</p>
<p>So how does an index that replaces faltering companies indicate the strength of &quot;the market&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit for 5YOs with context because apparently I don't know how to talk to 5YOs</p>
<p>People want to know if the value of the companies in the country is going up or down because they think that will tell us if we are OK with money or are going to go broke.</p>
<p>Analysts make lists of companies they think are important. They think those lists mirror the health of the economy (all business in the country). There are different lists. &quot;The Dow&quot; is 30 of the biggest industrial companies representing several types of big industries (really rich companies who do a lot of business).  &quot;The S&amp;P 500&quot; is a list of 500 companies from many more types of businesses that tell about company health below the super giant corporation level.  The &quot;Nasdaq Composite&quot; is yet another list of 3000 companies. When these indices (the value of the companies on the lists) go up people like to think that business and the country is doing better financially.  It makes them feel good.  Sometimes it does mean that businesses are booming and the country is doing great, but sometimes it is just that the confidence of people buying into all of those companies is up.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq that one of those lists is based on is an organization that organizes the buying and selling shares/ stocks (small pieces) of a companies. It is called a Stock Exchange.  The NYSE or New York Stock Exchange is another that does the same thing with different stocks.</p></div>		</li>
