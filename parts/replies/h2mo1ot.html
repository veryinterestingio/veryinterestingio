			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned recently that snow shoveling is responsible for so many heart attacks that you can clearly see the seasonality in graphs like <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-is-on-track-to-become-the-u-s-s-leading-cause-of-death-yet-again1/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-is-on-track-to-become-the-u-s-s-leading-cause-of-death-yet-again1/</a> (heart disease deaths is the purple line) and hospital emergency rooms would make preparations based on weather forecasts. Perhaps the portion of people working from home the past year didn't have to shovel driveways so much and lead to a decrease in heart attacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most innocent things are astonishingly &quot;risky&quot;. We had more snow than in the last 10 years, but at the same time it was so much snow that the people who still did go to work weren't able to drive anywhere. Instead of the usual swearing and furious shoveling in the neighborhood we had a ball this winter. Can't go anywhere anyways, and free entertainment for the kids. Relaxing for once.</p></div>		</li>
