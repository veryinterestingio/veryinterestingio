			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem like you know what youâ€™re talking about, so I have a question. Iâ€™ve been told that humans upward nod to close friends, and downwards nod to strangers. Something to do with feeling comfortable/uncomfortable exposing our vulnerable neck. Is this bollocks or is there a grain of truth there?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The meaning is probably based on culture, but the nod itself might be ingrained in some of us because it seems to happen almost everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the guy and don't know anything but in my experience it's more about where you're from. I grew up in a rural area and it was always upward nods even to strangers. When I went to university I met more people who did downward nods regardless.</p></div>		</li>
