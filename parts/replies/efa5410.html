			<div class="markdown"><p>Some do, (some even by just running wget in the background) and firefox has an addon that does this as well.  I have no idea why they removed it from the firefox standard install, it used to have resume built in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some browsers (Edge) have option to resume downloads and sometimes it works. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, Continue is a completely different unrelated mechanism for managing preauthorisation of uploads.</p>
<p>Resumable downloads are usually implemented using Range headers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All web-based downloads are &quot;chunks&quot; - torrents may get those chunks for different hosts, whereas a web-request is typically (although not always) from a single source).  It's just that a web-server loses track of where it is in the chunks when the http connection is terminated.  Not ALL web-servers have this limitation either, some are well capable to continuing a download after it gets interrupted.  (e.g. chrome supports a &quot;resume download&quot; concept, which leverages this capability).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have a reference point for whats missing saved, rather than checking against what you downloaded first.</p>
<p>A torrent keeps track of its progress much mote effeciently.</p></div>		</li>
