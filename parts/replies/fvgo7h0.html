			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the humidity is %100 you <em>can</em> still steam cook or stuff like that, right? Cause as you said the percentage is only relative to  temperature, and the temperature around the flame is higher than the room</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  If you heat water to 212F, it will boil regardless of the amount of water vapor in the air.</p>
<p>What happens in higher humidity is that the output from your pot, teakettle, steamer or whatever will be whiter and more opaque.  That's because once that steam cools down to room temperature, it will turn back into water droplets.  On a dry day, much of the water vapor produced by your cooker can get absorbed into the air meaning that the output stays clear as it cools down.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>More precisely, you need more than 1 atmosphere of water vapor in the air, in order for it to still be in equilibrium.  That's not possible unless you increase the pressure.  (which increases the boiling point, because that's why).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the humidity would go over 100% then it would precipitate out, as condensation or fog or whatnot. So if you were in a room and boiled water it would get humid then more humid then visibly steamy as the air couldn't hold any more moisture within itself. At that point it is at 100% but can't go any higher so everything else becomes visible water.</p></div>		</li>
