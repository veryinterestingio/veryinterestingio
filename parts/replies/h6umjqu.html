			<div class="markdown"><p>had a buddy in college who worked in a velveeta factory one summer. He said the nastiest, slimiest and moldiest leftover bits of real cheese were used in the process to make velveeta, and sometimes it was a real struggle not to throw up while working. Tons of dye and chemicals to hide to smell were added to the vat as well. Americans will literally eat the foulest shit if it processed and marketed correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood is a kind of cellulose, yes. So is potato starch. &quot;Cellulose&quot; basically just means &quot;vegetable fiber.&quot; Cellulose derived from wood HAS been traditionally used in some food applications going back to ancient times, though for fresh shredded cheese potato starch is now generally the standard. </p>
<p>That's partly because potato starch is more translucent, so the cheese looks more natural and less pale. It's also a PR thing, because cellulose from wood leads to a lot of panic-mongers screaming &quot;THEY'RE FEEDING YOU SAWDUST&quot;. Even though it's fundamentally no different from vegetable fiber in any other form, like that that's found in carrots or broccoli.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That moisture blocker turns out to be cellulose. All plants have this in abundance, not like it is some kind of man-made preservative. </p>
<p>To be fair though, some manufacturers have been caught using it as a filler while labeling the cheese &quot;100% pure&quot;.  </p>
