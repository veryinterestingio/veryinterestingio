			<div class="markdown"><p>They only taste test chlorides in that video, but there are actually a good chunk of other potentially palatable anions they could go with, depending on how far you want to stretch the sense of &quot;salt&quot; you're going for here. Perusing wikipedia for edible anions, you've got:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Acetate and lactate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various larger carboxylates, including citrate, tartrate, succinate, fumarate, and malate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phosphates</p>
</li>
<li>Various amino acid / nucleotide-related carboxylates, including guanylate, inosinate, glycinate, and glutamate</li>
</ul>
<p>Sodium salts of all of these are food additives (and some pretty tasty), but I don't think it'd be unrealistic to try taste tests of their ammonium, potassium, and magnesium salts if you had infinite time and money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MSG is monosodium glutamate, and the person you're replying to mentioned glutamates. Almost no need to test it though, as it's a known flavour compound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Monosodium glutamate is damn tasty, naturally found in tomatoes and cheese, as well as produced in your body, and despite the urban myths in it has no scientifically established negative effects at regular consumption levels. It's also a great  way to lower your sodium intake by substituting it for table salt.</p></div>		</li>
