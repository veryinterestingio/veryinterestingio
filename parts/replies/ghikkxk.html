			<div class="markdown"><p>The tidal interactions between the earth and moon are much stronger than between the sun and earth. Because of that, the earth is becoming tidally locked to moon (it's rotation rate is slowly decreasing). However, the process would take so long that the sun will become a red giant and engulf both the earth <em>and</em> the moon before that will ever happen :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a distance that a moon-sized satellite could orbit an Earth-sized body and likewise take an unreachable or nearly unreachable amount of time to become tidally locked, while also maintaining an orbit? I assume Earth's gravity is too insignificant compared to the Sun for a moon-sized object to continue meaningfully orbiting the Earth rather than the Sun at that distance.</p>
<p>What about, say, Jupiter? Could a satellite orbit Jupiter more directly than it orbits the Sun at any distance to be far enough out to avoid becoming tidally locked?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that but, if I remember right, as the earth loses energy on it's rotation and slows down it gives that energy back to the moon, which, is slowly increasing the orbital speed of the moon, which in turn pushes the moon away from earth slowly inch by inch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the sun lasted forever, sure! IIRC Mercury, the closest planet, is already kind of locked to the sun, although not exactly 1:1 because it orbits in an oval instead of a circle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To his point, Mercury is tidally locked with the Sun. Because it is much closer and smaller than the Earth. Venus, which is larger and farther away than Mercury, is not tidally locked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury is not tidally locked, it is in a spin-orbit resonance which is subtly different. Tidally locked is a special case of a spin-orbit resonance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Gravity pulls on the misaligned bulge, acting as a break on the small body's rotation until it is in step with its rotation around the bigger one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not always true as it depends on the sign of the difference of spin and orbital frequencies. That is the tidal evolution can result in a spin up or spin down of either of the bodies in the system.</p></div>		</li>
