			<div class="markdown"><p>The Craik and Tulving 1975 study concerned something called &quot;levels of processing.&quot; The subjects were given 60 words about which they had to answer one of three questions. Some questions required the participants to process the word in a deep way (e.g. semantic) and others in a shallow way (e.g. structural and phonemic). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Structural / visual processing: ‘Is the word in italics?'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phonemic / auditory processing: ‘Does the word rhyme with [some other word]?’</p>
</li>
<li>Semantic processing: ‘Does this word work in this sentence?'</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants who had read through the list while evaluating the words semantically did much better at recognizing the words later in a longer and larger list than those who evaluated the words structurally or phonemically.</p>
<p>The takeaway is that the more an item is processed and thought about, the more likely it is to be remembered. This is kind of why memorization by rote is a poor way to go about studying, and it's better to try and integrate what you've learned together so that they connect with one another and make sense. Further studies have examined this with more complex memory tasks, and it hold up.</p></div>		</li>

Is the training done in early childhood as effective as that done in later life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that they grow up closer to their true genetic potential, rather than an increase in intelligence? The intellectual capacity was always there, it was just preserved and put to good use thus was never lost in synaptic pruning. Whereas a child who never exercises these skills will grow up with a gap between their abilities and what was once their potential. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fallacious to think that the intelligence was &quot;always there,&quot; as it were. There's a genetic component to intelligence, but it's not entirely inherited and predestined at birth. Much of it depends on exercising and developing the brain over childhood and a lifetime of maintenance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that were the case then everybody in the same school would get about the same grades and standardized test scores. But they don’t. Some people are just smarter than others. Doesn’t mean they’re going to be more successful, because that takes a lot more than just intelligence, but they’re still smarter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TLDR when children’s brains are establishing neural networks the greater the stimulation the better. If they are stimulated by music, colors and interactions more neurons branch and form, and after some time (and continuous engagement) they will solidify. These pathways form a great foundation for future learning and memory.( Ofc there is much more to this including brain areas affected and mechanisms but if you don’t feel like reading textbooks)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because genetics is still not a very well understood area of study, so it is difficult to make any concrete statements concerning its role in memorization, but this answer cites a concrete study, with results that are possible to test without much difficulty. In fact, it would make an excellent Science Fair project. </p>
<p>I think it would be neat if r/Science hosted a Science Fair and attempted to replicate the results of well known studies in their field to promote Science Literacy in general and show people why these things are <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/they-don-t-think-it-be-like-it-is-but-it-do" target="_blank">how it do be</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>maybe he or she means it's a better answer because it's something you can do or control rather than it being determined just by your genes like you can improve.  just my two cents. </p></div>		</li>
