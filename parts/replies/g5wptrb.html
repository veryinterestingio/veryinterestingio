			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This is the problem with what is sometimes called wish-cycling. People think that an item can probably be recycled but they're too lazy to actually look it up. So they stick it in the recycle bin thinking that it's better to try to recycle it than throw it away. These people think they are being extra &quot;green&quot; because they are attempting to recycle more. What they don't realize is that by contaminating their recycling with stuff that isn't accepted by their recycling center, they are condemning ALL of their recyclables to the regular trash!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Companies have successfully convinced users that pollution is a people problem rather than a sustainability problem. The fact remains that manufacturers prefer virgin plastics over even properly sorted recycled plastics.</p>
<p>So long as they have people convinced that the problem lies with people not putting things in the proper bin, the people won't look at the bigger systemic issues of how our environment gets flooded with waste. Even if everyone did their part in sorting plastics properly, it wouldn't put a noticeable dent in the amount of waste we produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, it's not the biggest issue. It's still important for individuals to take personal responsibility for recycling properly.</p>
<p>This is doubly true in the US specifically because many areas (where recycling is run by waste disposal companies, in particular) have moved towards a model where huge amounts of recycling is processed in lump batches, increasing the amount of waste generated by each improperly recycled item.</p>
<p>I agree that we could have a better system that minimizes these impacts, rather than maximizing them, but until then it's more important than ever for people to make sure the items they put in the recycling bin will actually be recycled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct but this wasn't the point. And in fact if companies had successfully got the word out that putting the wrong items in recycling was a problem,  it would be less of a problem.</p>
<p>My point was ONLY about recycling,  not to address the problem of waste in general. And there ARE huge campaigns against single-use items which obviously is the biggest problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You'd think even a casual inspection of every 20th bin on a street &amp; notices for flagrant violators would greatly decrease the rate of contamination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is always an odd thought of mine while living in an apartment building, with garbage chutes, but one big recycling bin... </p>
<p>How/does it get sorted with an apartment buildings amount of stuff... does it just get chucked to a landfill?</p></div>		</li>
