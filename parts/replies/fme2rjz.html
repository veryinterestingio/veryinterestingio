			<div class="markdown"><p>The explanation should have been more like:</p>
<p>With gas engines the work needs to done to generate the power, from the moment you press the gas pedal and till the power is going to the wheels, there's a huge delay cause the engine has to make that power.</p>
<p>Battery on the other hand already has the power stored in it. All it needs to do is release it. </p>
<p>Also something I noticed, more cycinders is not equal to more performance! In short scope, yes it's &quot;easier&quot; for the car to produce more power but it makes the car heavier too. Like the saying goes &quot;a powerful car is faster in a straight line, a lighter car is faster everywhere&quot;</p>
<p>There's other things that you can add to a car to make it perform a lot better, like a Turbo for the intake, better exhaust, better suspension, better tyres and brakes. All these small things add up, if we actually take a proper example, this is the difference between a buggati V16 Chiron with 16 cylinders vs an F1 car with 6 cylinders, the F1 will smoke the shit out of the Chiron any day!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, higher quality/lighter engine parts (cylinders, valves, etc.) are crucial for higher performance cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A super basic way to say this is the power, as you mentioned, must be first created but then must travel through more components and moving parts to get to the wheel. Power in an electric car is already created and is at already at the wheel.</p>
<p>Also, number of cylinders varies in different cars, 4 being the least number. Nowadays you will see a larger number of smaller cylinder engines (4 and 6) due to improvements in engine design. You can get the same power out of 4 cylinders now that a couple decades ago took 6 or 8.</p></div>		</li>
