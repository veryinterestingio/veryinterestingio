			<div class="markdown"><p>I failed most of my classes the first semester of my senior year because I couldn't sleep because of a chronic cough. And I couldn't find a competent doctor to help. I first went to the on campus Dr and they're a fucking joke. Then I went to an off campus doctor and while I'm in the office I'm breathing perfectly fine so the doctor said he can't help, so instead he told me that I'm young enough not to be totally corrupted by sin and told me I should join his church's Bible study for college students. And then the moment I stepped in the parking lot, I had a coughing fit so bad that I threw up.</p></div>		</li>
