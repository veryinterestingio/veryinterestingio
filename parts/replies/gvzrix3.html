			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll hop on this comment because I recently read a paper on the subject. We can modify the photosynthesis process to produce more ATP, which is needed for the Calvin cycle that fixes carbon from CO2 that plants use to &quot;eat&quot;. Plants with this modification grow faster, larger, and have higher yields than wild type plants.</p>
<p>The tradeoff is that they are less resistant to stress and disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked it up again and it was actually a preprint, so take its findings with a grain of salt. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.289967v4.full" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.289967v4.full" target="_blank">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.289967v4.full</a></a>  </p>
<p>First a little background: genes are expressed in the cell to become proteins, which can act almost like nano-bots inside the cell to do work. The gene in question is purple acid phosphatase 2, PAP2, or AtPAP2 (the &quot;At&quot; is for Arabidopsis thaliana - the plant being studied).</p>
<p>For this research, they used mutants where the AtPAP2 gene is overexpressed (i.e. there is more of the protein encoded by AtPAP2 than usual). Those mutants appeared to grow flowers earlier, as well as grow more seeds. In addition, they used a plant where the AtPAP2 gene is &quot;knocked out,&quot; meaning the has had its DNA altered so it cannot express AtPAP2. The researchers who wrote the paper didn't make the change, they bought all of these plants through scientific supply companies.</p>
<p>To create a knock-out strain Scientists will write DNA code that the plant will incorporate into the gene in question. They buy that DNA from a company and put it in a bacteria which infects plants. They then infect plant cells using this bacteria. From there it is incorporated into the plant's DNA using the plant's own DNA repair mechanisms. To make sure the DNA is incorporated, the DNA also introduces another gene which makes the resulting plant resistant to a specific antibiotic. They then can grow the cells with that antibiotic, and know the ones which survive have incorporated the DNA.</p>
<p>This paper explores the chemical mechanisms that allows this to happen. Very generally, they found that AtPAP2 interacts with the photosynthesis of the plant. They were then able to compare differences from &quot;wild type&quot; (i.e. non-mutated) plants, the mutants which overexpressed AtPAP2, and the plant which has AtPAP2 knocked out to find how it functioned in the plant. One thing that's interesting about their findings was that the protein encoded by AtPAP2 likely has interactions with 40 other proteins in the chloroplast and mitochondria. So, by just manipulating the amount of protein this gene makes in the cell, they were able to see these significant effects. While the increased ATP/higher yield is interesting, and has far-reaching effects, the immediate benefit is that it helps us better to understand the role of the many proteins involved in plant metabolism.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But I'm currently tied up in trying to teach myself flora bonsais. </p>
<p>So far... I've gotten 1 full size plant (whoops)
She's now the mother plant for potential clones haha.</p></div>		</li>
