<p>Edit: Mainly because of its impact on battery life in laptops, tablets, and other portables. Don't forget that your use case is not the only use case on earth. You might have a beefy gam3r desktop, or a laptop you never unplug, but plenty of people want their laptops to last all day on battery, and a power-efficient CPU is important for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, consistency in performance.</p>
<p>Big manufacturers have to produce a constant amount of &quot;good&quot; pieces at a constant pace. If you know that a specific architecture can produce a theoretical clock speed of 1000 MHz but raw materials impurities can account for a +/- 15% performance (just making up numbers) you will sell that specific line of cpus for a &quot;guaranteed&quot; 800 MHz clock speed, reducing the number of unsaleable and defective pieces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came looking for the real answer, and here it is.</p>
<p>It really just comes down to variance in silicon quality. Even within the same model of CPU every chip is a little tiny bit different. CPU fabrication is fascinating stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to go in further in detail. </p>
<p>In the making of the processor of a certain architecture, there will be differences in the quality of the processors. F.ex: The borders of the wafer typically produce lower quality processors.</p>
<p>For this reason the processor is tested at various speeds and rated.</p>
<p>the best processors are cherry picked for the high end lines, while the others get separated in different quality groups. </p>
<p>Now, to position yourself on the marked an to maximize profits, you will need to sell different models, with different specifications, so that you can cater to as much customers as possible. The volume of what you will sell to this different market segments is does not 100% correspond to the volume available in the different quality batches. For that reason sometimes better processors are tuned down for marketing reasons.</p>
<p>So besides the safety margin, there is also a certain amount of luck involved in how much margin there really is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that they mass produce the CPUs, and then test each one for error rates at different speeds. They then sort them into different &quot;bins&quot; based on the the best speed for that particular CPU within an error tolerance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, that is literally just Intel asking for more money for something that could easily be enabled on all CPUs. Being OC enabled doesn't mean it'll actually OC at all. The only thing they guarantee is that it will hit the clocks on the box.</p>
<p>AMD don't artificially restrict their Ryzen CPUs. You can OC them all. (To what degree is of course down to your luck in the silicon lottery.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speed-binning means that you can have several &quot;different&quot; CPUs from the same family that all come off the same wafer. When yields are good, they get more units that qualify for the highest rating than they could ever sell at that price.  So most of them end up being labelled and sold as lower end CPUs when they're functionally identical to the top of the line.</p>
<p>When this happens you have a legendary overclocking CPU.  The original Celeron 266 was one of the first.  They were slow in office applications but just as fast as the Pentium in games.  The Celeron reliably overclocked to 400 mhz at a fraction of the price of the P2-400.  Some of the AMD Thunderbirds are in the pantheon as well.  Not only did they have insane overclocking headroom but you could enable the unlocked multiplier feature of the more expensive models by bridging two contacts with a <em>pencil</em>.</p>
<p>More recently (but still ancient history) was the Core2 Quad Q6600.  Sold as a low end 2.4 ghz CPU, but every single one of them would do the 3.2 ghz of the top model.  Mine did 3.7 ghz, Prime95 stable overnight, with air cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, overclocking increases the thermal output of the processor, along with power consumption, both of which aren't ideal when intended for laptops or office computers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - and to add to <em>this</em>, overclockers use non-standard cooling to overclock. </p>
<p>The manufacturer rates them to work acceptably with a stock cooler. </p>
<p>If you're willing to cool it down faster (i.e., spend more money on cooling), you can get more performance out of it.</p></div>		</li>
