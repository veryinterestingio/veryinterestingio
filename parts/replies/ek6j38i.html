<p>To be pedantic, 'meters per second' is a measure of speed, 'meters per second <em>per second</em>' is acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's just conservation of momentum... The momentum of a 2kg object being shot at 2000 m/s will be enough to accelerate a 600kg object to about 7 m/s in the opposite direction. He should have said &quot;the acceleration imparted would only bring the craft to a speed of less than 7 m/s&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it accelerate faster but for a period of time less than a second as well? Recoil is nearly instantaneous?</p></div>		</li>
