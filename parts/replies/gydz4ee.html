			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, though I would also like to point out that the process of inoculating trees with the truffle spores is an inexact science. The climate, soil acidity, and drainage all have to be conducive to the growth of the truffle, and then there's the matter of actually <em>finding</em> the truffles when they're ripe. You can certainly rake for truffle when they're in season, but your take will include lots of unripe (and therefore unappetizing) truffles, or if you wait too late, your crop will be predated by the wildlife that's able to get into your orchard. Hence truffles being found with pigs and/or dogs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only graft roots to related plants, so you need some sort of oak or hazel tree.  You could no doubt just dwarf an oak tree by pruning it, but the symbiotic fungus depends on the health of its partner.  If the oak tree (or whatever its host is) isn't big and healthy, I doubt you would get many (or any) truffles.</p></div>		</li>
