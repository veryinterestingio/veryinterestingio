			<div class="markdown"><p>There were many people who were smarter on this than I am. I have, however; noticed a couple of things missing in the examples region.
To start with, streptococcus needs to be treated very quickly because when it isn't, and your immune system learns what it looks like, then you can become immune to having valves on your heart. In other words, your body will learn the shape of something that it needs as a foreign and dangerous substance.</p>
<p>A little closer to what you are specifically referring to is outlined in the bookVaccine A by Gary Matsumoto. This discribes exactly what you're talking about. Many of my fellow servicemen gained really dramatic autoimmune disorders because of this experimentation. Examples range from the immune system attacking the heart, the reproductive system, and most traumatically the central nervous system. Part of the problem with diagnosis for these problems was that it behaved somewhat differently from person to person.</p>
<p>I hope this helps your understanding, and gives you a few further leads for further knowledge</p></div>		</li>
