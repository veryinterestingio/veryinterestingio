			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that this is how butter is churned. Mix the milk up, and those fats will “lose” their protein raft. So then the fat separates out and clumps up, forming butter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also how rennet forms cheese. The fat molecules are enclosed in a protein shell called casein, which has a negatively charged end which repels the other molecules. Rennet is an enzyme that cuts off the negatively charged end, thus causing all the casein molecules to join together, thus forming curds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That casein is also the reason that milk can help when you've eaten hot Chilli's, the protein attaches to the capsaicin oils and helps carry them out of your mouth. <del>So don't bother with soy or almond when it comes to spice!</del></p>
<p>Edit: Looks like Cunningham's Law has struck again, I can't say for certain about the non-dairy milk so I'll redact the comment :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa, that's super cool!</p>
<p>Does the whole mixture become butter? Or does the butter separate? If it separates, what do we do with the liquid that's left behind? Is it, like... skim milk because it has no fat in it anymore?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's... check this out... buttermilk. As in pancakes.</p>
<p>Commercial buttermilk is almost never made this way, but real buttermilk is the fat free leftover from butter churning. It is much like skim milk when fresh, but the milk is often fermented before making into butter to enhance the flavor of the butter, which is why real buttermilk is tangy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a similar process to how soap breaks down grease in a pan, the soap (detergent is the technical term) has a hydrophobic end, and a hydrophilic end, the hydrophilic end dissolves in water (for lack of a better term) and the hydrophobic end picks up the grease so that it can be carried away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soap and detergents are actually chemically distinct. Soaps are sodium and (sometimes) potassium salts of fatty acids. There's a bunch of different kinds of detergents, but the most common ones have sulfonate as the anion. The important difference is the carboxylate vs sulfonate anion. Soaps are more likely to form insoluble calcium products in hard water, while detergents resist this.</p>
<p>Both are surfactants, and I think that might have been the more general word you were looking for.</p></div>		</li>
