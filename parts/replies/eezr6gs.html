			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to love the feature on my Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 where I could force 3G instead of 4G LTE.</p>
<p>Because at the time, 3G had way better signal strength,
and telling your phone to basically give up on 4G, improved my speeds and experience.</p>
<p>A strong 3G signal was better than a weak 4G signal.</p>
<p>Ah yes, 2014.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really weirdly even today I find 3G is faster than 4G in my uni town - to the extent that 4G is sometimes totally unusable but 3G will do 1080p video at 2x speed. I don’t understand why - I’ve got a new phone and it’s a reasonably big city so it’s not like we’ve been neglected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you need millimeter wave antennas, and where I live, they come in the form of microcells. That is to say a box that connects to the fiber backhaul stuck on a telephone pole, with the actual antenna sitting on top of the pole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. There is new spectrum open up with mmWave so that will be new hardware. Some parts of 5G are just evolution of LTE to improve the spectral efficiency. It gets fuzzy where the cutoff is and AT&amp;T is already trying to take advantage of this and rebrand their LTE-Adv network as 5G. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Some parts of 5G are in a lower frequency band around WiFi frequencies (1.4 to 5Ghz), while the 1GB/s is in the 22Ghz band. However the high frequency band (mm wave) is stopped by the atmosphere, so it only has range of a couple hundred meters. </p>
<p>I believe the low frequency is rolling out first, as it isn’t as challenging to implement. </p></div>		</li>

<p>ELI5: Software Defined Radios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most radios (WiFi chips, walkie-talkies, cell phones) are built to do one thing and one thing only. They are pre-programmed when they are manufactured to operate on certain frequencies and broadcast data and a specific manner (because this is cheaper and uses less power when talking about mass-produced, embedded chips). </p>
<p>Software defined radios (SDRs)... aren’t. They know only how to send and receive radio waves, and rely on the software controlling them to tell them what frequency to send, receive on, what format to broadcast data in, how to interpret received signals, etc. <em>The software defines the type of radio that it is.</em> You could use one to connect to a WiFi network, press a button and then scan police bands, press another button and connect to a cellular network, press another button and talk to your friend on his ham radio. You can make the radio do anything with the supported frequency range, including interfering with a bunch of restricted frequencies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of having a hardware radio, you have radio controled by software. Basically like a wifi chip is designed with the wifi standard in mind. Its designed to work with wifi and only wifi. Much of the wifi standard is implemented in actual microchips, with a very limited layer to interact with the software driver and eventually the operating system.</p>
<p>SDR basically rips 90% of that away. The hardware knows how to create or transmit, or receive radio from a frequency. The actual data recieved is provided to the operating system as raw data.</p>
<p>For example, if ypu wad using a wifi chip to use wifi it might go something like this.</p>
<p>Computer: hey wifi chip, connect to network &quot;prettyflyforawifi&quot; with the password &quot;buttstuff&quot;, tell me when you get done if you were successful or not.</p>
<p>But with sdr it might be something like this</p>
<p>Computer: hey sdr chip, listen to the frequency range 2.2 ghz to 2.6 ghz and dump the data in memory location 1f00008943, in 16 bit chunks in a C style array. Update as often as possible, and check every second for a break command.</p>
<p>SDR is dynamic radio. An SDR could listen to anything from wifi to bluetooth, to FM radio, or to the sounds of a black hole evaporating. Data is provided as raw data, and standards or algorithms are implemented on a software level, way above the hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4G voice calls are still a mess in many cases.</p>
<p>If you use an iPhone, it's fine. If you use Android many networks will only let you use 4G calling if you're using that network's firmware only, and even then only support the latest version of many flagships.</p>
<p>All other devices are bumped down to 3G or lower.</p>
<p>Has Taiwan fixed this problem? Or are voice calls on some devices forced to 2G?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about other places but here telcos are forced to accept signals from other networks (especially emergency calls). So for example if you are with X and you are only near a Y cell tower then Y will relay it for you - however this is rare because Y then gets to charge X a nice big rental charge so it's beneficial for X to build their own towers. </p>
<p>The only problems we have are around frequencies, some phones made for some overseas markets won't work here. Our 2g network was shutdown a while ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, 2G was shut off in 2017, so I'd imagine they got it figured out. </p>
<p>I've noticed from time to time that my connection would drop to 3g, but only for a few moments and it's usually only on the train or up in the mountains. </p>
<p>However, service has improved quite a bit from even just a year or two ago. </p></div>		</li>
