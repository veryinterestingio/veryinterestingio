<p>1: give me a new 10-year loan for $100. I would now have $50 and would repay $10 a year for the next 10 years. (Refi).</p>
<p>2: sell me a second, 1- year loan for $50. I also have $50 today, would continue to pay $10 a year on the original loan, and $50 a year for 1 year on the second. (&quot;second mortgage&quot;). </p>
<p>3: give me a $50 line of credit (home equity line of credit ... HELOC... Second mortgage option 2) similar to how a credit card works. I have access to $50 and repay what I use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Refinancing isn't attractive in some situations if for example, the new loan would have a higher interest rate than the original.  </p>
<p>There are also some kinds of second mortgage loans (home equity line of credit) that have a flexible period where one can spend the loan value as needed instead of receiving a lump sum at once.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>*Your house is sold at a low value cos all they care about is quick recovery of their money. They charge you a shit ton for the costs in forcing this sale. You get what is left, which is nothing, and a bad credit record.</p>
<p>[And an extension of this] When you take out a mortgage your bank gains the right to be the first to get it's money back in any sale. It gets it before you do, and it gets it before the provider of any second loan does. It also has the right to force the sale, and manage the sale, and take possession, if you are in breach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[So this makes no sense because i missed a step XD] <del>The bank 'owns' the half of the house that you have paid for, and as they only gave you half the value of <em>half the value of the house</em>, they only need to sell the house for a quarter of its value to get their $50,000 back. This is a foreclosure. You can't pay the bank back, so they get your house (and you have to pay the sales charges etc).</del></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For most people its because A second gives you a shorter term/ smaller loan so your monthly payment isn't higher for 30yrs.  Ex- you have $100k left on your loan and have a $1,000/month payment.  You added a second mortgage for $50k and that payment is $500/ month.  You now have $1,500/ month in payments.  Say you get a surprise bonus the next day and are able to pay off the second.  You now go back down to $1k a month in payments.  If you had refinanced the first you would pay the $50k and your monthly payment would still be $1,500.  </p>
<p>There are a couple reasons not to touch an existing loan..</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if the original rate is better than today's rate you can have a small chunk at that higher rate instead of all of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your payment is mostly going to interest in the first years and slowly blends to paying the loan off later.  If youre well into the loan you don't want to start over paying mostly interest.</p>
</li>
<li>smaller closing costs on a smaller loan</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally the home equity line of credit (HELOC) is an option that you pay minimal closing costs (maybe $100) and you can draw against whenever. Its good because you don't have to keep paying closing costs whenever you want something.  Think of it like a low interest CC but high stakes because if you don't pay the bill they take your house.</p></div>		</li>
