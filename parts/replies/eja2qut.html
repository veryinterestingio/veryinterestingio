			<div class="markdown"><p>I can add to this. Loop diagrams allow the probing of much higher energies virtually. So while you may not be directly observing super partners the loops with these super partners will effect the calculations and measurements of various decays. So you look at the reactions and calculate with and without these loops. If experiment agrees with the no loop version then you can rule out their existence at higher energies (in the standard model). Every time LHCb looked at these loops (during my time) as suggested by theorists. They found no evidence.  If memory serves me they probed via loops to over 100 TeV.  Consider me dubious as to just needing more powerful accelerator ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who used to work in HEP-ex on SUSY/new physics stuff, I would add my skepticism of those (not saying /u/MpVpRb is one of them) who claim that a more powerful accelerator would do us any good. This is obviously anecdotal, but after the initial results from Run II came out, a lot of the younger people I knew were pretty pessimistic about the viability of new physics research at colliders. (To say that students and post docs are always leaving the field because there's a dearth of faculty jobs and that I'm seeing a spurious relationship between conversations with friends/colleagues and nearly everyone I knew leaving the field is a fair critique, but I think there's something there.)</p>
<p>To my eye, the previous iterations of new colliders where we got sizable jumps in energy were motivated (at least in part) by the search for the top and the Higgs, which we could credibly claim should've been &quot;right around the corner&quot; or nearly so, but now we can't. To my knowledge, we have seen no compelling reason, experimental or theoretical, to expect as-yet-unobserved phenomena to be lurking &quot;just around the [energy] corner&quot; at colliders, at least after having excluded huge swathes of the natural SUSY phase space. </p>
<p>I don't think you can find a group of physicists who can convince Congress or the broader HEP community that a 100 TeV collider would be a good investment of our already scant research budget, let alone <em>the best</em> investment, when compared with direct and indirect detection experiments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this fascinating insight. My background is biology so I donâ€™t have a comprehensive understanding of the limits of particle physics. What would you say is seen as the current best way forward in particle/fundamental physics if more powerful accelerators are not a good investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, you can check out some of the specific supersymmetry (SUSY) searches here:</p>
<p><a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/SupersymmetryPublicResults" target="_blank"><a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/SupersymmetryPublicResults" target="_blank">https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/SupersymmetryPublicResults</a></a></p>
<p>check out the &quot;SUSY particle searches&quot; filter category to get an idea of what people have looked for. My understanding is that none of these searches have jumped out as inconsistent from background, and each is probably about a phd thesis worth of work (many are people's phd projects).</p>

<p>There are also other things people haven't observed in LHC data, like WIMP dark matter candidates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the standard scientific process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a hypothesis</li>
<li>Devise an experiment which would counter that hypothesis</li>
<li>If that counter-effect is observed, discard hypothesis. </li>
</ul>
<p>What about the LHC means that it doesn't cause hypothesise to be rejected?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can reject all kinds of hypotheses with LHC data. The trouble with SUSY is that there are so many free parameters that you can almost always find a configuration of parameters that haven't been ruled out yet.</p>
<p>There are large swathes of parameter space that have been rejected by the LHC data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. So the way it wound up working in this case is sort of more like this</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a humongous number of hypotheses</li>
<li>Devise an experiment which would counter some of those hypotheses</li>
<li>If that counter-effect is observed, discard the ones which were countered</li>
<li>Back to step 2 and repeat</li>
