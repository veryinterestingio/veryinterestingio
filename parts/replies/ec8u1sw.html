<p>Bird ingestions are actually rare.  I worked for s charter airline for four years, averaging fifteen flights a day.  During that time, I saw a total of one bird ingestion, and maybe four cases where a bird struck a plane at all.  On the entire airport, not just our airline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for an air force base one summer in grad school.  My job was to make sure no birds had the chance to get into the planes.  Despite being on a migration route and surrounded by wetlands it was actually pretty easy to keep the base bird free without killing anything.  Didn't have a single bird impact that whole year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, this must have been a very small airport, or in an area with very little wildlife. Bird strikes are a regular occurrence, sometimes multiple per day at top 50 US Airports in temperate areas.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on a plane during take off and we ingested a bird. The smell was absolutely horrible. Never smelt anything so bad. It was quite scary actually. During take off there was a bang, instantly they powered down the engines and aborted take off. Then the smell came in. There was no damage, after inspection we took off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oof, yeah, cabin bleed air is generally taken off from the compressor, so I can imagine you got that full, liquefied goose smell. Delicious.</p></div>		</li>
