<p>A human without pain responses will quickly leave the gene pool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building on this, there's a condition known as CIPA: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain_with_anhidrosis" target="_blank">Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis.</a> It's a genetic disorder that stops the nerves that send pain signals from forming properly, which prevents the body from feeling pain. Sufferers have to be <em>extra</em> careful, because while putting your hand on a hot stove will still cause damage to the body, they won't get the pain signal to tell them to remove it.</p>
<p>One of the most common visible signs of CIPA is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12613315/" target="_blank">scarring around the lips, tongue and inner cheek walls</a>, because babies chew on themselves without realising what they're doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least they won't die in pain. All that sounds awful to me but it's mainly because I do get pain responses. For them it'll definitely suck to die but it's not on the same level of awful as it is to an outsider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also happens to people with advanced Diabetes. The high amount of sugar in the blood causes damage to peripheral nerves, especially pain receptors on the feet and hands. This is why diabetics are especially prone to foot ulcers (in addition to the vascular damage) and infections which often led to necrosis and amputations. They often can’t feel if a shoe is pinching or rubbing them the wrong way or if they’ve left their foot on something warm for too long etc. </p>
<p>There was actually a case against Dr.Oz by the family of a Diabetic man who got 5th degree burns from leaving a hot pad on his feet the entire night because he couldn’t feel it burning him.</p></div>		</li>

I can't feel it until the heat travels farther into my fingers an by that point I'm injured. I have to be extra careful while cooking or using hot water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's all well and good but a rather large amount of pain we feel is effectively useless.</p>
<p>For instance I broke my back years ago and now live in permanent pain, yet that pain serves no purpose. If I am lying down, I'm in pain. If I'm walking, I'm in pain. If I'm at the gym, I'm in pain.</p>
<p>I'd rather like it if we evolved to feel pain initially upon injury and then only if the injury is worsening, but other than that it should go away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nore realistically it goes to best available random mutation.  </p>
<p>People often think about evolution in terms of end goals, which is never the case.  It's more like water seeking the lowest point.  Water can't know that if it just went over that little hill it could then be at the lowest point, it merely flows to the next lowest point.</p>
<p>Evolution does the same. Theres no end goal, no recognition of intermediary steps that could lead to ideal solutions.  Its merely the best randomly available next step.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean that sucks but evolution is a matter of what works best not a matter of what you would rather have.</p>
<p>Issues like you describe do kill people though. The tallest man ever died because he wasn’t able to sense pain and therefore didn’t address it and died. Things like that. </p>
<p>We can tune out certain things. That’s why bad smells tend to fade even though they are still present (your brain just gets used to them). You don’t see your nose, unless you try. Any junk information your eyes see get disregarded etc. It hasn’t carried over to the pain sense, at least not as strongly, but maybe one day lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had kidney stones. That pain made me seek treatment <strong>immediately</strong>.  </p>
<p>If it hadn’t been so severe, I would have tolerated it and possibly died from infection or a ruptured kidney.  </p>
<p>I’m convinced kidney stones are one explanation for why people thought demonic possession was a thing.</p></div>		</li>
