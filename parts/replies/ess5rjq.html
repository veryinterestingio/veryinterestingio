			<div class="markdown"><p>This will be true eventually, but for the moment the universe is still young enough that the observable universe is expanding. Basically, there hasn't been time for light to reach us from the cosmological horizon--the point where objects are receding away at greater than light speed. Once it does, then the apparent expansion of the universe will stop and reverse.</p>
<p>Edit: to clear up a couple misunderstandings, I'm not saying that the space in the observable universe is expanding and then will contract, I'm saying that the distance to the furthest point from which light has had time to reach us is increasing over time, for the reasons OP outlines.</p>
<p>But eventually that distance will reach the cosmological horizon, where objects are receding so fast their light will never reach us. Presuming cosmological expansion continues to accelerate, the horizon will move towards us--not because any space is moving towards us, but because the distance at which the rate of expansion adds up to greater than light speed decreases.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I'm not crazy, here's a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0310808.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not quite understanding something about this. If everything in the universe started from a single point, and a star slightly beyond the edge of the observable universe is moving away at less than light speed how did it get to be beyond the cosmological horizon in the first place? Wouldn't the speed of the star relative to us need to have outpaced that of its light in order to be far enough away for the light to have not yet reached us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most common misconception about the Big Bang is it happened somewhere, and everything is expanding out from that point. In actuality, the Big Bang occurred everywhere, and the expansion of space is uniform - everything is receding away from everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple misconceptions here, everything in the observable universe was once very compact dense and compressed, our models of physics break down here so we don't actually know what would happen in these conditions. </p>
<p>Also we don't know how large the universe is outside of what we can observe, it may be infinitely large and all filled with matter etc.</p>
<p>Currently we can see all the way back in time to that early compressed state of our observable universe. This point in time was before the first stars in our observable universe formed, so there aren't any stars in our observable universe that have accelerated outside of it yet.</p>
<p>The universe can theoretically expand faster than the speed of light between two points. Under these conditions a star could leave our observable universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to distinguish the extension of the universe from speed of objects.</p>
<p>When we says that the universe is growing, we roughly says that &quot;the distance between two points perfectly immobile in the universe increase with time&quot;. So even if they look like they're moving, their speed is 0.</p>
<p>So during the big bang, it is likely that some particles did go from &quot;almost at the same position&quot; to &quot;very far away&quot; in &quot;a very short time&quot;, while being &quot;almost immobile&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true.. Once something goes beyond the horizon you continue to see the afterimage of the thing for some time after it has already begun &quot;moving&quot; at superluminal velocities (it isn't moving at superluminal velocities, space is). It'll just kind of seem to freeze there at the edge as it's last light redshifts into oblivion. I don't know how quickly the object would actually take to disappear entirely after passing the horizon, but technically speaking you don't really see it cross the horizon and just &quot;pop&quot; out of existence or anything. It's more like it just freezes there and gets darker until eventually nothing is left. Admittedly, I find this infinitely more horrifying than just here one second and gone the next.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All we can say is that our currently observable region of the universe appears to have been much smaller long ago. We can't say anything about what is (and always has been) outside our observable universe. It may be infinite (both now, and when the universe was young).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space isn't the only thing. The red dot a laser pointer makes on a wall can move faster than light, easily. Just swing it around and have the wall far enough away. Angular velocity times radius is the speed of the dot and there's no upper limit. The laser moves at the speed of light but the dot moves as fast as you want.</p>
<p>It's because these aren't actually <em>things</em> that are moving, but geometric abstractions. The dot is just an artefact of geometry, the point where the laser intersects the wall; and the expansion of spacetime is a change of the underlying geometry itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about the balloon analogy.  The universe is the surface of the balloon.  Draw two dots on the balloon and inflate the balloon.  The two dots are not moving, yet they are getting farther and farther apart because the space between them is getting bigger.</p>
<p>Even more: if you have two ants on the balloon, trying to walk towards each other, it's possible to inflate the balloon fast enough that the distance between the ants increases faster than they can walk.  They'll never reach each other.</p>
<p>The speed of light limitation means that the ants can only go that fast.  But the expansion of the balloon is not limited.  It's not even a motion, it's space getting bigger over time.  It doesn't break the speed of light limitation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you expand the space between two particles, they spread apart at the speed you set for expansion.</p>
<p>If you lined up 3 particles and expanded the space between each of them at the same speed as before, the distance between the first and 3rd particle will be twice as far apart in the same amount of time.</p>
<p>If you lined up billions and billions of particles and expanded space between each of them, even at a small scale/speed, the distance between the first and last particle would become larger at an extremely fast speed.</p>
<p>Now bloat that up to all the particles in the universe in all directions. The space on a small scale would be increasing slightly and slowly, while the edge to edge size would expand extraordinarily fast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The balloon analogy is correct, but the inside of the balloon doesn't exist. It’s just the surface of the balloon, not the insides of it. Way too many days trying to read books going, “but whats inside the balloon?”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, but actually no. You are correct that in the balloon analogy you image the plane of space as just the surface of the balloon. There is nothing inside the balloon. Inside the balloon doesn't exist. We only use a balloon for ease of explanation. The shape of the universe could be flat, round, a mobius strip, it's irrelevant for our purposes here.</p>
<p>What is important to keep in mind, though, is that the balloon analogy is just a model; it's a simplified view of the universe for the means to help understand. While the universe is expanding 2 dimensionally, our universe is 3 dimensional, and so it expands 3 dimensionally. In the balloon analogy, this would mean that as the balloon expands it also got thicker. However, you are 100% correct that there is nothing 'inside' the balloon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes exactly, thats what took me sooooo long to visualise.</p>
<p>Admittedly I was about 14-15 when I tried to get it, but it took me nearly 20 years on top of that before I really understood the balloon. I think when I started reading posts on here because I wanted to understand special and general relativity.</p>
<p>Three dimensions on-top of the balloon or dog bone or whatever it is.</p>
<p>I guess, I’m just posting this in case anyone else has the same issue. </p>
<p>Theres nothing in the middle cos there is no middle.</p>
<p>Edit: gotta remember that I was educated with physics in 1984-86. My physics teacher did not like “Big Bang” theory and thought it would be disproved at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trick is to understand that you can have a curved space without needing anything for it to curve <em>through</em> or <em>around</em>.</p>
<p>Consider the Earth. We all live on a curved surface, and as a matter of fact the curved 2-surface of the Earth is embedded in a nearly flat 3-space we call, er, space. There's an inside full of magma and an outside full of stars. And by reference to that outside, we can see that the Earth is round. Look at how the stars are different here from there. How it's daytime in Japan and night in New York. How the Moon is upside down when seen from Australia. We can check against the inside too: set up a seismograph in London and time the arrival of the shockwaves from an earthquake in China. Here are the waves that came around the surface... and here are the waves that came through the centre. So it's easy to think that curvature involves and requires that larger space.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that there is no surrounding 3-space and that the surface of the Earth is the entire extent of a two dimensional Universe in which we live like the people of Flatland. Could we still conclude that the Earth is round, without any reference at all to any outside universe?</p>
<p>In fact yes! Draw large triangles. In a flat space, as Euclid taught so well and as any schoolgirl will tell you, the angles of a triangle will add up to 180 degrees. But in a curved space that's not so. Draw a triangle with a right angle at the North Pole and the other two corners on the Equator. There you have it, a triangle whose angles add up to 270 degrees! Flatlanders living in a universe shaped like the surface of the Earth could work out the curvature of their space, even with no reference at all to any kind of an outside.</p>
<p>When we describe spacetime as <em>curved</em> or <em>stretched</em> or <em>warped</em> or anything like that, that's the sense we mean. Large triangles will have the wrong angle sum. The ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumference will vary from π. Euclidean geometry in general will be altogether out of whack. That's how the Universe can be curved and can expand even if there isn't any larger reality.</p></div>		</li>
