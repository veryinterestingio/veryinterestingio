			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s interesting, do you have a source for that? Wikipedia mentions that the first fibre optic trans Atlantic cable was laid in 1988, so we’ve had them under the sea for 30 years now, longer on land. </p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly when the last ones were no longer used, Though I know it wasn't all that long ago where coaxial was still being used in a couple places.   Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All cables presently in service use fiber optic technology</p>
<p>There have been a succession of newer transatlantic cable systems. All recent systems have used fiber optic transmission</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Granted this is only transatlantic, so there might be some undersea coaxial in use somewhere still.</p></div>		</li>
