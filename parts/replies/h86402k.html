			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s kinda crazy tbh. You’d think that their oxygen intake would have to be absolutely enormous considering their massive body volume — where is all that extra blood stored compared to land animals? Is their blood ‘denser’ as well? Kinda like natural doping. </p>
<p>I guess the extra blood probably means they’re denser pound for pound than a typical mammal, yeah? But all that extra mass is offset by the fact that they’re suspended in water all the time. Quite a fine balancing act.</p>
<p>It’s almost unbelievable that massive whales can even exist due to the squared-cubes law (and its implications for heat exchange and respiration), but I guess they found ways around that; namely, lots of (dense?) blood and always being in water. </p>
<p>It puts into perspective that massive land animals like the 88-110 ton Argentinosaurus were true anomalies — how did <em>they</em> manage to survive without the aid of water? They still were only half the mass of a modern blue whale though, so gravity obviously becomes a significant hurdle at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good questions. I'm not a biologist but  a writer and did a lot o homework on breathing and respiration a few years ago.</p>
<p>Anyone who really knows anatomy would murder me, but my understanding is that whales have &quot;spiral&quot; blood vessels.  That their circulatory systems are somehow less linear and instead (at least at the capillary level) run in spirals which allow for more blood volume.</p>
<p>Also interesting is understanding the difference between &quot;white meat&quot; and &quot;dark meat.&quot;Dark meat gets its color from myoglobin.  A slow twitch protein that stores oxygen i the muscle.</p>
<p>Birds have white meat in their flight muscles because they burn oxygen so quickly that they never hope to store it there.  Land mammals have darker meat because they have more myoglobin, and water mammals and whales and seals have DARK DARK meat because their whole system is designed to advantage holding more oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to consider is how metabolically active a particular tissue is. If you look at a PET scan of the whole body you can see which tissue is most active - and it’s often just brain heart and liver that are the hottest areas. Our brains and I assume whale brains consume massive amounts of oxygen. But if you had 5x more blood per weight and much higher myoglobin and hemoglobin  then you could already hold your breath a lot longer. Whale meat is almost black it’s so rich in oxygen storing myoglobin . But even humans as  an extreme example can have an amputated limb re-attached a few hours later. clearly your arm can “hold its breath” so to speak for far longer than other parts. Whales also slow their heart rate way down and even their livers and kidneys can be slowed down . Another way of looking at this is that below a couple hundred meters your lungs and whale lungs collapse (and whales can dive 10x that deep) - in other words there’s no air in the lungs anyway. If marine mammals can dive with collapsed lungs then there must be other mechanisms to carry oxygen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most thorough explanation. Whales and dolphins do sometimes &quot;log&quot; at the surface to rest, but mostly they rest underwater like <a href="https://api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/photography/article/sperm-whales-nap-sleeping-photography-spd" target="_blank">this</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, whales and dolphins don't have an involuntary breathing reflex. Every breath they take is manual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the half brain theory.... They just dont have the CO2 reflex to breath like us, they can take a breath anytime. The whales that dont go up for air, natural selection</p></div>		</li>
