			<div class="markdown"><p>Particles decay into other particles, and particle decay is probabilistic in how it happens and what things decay into. So, for example, let’s say the particles are dice. Roll the dice and it determines what the particle decays into.</p>
<p>Some particles, among the things they can decay into, are more or less likely to decay into a specific option over the others. For most particles, we understand the mechanics of why. The dice are weighted, or they have six twice instead of having a two on one of the faces, etc.</p>
<p>Scientists have now discovered that one specific particle is more likely to roll a six than other numbers, but as far as we can tell, the dice it is rolling are completely fair and there’s no particular reason for why it randomly keeps rolling sixes.</p>
<p>The options are that either CERN has gotten very (un)lucky in its rolls and it’s just a very unlikely coincidence, or we’re missing something in how this particle works that isn’t explained by our current model of particle physics.</p></div>		</li>
