			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah. They can certainly <em>look</em> the part from afar, thanks to their size, enough to make some unnerving iphone videos at the right angles... But <em>looks like</em> is nothing more than that.</p>
<p>Wind turbines, the big ones, are usually built far enough from most constructions that this is not a threat. Chances are even in a once-in-a-century (or once in a decade with a bit more climate change) hurricane the blades should land a couple of hundred meters short of your terrain if broken off and flung.</p>
<ul>
<li>That's not counting if you have a small one in your yard or something, but honestly I'd be more worried about a transmission tower than a turbine in such conditions. Several dozen meters of snapped line in a storm can be pretty hair-raising if there's enough wind to actually move the thing....</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's not counting the fact that it would've turned into the wind and would therefore now be rotating perpendicular to where the storm wants to send that, not sideways towards your house.</p></div>		</li>
