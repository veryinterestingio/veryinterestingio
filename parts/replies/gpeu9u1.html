			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, probably their surgeries and operations don't last long to affect the eyes, today there's surgeries that last 10 or more hours if complicated, while there, red color doesn't matter when it could last few mins or hour or two tops.</p>
<p>I always wondered why don't they just use transporter to beam in and out replacement organs tho... Considering they had shown holo-doctor performing as actual doctor who when needed had put holo-organs in alien crewmember when his lungs were stolen....</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a20571/longest-surgery-of-all-time/#:~:text=Q%3A%20What%20was%20the%20longest,twins%20conjoined%20at%20the%20head." target="_blank">the longest surgery on record occurred in 2001 and lasted more than four straight days—103 hours to be exact. A team of 20 doctors at Singapore General Hospital worked in shifts to separate Ganga and Jamuna Shrestha, 11-month-old twins conjoined at the head. Not only did the girls share a cranial cavity, their brains were partially fused. Typically such separation procedures might take 30 hours—still an eternity in surgical terms—but once underway, doctors discovered that the girls' brains were even more tightly enmeshed than expected.</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's a good chance they did do that, we saw them beam a baby out of the mother when there was complications. </p>
<p>Although that kind of very precise transporter use was not possible (or at least considered safe) during the TOS era and we see significant improvements in the technology from TNG to VOY.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, our cones that see red also see green, and they are opponent colors. Surgeons wear green. After looking at one color, red (blood),for hours, you tend to see less detail. Gazing away from the blood and towards the green will allow your cones to “rest” and see detail much better when you look back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to be an OR nurse and this is spot on. Focusing for hours on an operative site that is red will cause transient loss of fine detail in the center of your vision. Obviously not ideal during... Ya know... Surgery.  Being able to look at the inverse color allows the neurotransmitters from the cones to replenish.  Sounds reasonable, and it definitely helps.  Also focusing on a different distance allows the eyes to change shape avoid eye fatigue.  Same reason you should look away from your monitor at least a few times an hour.</p></div>		</li>
