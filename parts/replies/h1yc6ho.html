Reading OPs question I infer the context to be &quot;glass&quot; as in window. </p>
<p>When we describe why I can see through a window there are a couple of things that are inferred but perhaps not obvious, and in an ELI5 therefore must be highlighted. I'll try to do that now.</p>
<p>In this particular branch of physics that deals with the problem OP asked there is a property of materials called &quot;the index of refraction&quot;. It's a property that's indispensable in describing what will happen when light and things interact with each other and what the outcome is. That IoR property has a lot of factors that go into determining what value it is for each type of object that light might interact with. Things like what is the object made of, how are the molecules arranged, for example, but many more factors that are advanced. The point is every material object has this IoR property and it can be found by looking it up in a table. Is that good enough?! Absolutely!! It's the same level of detail and importance as when I say this brick weighs 10 pounds. You don't have to think about how much is because of this or that, or what amount of 10 pounds is due to the energy of this or that bond type. Nope, it's all shrink wrapped for you in that one number. Understood and accepted by all...it's no different than IoR when dealing with optical phenomenon. One hyper important factor that's baked into that IoR value is geometry! Geometry? Yes! It's never said because it's understood by people in the field, but is utterly not obvious for those not in this field. The geometry of the object shape is &quot;cooked&quot; into the IoR!!! That's factor #1. The other factor is colour of light. Unlike something like weight, the IoR will be different for each colour, be it red, ultraviolet, whatever, for each individual material! So for each material type, and each colour, there is an IoR. That's factor #2 (geometry and all other factors are baked in there too, remember). Now, lets address the question OP had. </p>
<p>IoR is used to tell us/calculate whether an object is transparent or not and because the colour of light is relevant, when we look up IoR for air and glass we can figure out how much gets through &quot;STRAIGHT&quot; with our particular geometry!! This is going to sound cold but when we look up window glass the IoR and planar shape of panes means we will &quot;see&quot;/calculate a result that's transparent...at many particular angles. If you look through your window at certain angles and certain coloured objects the brightness or reflection amount changes, i.e. not as/more transparent. I can literally look at my big window and find spots where it's almost completely opaque and if I take a step to the right that same spot of glass becomes transparent. Different colours, different angles can mean different transparencies and it can all be expressed in that Index of Refraction number and angles of attack.</p>
<p>That is how light/optics &quot;works&quot;! Any answer more sophisticated (including explanations using the p word) will have to account for all I've written and much much more.</p></div>		</li>
