<p>The English wanted it to be called CUT for &quot;Coordinated Universal Time&quot; and the French wanted it to be called TUC for &quot;Temps Universel Coordonné&quot; so they compromised by calling it UTC which doesn't stand for anything but has the same letters as the other two proposed abbreviations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely no scientist would write GMT for modern time measurements; there’s ambiguity about what it means. When it was last used for scientific purposes it was roughly the same as UT1 or UT2, but British civil time now appears to be based on UTC (though this has never been legislated).  If you want absolute accuracy to the nearest second or better, just writing GMT doesn’t cut it.</p></div>		</li>
