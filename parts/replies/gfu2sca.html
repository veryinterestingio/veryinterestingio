			<div class="markdown"><p>In my case, this Honda dealer stated they priced their items fairly according to the market and you didn't need to negotiate so the transaction would be less stressful. But I just look online with my phone and see 4 other dealerships with the same vehicle and a lower price that will let me haggle for that free undercoating I desperately need to win to validate my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, so go elsewhere. It’s a hyper-competitive marketplace. If their no-haggle pricing sucks and is too high, just don’t buy their cars. I still think no-haggle is preferable to the bullshit most dealerships do. And the more no-haggle pricing there is, the more transparent the market will become and the less opportunity there will be to get ripped off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For new cars at least, these dealers are just haggling with extra steps. I visited one of these without realizing they were a &quot;sticker price is our best and final price&quot; place.  They had a price lower than MSRP but still well above the average TrueCar sales price for that model in my area. When I pointed this out to them they managed to have &quot;found some other available incentives&quot; which dropped the price another $1k below their &quot;best&quot; price.  These weren't anything like &quot;first time buyer,&quot; &quot;new college grad,&quot; or a military discount. Just another BS way for them to continue to game the system.  </p>
<p>Drove a few miles to a regular haggling dealer and they beat this &quot;better than best&quot; price immediately.</p></div>		</li>
