<p>The job is going to pay an entry level wage, but managers selfishly want someone who is way overqualified and will be able to overperform for that low wage. They think those overqualified people won't need as much supervision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's more to it.</p>
<p>H-1B law requires the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An employer which recruits in good faith must offer fair and nondiscriminatory opportunities for employment to U.S. workers.  U.S. workers must be given fair consideration for jobs.  H-1B workers must not be favored over U.S. workers.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies therefore use phony job postings to demonstrate that they were unable to find qualified U.S. applicants, allowing them to willfully bypass the spirit of the law to hire cheaper, and more exploitable, immigrant H-1B labor. In fact these positions are impossible to qualify for by design. For instance, you may see an &quot;entry level&quot; position requiring three years of experience with a language or tool that's only been around for one year. That's not a typo, that's done on purpose. It's a deliberate and cynical loophole that denies U.S. citizens the right to work in many fields.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Redditors, what would it take to convince you that a company that advertised a need for 3 years experience with a technology that use existed for 1 year, had recruited in good faith when they hired a foreign worker?</p>
<p>Edit: not even convince just the standard for a civil lawsuit more likely than not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that hilariously extensive job requirements can also be used to tailor a job to a specific person.</p>
<p>Want to hire your buddy Fred, but your company requires you to post the listing for a full three weeks? List every single thing Fred can do, as a job requirement. Programming position? Doesnâ€™t matter, it requires 5 years of drone piloting experience, a lifeguard certification, and 8 years of experience as a hobbyist Toyota Camry mechanic.</p>
<p>Why? Because Fred will look <em>incredible</em> when he drops a resume on HR that perfectly matches the job requirements, and nobody else has even applied in those 3 weeks.</p></div>		</li>
