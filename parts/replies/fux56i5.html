			<div class="markdown"><p>I basically live just to the right of Mt Stupid on the Dunning Kruger graph so I generally know just enough to explain things in simple(but still wrong) terms. Like this explanation for example, it is deeply, deeply flawed and technically wrong but it gets the idea across. (Plus I studied behavioral brain health in school, don't do anything with it these days and have forgotten 90% of what I learned but still)</p>
<p>Plus I read/watch a lot of random shit. My mind is like a steel trap: rusty and illegal in several states.</p></div>		</li>
