			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. You're the second person to say this somewhere on this post (that I have seen).</p>
<p>What it's this about? What do you mean there is a 2x momentum change? I'm really weak in physics but about a billion years ago some dude got hot in the head with an apple and said that such a change (2x) is illegal.</p>
<p>I don't understand..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This one: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04310.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04310.pdf</a> seems like an interesting answer. In short, it is not a linear relation, but for the limit case of a stationary, heavy, ideal reflector at normal incidence it does indeed come out to 2x (eq. 8 deals with velocity after a single reflection, but momentum change will behave similarly up to relativistic speeds of the mirror). This seems to simply follow from eq. 1 and 2, which are conservation of energy and momentum, respectively.</p>
<p>In a more colloquial picture, consider this:</p>
<p>A photon hits a black body surface at normal incidence and is absorbed. Momentum is conserved, and thus the new momentum of the surface is simply the sum of both.  </p>
<p>A photon is emitted. This is the example discussed in the top answer. Since the emitted photon carries a momentum, the emitter surface experiences the opposite momentum change in order to conserve total momentum.</p>
<p>Since momentum is a vector (directional) quantity, in the first case the surface gains momentum +p_photon, and in the second case &quot;loses&quot; -p_photon (the direction of the vector is reversed), i.e. -1 * -p_photon = +p_photon.</p>
<p>Since &quot;reflection&quot; is the sum of absorption and emission, the total change is thus 2* +p_photon.</p>
<p>At least that is how I understand it in my mind. Compare also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure</a> in paticular &quot;Radiation pressure from reflection&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Equal and opposite, my friend.</p>
<p>So light is travelling at the speed of light (natch).  It hits the sail and all of that momentum is absorbed by the sail, pushing it in the same direction as the light was travelling.</p>
<p>But then the light is reflected by the mirror, sent back to it's source.  Just like shooting a gun causes recoil, emitting this photon causes recoil which pushes the sail in the opposite direction of the photon, which also happens to be forward since the photon is now travelling backwards.</p>
<p>If the sail was black, it would have only the absorbed momentum.  But because it's reflective it gets double momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the apple hitting Newton's head is actually made from extremely springy rubber, so that after hitting his head it bounces straight back up to almost the same height. </p>
<p>Let's consider down to be the positive direction. So the apple has a momentum of <strong>p</strong> immediately before impact, and then immediately after impact it has a momentum of <strong>-p</strong>. The change of momentum that the apple experiences is -2<strong>p</strong>. </p>
<p>Conservation of momentum implies that Newton must experience a change in momentum that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction (pretending that Netwon in this case is a point particle). In other words, the apple transfers a momentum of 2<strong>p</strong> to Newton, rather than just <strong>p</strong> in the case where the apple stops after hitting his head. In reality this momentum is immediately transferred to the Earth, where it has negligble impact because the Earth is much heavier than an apple^([citation needed]).</p>
<p>Now just replace apples with photons and you should get the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To extend on this: a bank of incredibly high powered lasers attached to a massive solar collector in orbit or simply in space somewhere, would be a pretty efficient way to accelerate a light sail if those lasers were pointed at the sail. Probably this has been discussed by the Lightsail project, but take the atmosphere out of the equation if possible.</p></div>		</li>
