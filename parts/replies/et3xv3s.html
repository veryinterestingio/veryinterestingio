			<div class="markdown"><p>I just read about the ion drives and they definitely sound like the best option for interstellar travel that we have at the moment. If I understood most of it, they last a long time, are extremely effecient, and can reach a pretty extreme velocity over a long period of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that to use ion drives for interstellar distances you would need to have the spacecraft be nuclear powered, at which point you could use a more efficient nuclear rocket so why bother with the ion drive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ion drives need large amounts of electricity which have to come from somewhere. Within the solar system we use solar panels which can basically run indefinitely. In interstellar space they’d be useless. </p>
<p>Even at Jupiter’s distance to the sun you only get ~4% of the solar power you’d get at Earth’s distance. The Juno probe had huge 14kW (in Earth orbit) solar panels which only outputted 400W at Jupiter.</p></div>		</li>
