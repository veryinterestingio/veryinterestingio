			<div class="markdown"><p>It can trigger a massive Vagus nerve response which triggers some drastic parasympathetic functions like passing out. </p>
<p>In patients with SVT, we can sometimes take advantage of this Vagal effect to lower their heart rate. Things like a carotid massage, dunking your face in ice cold water, and bearing down (making pressure in your abdomen like you’re going to poop, but without pooping) can sometimes restore a more normal rate and rhythm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll admit I'm not 100% on this and they are probably tightly related to each other, but I think there is a slight difference between a vasovagal response and neurological overload. I'm thinking of the difference in presentation between knockouts we see that &quot;put someone to sleep&quot; and recovery is slow, and the knockouts where people bounce up from the mat completely unaware that they went down.</p>
<p>The nerve I was taught results in a knockout with that classic cross to the jaw is the trigeminal nerve. The hit to the jaw slams into it, overloads your nervous system and causes a temporary &quot;blue screen of death&quot;.</p>
<p>The vasovagal reflex--as I understand it--can result in loss of consciousness due more to secondary means (reducing blood flow/oxygen to the brain via bradycardia and vessel dilation, basically sudden-onset hypotension) rather than the more direct means of overstimulation (turning on too many lights at once and throwing a circuit breaker).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's especially worth noting is most chokes in sports like MMA are blood chokes, meaning they block the arteries on either side of your windpipe, rather than blocking your airway.</p>
<p>So it's not a matter of holding your breath, it's actually preventing oxygenated blood from going to your brain. As long as it's not held there's little to no brain damage (it's safe to practice).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s either asphyxiation or limiting blood flow to the brain, either way essentially depriving the brain of oxygen.  Again, system overload (as the good doctor put it) and higher functions are sacrificed to protect the sympathetic nervous system to enable, where possible, breathing and basic function.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it possible that the ensuing memory problems I've experienced are also a result of similar &quot;overload&quot; trying to preserve function by sacrificing memory access?</p></div>		</li>
