			<div class="markdown"><p>There is nothing cheap in ballooning. You're talking about $50 an hour in propane to keep the thing aloft, another $50 an hour in bag deterioration from the heat, a couple of helpers in a pickup truck to retrieve it from every flight, insurance, a bottle of champagne to mollify the farmer whose land you alight on...and that's for a modest 2-person balloon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of the pilots at a festival in my home town landed in a field and scared the family's milk goat. You know, the only source of milk for their highly allergic to everything daughter.</p>
<p>IIRC, they lowered their price a bit after he said he asked them to take it to the slaughterhouse so he could have the meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a comment recently from a guy who works in ballooning who said his industry is a pretty accurate leading indicator for the economy. If rich people really do start worrying about the inverted yield curve, they put off their expensive ballooning jaunts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that would be a Key Grab with an envelope puncture.</p>
<p>That's promotional gimmick game for balloonists. A local car dealership will put &quot;the keys to a new WHATEVER&quot; on the top of a 20'-50' pole. If you can grab 'em, it's yours. It's about a million times more difficult it sounds </p>
<p>It's a great way to get all the balloons to one spot and a helluva lot of fun to watch , but gut wrenching to see someone miscalculate and puncture the envelope of their balloon.</p>
<p>Repairs are just as expensive as you'd think.</p></div>		</li>
