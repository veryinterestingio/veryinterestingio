			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I don't remember the scientific explanation for it and actually mocked one of my buddies who brought it up one time. Then a few months later my weather training included this as a legitimate meteorological indicator lol...still don't hear the end of that one til this day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I believe pine cones will close or open depending on the humidity</p>
<p>And pay attention to where on the tree birds tend to sit in raid or cold weather (I don’t quite remember this one) as it can show you the best place to shelter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The leaves of deciduous trees, like maples and poplars, do often to turn upward before heavy rain. The leaves are actually reacting to the sudden increase in humidity that usually precedes a storm. Leaves with soft stems can become limp in response to abrupt changes in humidity, allowing the wind to flip them over.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Something to watch for when thunderstorms are in the area. The trees aren't always right though (might not rain or storm could be off aways from you) and not every single leaf turns up. But it is a generally good indicator for approaching storms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha! I hear ya, it's cool stuff to pull out at random. I haven't worked in meteorology for 10 years now so I've forgotten a lot. But one thing I remembered was this. If you stand with your back to oncoming wind, a general rule of thumb is the the center of a low pressure system will always be to your left. It seems trivial but can be helpful in dire situations. It has to do with the fact that winds around a low pressure center will always flow counter-clockwise, and high pressure flows clockwise. If you know the wind direction, you can almost always determine low pressure is to the left, high to the right. If you ever had to make a decision based solely on this principle to determine which way you should go to avoid potentially inclement weather, this is a good place to start.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;You'll never determine the pressure gradient of my whirlwind and the direction of my attack!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I don't think so.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One my dad taught me was on a clear night if there is a ring around the moon there is a lot of moisture and rain the next day. Something about the moon light being diffused by the moisture.</p>
<p>Also a non weather one was if you hold you hand up to the horizon with you arm extended, each finger is roughly 15 minutes. So you can tell how much day light you have left.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one I remember from my grandmother is if the clouds in the sky look like “sheep’s wool”, expect cooler weather coming through, like a cold front. I can’t recall what that specific cloud pattern is called, but her tip still is usually spot on.</p>
<p>That leaf tip is fascinating, thanks!!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are probably cumulus, towering cumulus, or thunderstorms which are cumulonimbus. The cold front coming through causes lift, among other things. This will lift moisture in the air high enough to where it condenses due to the temperature decreasing aloft. This causes big puffy clouds, and when they get big enough they will eventually release rain and possibly thunderstorms if all conditions are met. Loved the science of the job, application was sketchy for me lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another one is a mackerel sky which are undulating or rippled rows of altocumulus or cirroscumulus clouds and usually mean unsettled weather within 12 hours. Either rain if above freezing or snow if below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We used to say &quot;Mackerel sky, could be wet, could be dry,&quot; which I never really understood, since those two conditions basically encompass every possible weather. Maybe it should've been &quot;will be wet and dry.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
