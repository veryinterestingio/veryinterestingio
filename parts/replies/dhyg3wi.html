			<div class="markdown"><p>Reproduction isn't even really a reason, it's basically just a thing that living things do, and if it doesn't reproduce then we don't consider it alive, and if something fails to reproduce it stops existing. So the only species that remain alive for any meaningful​ amount of time are those that reproduce above a minimum acceptable level</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To go further, there is no meaning to life. Living is just furthered by reproducing. Living creatures that reproduce continue to live through their offspring. There is no other way outside of immortality.</p>
<p>Anything that lives that does not reproduce isn't around long enough to be noticed. Life is like fire, it'll spread as long as it has the means to. </p></div>		</li>
