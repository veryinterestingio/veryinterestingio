<p>Our aquarium, for instance, takes a more naturalistic approach and hires a guard on duty to stand watch so none of the species get too violent with each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had an interesting experience with this in Australia at Currumbin Wildlife sanctuary. They have a big paddock where you can hang out with Kangaroos, and they hop around and you can feed them, and there‚Äôs a little creek running through it, and there‚Äôs a little bridge across to get to the ‚Äúhopping ground‚Äù. Well, we went to cross the bridge, but there was an emu chillin there, and we were a bit nervous about that. Ranger dude was like, ‚ÄúEh, just give her a nudge. We discovered some time ago that if we feed her loads in the morning, it keeps her pretty docile.‚Äù The way he said it inferred that incidents had become less frequent. üò¨</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I visited Monterrey Aquarium in California a few years back when they had rescued a great white. It was quite amazing to see. They kept it well fed but it grew so fast and the other fish in their largest aquarium started to show up with bites. First a mola mola, then another shark, then a turtle. Finally they had to tag and release it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I read that without the <em>from</em> and thought &quot;well that would make the other fish seem less appetizing&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
