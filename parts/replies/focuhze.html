<p>Unlike other consoles, the N64 doesn't run any code directly off the cartridge</p>

<p>Yes it does. It copies <strong>some</strong> code to RAM, but no games run completely out of RAM and will mostly run from ROM. Every cartridge based system operates like this with the N64 being no exception. N64 cartridges range from around 4MiB to 64MiB, and the system only has 4MiB of RAM total (8MiB with the RAM expander). No game, even the smallest one, has the necessary space in RAM to run without the cartridge and it WILL need constant direct access for things like level geometry and sound that will be executed directly. To the processor, the cartridge is just another chunk of memory in it's address space.</p></div>		</li>
