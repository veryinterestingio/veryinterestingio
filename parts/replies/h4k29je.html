He worked crazy hours and expected his students to do the same. After his death it was discovered he was able to work such crazy hours because he was heavily addicted to cocaine .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Same in the oil industry. For a lot of staff during turnarounds there's really no reasons to do 24 12+ hours shifts in a row. The union crews productivity is highest at ten hours but they do 12 and you get maybe half an hour more work out of them. The young engineers can keep up with eight hours shifts and stick around when there's issues, but the mentality is that whoever clocks the most hours works the hardest. Productivity is shunned. Don't you dare leave after eight and trying to prove its unnecessary to stay, the OT hours are considered sacred gifts that must be preserved. Work life balance is a sin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had a job interview for an IT position where the man interviewing me said that it was normal to push something to production at 8 pm on a Friday and then keep working till 8 am to make sure everything was all right.</p>
<p>I asked how those hours were compensated and he looked at me as if I had said something disgusting. I guess I was already looking at him as if he had said something disgusting. I didn't get the job. I didn't feel bad about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you would not believe what other ridiculous traditions units have, the last icu i worked in had this weird, not exactly rule, more of a tradition, that you don't write down what you see in patient tracking at the time when it happens, but every 2 hours no matter what, because it looks nicer. Another tradition that had formed there is that most docs simply don't even go to the icu, and only nurses, aids and students are present. seems like good thing for overcrowding, but it's really shite when something goes wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Airline pilot here, my girlfriend is a nurse. It absolutely blows my mind that healthcare workers don’t have fatigue rules in place. If me as a pilot am guaranteed a minimum of 8 hours of rest, and can only work 14 hrs in a 24 consecutive hour period, in overall comparatively less stressful environment (we spend most of our time in cruise), then doctors and nurses should definitely have similar rules in place. Especially if like you said, you are dealing with life or death decisions for hours on end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way I've heard they get around that is that 80 hrs/wk is to be the average. So you can do 100 clinical hours one week and 60 clinical hours the next week and be in compliance, but you're expected to spend time on your &quot;down week&quot; working on research. Almost every resident exceeds 80 total hours worked most weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's still (as far as I'm aware anyway) debate on if changeovers in healthcare professionals is more likely to cause issue with the service you receive, or if a tired doctor is.</p>
<p>I believe a lot of healthcare professionals see the handover to be the most likely time for pertinent information not to be passed on (not necessarily out of negligence or anything, just being human and somewhat forgetful), and that causing the most issues.</p>
<p>Of course, the health of patients doesn't work to a doctor's schedule. Who would you want to be administering your healthcare at what should be the end of their shift? The person who is expecting to go home, not used to working past their scheduled goes, and so is likely somewhat tired, or the person who is already used to working past those hours?</p>
<p>Currently I think the current model is the best for the patient. Does it need revising though? Certainly.</p></div>		</li>
