			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a class in archaeology, we did a whole section on pottery found around Italy. When I asked my professor about why we were covering it so thoroughly, she got this Vietnam Flashback Look and said. &quot;It's pottery. It's all pottery. It's all I did. It's all we had.&quot; Apparently she had a gig sorting, rearranging, and cataloging nothing but pottery for like two years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes a lot of knowledge is missing about this. As far as I know we are also pretty unsure about dinosaur skin colors. It's important to differentiate history as a science from books and movies with creative freedom. Modern history scholars painfully try to limit themselves to facts they can reliably show to be true, or Mark it as a hypothesis. In the history of history this wasn't always the case though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're finding increasing evidence about dinosaur colour, particularly for feathered dinosaurs. In that case, the structures in the feathers are almost identical to those found in modern birds and their shape is related to their colour at the microscopic level (I don't know how and why). In other cases for colour, what we often do is look at modern animals in similar environments and make an intelligent guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regards to the dinosaurs in particular - they recorded countless animal sounds and remixed them into whatever they thought sounded fitting. Donkeys, geese, horses breathing, dogs eating dog food - all smashed together, slowed down, sped up, and digitally altered. My favorite is that one of the iconic raptor sounds is actually derived from sounds tortoises make while mating. Lies! Damn entertaining lies!</p>

<p>Forget about the sound of dinosaurs. What did they actually look like?</p>
<p>It is now known for certain that dinosaurs were feathered. We have found actual dino feather imprints. They looked nothing like the clean lizards you see in films.</p>
<p>If you look at a bird, you're seeing the direct descendant of a dinosaur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but most dinosaurs didn't have beaks for one. In most media you also see dinosaurs having their teeth showing with a closed mouth like crocodiles, but recent studies concluded that most likely they had lips that covered their teeth. Also feathers found don't quite resemble the modern feathers and probably didn't cover the whole body in many species. Birds are descendants of a very specific group of dinosaurs, many of the other groups like pterosaurs have no modern descendant.</p></div>		</li>
