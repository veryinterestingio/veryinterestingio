			<div class="markdown"><p>Until I read your comment, I genuinely thought that this post was referring to the oscillation between &quot;I have to pee&quot; and &quot;OH MY GOD I HAVE TO PEE&quot; as I approach a bathroom. I feel like a child when I'm out somewhere and seek a bathroom every 3 hours, but I know from experience that this is the only way to avoid disaster. Wish there were a way to change it.</p></div>		</li>
