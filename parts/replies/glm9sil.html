			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple more: </p>
<ul>
<li>dissolving out glues or other binders in the paper or fabric itself</li>
<li>shifting the fibers in paper around by causing them to swell, particularly in low-quality papers that look wrinkled and slightly changed in color after they have gotten wet and then dried. </li>
<li>Washing deep-set contaminants to the surface, such as in an old and well-used couch's fabric covering</li>
<li>causing visible patches of mold or bacteria to grow on a spot that got some extra minerals or other deposits of fertilizer from water that brought it in, something you sometimes see in old objects like window blinds in an an abandoned house</li>
