			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too I still wish I studied accounting instead though. Being a biologist is interesting on paper. But years of hearing stories in lectures of apparently esteemed biologists buying their clothes second hand because they canâ€™t afford new ones really put me off. Whatâ€™s the point in trying hard if all you get for it is respect from other biologists?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is perfectly fine, but there is good money to be made in biology, just not accounting level money. You have to remember that Academics are usually underpaid, but there are still a lot of ways to make money, even in academia. Some people just don't care about the money.</p>
<p>Industry is definitely where it's at, biotech and pharmacogenomics can get you good money. You just have to know where to look</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would you want more money when the money you got can buy you food, clothes, a house and maybe even a car? You followed your intrinsic passion (I presume) and that is great! Pursuing money only leads to a rat race you canâ€™t win and which will never satisfy you in the long run. I gave up a well paid and secure (but boring) desk job to become a nurse anesthetist. Iâ€™m paid minimum wage until Iâ€™ll graduate. And I have never been happier than now, in my second hand clothes ðŸ˜€</p></div>		</li>
