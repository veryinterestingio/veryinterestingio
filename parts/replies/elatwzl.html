<p>In maps, you see distinctive areas of the map marked off, with &quot;Mandarin-speaking&quot; areas and &quot;Cantonese-speaking&quot; areas with sharp boundaries between them, but in reality it's a gradient of thousands of dialects spread out over a wide geographic area.</p>

<p>I don't think this is correct if you mean that there isn't a sharp line between neighbouring Chinese language groups. Of course, there are many dialects within each language group, but the lines between e.g. Min and Yue, or Min and Wu, or Wu and Mandarin, are very distinct. It's like how there might be a continuum of dialects from Low German to Swiss German, but there is a sharp divide between Low German and Danish. When you cross the line from Cantonese (Yue) to Teochew (Min) areas, it's similarly very distinct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d argue that Yue and Min aren’t really neighboring dialects. They’re adjacent to each other on the map, but I’ve been on a bus from Zhongshan (Yue area) to Chaozhou (Min area). It was a six hour drive along an uninhabited coastline that was mostly mountains and rocky cliff sides. It wasn’t until reaching Chaozhou (Teochew) that the mountains opened up into a river valley surrounded by mountains. In the past, likely no one would have tried to walk between the regions and it’d likely only be accessible by sea. </p>
<p>Going north from the Yue areas is a better example. In the countryside around Shaoguan you see the Hakka and Yue dialects blend together and Hakka continues north into Jiangxi. Going west, Yue continues into parts of Guangxi and merges into Pinghua.</p>
<p>But yes, in general Min is probably an exception to the dialect continuum. It’s said that the dialects are so distinctive that even neighboring villages are unlikely to understand each other unless using a lingua franca like Hokkien or Mandarin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting...I always thought Hakka was midway between Mandarin and Cantonese. I wonder how close it is to Gan.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are we talking Dundonian Scottish or Scottish Gaelic? Because no one understands Dundonian Scottish, even with a drop of water to open it up.</p></div>		</li>
