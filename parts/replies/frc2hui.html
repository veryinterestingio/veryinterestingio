			<div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves are just lower frequency, lower energy version of visible light. They are not ionizing, so they don't cause cancer. They just cause local heating of water. That is why we use them.</p>
<p>AM/FM radiowave , microwaves, infrared,  visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays, gamma rays  are all just electromagnetic radiation of increasing frequency and energy.</p>
<p>Only the last 3 (ultraviolet, x-rays,gamma rays) are ionizing and can cause cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably fine. It only takes a small amount of leakage to interfere with wifi. A typical home base station transmits with 0.1 watt or less; a microwave is pumping 1000 watts or more into the food, so it doesn't take much to stomp on the wifi signal.</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> possible for a microwave oven to leak dangerously, it just isn't common. If the microwave's door is loose/askew or if it doesn't latch properly, then you might want to get it fixed or replaced. If there's nothing physically/visibly wrong then it's unlikely that there's a leakage problem.</p></div>		</li>
