			<div class="markdown"><p>Localization? Same thing as &quot;dubbing&quot;â€”figure out how to translate the screenplay (and hopefully keep all the jokes and references intact), then cast and schedule voice actors to record lines over the existing clips.</p>
<p>The deepfakery would help better match the video of the onscreen actor to the voice actor. End result is a clip where the onscreen actor looks and sounds like they're speaking the foreign language natively.</p>
<p>(To some degree, we get visual cues from speech, which traditionally get broken during dubbing. Studios typically don't reshoot whole scenes in different languages for rea$ons.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the answer: if you are interested in the entire cycle of making a full animated feature, you can watch the series [Into the Unknown: Making Frozen 2] (<a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/into-the-unknown-making-frozen-2/6PWutGrMQzCI" target="_blank">https://www.disneyplus.com/series/into-the-unknown-making-frozen-2/6PWutGrMQzCI</a>) on Disney Plus. (You will need to have a subscription.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a great example might be Bob's Burgers because they do group recordings so that improv can happen in real time off other actors lines as opposed to hearing their dialogue after it's been recorded or that's at least what I've Been Told</p></div>		</li>
