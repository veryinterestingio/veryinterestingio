			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked with a team of scalper for a few years in chicago. This is pretty much it. We had target prices and times lines we would hustle as hard as possible to get max dollar abd once the game started we would haggle with  people  on prices and they were getting a deal by picking up less than face value priced ticket from us but it didn't matter because we were already in profit. I probably sold tickets for at least 2 thousand events between sports and concerts. Only bad loss I took was on a Sox game in 2016</p></div>		</li>

<ol>
<li>How do you successfully scalp tickets when it's &quot;banned&quot; around the park?</li>
<li>How many people on an average day are going to games looking for tix? With the sox, only game you may remotely gave interest is the cubs/sox series, but are people seriously &quot;I'm gonna waste an hour in traffic and see if I can get a ticket&quot;?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only place I really had issues was Wrigley. Cubs was always and will always be huge money they sell out no matter what. the problem is they are straight gangster if you mess with their money more now so than ever. As long as we kept it &quot;reasonable&quot; were not scumbags and didn't step foot on to Wrigley property they left us alone however I should say Majority of our tickets were sold on Craigslist and people would meet us down there which was generally ignored since we weren't standing out there yelling about having tickets. </p>
<p>Majority of people that were getting tickets didn't really drive down there they were from the city and usually just looking for a fun night and some drinks. Especially in Wrigley. Besides that it was a lot of people who got off work and was meeting up with friends and wants the ticket to get in and SRO it. But over all It depends on how the teams doing but Its not real about how many tickets get sold the trick is the price I got the tickets for. We made our big money off the Blackhawks we had season tickets prior to them getting toews or Kane and once those two got a cup... Man... It wouldn't matter how many tickets I had they sold. I was getting tickets on ground level for cheap since we haf season tickets and got them from someone else who had them for years prior so the price only went up a little since you get &quot;locked in&quot; on ticket prices. So like 2013 when they won (example prices) if I got tickets for 10 dollars each and was selling them for 40 dollars each. One ticket took care of all 4 seats.</p></div>		</li>
