			<div class="markdown"><p>And just to add to this... don't do this.  You don't want  power going down a pin that wasn't suppose to have it.  It can damage both the cart and console.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also also, you don't want to damage connectors because even if you insert it normally next time, the cart might occasionally lose contact with one or more of its pins, making glitches and potential future cartridge damage possible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the cart gets tilted, the connectors will be at an angle that they were not suppose to be, and all it would take is the bottom of a pin just to touch the next connector over on the console.  After looking at a cart, the pins do have a nice gap between them to try and minimise damage if the cart is not inserted properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of Sonic 1 or 2 one Genesis/Mega Drive having some kind of debug mode. I'm pretty sure you could somehow enter a mode where you were able to place all kinds of items all over the levels and do all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>It's a weird memory from when i was a kid, because console games back then weren't supposed to act that way and go all buggy and let you do weird stuff that breaks everything. It feels like some kind of fever dream when i'm trying to remember the details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Up, C, Down, C, Left, C, Right, C, A, B, Start, I think was the code. Sonic 2 had one too, though it might have been a sound test code (I know level select was definitely a sound test code).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't an accident. If you watched the video, you'd know they overloaded the interrupt to trigger the debug screen on purpose. This was to pass Sega's stringent burn-in validation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They catch any and every error this way, that part wasn't accidental. The accidental part is that it has the effect of making a &quot;secret punching trick&quot; which was a surprise to the developer until recently, as he says in the video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on this, when you have electrical contact between pins and you move the pins, because of surface level oxidation you can easily see a state where the contact bounces,  capacitive charge will build up microscopically and arc hundreds of times a seccond over nano meters... essentially your contact sees a ton of pulsing high signals which on some pins for the cartridge can be counters or clocks which may cycle and overflow values..</p>
<p>The wrong timing of 1s and 0s could reference totally different texture sprites this changing every sprite on the screen to something totally different in memory</p></div>		</li>
