			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up summering on Oak Island and this was all pretty much common knowledge to anyone in the area that had actually paid attention in history class.</p>
<p>The locals pretty much treat it like Roswell NM and the UFO stuff.  They have signs and tshirts and coffee mugs to sell to tourists, but there's a reason why literally none of the investors on that 'project' are locals.</p>
<p>Also, the notion that a ship full of armed pirates would let the captain take away their pay and bury it without them then sail away broke is laughable.  </p>
<p>Captains on pirate ships had <strong>way</strong> less power than modern romantic depictions would have you believe.   They were much more at the mercy of the crew than vis versa, as simply counting the number of guys with swords and pistols on each side should tell anyone who can add.  </p>
<p>Perhaps you've heard of the term 'mutiny' before?</p>
<p>Imagine if your boss emptied the company checking account, left the office, and just never came back.  How long would you keep going to work without pay?  How far away does he get with the money?</p>
<p>Now imagine <em>you have the legal right to shoot your boss if he's being a crappy boss</em>, then you can elect a new boss.   Exactly how far do you think he gets with all of the money now?</p>
<p>Seriously people.  The Golden Age of Piracy is fascinating enough without people making up fantasy stories after having read &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also a bunch of absurd theories of where the treasure might have come from.  Including things like the Knights Templar secretly sailed their treasury all the way over to Nova Scotia, only to stop at Oak Island and bore and impossible deep hole in unstable, flooded ground... and then leave a marker so it wouldn't actually be a secret.</p>
<p>Another odd point, if by some mental deficit you found a reason to go to titanic efforts to bury it only to leave a marker so it wouldn't be lost, the marker could easily be removed.  </p>
<p>So if you thought it was absolutely critical to tell anyone who came by about the treasure... so it wouldn't be lost... that plan is not reliable.  Someone would steal the marker sooner or later, and the treasure would be lost anyhow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, but Treasure Island supports your point that captains on pirate ships had way less power than modern romantic depictions would have you believe. That whole book is about the breakdown of any kind of order aboard the ship and on the the Island as the crew go cuckoo for treasure. No one's really in charge at the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I first read about this in 1971 when I was in 5th grade. Even then I thought the whole idea to be illogical and most likely not true. But all through my life I have heard people say they just know there is treasure there and eventually someone is going to figure out how to get it. They really believe it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's remarkable that this insane legend gained as much traction as it did- way, way pre-internet.  It was a childish story that doesn't even make logical sense, let alone that nothing holds up when you try to research any facts.  Still people devoted huge efforts to rip up the entire island</p></div>		</li>
