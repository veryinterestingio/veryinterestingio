<p>Do I understand it correctly that if you encounter an actual ad26 virus after vaccination  your immune system would see this a totally different virus than the altered ad26 virus used in the vaccine?</p>
<p>And am I right in assuming that using a platform to which you are already immune prevents the immune response? That's something I read about the CanSino vaccine which uses the ad5-platform that's already circulating among humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a natural adenovirus “looks” much like the vaccine version to the immune system, as far as it goes. The virion (the physical virus, the little capsule of protein surrounding DNA that enters the body and attaches to a cell) is identical or nearly so. The difference is that it doesn’t make more copies of itself. The natural virus makes billions of new virions, releasing them into the body and driving a much greater immune response. The vaccine version is non replicating, so it doesn’t perform this amplification step.  </p>
<p>Having immunity to the natural version <em>reduces</em> but doesn’t necessarily <em>prevent</em> the immune response - the CanSino study found about a 2-fold difference, which isn’t all that big. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before vaccination, 266 (52%) of 508 participants had high pre-existing anti-Ad5 neutralising antibodies (table 1). Participants with low pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity had RBD-specific ELISA antibody and neutralising antibody levels that were approximately two-times higher than the participants with high pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity</p>
