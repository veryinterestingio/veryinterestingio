			<div class="markdown"><p>The British system is a good example. For the most part, the layman does no tax, as its income tax, VAT, council tax and a few more. You're just told this is your tax for the year, pay, refund or you're all good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VAT isn‚Äôt something most people worry about, because it‚Äôs paid by the retailer</p>
<p>Council tax is once a year, but most people set up a monthly direct debt to cover it (although this might vary across the country as it‚Äôs administered by local councils, not central government)</p>
<p>The big ones are National Insurance (which pays for the NHS) &amp; income tax, but again, most people don‚Äôt worry about this because it‚Äôs taken directly from wages/salaries when they get paid. Most people never get a tax bill in their life, it just happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have this system in Hungary for 10 years or so now.</p>
<p>The only caveat is that if you have a refund you'd get that \~3 months earlier if you do it own your own. I don't mean refunds from bad declarations, but we have some retirement or health savings accounts that are eligible for refund for x% of the money you put in throughout the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In France we switched to having taxes paid automatically every month for most employees last year. If you don't have a side business and didn't inherit or made money with stocks you basically don't have to fill taxes ever and you don't have to keep money on the side to pay taxes all at once. And again, we switched last year (from a much better system than the current US system) so there is no excuse to not change</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In France it's great, you get a letter saying &quot;remember to check the online tax site&quot;, you go to impots.gouv, they present what they believe are your earnings, if everything is correct (takes less than a minute for me), you click OK and you leave. Taxes paid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a lot of people in the US it's pretty much this simple as well. The thing that makes a complicated is if you don't want to take the standard deduction or you run a small business.</p></div>		</li>
