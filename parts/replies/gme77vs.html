Definitely an amazing read for anyone, you don't even have to be that interested in birds</p></div>		</li>

<p>i read somewhere that if they do not like the cause of death then they abandon an area but i do not have source rn.</p>

<p>If that's true, that sounds like the same sort of semi-functional superstition that us humans can have when we lack a full understanding eg. biblical prohibitions on shellfish, and the spiritualizing of ritual bathing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Superstitions definitely have been found to be very evolutionarily helpful. It is safer to leave the body and not get infected by some disease (type 1 error) than to mourn the body and possibly become infected with whatever disease or fungus (type 2 error)</p>
<p>The best example I can think of was explained well by my advanced Cognitive Neuroscience professor, although it is a very rudimentary example; Early humans living in Africa doing their thing would have times where they can hear rustling in the grass or something that seems like a predator, but are unable to see it. This is where the superstition can save lives. </p>
<p>They can either choose to ignore the rustling and continue on, or they can assume it is a predator about to attack them and they can run away. If it is a predator, it is way more beneficial to run away than it is to stay and get attacked. If it isn't a predator, then the person just wasted some precious energy, but is still alive. Those who run away are more likely to survive, and therefore more likely to pass on their superstitious beliefs.</p>
