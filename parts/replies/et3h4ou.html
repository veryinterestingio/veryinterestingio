			<div class="markdown"><p>A point of clarification: the radioactive carbon is always decaying. When a plant is alive it absorbs new C-14 from the atmosphere and maintains a constant amount. When it dies, the concentration of C-14 in it starts to drop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, sort of.  </p>
<p>Animals may incidentally exchange little bit of carbon with the atmosphere, exchanging across the lungs - but our primary source of carbon comes from our food.  Ie, eating plants, or animals that ate those plants.  So, we take in carbon 14, but only because plants take in carbon 14.</p>
<p>So, if we only ate synthesized food made from isotopically pure carbon-12, then we'd slowly lose our C14 concentration as we cycle it out of our bodies without receiving more.</p>
<p>Could be a fun prank to play on future anthropologists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small amounts of biomatter accumulate on it, and it may adsorb some CO2 from the water.  But not only are these possible to separate out, the bulk of the wood's mass is still the original carbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this how it works with rocks in the ground?</p>
<p>They must have some initial source of carbon for it to decay. So, if I make a table from a big rock in the quarry...then measure it's carbon content, won't it be the same as the rock that I took it from that's still burried?</p>
<p>How can we carbon date the earth itself if we have no base reference of where/when the carbon came from. Sorry if it's a bit confusing...I'm not sure how to express the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rocks are not carbon-dated, as they were never alive.  Most do not contain significant amounts of carbon either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that makes sense.</p>
<p>How would people go about ageing the earth? Is this more to do with size of the sun/stars/mass loss/luminosity/lots of other science bundled together etc...</p></div>		</li>
