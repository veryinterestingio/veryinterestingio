			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe apples are kind of similar since they don't grow true to type if you try to grow from a tree they probably won't taste good, but they can do well as cider. So we just graft trees with good fruit to rootstock.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Banana's are not going extinct, only the specific supermarket variety you are familiar with is endangered.</p>
<p>Wild bananas are smaller and full of hard seeds, that's why we bred the seedless ones. They are not endangered.</p>
<p>Because the common Cavendish Bananas are all clones of each other they are super vulnerable to a type of fungus that's been killing them off. Within a decade or so the infection rate could be so high as to make the plant no longer viable to be farmed.</p>
<p>It might surprise you to learn that this has happened before. The Gros Michele banana used to be the supermarket variety until it suffered the same fate. Hence the old timey song &quot;Yes we have no bananas.&quot;</p>
<p>Urban legend says that's why artificial banana flavoring doesn't taste like bananas, it tastes like the extinct variety.</p>
<p>Good news is they're already breeding replacement varieties of bananas, so expect to see a new breed of banana on the supermarket shelves in the next few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's because the variety we grow (Cavendish) is susceptible to disease.  We used to grow a different variety (Gros Michele) but the disease made that variety untenable. </p>
<p>Bananas won't be extinct though,  there are many other varieties,  but most won't work with the plantation and shipping regime we've built to grow and distribute them, or won't taste like we expect them to.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why artificially flavored banana candy doesn't taste like bananas? It's because that flavor is modeled after the Gros Michele not the Cavendish,  and you're probably too young to have ever tasted one.</p></div>		</li>
