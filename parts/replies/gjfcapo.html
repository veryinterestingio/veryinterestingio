			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're geniunely asking, the information stored in your computer is stored in bits. Bits act like a light switch, either on or off. On means there's electricity passing through, and off means there is no electricity passing through. Obviously this is a very simple explanation that breaks down when you think about hard drives storing stuff without electricity but ignore that for now. Lightswitch.</p>
<p>Light switch has two positions then, on or off right? So that means with one lightswitch you can store 2 numbers. 0 (off) or 1 (on).</p>
<p>Now put a second lightswitch next to it. You can do the following</p>
<ol>
<li>00 (off off)</li>
<li>01 (off on)</li>
<li>10 (on off)</li>
<li>11 (on on)</li>
</ol>
<p>You get four options. Two lightswitches, two options per lightswitch.</p>
<p>What about three lightswitches?</p>
<ol>
<li>000</li>
<li>001</li>
<li>010</li>
<li>011</li>
<li>100</li>
<li>101</li>
<li>110</li>
<li>111</li>
</ol>
<p>You get 8 options. So this is powers of two now. 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8.</p>
<p>If you list out the powers of two you get:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Power/Number of lightswitches</th>
<th>Two to the power of</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>32</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>64</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>128</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>256</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>512</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>What if you had 10 lightswitches? 2^10 = 1024. So that's 1024 bits or a kibibit.</p>
<p>There are 8 bits in a byte. So that 1024 bits is 128 bytes. </p>
<p>1000 bytes is a kilobyte</p>
<p>1000 kilobytes is a megabyte.</p>
<p>1000 megabytes is a gigabyte.</p>
<p>1000 gigabytes is a terabyte.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an adverse reaction to the phrase &quot;As you already know&quot; and variants thereof.  Too many conference presentations begin with that line!  Like, dude, you're at a conference with people from all across a huge subject talking about your super-niche area, and a lot of the folk here are humble postgrads who are well aware that they know nothing!  At that point, I usually decide they're probably not worth listening to if they can't even get through the title slide properly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the case of storage, adding 1 bit to the range of your addressable storage also doubles the storage size. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an important piece. All others answer is just reiterating that computer stores data in binary (base 2). They all miss the point of why it's inconvenient to have a memory size that's not powers of 2.</p>
<p>As you said, this is convenient for software.
While I never studied all storage address table structures, most memory address tables mark each chunk of data (e.g., sector for HDD) with an address number (yes a literal address like a street address). These address numbers are binary. For example, 00, 01, 10, 11 represent 4 addresses. To increase it to 5 addresses, you need another bit. However, adding another bit doubles the address you can represent (100, 101, 110, 111) totaling 8. So you might as well fill those addresses with more hardware storage.</p>
<p>I'd be curious if this is convenient for hardware (as you said it's easy to branch out each storage unit)</p>
<p>EDIT: This is purely for convenience. In reality, hardware manufacturers do not fill up the address table. Marketing comes into play and hard drives are sold in base 10 (GB) not base 2 (GiB).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, when you already have e.g. 16 address lines and all the control logic for it there is little reason to limit your maximum memory capacity to less than 2^16 (64KiB).  It can even require <em>more</em> logic if you have to check that your software (or other logic) doesn‚Äôt exceed a certain address range.</p></div>		</li>
