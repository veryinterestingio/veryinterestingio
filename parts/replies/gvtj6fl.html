<p>That being said, an infection is real rare.  iirc, less than 200 diagnoses have been made since the 60s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, pretty much.  Parasites need hosts.  Your parasitism game is gonna be pretty poor if you kill your friend almost 100% of the time, and if you do it so quickly they barely have a chance to pass you and your parasite pals along to a new environment.  Same reason why malaria is way more common: it's less aggressive, and that's a way better strategy if you're a tiny little microscopic vampire and want to meet a lot of new people all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Malaria is also way more common (and deadly) because malaria depends on mosquitoes to pass it along, not active humans encountering each other.</p>
<p>You can be nearly dead, lying there, and still be bitten by mosquitoes, who will ingest the parasite and move on to bite a healthy person, infecting them. Malaria does not require a healthy human to pass itself on; it just requires lots of mosquitoes biting people.</p>
<p>Diseases that are passed from human to human tend to become less deadly and less fast-acting over time. They need a host healthy enough to pass it on, and an obviously sick or dead human can't do that.</p>
<p>Cholera, plague, malaria, and other pathogens that pass on through water or other animals don't care if you live or die; for some, the faster you die or end up lying there ready to be bitten, the better off it is (e.g. for cholera, as long as you are emptying your entire system of water, as fast as possible, it will find new hosts. It doesn't need you alive and healthy; you can crap out plenty of new cholera as you die).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment about no defense for Naegleria fowleri isn't right. </p>
<p>They've found a majority of people who have swam in freshwater at some point have antibodies to that amoeba and never had any symptoms of infection which suggests that most humans have immune systems which kill it without issue, and only a small and very unlucky minority who cannot for whatever reason experience full blown infection from it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Might differences in the immune response partially explain why certain individuals develop PAM? Studies of human serum and mucosal antibody titers have found widespread evidence of anti-Naegleria immune responses resulting from subclinical N. fowleri exposure [7â€“10]. These immune responses may arise after a nonolfactory exposure or olfactory clearance of less pathogenic strains of N. fowleri. Although there is no evidence that overt immunodeficiency predisposes toward N. fowleri infection, the presence of detectable but variable immune responses suggests that differences in innate and adaptive immunity contribute to developing PAM.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Swabs from the nose, mouth and pharynx of healthy individuals have isolated N. fowleri. Antibody surveys suggest that N. fowleri exposure without apparent sequelae is exceedingly common, with over 98% seropositivity in a survey of youth in Northwestern Mexico and many other areas where N. fowleri is endemic.</p>

<p>It seems humans are exposed to this amoeba frequently and never become sick with PAM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I like this angle.  I was considering olfactory infection around the ID50 and not what takes place in individuals who are previously, and perhaps endemically exposed, or who encounter the nicer, more forgiving strains first.  If that's you, then yes, we have a defense, but if not, we don't really have an innate response or a medicine that can handle the situation unless there's some other information I'm not aware of, and once it's past the blood-brain barrier I'm pretty sure we are toast.  If you know of any articles that suggest otherwise, I'd love to check those out as well.  The ones you referenced are great, and I'm always down for a good perusing.</p></div>		</li>
