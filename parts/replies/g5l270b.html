			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is a bit different. Both coffee and beer have other effects on the brain, and over time it learns to associate those effects (which it enjoys) with the taste. Hence you “develop a taste” for those things, but mostly because they provide a service other than flavor (namely a “buzz”)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read this somewhere and use it as one of my guiding principles for introducing my kids to new foods. Even if I know they are unlikely to eat a certain thing, I still put it on their plate so they keep getting used to it. Eventually it will become familiar enough and they’ll enjoy it.  I never force them to eat it though, that choice is up to them.</p></div>		</li>
