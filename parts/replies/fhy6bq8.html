			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't always use them. People like forgetting going back to the OR and the amnestics serve as adjuncts to anesthesia. They also make it a little easier to get people to a deeper state of anesthesia quicker for intubation. But, no, they aren't always used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. I recently had to be &quot;knocked out&quot; for MRI. I actually remember the dreams I saw during that. Was that some lighter sort of anesthesia, because from the surgery a few weeks later I can't remember much at all, let dreaming anything.</p></div>		</li>
