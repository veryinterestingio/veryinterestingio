			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;One of the interesting things about space,'' Arthur heard Slartibartfast saying to a large and voluminous creature who looked like someone losing a fight with a pink duvet and was gazing raptly at the old man's deep eyes and silver beard, &quot;is how dull it is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dull?&quot; said the creature, and blinked her rather wrinkled and bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Slartibartfast, &quot;staggeringly dull. Bewilderingly so. You see, there's so much of it and so little in it. Would you like me to quote some statistics?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Er, well ...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

But with space being really big and all, the chances of being picked up within that time are 2 to the power of 2,079,460,347 to 1 against, which by a staggering coincidence is also the telephone number of the Islington Flat where Arthur went to a fancy dress party, and met a very nice young woman whom he totally blew it with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pillars of Creation are roughly the same size as the distance from our solar system to Alpha Centauri (4.4 light years). That translates to <strong>41,000,000,000,000 kilometers</strong> (aka 25 trillion miles).
Contrast this with Jupiter, which has a <em>circumference</em> of 440,000 kilometers (273,000 miles).</p>
<p>If you wanted to display this difference in EIGHT orders of magnitude, it would require a super-hyper-ultra-MegatronHD 16K TV = 15,360 x 8,640 resolution = 132,710,400 pixels. The Pillars of Creation would take up the entire screen and on an adjacent 16K TV, Jupiter could be fully displayed in 1 and 1/3 pixels.</p></div>		</li>

I've taken pictures of the pillars of creation through my telescope before and they are a pretty decent size, I've also taken pictures of Pluto which only ends up being a few pixels and that's still in our solar system (dwarf-planet, but still). A planet light years away wouldn't even register, even a large one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious how accurate your mountain comparison is, so I did some math.</p>
<p>So the eagle nebula (the one with the famous &quot;pillars of creation&quot;) is about 70 light years across, where Jupiter is a mere 139,822 km.  That means the nebula is 4,736,000,000 times bigger.  If Jupiter were the size of a grain of sand, the nebula would be the size of the moon.</p>
<p>Of course, the nebula is further away, at about 7,000 light years to Jupiter's 588 million kilometers.  That's a ratio of about 112,000,000 times further.  For reference, if Jupiter was 1 meter away, the nebula would be about half way to the moon.</p>
<p>So, which can you see easier and more precisely?  A grain of sand 2 meters away, or the moon?</p></div>		</li>
