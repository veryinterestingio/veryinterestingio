			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this penicillin resistance comes at a cost to the bacteria, so even resistant bacteria will be less able to compete with a penicillium mold which is the reason they produce it in the first place. It didnâ€™t evolve to clear infections in humans it evolved so a mold could outcompete bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are!  This is actually a return to an old idea with new methodologies.  The idea of phage therapy for bacterial infection dates back to the early 1900s (not long after the discovery of bacteriophage), and is being revisited to combat drug resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about bacteriophages in 1998 when I was in college. I thought we would have got somewhere with the research by now but it looks like we're still on the same place since then.</p>
<p>I suppose the challenge would be how do you stop your body destroying the bacteriophages before they killed the bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting thing is that bacteriophage treatments are sucefully and more widespread used in some former soviet-union countries.
There was actually quite some research on bacteriophage treatments by the russians during WW2 and the cold war. However, due to the cole war this research was not translated and shared with the rest of the world</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another huge problem with finding antimicrobials is that they are all toxic but only a few are toxic enough to kill the pathogens and not quite toxic enough to kill us.</p>

<p>Someone had the idea &quot;Let's poison the body and hope the human survives longer&quot;, anyways that's oversimplified chemotherapy</p></div>		</li>
