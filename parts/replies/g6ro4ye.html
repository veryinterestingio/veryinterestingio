			<div class="markdown"><p>You're wrong in the sense that commercially available peanut oil (which just means &quot;peanut oil you can buy,&quot; so that's like every peanut oil that isn't homemade) is enough to trigger a reaction. Like /u/98521745633214789632
said, the FDA considers any <em>highly refined</em> peanut oil (which is what most mass-produced peanut oil is—<em>highly refined</em>) to be of such low concern as to not even warrant an allergy warning if included in the production of other food—e.g., a fried chicken sandwich that uses highly refined peanut oil as the frying medium. </p>
<p>There are other types of oils out there that are not <em>highly refined</em>, like cold-pressed etc., but like I said most of the market is comprised of <em>highly refined</em> peanut oil, but ALWAYS QUADRUPLE CHECK.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird thought. I read recently how the measles disease “erased” the immune system’s memory of prior diseases (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03324-7" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
<p>Do you think this “memory erasing” capability could be utilized to wipe a person’s body from creating the antigen that results in severe peanut allergies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but its not a viable solution. The burden of a food allergy is weighed against all other potential health burdens a person may face. People with very severe autoimmunity can take a drug called ritixumab, which kills most of the cells responsible for holding memory (called B cells). However, B cells also hold memory for everything you are vaccinated against. The real trick for immunologists is learning how to only kill the B cells that hold memory of peanut, while leaving everything else in tact. After all, avoidance of peanut is much easier and more viable than potentially dying to a vaccine preventable infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question if you have time! (This is really interesting and I know nothing about this stuff) Why would someone with autoimmune disease want to kill their B cells? I guess I’d have thought with autoimmune diseases you would REALLY want to remember the things that could kill you. Also I guess I don’t really know what happens with autoimmune diseases other than the immune system essentially bodies itself so maybe that’s why you’d need to “forget” a lot of things?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah. It appears I was confusing antigen with antibodies. Erasing the immune system’s memory would only erase the instructions for the antibody but once the pathogen was reintroduced the body would once again create the antibody and wackiness would ensue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, yes.  But it would be pretty totally unreliable. And it would also be nearly impossible (I said nearly) to target those cells without harming something else. The theory behind it is sound, because yes the plasma cells (cells that make antibodies) would be killed but you’d need to kill the other related immune cells too (namely any B cells that are still proliferating), but to develop something that can target only the cells producing a specific antibody is to my knowledge something that hasn’t happened and by my guess can’t for awhile if ever</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your other comment!  </p>
<p>There are people working on this. I don't have the citations on hand, but some labs are engineering T cells to have specific antigens on their surface, and use those antigens to kill only antigen-specific B cells. These are called Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells, if anyone has interest.  </p>
<p>There is another approach that involves complexing an antigen (like peanut) with the types of drugs that are used in chemotherapy. Basically, B cells will gobble up the peanut that they are specific for, and when inside the cell the chemotherapy drugs can kill that specific cell.   </p>
<p>These are still wildly experimental therapeutics, and with the recent approval of Oral Immunotherapy for food allergies, its less likely these will be pushed out to patients any time soon until good safety profiles can be uncovered for them.</p></div>		</li>
