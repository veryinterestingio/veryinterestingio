			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  The movie script wasn't &quot;non-negotiable&quot; either, it was &quot;negotiable&quot;.  That is, it can be transferred to another party, in this case without any authority's permission.  </p>
<p>Even if you have a list of bonds known to be stolen, if they are not seen again for years, it may have changed hands many times (and certainly would to launder them), so you cannot simply arrest the bearer when cashed, or even deny its value.</p>
<p>The final bearer will likely be innocent.  He bought or traded the bonds from someone who bought or traded them from someone else.  It eventually leads back to a trade from Hans Gruber, operating under an assumed name, who bought an island or whatever with them.  No identification or records are necessary, the bond's value is in the physical certificate, once it's physically traded or  physically stolen, whoever the person holding it is now the bearer.</p>
<p>Stock certificates in the old days were usually registered.  If you stole the physical certificates and tried to sell them, you are not the registered owner.  Having been stolen, attempting to get yourself registered as the new owner with the issuer is not going to be possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what normal bank notes are, effectively promissory notes from a bank that they will give you £x/$x/€x/etc. in coins. It's much simpler to carry around these notes than coins though. So does that make bearer bonds promissory notes to be exchanged for smaller denomination promissory notes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transactionally speaking, yes-ish.  Crypto derives a value from being mined.  The actual production of the hashes &quot;backs/creates the value&quot;. You used electricity and a mining rig to produce it.  Just like with mining gold, the miner is hoping that it costs less to mine a bitcoin than the market rate so they can take profit on the difference.  A gold miner hopes that the cost of mining an ounce of gold is less than the market rate.  If so, the difference in the cost to produce and value when sold is the profit.</p>
<p>Bonds are backed by the issuer, usually a company or government.  Bonds often pay interest much like a savings account.  This is what the company pays the bond holder to borrow the cash.  Railroads in the US often issued coupon bonds (bearer coupons) where the interest and a portion of the original bond value would be paid to the bearer of the coupons attached to the bond. </p>
<p>Crypto, bonds and cash are all transactional instruments.  Whomever holds &quot;it&quot; holds the value of &quot;it&quot;.  How much administration now involved depends on how the instrument is obtained and used.  In reality, bearer bonds are probably safer transactions than crypto.  For crypto to be less traceable, you have to use &quot;mixers&quot; to obfuscate the trail.  The value of bearer bonds remains constant as long as the company is still in business or government is still solvent.  All you have to do is hold the bond to hold the value.   </p>
<p>On a side note, This is actually what people were originally referring to when they talked about &quot;coupon clipping old lady / granny&quot; back in the old days.  They often inherited these instruments from family because their father / husband / whomever knew the bonds would retain the value and were easy to convert to cash in fixed amounts to help with budgeting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The mining process helps control scarcity which helps maintain its value, but it seems misleading to say that it derives value from being mined.</p>
<p>The connection between mining and value is that miners will alter their behavior based on the current valuation, devoting more or fewer resources to mining.</p>
<p>The analogy to gold holds here - gold doesn't &quot;derive value&quot; from being mined, its value comes from its utility and desirability. The fact that it has to be mined helps ensure scarcity, which limits how far its value can fall, but only as long as it remains useful and desirable.</p>
<p>If a crypto coin falls out of favor for some reason, its value tends to zero, and all the resources spent on mining are irrelevant and don't provide it with any value.</p>

<p>I feel like I'm in r/ExplainLikeImCalvin. Any source on that? I've only ever heard of coupon clipping in the context of retail discount coupons. They're associated with old women because many old women are very price-sensitive, and have a lot of time on their hands to deal with retail coupons.</p></div>		</li>
