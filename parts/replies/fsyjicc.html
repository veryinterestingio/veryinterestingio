			<div class="markdown"><p>Go to a big box retail store and look at the locksets. They all have a key number so you can buy multiple sets with the same key depending on how many doors at your house. I doubt the hardware store has more than 20 different numbers for one model at any one time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to consider different manufacturers who will use different key shapes - for example, different grooves on the sides, which means only that manufacturer's key will fit. Even if two keys have the same &quot;code&quot;, it doesn't matter if the grooves are not the same.</p>
<p>There are also entirely different styles of locks, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu2vm4At4JM" target="_blank">disk detainer cores</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htqNNZ6jrjs" target="_blank">dimple lock cores</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY9PJxVWORE" target="_blank">tubular lock cores</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV8QKZNFxLw" target="_blank">locks with other unusually shaped keys</a>. Manufacturers may use cores with more or fewer pins, disks, etc. so there might be 5 pins or 12 pins. They might have more or fewer positions those pins can be in.</p></div>		</li>
