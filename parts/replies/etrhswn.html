			<div class="markdown"><p>>  Asymmetry is common. For example, I'm in the US. For me to travel to Turkey as a visitor, I pay about $20 online or at the point of entry for a visa that is valid for 4 months with stays no longer than 90 days (as of 2015 for my last trip there). For Turkish residents to come into the US, it's a little more effort to get the visa, but the US would grant it for a period of 10 years (again, as of 2015). </p>

<p>Life is unfair isn't it?</p>

<p>But it makes sense for the Turkish government to do that. Americans are less inclined to go to third world countries so the governments have to incentivise them with cheap visas/holidays.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I spent most of my time there for work in Ankara and Izmir. The fun part was that I was able to be there and not do tourist things. My visits were never longer than 2-4 weeks, so I got by on a basic tourist visa.</p></div>		</li>
