<p>Or do businesses just schedule auto reboots every so often during non peak hours?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, enterprise grade routers are much more reliable. Better cooling, better software, and more capable hardware as well as physical and logical redundancy work wonders.</p>
<p>But you pay for it, enterprise routers can be 4 or 5 figures in price</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oof, think I'll stick to a plug in plug out power cycle every few weeks.  </p>
<p>I will have to look at my router manual to see if I can schedule power cycles or something.  Short of getting a wifi enabled plug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - even for small routers, I use Draytek Vigor ones which tend to be about \~£200 compared to £50 or less for a similar low-grade Netgear etc. consumer grade unit.</p>
<p>Software support forever, far more features, and they seem to have much more stable software running as well as (I suspect) higher-spec hardware in terms of faster CPU &amp; more RAM.</p>
<p>I found running a utorrent client all the time just locked up the Netgear in a few days use, I'm guessing either through bugs or running out of RAM with the higher number of open ports etc.</p>
<p>Edit to add: A lot of routers you can root and run OpenWRT on them which may be an improvement, or you can use a Raspberry Pi as a router for total control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not a network engineer, but in software.</p>
<p>i have a unifi system at home, with an older generation USG, their 16-port managed switch, 4 access points, with the controller installed on a local raspberry pi.  </p>
<p>USG, switch, and two of the access points are sitting at 265 days uptime. the access point near the microwave goes wonky every once and while after a long defrost and needs a reboot.  </p>
<p>if i were to do it over again now, i would get the dream machine pro, the same APs (1 AC Pro, 2 LRs, and 1 mesh),  and then go back in time and ask for my ethernet drops in the ceilings instead of typical outlet level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most common issue for routers (more precisely just the modem) needing restarts in my experience is that the DSL connection dropped due to interference or whatever, and rebooting the router is a really simple way to force a reconnect. If you go through the software and force a resync you'll achieve the same thing.</p>
<p>You can usually also wait for 3-5 minutes for the automated reconnect, but forcing a reconnect is faster.</p></div>		</li>
