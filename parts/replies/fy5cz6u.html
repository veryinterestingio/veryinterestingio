			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes even further than that - &quot;?!&quot; and &quot;!?&quot; both exist. The difference is fuzzy, but generally, the reaction is that &quot;!?&quot; means something like &quot;this looks risky, but interesting&quot;, and &quot;?!&quot; means &quot;this feels bad, but it's not obvious how to actually take advantage of it&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And you can't forget &quot;??!?&quot; which, of course, means &quot;this looks really weak, but then I thought about it and found a way it was a good move, but that's just because I'm bad at chess.&quot;</p>
<p>And &quot;?!?!?!?!...&quot; which means &quot;this move creates a Nash equilibrium and alternates between weak and strong.&quot;</p>
<p>Which is not to be confused with &quot;‚ÄΩ&quot; which is to be used for moves that are <em>simultaneously</em> weak and strong.</p>
<p>EDIT: I want to be clear that this is DEFINITELY how I would explain this to a five-year-old.</p></div>		</li>
