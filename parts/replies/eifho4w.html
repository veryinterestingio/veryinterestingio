			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, when I was in college studying for a degree in Medical Technology, hospital lab stuff, we were taught a simple test for &quot;stool for trypsin&quot;. </p>
<p>A dab of poo on a chip of used x-ray film and incubated at body temp for an hour. A positive result would be the gelatin layer is dissolved, digested. Used it the diagnosis of a pancreatic duct blockage...at the time. It was a long time ago.</p></div>		</li>
