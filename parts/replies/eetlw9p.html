			<div class="markdown"><p>Waterfowl hunter here.   Echoing the comment above.  I see geese flying north right now.  However I know they’re just going from roost to feed in the morning.    In the evening they’ll be going south to their roost.  </p>
<p>If there’s hunting going on in your area, the birds will get accustomed to avoiding fields that are hunted and start only visiting fields and ponds that aren’t hunted because they’re safe.  Then they’ll be following a flight path that looks very deliberate as if they’re migrating but in reality they are heading straight to roost or feed and not making eye contact with anyone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Goose hunter. This time of year ..I strongly agree. Those birds now fear being shot at. Every group of birds we saw over the past few hunts stayed together and followed other birds to very specific spot...and vice versa. They would not break away and decoy to our fields. Pretty crazy to watch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t necessarily have an opposition to hunting, per se. But your comment and the one you were replying to make it sound like even the geese that survive (which is presumably the majority) have their lives impacted by fear of being shot. Enough to make them take different routes which might use more energy, which could impact them in terms of migration/etc. That seems...wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the perspective.  Again, I am wholly ignorant of geese migrations, and birds in general, but I've always had these questions in the back of my mind.  In the summer in Calgary you can see Geese a lot by the Bow river parks but I don't usually see them during the winter. As far as I can tell they're just passing through.  I have an overly simplistic model in my head that sometime in the fall they all just take off for warmer lands and that's it.  I never considered southern Canada (near 51 degrees North) warm enough for them at this time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geese (and mallards) will stay around as long as there was open water up to ~2 days prior AND their food source isn't too covered to feed from.</p>
<p>So it's possible they'll stick around through super cold weather if their food source remains uncovered. Or it's possible they'll leave open water to head south of too much snow to eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it seems like the migration is more of a shift in range than a drive to a destination. They hang around different areas that tend southward in the fall. It's not like the salmon run.</p></div>		</li>
