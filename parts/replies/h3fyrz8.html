			<div class="markdown"><p>just a bit about me: I majored in Biochemistry at the University of Barcelona in Spain after working on a pancreatic cancer project in Germany. Later, I pursued an MSc in Biomedicine in the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona) and The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA) under the supervision of Dr. Vogt. That led me to meet Dr. Moscat and Dr. Diaz-Meco at Sanford Burnham Prebys Institute in La Jolla, where I earned my Ph.D. studying the metabolic adaptations of cancer cells to diverse tissue environments and how they are affected by the pressure of new therapies.</p>
<p>My interest is still heavily focused on understanding mechanisms of cell survival and adaptation that originate when tumor cells clash with is surrounding neighbors. Now, in the laboratory of Dr. Goldrath, I am looking at it from another side of the equation... the immune system!</p></div>		</li>
