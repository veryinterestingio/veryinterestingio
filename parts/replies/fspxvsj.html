But kids don't learn to talk in a vaccuum -- if a baby were to refer to its father as &quot;mama&quot;, everybody around them would teach them to use that word to refer to its mother.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My fun story is that our son until 30 months old though that all boy kids are called Adam because we have 4 family friends and all them named their son Adam (don't ask why). Being their kids playing with him (more or less same age since he was 12 months old) He automatically associated all boys names as Adam</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have two 6 month old twins who both just started talking. A few weeks ago they both started babbling, making sounds other than crying. My son's first sounds were Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba over and over. We immediately started saying it back to him, and handing him a Bottle and saying Ba Ba! The exact same thing happened with my Daughter a day latter, saying Ma MA Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma. We did the same thing, got really excited handed her to mom, and said Ma Ma! I'm pretty sure they both know the words for Ba Ba and Ma Ma. But it's hard to tell. My daughter more so seems to get it.  </p>
<p>We are also teaching them sign language. The certainly know the signs for Play and More. Another funny thing, they also started &quot;babbling&quot; sign language around the same time. They'd stare at the hands like they were high and move them in abnormal ways. Same thing, anything they did that resembled communication, we'd get super excited and repeat back.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The “ah” sound in car and far is the most basic vowel sound. It is an open mouth and an open throat. It’s very easy for a baby to make this sound. So if you make a long ah sound then open and close your lips you’ll make a aaaammmaaammmaaaammm sound. Or mama. Or amam.</p>
<p>There’s a theory that baby says mama, then the mother gives the baby milk, then the baby associates mama the word with milk. Then baby associates the word mama with their mother.</p>
<p>The number of languages that use mama or amam to mean mother, breast or milk is amazing and spreads well outside the indoeuropean world.</p></div>		</li>

Papa, Tata, Ata.  Mama, Nana, Ana. (And Tata and Nana are used for grandparents in many regions.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Afaik, in turkish 'ata' means 'father' too. Hence the name &quot;ata-turk&quot;(Father of the Turks) for Mustafa Kemal Pasha</p></div>		</li>
