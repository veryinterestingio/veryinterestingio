			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you got into the nitty-gritty, I also want to jump in an explain the dehydration. Alcohol inhibits the production of aquaporins which are proteins in the tubules of your kidneys that let water back into the blood. </p>
<p>Kidneys work by slinging blood at high pressure around sharp curves, pushing out everything that isn’t blood, then reabsorbing what the body needs. The rest gets collected and excreted in pee. The lack of aquaporins means that the water can’t get reabsorbed while you’re drinking. That’s one reason why you pee so much. </p>
<p>So when you’re drinking and peeing a lot, and you think “boy, my pee is clear, I’m drinking a lot and I am very hydrated”, it’s not good, you are netting water loss which is why you’re inevitably dehydrated in the morning.</p>
<p>When I break the seal, I like to look at the toilet and say “bye all of my water”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You gotta drink more <strong>because</strong> there's a reduced absorption of water, it's not completely blocked. Drink away (water), my friend!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how much alcohol is in your system, yes. Alcohol inhibits ADH so your kidneys cannot absorb water nearly as well as it could be</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>In this state your body begins to produce stress hormones like Cortisol, you begin to worry and feel stressed out. One under recognised &quot;hang over&quot; effect of alcohol is feelings of guild and shame.</p>
<p>This combined produces &quot;early morning waking&quot; which is a symptom of psychological distress in humans.</p>
<p>You're tired but your brain is wired and you can't sleep. You're anxious and stressed as your brain is overwhelmed with input and tuned for when you were drunk not sober. Invariably you might find yourself stressing about what you might have done</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Ireland will call this &quot;The Fear&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: Many a days have been spent after a heavy night of drinking, wrapped in a blanket looking like a spook,waiting for the local domino's to open to provide us with &quot;the cure&quot;</p></div>		</li>
