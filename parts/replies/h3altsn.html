			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone from a northern PA, driving west to visit family in Indy is physically &amp; emotionally painful. As it slowly gets flatter I just feel sad. Then when hitting that point in Ohio where it just goes flat, I die. Indiana, Illinois just depress the hell out of me. Long, straight, flat, same horizon mile after mile. It's amazing how accustomed to where you're from you can get and drastic changes can drain you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I absolutely hate the flat.  I used to drive from Chicago to Texas.  The portion of the trip through Illinois was just awful, but here in the mountains, I get more tired driving 20 minutes to the grocery store than I used to get driving from the burbs to the Loop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who lives in flat Indiana, it's very exciting driving to anywhere with hills, and is a good wake me up when I get to that point or any change of scenery really. Southern Indiana has some gnarly knobs, just wish there was more.</p></div>		</li>
