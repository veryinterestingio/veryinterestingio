			<div class="markdown"><p>In my middle and high school lab, the first couple of days is always devoted to safety. Part of that is that I make sure every student knows exactly where the emergency gas shutoff switch is, and I tell them that every single one of them has blanket permission to switch off the gas at any time. It's not the one the fire department will use, but it will shut off gas to the room at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's so important. I instructed my children, to never ask permission to use safety equipment, eye protection, hearing protection, fire extinguishers.</p>
<p>I had a friend whose car caught on fire on a military base. A military security cop was on the scene, and called on his radio for permission to use a fire extinguisher.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a veteran, that sounds about right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never thought about this before, but what do firefighters do when the fire's been put out and they're now all soggy from the hose? Do you bring towels and stuff to dry off, or do you just get back in the truck with wet trousers? And at what point is a firefighter's job finished and y'all can go back to the station/home?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So once the fire has been extinguished we shift from direct attack to overhaul.  In overhaul what we do is ensure the fire cannot reignite after we leave.  The average room fire can reach 1000 degrees at the ceiling.  So the area around the fire can hold a lot of heat.</p>
<p>Using hooks, poles, and axes we'll open the walls/ceiling, drag furniture outside to be soaked, and look for hot spots with the thermal cameras that need to be soaked.  We also ventilate the space to allow all the products of combustion like carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, phosgene gas, etc to dissipate in a controlled fashion.  Every structure fire is a low grade hazmat incident so it's treated as such.</p>
<p>Now after that is done we really don't clean up at the scene.  Simply because it doesn't serve much purpose.  You are basically doing manual labor inside a snow suit inside a room that is a few hundred degrees.  So you are drenched head to toe in sweat almost immediately.  So what we do is pack all our stuff and head back to the station.  Every piece of equipment we used gets cleaned.  PPE that has been exposed to fire gets washed and hung to dry.  Some departments have specially designed dryers for this but mine does not.  So if we get another call before it dries we just work soaking wet and it sucks just as bad as you think it does.  But most of us have an extra pair of gloves for moments like this.  Then after everything is reset and we are ready for another call then you hit the showers.  </p>
<p>Resetting afterwards is very important because there is no such thing as &quot;We weren't ready for another fire.&quot;  If you have to work another job exhausted, soaked, and miserable then that's what you're going to do.  Because that's what we signed up for.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You all would be shocked what we can do with a water extinguisher only.</p>

<p>You can’t do that. We need an example, or at least I know I do, because I’m immature and like neat stories.</p></div>		</li>
