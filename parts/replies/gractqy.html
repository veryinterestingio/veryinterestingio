			<div class="markdown"><p>So breathing into the patient is an attempt to give some trace oxygen from our breath to the patient's blood. So it's not exactly to get the lungs moving again but moreso to do the same job of the lungs. Compressions are used to do the same job of the heart, pumping blood throughout the body (namely the brain since it starts to die very soon without oxygen). So with breaths we're giving oxygen to the blood and with compressions, we're sending the blood to the brain to give it that oxygen. So basically, CPR is an effort to keep the person &quot;alive&quot; until an AED and advanced medical care can arrive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breathing is to force oxygen into lungs. Compressionsx, as I learnt it, is for &quot;manually&quot; pumping the heart so it sends oxygen filled blood around in your body. If the brain doesn't recieve oxygen fairly quickly it starts dying. </p>
<p>Also, I learned that it was important to not do it too fast, because then the heart wouldn't pump as efficient.</p>
<p>Please corect me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good CPR is characterised by a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, at a depth of 1/3 the chest depth allowing for full recoil. That last part is hugely important and is where a lot of people mess up. The idea of compressions is to squeeze the heart to eject blood from it, but if you don't allow it to return back to normal you can't squeeze any more blood out of it. People often start compressing and stay compressed which hinders the amount blood actually being ejected. Easy mistake to make and everyone does it until it gets trained out of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and I also might add that the blood flow created by chest compressions is dynamic, you don't go from 0 to 100% after the first compression, it takes several to get to a decent flow (it's like being on a swing, you will have to put some energy into it to slowly increase the height you swing at) and everytime you stop to do something else (for example mouth to mouth) you have to go back to square one</p>
<p>this is also why a steady rhythm is important (100/mn) and that resuscitation should be coordinated to avoid long pauses when you need to rotate with other people to take a break (you shouldn't be doing compressions for more than 2mn if possible)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Red Cross still teaches to give rescue breaths if you know the person doesn’t have an obstruction or something preventing you from doing it properly. However, they say the compressions are by far more important. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not doubting you but just wanna say this probably varies, I just got certified a week ago and the instructor said nothing about prioritizing compressions over breaths, let alone saying to disregard the breathing. It's also probably pretty different between an EMT with proper gear and potentially a team vs some guy who saw someone collapse, the latter obviously won't have a breathing bag regardless of his training</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CPR is taught by many private companies. Depending on what each organization wants to teach they could be teaching compressions only or rescue breaths. I am certified too and was taught rescue breaths even though I thought most people were moving to compressions only. </p>
<p>This isnt one of those subjects where there's only one correct way of doing things. You can look at how every hospital oporates and you can find some differences. It doesn't mean differences are bad. You can probably find minor variations of how tow truck companies jump start your car. Some have portable chargers. Others hook up to their truck. Is there a right way? Not really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what I've been taught is that your blood has quite a bit of oxygen in it, so even if you are giving just compressions for CPR, you can keep someone alive. I think your body doesn't use up oxygen quite as efficiently or quickly as one might think. I've heard we only use something like 2% of the oxygen we breathe in (of 21% O2 in the air), so it makes sense that our blood would take a while to &quot;run out&quot; of oxygen. </p>
<p>I'm no doctor, so that's the best explanation I have based on a number of years of CPR training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading that, now when people say stayin alive for the chest compressions do they mean the pace of ah ah ah stayin alive or the actual BPM of the song? Or are they the same?</p>
<p>Also, what's does it mean when I've read &quot;if you're not getting tired you're doing it wrong&quot;? I've thankfully never had to attempt cpr but...hate to try it and learn I've not compressed hard enough for x amount of seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer your first question yes, you want to match the BPM of the song which is 120 beats per minute. I'd recommend just pulling up a metronome set to 120 BPM to get a really good idea of the actual pace since trying to go off a song might not be super precise, but works in a pinch. </p>
<p>To answer your second question giving cpr can be a very exhausting especially if you have to do it for longer then a couple minutes and you're on your own. For an adult victim you should be compressing 2-1/2 inches deep which is going to crack ribs and break bones. </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>
