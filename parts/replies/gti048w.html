			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a really good summary. Not totally accurate about the semi-subs though, some are suitable for deepwater applications. I worked on one that maintained location using dynamic propulsion. It’s max water depth was 8500 ft, so about 2600 m. </p>
<p>The drill ships in our fleet were able to drill in up to 12000 ft of water, which is just nuts to think about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual bit is in the very tip of the drill string. The drill string is made up of the bit, some stabilisers, measurement tools etc. And then that is connected to the rig via drill pipe.  So the bit length depends on the size of the bit (diameter, depending on casing size) and the drill string length depends on which tools they are using down hole. And the entire pipe is determined by water depth plus how far down through formation they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apologies, I should have been clearer with my get-out statement and using a full stop instead of a comma for a run-on sentence. <strong>In the UK,</strong> when we talk about deepwater we normally mean 200-300m.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure if that is how they make concrete for drilling rigs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity based structures (GBS) which is what you're talking about are usually slip formed in a graving dock (natural dry dock) .</p>
<p>What that means is, they are very slowly cast with a form that moves upwards as the concrete cures.  The bottom is cast in a dry inlet and then once it is tall enough, they actually flood the graving dock, and float the GBS out to where they want it and sink it.  Very simplified version, look up concrete slip forming or the Hebron project in St John's Newfoundland for some interesting videos</p></div>		</li>
