			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's true that the eyes don't work exactly this way, and don't process vision in discrete frames the same way that film does, I stand by the explanation of why things rotating at certain speeds appear to go backwards.</p>
<p>The sub is called &quot;explain it like I'm five&quot; - I think this is an analogy made simple enough that a five year old could understand it, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that this is not an effect that actually happens due to how your eyes work. Your brain and eyes do <em>not</em> work like that, and if you are staring at a spinning thing in static lighting then it will never appear to go backwards. <del>Nobody has ever seen a car wheel spinning backwards outdoors in the sun with the naked eye.</del></p>
<p>For the effect to happen you need either a camera or a flickering llight (as some kinds of artifical light do), and <em>that</em> is where the frame rate comes from.</p>
<p>Or, OP could be referring to a more subtle effect having to do with <em>tracking</em> motion with your eyes and saccades, as I alluded to in my top-level reply.</p>
<p>Edit: seems that an illusion exists that can make things seem to be spinning backwards in continuous light, but the current scientific evidence points to it being unrelated to your eyes working like a camera with a certain frame rate. Instead it seems to be a visual processing thing, i.e. an optical illusion like many others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't, not under static lighting and without moving your eyes. Our eyes do not behave as a camera with a given frame rate and a fast shutter speed, which is what causes this effect, because our eyes do not have shutters.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> think of the eyes as having a specific ability to discern things moving quickly, equivalent to a frame rate, but when things go faster than that they just turn into even motion blur. It's the same with cameras: if you take a camera with a 360Â° shutter angle (which means the shutter is open all the time), then the spinning backwards effect does not occur.</p></div>		</li>
