<p>This trend isn’t stock holders saying “I think things are looking bad so I’m going to bail”. It’s simply adjustment to new compensation methods.</p>

<p>But how can I spin this into an article used to push a false political agenda/narrative?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really feel like with that headline CNN is just explaining &quot;this thing is happening&quot; and the thread OP here on Reddit is trying to make a chicken-little situation or to make CNN seems less credible. </p>
<p>Which is a pretty stupid waste of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CNN comparing current times to what happened right before the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression is trying to get the exact reaction that OP is having. Don’t be naive.</p>
<p>The headline is fear mongering at its finest.</p>
<p>Edit: since people want to downvote who almost certainly didn’t read the article, they’re basing this off the dollar amount of stocks sold per month by executives. Does anyone see the issue with comparing dollar amounts between a 12 year gap?  Did inflation magically stop being a thing? Is the economy the same size it was 12 years ago?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, lots of companies offer discounted ESPPs these days, and most people overstuff theirs to the max contribution level and then sell once the buy window closes.  It’s honestly dumb not to do this in a lot of cases, as it’s a perk that can give you a 15-35+% return over that period depending on the company and terms.</p></div>		</li>
