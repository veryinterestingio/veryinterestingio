			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn’t say it’s just adrenaline/epinephrine, but also a lot of other things too, just from that.</p>
<p>A bit more technical than a ELI5, but adrenaline/epinephrine is a catecholamine. Those normally start at dopamine, then becomes norepinephrine, then becomes epinephrine/adrenaline. Reason I figured I’d add that is because they’re ALL stimulatory, and all are implicated in anxiety responses (in increasing order, relatively). So, when the alcohol wears off (or the receptors begin in increase/decrease in density), you might get an immediate release of 200 dopamine, 300 norepinephrine, and 400 epinephrine. Then, as enzymes react, you then have 150 dopamine, 325 norepinephrine, and 425 epinephrine. Then one more pass and you have 100 dopamine, 325 norepinephrine, and 450 epinephrine.</p>
<p>ELI5 summary: The sobering out part releases stimulatory chemicals that get converted to even more stimulatory chemicals, and it continues on this cascade until the body thinks it’s back to equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>
