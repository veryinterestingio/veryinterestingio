<p>As spiders get bigger they ARE vulnerable to fall damage.  They panic when they feel that they are in danger - that includes biting their owners who are foolishly holding them in their hands trying to show them off.</p>
<p>Contrawise - a bug can be brushed off by you and land on the ground but due to having so little mass vs air resistance and a smol body - it walks away or flies away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pure material physics. </p>
<p>Say, you both land on your elbow, you weigh 80kg and kid weighs 18kg.</p>
<p>The elbow is same three pieces of bone of calcium, cartilage and so on, only you're putting up to four times more weight on it, so it breaks more likely.</p>
<p>Size doesn't really affect what we're made of. Bones can take X amount of force before they break. That's why super huge animals can't exist - their bones couldn't support such weight, and even if it did, they'd sink into ground.</p>
<p>(That's also why ants are amazing, they gamble this rule to the very limit, carrying multiple times their own weight)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes. Your muscles, bones, and joints are probably stronger than a child's. However, your muscle/bone/joint strength-to-weight <em>ratio</em> may not be, so you're going to get hurt more by the force of a fall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The denser they are, really. There has to be enough mass per area to overcome air friction.</p>
<p>Feathers are big, but have very little mass per square inch or whatever. So size itself isn't a factor. Meanwhile, just a black pepper-sized ball of gold falls quite hard. It's going to definitely clink on a stone floor. And feather made of metal would also fall quite rapidly. While a large plate sheet of metal of exact same weight would fall slower (unless it's going sideways), because that weight is divided over larger area, which all has to fight extra air friction caught by its surface.</p>
<p>It gets more complex, though, at some size/weight, it doesn't matter so much anymore. Air friction is simply too weak force to make impactful difference. If you drop two large ships or same weight from a helicopter (well, or something), their shape and weight distribution doesn't matter anymore, really. One might simply reach ground few milliseconds earlier, and that's basically it.</p>
<p>But eh, good enough for ELI5 I guess.</p></div>		</li>
