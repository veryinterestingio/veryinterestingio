			<div class="markdown"><p>Human grazing of livestock is presumed to have had an effect on the climate, but mainly the reason was a shift in the monsoon, which previously watered the land sufficient to maintain grasses. With reduced rainfall and intensive grazing, the plants that could survive were destroyed. <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/abrupt-climate-change/End%20of%20the%20African%20Humid%20Period" target="_blank">https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/abrupt-climate-change/End%20of%20the%20African%20Humid%20Period</a>.</p>
<p>It should be noted, in the previous interglacial, 120K years ago, the monsoon that currently delivers so much rainfall to the Indian subcontinent and Pakistan, fell very heavily on the Arabian peninsula. It too was a savannah with scatter lakes. Recently found human remains and tools around dried lakebeds in Saudi Arabia suggest this climate was an enabler for early modern humans to leave Africa and disperse into the Eurasian continent.  With currently global warming, it is entirely possible the monsoon may shift to watering the Arabian peninsula sufficient for the greening of the desert there</p></div>		</li>

<p>Until last time around, when humans F'd everything up by overgrazing their animals.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the present day potential showing none of Australia as extreme desert also pretty misleading, at least as much of central Oz is perceived. It it is perhaps illustrative of what the &quot;green&quot; Sahara was really like</p></div>		</li>
