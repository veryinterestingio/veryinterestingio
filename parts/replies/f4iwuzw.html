There are also cavefish that do have a clock but it’s 48-h and thus non-circadian.
I wish people without expertise would stop piping up to give opinions.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a principal investigator, which means I have a lab and direct research. My lab does a wide variety of work which uses techniques that range from molecular biology and biochemical experiments, genomic experiments, and animal work. I won’t comment on the specific projects because I’m pretty sure it would out my identity and would rather not have it out there.<br />
What do I do on a daily basis? Depends, ranges from reading papers, writing grants and papers, going over experiments with my technician, meeting one-on-one with my grad students and postdocs, sometimes still doing experiments, and stressing out a lot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>some sort of circadian rhythm</p>

<p>One could argue that 48 being 24*2 would qualify as &quot;sort of&quot; circadian.</p>
<p>I wish people with expertise would be nicer about technicalities instead of badgering the person who &quot;piped up&quot; and brought the conversation to where it is.</p>
<p>Through /u/Geovestigator's comment, we've learned more. That's what it's all about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'll give you a teaser:</p>

<p>The nocturnal rodent/human paradigm of circadian organisation is  unhelpful when considering the broader manifestation of activity patterns in mammals.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was literally the cut and dry phrase taught to me in a biological rhythms class that focused on circadian rhythms. </p>
<p>Right away in your abstarct it says &quot;The emergent circadian paradigm, however, neglects the roles of energy metabolism and alimentary function (feeding and digestion) as determinants of activity pattern. &quot;</p>
<p>this implies that the now neglected things were not always so. So science this emerging paradigm (not fully emerged) says something different than what previous people have said. That isn't to say you are correct just that you are taking a certain view on the topic. </p>
<p>There are of course circalunar, cislunar, and all sorts of other rhythms that exists in addition to other rhythms, but none of that was the question OP asked. </p>
<p>. I wish people without tact would stop piping up to give opinions on things they are not even fully correct about.</p>

<p>I understand that science changes but the information supplied was up to date when it was given to me.  This is a section from one of the lectures.</p>

<li>DNA-based genetic code enclosed in a nuclear membrane</li>
<li>Mitochondrial-based oxidative phosphorylation</li>
<li>Circadian rhythms
circa = about, dian = a day&quot;</li>

Not all eukaryotes have circadian rhythms. But what do I know, it’s only my field of expertise as a professor. You sure set me straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, our circadian clock dates back at least to cyanobacteria billions of years ago.</p>
<p>It evolved as a mechanism to replicate DNA at night rather than in the day, to avoid damage due to UV.</p>
<p>It is run by feedback cycles involving the core clock genes, not melatonin, including <em>Clock Bmal1 Cryptochrome Period1</em> and <em>Period2</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rhythm is often driven by the sun though afaik. Do you know how it's influenced in the abscense of circadially varying light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It is not driven by anything. It’s generated by cell autonomous mechanisms, just like the cell cycle. It is maintained in synchrony with the light dark cycle, but this is an active process that has to be done every day. If you put an animal that has a circadian clock in total darkness, it will “free run” with its own period. In humans it’s 24.5ish hours long.
Light is an “entraining” or synchronizing cue.
Also, the guy above is also inaccurate with his description of master-slave model, if we go to the nitty gritty details. And melatonin isn’t the only way peripheral oscillators are entrained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add onto this, there's a French geologist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Siffre" target="_blank">Michel Siffre</a>, who has done experiments related to this with <em>his own body</em>.</p>
<p>The basic premise: take enough food and water into a pitch black cave with no sources of light and no way to track time, and see what happens, including if he could guess what day it was when he emerged. The way he defined a day was to say that &quot;a night's sleep equals the completion of a day&quot;</p>
<p>His first experience - he emerged 25 days <em>later</em> than his estimate.</p>
<p>His second experience - his body changed his circadian cycle to about 26 hours, and some of his days were as long as 50 hours. He stayed in the cave, alone, for <em>six months</em>.</p>
<p>His third experience - he went down into the cave for a planned 60 days and emerged 9 days past his target.</p>
<p>I highly recommend <em>Why Time Flies: A Mostly Scientific Investigation</em> by Alan Burdick to OP, which is entirely focussed on our perception of time.</p></div>		</li>
