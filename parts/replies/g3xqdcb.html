			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is probably it. Being home constantly due to covid has had me paying attention to the thermostat more, and I noticed that in spring, I was frequently overheating and having to turn the AC lower, but in the middle of summer I could keep the ac much higher and still stay comfortable. Finally realized it wasn't the temperature that made the difference, it was just having the AC run every once in a while, which involves the dehumidifier running as well.</p></div>		</li>
