			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat related:  I did a lot of experimentation with scabs as a kid, and discovered that if you press on the scab and it hurts, then it will bleed if you pick it.  But if you press on scab and it doesn't hurt, then you can pick it, and it won't bleed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I performed a similar scab experiment as a child, a friend told me that if you scratched a part of your skin enough, it would become a scab. She then told me that if you picked a scab enough, it would become a scar. So obviously I now have a scar in between my eyebrows (why did I choose that spot?!). Kids are weird man</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother came up with a weird way of making a temporary tattoo. Essentially branding lite - you draw on your skin with a black sharpie, then you put a bright flash bulb (like a camera flash) right up to it and flash. Interesting thing is it barely stings because the heat dissipates pretty much instantly, but the high temperature fries your epidermis so it's discolored until your skin regrows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to got past the ELI5 explanation, for a wound that covers a larger area, an important factor is whether hair follicles got damaged or not. There are skin stem cells in the follicles so they can act as bridges to help larger wounds heal. It’s why for burn wounds, the most important factor isn’t 1st degree vs 2nd degree vs 3rd degree, but 2nd degree superficial vs 2nd degree deep, because that’s where you lose the hair follicles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true.</p>
<p>Epidermal stem cells are located in the stratum basale, the lowest layer of epidermis. Hair follicles are located in the dermis, deeper than the epidermis. The hair follicle sheath is continuous with the stratum basale, and the deepest part of the hair follicle has special stem cells which produce the hair.</p>
<p>Also, 1st 2nd and 3rd degree is no longer widely used to classify burns. We tend to use superficial (only affecting the epidermis) vs deep (also affecting the dermis). Deep burns may be further designated depending on which deep structures are exposed. This is because the important part of burns is whether the stratum basale and it's basement membrane are affected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure if different countries are using different systems but in the burn unit at my hospital we still classify burns as first, second, and third degree, and then we subclassify second degree as superficial or deep. And a second degree superficial burn has completely destroyed the epidermis and extended into the dermis - meaning it has as you pointed out completely obliterated the stratum basalae. However, most superficial second degree burns spare the majority of the hair follicles - and this is very important because most of these patients do NOT need a graft or flap. The stem cells located in the hair follicles will help regenerate a new epidermis. However, if the burn is second degree and deep, you have lost most of the hair follicles which are in the deeper dermis. Without a graft or a flap, a wound larger than 2x2in won’t heal without contracture at the very least.</p>
<p>You can see this referenced in the <a href="https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/burn-center/Pages/about-burns.aspx" target="_blank">UC San Diego website on burns</a>. I don’t work there, but it’s one of the best websites for patient information and I referred patients there routinely when I worked more closely with the burn surgeons. As you can see on that site, they say what I said - the section on superficial second degree burns states that new epidermis will grow in 1-3 weeks, whereas with a deep second degree burn sometimes grafting is needed (this is of course a bit oversimplified).</p></div>		</li>
