			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but convection is just conduction and advection, in other words conducting from your skin to the air and then physically moving the air away. Which would explain why convection is better than pure conduction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The way I learned in my ChemE heat transfer class is that [con]duction + ad[vection] = convection. Basically, conduction and advection are actual modes of heat transfer whereas convection is a boundary condition where both occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, absolutely, it works both ways. If the fluid (again air here) is hotter than the other medium, it will more rapidly provide heat through convection. On really hot days, the wind can feel kind of like the blast of hot air coming from an oven or sauna when you open the doors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Making simplifications, and to go a bit deeper into the discussion: We describe heat transfer by convection (a heat transfer mode that involves bulk fluid movement, like wind) with the equation:</p>
<pre><code>q" = h(Ts - Tinf)</code></pre>
<p>q&quot; (W/m^(2)) is the heat flux, which is the rate of heat transfer across an area. h (W/m^(2)-K) is the convective heat transfer coefficient, which is based on a few things and for here we're just going to say it has to be positive. Ts is the surface temperature of the object (our skin, in your case), Tinf is the temperature of the surroundings (the surrounding air, in your case). As other's have said, we feel heat transfer, not so much temperature. So the higher the q&quot; out of our body (+q&quot;) the colder we feel. The higher the q&quot; into our body (-q&quot;) the hotter we feel. Don't worry too much about the sign convention.</p>
<p>You can see from the equation that if Tinf is bigger than Ts, the change in T will be negative, so q&quot; will be a negative number; the surroundings will be hotter than our skin, and because of physics heat will &quot;go into&quot; our body; we'll get warmer. You can also see that if Tinf is equal to Ts, the change in T will be zero, so there will be no <strong>convection</strong> heat transfer due to the surrounding air.</p>
<p>So if we want to make the magnitude of q&quot; bigger, we can either make h bigger, or we can make the temperature difference bigger. So that's mathematically why an even hotter wind, like 105 degrees, will heat you up faster. Bigger change in T.</p>
<p>So what about h? My heat transfer textbook gives some basic ranges of h in the introductory chapter, but suffice it to say, it's complicated. For free convection in gases, h is 'typically' about 2-25 W/m^(2)-K, for forced convection in gases, h is 'typically' about 25-250 W/m^(2)-K. 10 times higher. I guess the last thing to bring up is the difference between forced and free convection. Forced convection would be like a fan, or a windy day. Free convection would be like a still day. Even though there's 'no' external force making the air move, the heat transfer will induce a movement in the bulk fluid, which is technically convection.</p>
<p>Keep in mind again that there are a lot of simplifications going on here, but I think this gets you like, 95% of the way to being able to talk about convection heat transfer in an intelligent, informed manner.</p>
<p>To those of you out there who know way more about heat transfer than me, please correct me if I said anything that's just egregiously wrong. I know I made a lot of simplifications, but sometimes what we think is simplifying is more wrong-ifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The rate of heat transfer scales linearly with the “heat transfer coefficient”, h, which is calculated by evaluating the properties of a thermal boundary layer at a point. The average heat transfer coefficient (hbar) is used to calculate the heat transfer:</p>
<p>q = -hbar(T_inf-T_surface) where T_inf is the temperature at “infinity” where the thermal boundary layer approaches the temperature of the fluid.</p></div>		</li>
