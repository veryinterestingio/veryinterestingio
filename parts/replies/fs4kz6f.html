			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it feasible to enact a regulation that any time a credit bureau opens a new record, they have to verify the SSN with the government?  Like if you apply for a loan and they check with a bureau and it pops up &quot;no record found&quot;, instead of automatically creating a new record with the provided information, they require the person to fill out that SSA-89 form?</p>
<p>(I'm not too knowledgable of the inner-workings of lenders and credit bureaus so this might be a stupid question.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since bureaus are utilized in nearly every business transaction in the US, a law would probably just cause a lot more problems.  The problem with identities is they are the culmination of all data associated with that social.  There is no central government database of people's information outside of SSN, name, DOB.  The only databases that exist are from private companies such as the bureaus themselves.  The biggest is Lexis Nexis, and it contains a frightening amount of data on any one person, but again it's only what has been submitted.  For adults the information can be desiminated to reveal fraud, but for children with no history, it's much more difficult as nothing has been reported to show red flags (other than a 5 year old buying a Bentley).  Government data requires written authorization to obtain from the government as mentioned before.  You can freeze any of your bureaus which prevents someone from using their social.  I highly recommend parents do this for their children prior to turning 18.  Just visit Equifax, trans union, and Experian and freeze them.  If you suspect fraud, you can place an initial fraud alert on your bureau using the same method which alerts creditors to pay closer attention.  If you're actively being targeted you can use an extended fraud alert which requires a lender to call you personally and verify your identity prior to extending credit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the note of ID fraud: identitytheft.gov is an excellent website setup by the FTC. It not only lets you fill out an ID Theft report, but also gives you simple step-by-step instructions on how to dispute accounts, credit applications, etc. It also gives you a great breakdown on the difference between a fraud alert, a fraud lock, and a credit freeze. Definitely check it out whether or or not you’ve been a victim of ID fraud, because you’ll be glad to know it’s there either way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be possible, but the major reason it doesn't happen is that it would make it more difficult for consumers to apply for credit.  And no one wants that.  Especially not the banks, who are the largest customers of the credit bureaus.  By the way, the banks eat the fraud losses anyway, so it's more of a financial calculation.  Unfortunately, consumers still have to deal with getting the fraud resolved.  But they also get easier loans, so that's something, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why use a real number in the first place, then, if there's no information attached to it?</p>
<p>Why don't fraudsters just use a random number that fits the general SSN assignment scheme?</p>
<p>What is used for verification of the number to know that it is even real?</p>
<p>From your explanation, it sounds like the the SSI just provides CRAs with a daily text file filled with nameless, ageless valid numbers to check against.</p>
<p>That makes absolutely no sense, though. That's how the death index works, after all, but the  the SSDI includes names and dates of birth and death.</p>
<p>So, how the hell would a CRA be able to actually verify that an SSN was at least truly assigned, but not be able to start with one single corresponding detail?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What to you are describing is another type of fraud called synthetic ID's, and they are gaining popularity.  A person fabricates an SSN and starts placing information, building an identity of a completely fake number.  These are generally defeated by SSA-89's.  These are more time consuming and difficult to pull off, but generally are more difficult to track down to the individual responsible.  Since there is no direct victim in this type of identity theft, it's also more difficult to get the authorities involved as well.  Most law enforcement has better things to do than prosecute complicated white collar crime, so most of these fraudsters get away with it.  They'll even do cheeky things like using mugshots of famous criminals for their driver licenses, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, lenders literally have no way to verify SSN, other than send a paper form with written signatures on it (including that of the SSN assignee) to the SSA?   That means CC companies do not verify it at all, and the whole thing is  the honor system.</p></div>		</li>
