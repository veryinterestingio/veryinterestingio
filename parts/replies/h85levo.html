			<div class="markdown"><p>It has! They hooked up EEGs to whales as they slept as well as tracked eye movement and other behaviors. I believe beluga and bottlenose dolphins have been tested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been confirmed in dolphins, I know that much. And with the species of whales we have had in captivity I assume it's at least been confirmed for them.</p>
<p>I cannot apeak for blue whales though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, human sleep isn‚Äôt nearly as ‚Äúunconscious‚Äù as we like to believe. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs like a computer going into update mode ‚Äî you can‚Äôt play solitaire, but you can wake the computer back up if something is in danger. The human brain doesn‚Äôt record sensory input very much, but it‚Äôs still reactive to it, so we just lose perception of time even though we <em>are</em> still perceiving it. </p>
<p>So a whale just does the two step for an update instead of a one step, so it can maintain enough cognition to stay alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah with full anesthesia you realise what it is to completely lose perception of time and it's definitely not like sleeping. </p>
<p>When you sleep you might not know exactly how much time passed but you sort of have an idea even though sometimes it's completely off. </p>
<p>With anesthesia they are telling you to count down your eyes shut and the next second you're awake but it's a few hours later like being completely switched off and on again. </p>
<p>At least that was my experience anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had surgery last year, and the first thing I said (and rather loudly) was <em>&quot;I've been molested!&quot;</em>. I don't know where the idea came from - It kinda makes me wonder if I was dreaming whilst I was under, or thought of that Seinfeld episode with the dentist before I was able to continue forming memories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Legit ‚Äî this is why we think we forget most of dreams. We‚Äôre perceiving ‚Äî but we‚Äôre not processing or recording super effectively. Our brain is too busy cleaning up the mess from the previous day.</p>
<p>Thus, weird-ass batshit crazy perceptions that don‚Äôt get committed to memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More accurately, it's like waking a computer literally from sleep, mouse and keyboard inputs are still kept track of, but everything else is shut off. A wake up from updating is usually disastrous for the computer, so it wouldn't be completely accurate for us humans.</p></div>		</li>
