			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. First and foremost, their bodies are developing, physically and mentally. </p>
<p>And second, they cannot consent, and they are considered a vulnerable population and require many protections and clinical research advocates which can be a bit of a headache for the research team. </p>
<p>Thirdly, there must be a very strong and compelling reason to include vulnerable groups especially children in clinical research in which benefits are way more than risks to be approved by the ethics group. </p>
<p>Fourth, the risks vs benefits for children is often times an incomplete assessment since whatever interventions they will have during the trial may show adverse events after a long period of time and possibly after they have exited the trial and extended follow up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To your second point about informed consent: Although they can't provide informed consent, at least in the US, children over a certain age are required to provide assent to participate in a clinical trial whenever possible. This means the child is saying &quot;yes, I understand what's happening and I want to do it&quot;. Their parent (often times both bio parents) or legal guardian also has to provide informed consent for the child to participate.</p>
<p>Usually the institutional review board has a child advocate on the board, either all the time or on an as needed basis. The age and requirements for children providing assent will change depending on the trial and condition, but children still have to agree that they want to participate in the trial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was confused that assent hadn’t been mentioned yet. I know in my field that’s usually the requirement, but I didn’t know if it was different in medicine. I can’t imagine outside of extremely niche cases the children of the age assent wouldn’t be neurotypical or developmentally typical in a research setting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep am aware of that. Some children can’t assent. And even with the assent, and parent’s consent at the initial enrollment, it is important for continuing review of assent and consent at every followup for certain trials.</p>
<p>So it can get slightly tedious especially if there is limited research staff</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of this is right and I'll add one more thing: the trial and potential vaccine needs to be better than the consequences of not having the trial. While children are 100% vectors for spreading COVID-19, they have lower incidents of serious cases leading to death. So if the vaccine does anything to raise the incidence of mortality among children it will be harder to do a trial among those groups. It is a real Gordon Knot. Children spread the disease so they need to be vaccinated but the vaccine needs to already be demonstrated to be safe.</p>
<p>Just so we are clear, vaccines save lives. Anti-vaxers are bad citizens and bad parents. Get your flu shots, give your children every vaccine the doctor will give them. Stay up to date on your shots. Vaccines are a real miracle of medical science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, there is some serious reporting bias among different age groups and what I've read looks like epidemiologists are still trying to figure out how much of the reduced mortality in children and adolescents is due to lower transmission, less severe symptoms, a different set of symptoms, or something else entirely. We know they don't die as often but it is a bit more complicated than just saying that one number when you are designing a huge vaccine trial.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Please modify this statement to reflect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019" target="_blank">reality.</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Children make up a small proportion of reported cases, with about 1% of cases being under 10 years and 4% aged 10–19 years. They are likely to have milder symptoms and a lower chance of severe disease than adults.  </p>
<p>According to a CDC analysis, the risk of death by age groups in the United States is 0.003%, 0.02%; 0.5% and 5.4% for the age groups 0–19, 20–49, 50–69, and 70 or over, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>0.003% vs 5.4% is not &quot;slightly lower&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many drug trials are tested exclusively on men, if only at first.</p>
<p>It's not really as a consequence of sexism, but more of a consequence of women potentially being pregnant. All of the consequences and problems of kid trials apply also to trials involving women, because a woman might be, or become pregnant. </p>
<p>Of course as a result of this women often suffer significant side effects not seen in men, because women are physiologically different from men. Which means women receive poorer health care options which is sexist by effect if not by intent.</p></div>		</li>
