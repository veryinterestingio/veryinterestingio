<p>The Swiss Alps are at a strategic junction that was off limits to both sides militarily. The Swiss attacked French and German soldiers who attempted to use Swiss passes through the Alps, and shot down aircraft that entered Swiss airspace. They are belligerently neutral.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The report on arms revealed that from 1940 to 1944, 84 per cent of Swiss munitions' exports went to Axis countries. The remaining 16 per cent was split between the Allies and neutral countries.</p>

<p>The only thing they were neutral on was people in their space. In regards to weapons, they vastly favored the Axis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sweden isn’t that well defended from their mountains. </p>
<p>But the Swiss are. You’re definitely wrong in that regard. The Swiss to this day still have plans in place to blow up mountainous bridges and retreat further in the country if need be, and they had these plans during WWII. You try building a bridge while you’re on a snowy mountain. It doesn’t work too well. Especially when you need tanks and trucks to cross. </p></div>		</li>
