I usually decry Wikipedia for it's pop psychology takes but this a decent overview of the experiments that have been consistently run by psychology students in statistics classes since the 80's which demonstrates the phenomenon. The reason this experiment keeps getting repeated by undergrads is not to learn anything new, but because the effect is so strong that it's easily measured and makes for a great example of how to do statistics for scientific research in psychology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m probably not going to look for the source, but there was a study showing that rollercoasters can provide an increase in sexual attraction, presumably from the adrenaline creating more excitement hormones. And also I’m probably slightly off on the explanation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Psychology student here, this often occurs when a couple gets through some sort of tragic event together, such as a plane crash. The heightened emotion during such an event is often misattributed to feelings for the other person. As a result, couples who go through a traumatic event often end up marrying soon after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have always heard that trauma bonds people, but I never heard a mechanistic explanation of why. </p>
<p>My personal theory was that it built a large amount of trust, knowing you can trust someone to be dependable and with you through a traumatic situation. Since trust is a foundational element of relationships, it's like a shortcut.</p></div>		</li>
