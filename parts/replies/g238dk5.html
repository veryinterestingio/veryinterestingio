			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true for modern cars.</p>
<p>Some decades old cars can fluctuate a lot faster without a delay. If it isn't noticeable it doesn't matter, if it is noticeable then only trust it parked on a flat surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point about older cars.  My first car was an 85 escort, and the fuel gage on it would swing noticeably going around curves.  Especially interstate cloverleafs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you show me photos of these baffles? People are commenting about them, but I have literally never seen them in gas tanks. Inside the car gas tanks I've seen it's just a lot of smooth plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah my first car was a 2000 Camaro when I was 16 and I parked on a hill. I would be so confused when I had a qt. Tank and the next day would come out with my gas light on. Then I’d spend my food money on gas I didn’t need. Sad days.</p></div>		</li>
