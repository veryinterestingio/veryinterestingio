			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think some people truly understand the massive scale of forest land. It's an impossible amount to maintain. You can thin it out, cut underbrush and add fire breaks near populated areas but that relatively small percent is a massive undertaking...even if we decided to actually fund it properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>33 million acres being managed by underfunded agencies, checkerboarded in with unmanaged private lands, some of it accessible, some of it unroaded, some of it protected from impact by federal laws and regulations. Forest management is incredibly nuanced and challenging.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only reason our fires are so unstoppable today, is because we've spent decades putting out naturally occurring fires, which historically played the role of removing dead vegetation and dense underbrush. Allowing all of this dead vegetation to accumulate means that ground fires now burn higher and hotter, until they light the tree crowns on fire. Once a fire crowns, there isn't much stopping it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.  In some areas yes, in some areas no.  Climate change has had a massive impact as well.</p>
<p>Just ask companies like SPI who have had their timber plantations burn like clockwork ten years after they replant them in a couple of places.  They have a vested interested in active forest management and they arenâ€™t immune.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve done ourselves no favors over the last 70 years, but it would be pure hubris to claim that as the major cause.  Just look at how the Dixie fire blew through the Chips fire burn scar.  The days of counting on recent historic burns to throw you a suppression bone are waning.</p>
<p>Edit:  I should probably add that one issue with fuel buildup on the forest floor is the potential for ladders up into the canopy.  Thereâ€™s a huge difference between occasional torching and a running crown fire.  In California at least, thereâ€™s so many standing dead trees from drought and beetle that ladder fuels arenâ€™t really required.  The crowns just ignite and run.  So to be more specific in my response:  yes, poor fuels management has hurt us out west, but the critical fuel moistures that are really powering these fires are a result of climate and drought.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe if people didn't build in dry, heavily-undergrowthed areas, we wouldn't worry so much about these fires - and could let them burn out and replenish the ground the way they're supposed to</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worse, people build in healthy forests and then pressure the government to stop fires that might burn down their homes.  This leads to increased undergrowth and fire potential.  After a decade or two it's just a matter of time until a drought causes a disaster.</p></div>		</li>
