			<div class="markdown"><p>So, how would it feel to a human? Cold? Warm? I understand the explanation as to why Voyager isnâ€™t melting, and I get that it likely has a specific type of thermometer to record the temperature of particles around it, but what would that feel like to a person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cold, but not flash frozen.</p>
<p>The sensing of heat (or lack thereof) that we call temperature is actually the energy exchange between our body and our environment. In outer space, there is no environment. There are no things to exchange heat with. The only energy exchange is your body radiating away it's heat. So if you were naked in outer space but weren't also, you know, immediately dead from a laundry list of other problems, you would not instantly be killed due to temperature changes. You would <em>feel</em> very cold because the only energy exchange would be you losing heat through thermal radiation. Again ignoring all reasons why would be already be dead, your metabolism would keep on trucking, generating body heat, but it wouldn't be generated fast enough to counteract the heat loss due to radiation, so you will eventually be frozen.</p></div>		</li>
