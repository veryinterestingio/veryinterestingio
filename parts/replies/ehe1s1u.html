The Golden gate bridge is a good one but here's another. <em>Have to</em> is hard to define well, but historically, a good example is the Greeks, who built the Parthenon, among a few other temples, at a slight angle, so that if you kept adding height to it, it's sides would eventually terminated in a very tall pyramid. This gives it the appearance of not leaning over you like some tall buildings in cities do.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We found it missing.  They’d dismantled it to rebuild it stronger.  Terribly disappointing thing to find, and I’d never have imagined it to be true.  </p>
<p>Apparently it was the second time they’d done it too.  They were replacing the steel rods they’d used to tie the rocks together before with titanium rods.  They’d figured out where some of the stray pieces had gone since then as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4.62 centimeters by the way, assuming that the pillars are build perfectly straight upwards from the earth, and assuming the earth is a perfect sphere. In reality it can change depending on things like metal heating up in the sun. Warm objects expand causing the pillars to bend. These and more make sure its never exactly 46.2 millimetes.
