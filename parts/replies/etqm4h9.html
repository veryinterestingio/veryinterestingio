			<div class="markdown"><p>it's like nitrous that you may have seen in a movie or video game that suddenly makes cars go fast. It works well in short bursts, but if you used it all the time you would put a lot of wear on the engine and cause it to blow or would just be wasting a lot of resources to go slow down the block. Only use it in emergencies and in small doses.</p></div>		</li>
