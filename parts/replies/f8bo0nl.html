			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonus bonus fact: the indigo used to &quot;dye&quot; denim blue isn't a dye, it's a pigment. When &quot;dying&quot; with indigo, the pigment precipitates into a hard coating on the surface of the cloth, a bit like painting the cloth blue. Levi's don't &quot;fade.&quot; Fading refers to a colorant being damaged by light. Indigo is insanely light-fast. Instead the indigo layer wears off, allowing the white cotton to show through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just gonna add, in case we have people in this thread who have never experienced fabric, that the pigment would penetrate into individual threads of the material. It's not just a coating, it's a ton of fragments as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cyanoacrylate, the main ingredient in superglue, normally reacts with water (moisture in the air) to form long, solid polymer chains. However, it can react the same way with cellulose. Any contact with cotton results in a vigorous exothermic reaction. It can get hot enough to start a fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Use some acetone, test a patch of fabric first to make sure it won't harm the color. Alternatively, since it's cotton, you could probably decompose the superglue CAREFULLY with a heat gun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also means various fabrics are easier or more difficult to dye at home. Cotton is easy and can be done in the washing machine. Some synthetic fabrics like nylon are doable, but you have to fix with vinegar and have them in 160-180F water bath to do so. Polyester is almost impossible to dye at home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polyester can be dyed in high temperature high pressure vats. It’s an expensive process. Much easier is to mix the dye with an adhesive and just run the fabric in a vat but then it fades much faster.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why many years ago, every household had <a href="https://pixl.varagesale.com/http://s3.amazonaws.com/hopshop-image-store-production/31865935/b4ffef5dd342376033fc7c5658e2e14d.jpg?_ver=large_uploader_thumbnail&amp;w=640&amp;h=640&amp;fit=crop&amp;s=f81bcdb49a4e30106755e5ff5cc40707" target="_blank">a copper stovetop boiler</a>. White shirts, blouses and undies (the only kind back then) would have their stains literally boiled away. Detachable celluloid collars and cuffs would be sent out, because they were tricky to launder without destroying, <em>and</em> highly flammable. Coloured fabrics wouldn't be boiled, just simmered on top of the coal/wood stove until the detergent could take effect.</p></div>		</li>
