<p>The cancer was essentially contagious and ran through the population due to the genetic similarity between animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just jumping in here to add on. Most people don't understand why inbreeding is bad. Inbreeding doesn't cause genetic disorders or mutations in a population that doesn't have any, it just allows recessive diseases already there to show their face and proliferate. If you already have a genetically healthy population, even if it's small it won't be an issue except for part 2.</p>
<p>The other problem with inbreeding is the lack of genetic diversity, this leaves the population open to the possibility of extinction by a disease or natural factor that the population had no natural immunities or helpful mutations for. This isn't a problem for a species that is already on the brink of extinction though because the alternative to possible future extinction is it happening right now. Given enough time that genetic variation will return naturally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why the endangered mink that was just cloned, was cloned from a mink that was frozen since the late 90s!</p>
<p>A good example of inbreding in endangered species causing problems is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea_singing_dog" target="_blank">New Guinea Singing Dog</a>. It was only alive in captivity for more than 50 years - researchers thought it was extinct in the wild. Then, a few years ago <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/science/singing-dog-new-guinea.html" target="_blank">it reemerged in the wild!!</a>. The ones in captivity were very inbred which was causing problems, they weren't living as long, they were getting sick, which did not look good for the species. When they found these wild dogs near a village in New Guinea, they were very surprised. These dogs only had 78% of their genome the same as the singing dogs in captivity. They may have interbred with village dogs, or may have come from a quite different line, explaining the genetic difference, but sure enough, they were not village dogs, they were wild singing dogs. The 22% similarities were believed to be from a common ancestor of all wild dogs in New Guinea and the region. The researchers used these dogs to reinvigorate the gene pool with new genes, which really helped make the dogs more healthy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This is why inbreeding among nobles resulted in so many issues. Many people have all sorts of little defects hiding out in their DNA, but because those little defects are so rare among the population as a whole, they rarely pop up.</p>
<p>However, two people with essentially the same DNA are likely to make those pop up. Repeat that over a handful more generations and the chances become greater and greater.</p>
<p>Same for animals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not exactly friendly to shun an entire family from marriage because of that one schizophrenic uncle... but it's a fairly effective way to avoid marrying a potentially recessive trait into your family.  Hundreds of years of selective breeding does actually work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it also matters where the small remaining population arose from. Hypothetically speaking if there were 100,000,000 animals originally, living in spread out herds or packs, and the remaining 10,000 endangered animals is a somewhat representative (evenly spread) distribution of the original 100,000,000 (some from pack A, some from pack B, etc.) then the effects of inbreeding should be far less... at least for the first few generations of offspring. I would assume the scientists in charge of repopulation would then carefully mate future generations accordingly to minimize negative effects on the future</p>
<p>EDIT: representative distribution</p></div>		</li>
