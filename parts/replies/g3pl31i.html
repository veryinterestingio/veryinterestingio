<p>This is a very important thing to remember.  You'll see restaurants or ads for grass fed beef with all this beautiful marbling and big juicy steaks.   No.  You're not going to get that on a cow with just eating grass.  Hence, I think (I have no source or time to look for one about this right now) that &quot;grass fed&quot; advertised meat only has to be fed a certain amount of grass in their diet.  (Or maybe the FDA doesn't even have any guidelines on the designation.)  But, people like the image of these beautiful fat cows just eating healthy green grass in a meadow all their lives before they are butchered.  While, as OP mentioned in the post, you can have cows just living on grass (and finding the minerals they need in the dirt or elsewhere), but they are going to be quite lean (and tougher, as in the meat), than beef that has had supplemental protein sources, such as grain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m not sure about the US laws, but that diet makes meat way tastier than silage fed cows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite!</p>
<p>A properly grass fed animal absolutely will be marbled and have a fat cap. I hesitate to say “just like” a grain finished animal, because that isn’t true. To compare grass fed to grain finished is to compare it to an inferior product. </p>
<p>Proper pasture is not a monoculture of “grass” like a lawn. If you walked into my neighbors pasture, you could easily find 100+ species of grasses, sedges, legumes, brush, wildflowers, etc. All of these species will have a different nutritional content (protein, vit/mineral), that the cows have the ability to self select what they need in their diet that particular day. These cows are also offered free choice minerals and salt. As a result of this “grass” fed diet, you will have a wildly different end product than something coming from a feedlot. </p>
<p>Feedlot cows are fed a ration of hay, a grain mix (usually primarily based on corn and soy) and a mineral balancer. “Corn fed” is not a desirable trait. It is the rapid development of the fat layer that leads to the white, mushy fat that is sadly common place on beef cuts. This fat is tasteless and has a horribly unpleasant texture, which is why it is heavily trimmed.</p>
<p>Grass fed animals will fatten more slowly because they are not being shoveled full of the equivalent of bovine twinkies. This means that the fat cap on these carcasses is of a totally different quality. You will often find a deep yellow fat that is firm in texture and has a very deep/rich flavor. This yellow color is due to beta carotene (just like what makes carrots orange) and is a good thing for you to consume! Beta carotene is turned into vitamin A by your body, which is an important part of vision/eye health, immune function, and healthy skin. You will not find this beta carotene content on something grain finished, it comes from the diverse plant diet of a grass fed animal. </p>
<p>We are designed to get our nutrients from grass fed animals. But grain finished is quicker, and easier which is why it is so heavily marketed and available. We are so used to eating “McDonalds” style proteins (beef, pork, poultry), that the healthy “vegetable” equivalent is considered less desirable and unpalatable. We need to stop feeding our inner toddler and give our bodies nutrition of substance to work with! </p>
<p>Short aside: yes, USDA labeling pisses me off. There are so many industrial agricultural mega corps that use the technicalities of labeling to try and pass off an inferior product. Just like “organic” and “cage free eggs”. Skip the BS, buy from your local farmer instead. I guarantee they would LOVE to talk with you about how your food was raised, and probably invite you out to the farm to see for yourself. If you’re not sure where to find a local farmer, checking if your town has a farmers market is a good place to start! Or shoot me a PM and I’ll see if I can find someone for you (USA only, no guarantees about Canada. Sorry y’all). </p>
<p>We don’t farm to get rich, we farm because we love caring for the land, the animals, and even (sometimes) the people (grumpy farmer joke!). </p>
<p>Source: Am a regenerative farmer. I specialize in pasture raised pork and poultry, now dabbling in small scale dairy.  </p>
<p>Tl;Dr: Grass fed still will be marbled with a fat cap, except the fat off these cuts is healthy for you. Grain fed is the equivalent of wonderbread vs a proper homemade loaf. Shop from your local farmer!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ah yes, reminds me of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/natureismetal/comments/g37y8r/horse_eats_chick_in_front_of_hen/" target="_blank">this post</a> that stuck with me. Previously I herbivores exclusively eat plants. Turns out they can eat anything when an opportunity arises and they're curious or hungry enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Herbivore, carnivore (even obligate carnivore, like felines) seems like it tells you what they need to eat and what their system finds easiest to digest. Nothing stopping them from eating other things, too. Sometimes they’ll get sick, but then humans recreationally consume poison.</p></div>		</li>
