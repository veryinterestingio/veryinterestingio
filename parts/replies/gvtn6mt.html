			<div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to the US.  The eastern states have more natural borders and are thus less square.  The states out west do not have as many natural borders therefore their borders are more of a straight line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's how a lot of the states were formed, the boundaries are often set as straight lines since a lot of the western states have a lot of flat, dry land</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has more to do with the western states weren't explored all that much. Those territories were defined by lines of longitude and latitude, despite their natural features. Even the eastern states have several borders that just cut across. The Appalachian mountains run through the PA-NY boarder and is straight. The western boarders for many of the original 13 states we're defined by Congress to prevent western expansion of states that had access of territory west of the appalachians. Those borders are straight despite the known natural landmarks. </p>
<p>The desert borders in the middle east and the Sahara are straight due to the lack of physical features and that no one lives near those borders.</p></div>		</li>
