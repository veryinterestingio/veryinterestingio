<p>The op notes the lungs, kidneys, brains but also eyes, hands and limbs can also take up the slack when one is unable to use the other. Humans and animals have an amazing ability to fall back to redundant systems and use non traditional pathways even through single point of failure organs (think brains) to be able to survive and procreate and pass on their freaky genes to the next generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RUSSELL: Overdesigned. Klingon anatomy. Twenty three ribs, two livers, eight-chambered heart, double-lined neural pia mater. I've never seen so many unnecessary redundancies in one body.<br />
CRUSHER: Unnecessary? The Klingons refer to it as the brak'lul. Almost every vital function in their bodies has a built-in redundancy in case any primary organ or system fails.<br />
RUSSELL: It's a good design in theory, but in practice, all the extra organs means just that much more that can go wrong.</p></div>		</li>
