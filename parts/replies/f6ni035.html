			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember that serotonin concentrations are only high in synapses between nerves, which is a really small space.  If it diffuses into the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid (after avoiding degredation or reuptake) it is quickly diluted to a negligable concentration.  Then when it diffuses to the blood its even lower.</p>
<p>So the question &quot;can this small molecule diffuse out or through a barrier&quot; is usually yes, but it isnt at a high enough concentration to matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides its role as a neurotransmitter, serotonin is potently vasoactive. </p>
<p>So I wouldn’t say that synaptic qualities of serotonin outside of the synapse don’t matter—when secreted by endothelial cells, it causes rapid vasospasm and platelet aggregation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The combination of the <strong>hydroxyl group</strong> in the 5 position of the indole nucleus and a primary <strong>amine nitrogen</strong> serving as a <strong>proton acceptor</strong> at <strong>physiological pH</strong> makes 5-HT a <strong>hydrophilic</strong> substance. As such, it <strong>does not pass the lipophilic blood-brain barrier readily</strong>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also remember that the BBB doesn’t exist as a physical ‘barrier’ despite its name. It’s a concept borne of the ability of molecules to cross from water based blood to fat based brain tissue. The hydrophilic/lipophilic nature of the molecule in question is largely what dictates whether it will cross the BBB. Also worth noting is that the BBB can become compromised in certain disease states meaning polar molecules are more likely to cross into the brain</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Controlling serotonin levels has been a huge endeavour of study for decades now. But keep in mind the the number of serotonergic receptors in the rest of the body  absolutely dwarfs the receptors in the CNS. The amount of serotonergic receptors in the digestive system is staggering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question - to pass enough serotonin through our digestive system to get us a noticeable psychoactive effect, would that lead to a lot of bodily effects and likely be uncomfortable? </p>
<p>I’m guessing a large enough amount would mostly end up not in our brain if at all, so would it just end with serotonin syndrome or...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, I don't think anyones ever actually found DMT in the brain.  It's speculated to be produced by the pineal gland during dreams but that is just speculative.  Serotonin is pretty well understood for a neurotransmitter and we're quite sure our brain makes it endogenous.</p>
<p>A great deal of the information about DMT that is popularly available contains bad science due to the fact that people who experimented with it had such profound experiences that they tended to overstate their understanding of it in their writings.  If you've tried DMT, you'd know why.  Unfortunately, first hand experience is not scientific.  Science needs to produce repeatable results, and nobody has (afaik) designed an experiment to determine whether DMT is endogenous to the brain, and what purpose it might serve.  </p>
<p>If anyone is aware of any studies that would contradict this I'd be very interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding on something, the DMT that is found in the brain is different than the DMT that people do recreationally (although they are similar).</p>
<p>5-HO-DMT (bufotenine) is what has been proven to exist in the human brain, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine is what people use to experience psychedelia.</p></div>		</li>
