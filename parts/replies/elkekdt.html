			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point, and certainly a limitation of any cross-sectional survey like ours. We note this as a limitation in our study, but there wasn't much we could do with the current data to rule out reverse causality.</p>
<p>However, I currently have a study working its way through the peer-review process that takes a longitudinal approach. We look at whether surface or deep acting on a <em>particular day</em> is more likely to result in drinking <em>later that day</em>. In this study we tested the reverse direction--that drinking more one day (e.g., Monday night) results in more surface or deep acting the next day (e.g., Tuesday) and find that alcohol use <strong>does not</strong> predict subsequent surface or deep acting. </p>
<p>Thanks for the question!</p></div>		</li>
