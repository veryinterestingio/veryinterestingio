			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but also no.</p>
<p><em>Complexity</em> is still absolutely important. It just turns out that complexity via <em>length</em> is both better for us meat-brains and easier to increase. Older (bad) systems often (and sadly sometimes still do!) have <em>maximum</em> lengths for passwords, so the only way to increase the total possible combinations is adding symbols, etc. </p>
<p>Now, predictable long passwords are still an issue depending on <em>how</em> someone is breaking in which is why <em>completely random</em> words, with one randomly chosen symbol between words  work fairly well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thankfully, sadly ITIL and, worse, payment card industry standards still require quadratic soup.</p>
<p>and what's even more silly is as long as your potential salt space has special characters, you don't need them in the passwords at all.</p>
<p>no one is doing dictionary attacks on front-end passwords anymore, they're trivial to stop, and worse, requiring all that BS only encourages credential re-use, making credential stuffing more lucrative and dangerous </p>
<p>they're literally protecting against the really dumb, uncommon and easily-prevented attack by making people more vulnerable to the one that's being used every day by threat actors, which... seems backwards for a payment card security standard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You made really good points. Because people don't want to change their password because of the requirements on complexity people reuse. Then their password is leaked and some one tries it using their email and leaked pass on other platforms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pure CYA. If someone brute-forces a password on your site, even if that's 1/1,000,000th as likely to happen, then some would consider that your &quot;fault&quot;. But if a user gets phished by some weak-ass scam site, or re-uses their password, it doesn't matter that this is happening hundreds of thousands of times if its those users' &quot;fault&quot;. Heck, even if the complex rules have negligible to negative impact, you can always defend yourself with &quot;look how complex these passwords are! Clearly we did everything we could!&quot;</p>
<p>It's absurd because the actual fault should lie with the people who could make an easy remedy to keep their site a million times more secure but don't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but because of how combinatorial math works adding more characters will always give you better security than expanding the set of possibilities for a character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's just wrong. You can define isomorphisms between x base y length representations to an equivalent entropy v base w length representation. The idea is that humans remember certain things better than others and that maximizing length over character set takes advantage of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, I'm aware you can define a isomorphism that way.</p>
<p>my point is that given the known math of ASCII, adding another 16 or so potentials to every character of a 8- or even 12-character password adds fairly little entropy compared to adding a few more characters, and is blown out of the water by increasing the minimum length from 6 or 8 characters to 16 or 24</p></div>		</li>
