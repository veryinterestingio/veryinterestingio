			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the US and Japan control their own currency; Greece does not. So if, for example, there is rapid inflation in the US (prices go up due to too much money in circulation), the Fed can raise interest rates to bring things back into alignment. Greece does not have those tools. This is a problem on its own, and also affects how the Greek economy is perceived in terms of confidence - &quot;If problem X occurs you can address it&quot; vs. &quot;If problem X occurs you can't do anything about it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Those states might do better if they could devalue their currencies and make three or four Mississippi Dollars worth two California Dollars.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are a lot of benefits from having the same currency over a large area. We don't have to worry about oil prices jumping 20% because the Texas and Louisiana Dollars rose, bread prices going up 30% because the Dakota Dollar rose, or the [State] Dollar falling and suddenly imports from the next state over cost more.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area" target="_blank">Optimum currency areas</a> are a serious study, although the answers aren't as clear as we'd like yet since it's hard to run experiments. The Euro area seemed too diverse to be an optimum currency area in the late 90s and the Euro since hasn't proven the critics wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US transfers a significant amount of money from powerhouse urban coastal economies to the rural states in order to avoid the need for devaluation.  The EU does not do this.  That is the real problem here.</p>
<p>Most rural states get about 1.5-2x the amount of taxes they pay back in federal spending, while the urban states get stiffed.  The numbers would get even more intense if we separated it out on a zipcode basis instead of a state basis.  In a very real sense, rural america is supported by federal welfare that is transferred from urban economies.  They would be completely screwed if they had to pay their own way, you can't devalue your way out of not having a (relatively modern, productive) economy, which is also Greece's problem.</p>
<p>The EU could work if they did that too.  But they're more like the US under the Articles of Confederation... a highly limited federal government with no independent spending power (except that unanimously agreed by the member states) and no independent military power.  It didn't really work for the US and it doesn't really work for the EU either.</p>
<p>Germany has no interest in agreeing to transfer their tax revenue to Greece, any more than New York would willingly agree to transfer their tax revenue to Iowa.  The Federal spending power is the only thing that makes the common US currency zone work, and it takes federally-minded representatives, not just senators looking out for their own state.</p>
<p>Like the Articles of Confederation, the EU was an arrangement designed to get independent-minded member states to agree to it... not to produce effective governance.  It actually works remarkably well given its limitations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is always the general answer to the whole Greece vs X debate but it's very superficial. Not necessarily wrong but being in control of your currency is not fail proof and the failure of Greece has more to do with making false promises and less about the Euro.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The us is a a large and diverse economy which is the reserve currency of the world with a strong tax collection system and robust legal tradition.</p></div>		</li>
