			<div class="markdown"><p>we are if you strictly measure it as distance traveled over the maximum time we can do other animals can burst faster than us, and a horse can go a decently long way faster, but humans are capable of maintaining speed over 12 hours at a time if properly conditioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly, speed as a function of distance over time would result in us moving quicker over longer time, and slower over shorter amounts of time. I find it helpful to define this in terms of velocity, in which many animals can best us because of their acceleration - however average velocity over a defined quantity of time we would come out ahead if given enough time. I'm really just nitpicking the definition for accuracy, I get what you're saying...</p>

<p>...However I'm sure not many of us are in good enough shape to outrun a turtle at this point lmao. Human evolution everyone</p></div>		</li>
