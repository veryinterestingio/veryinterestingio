			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that how it is for most scaled animals?</p>
<p>So in fiction when a character tries to get a single scale from some animal, or thrusts their sword underneath a scale to kill a dragon, is that basically off base?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there are at least four totally different kinds of scales in different kinds of animals.  Some reptiles shed scales singly in smaller pieces, or you could chop out a scale I guess.  Fish scales are quite distinct objects, and shark scales are different from other fish scales and are basically tiny teeth.  Pangolin scales are totally different again and are basically derived from hair</p></div>		</li>
