			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at it as a return on investment that's almost 300% return on your investment in under a year.  Let's assume you need 3 months to get the next crop started then it's in a year.  Most companies, at least in the U.S., look to achieve a 10% return on their investment.  That Sh5,000, would make them Sh5,500 instead and would be considered pretty good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Planting, caring for (albeit probably minimal because pineapples sound pretty darn hardy), and harvesting/selling sounds like a lot of effort for the profits made. Granted it's hard to understand the true value of such profits as $82 in 9 months is less than I make in a day in the US, I know the cost of living there is much cheaper in comparison to the US but I don't know the details well enough to say whether $82 is good, bad, or average profit for the work involved.  </p>
<p>Regardless it sounds pretty lucrative for the investment as long as you can do the work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it always just feels meaningless to compare value of something in American dollars in a country where everything is cheap with US dollars. a country could pay a guy 2 dollars/day and if that buys his groceries for the next two weeks, then that's probably a good deal and the system works</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  It'll depend on how much more you could have gotten for the work involved as well.  Then again if you can get a second job while your plants are growing then that's extra incentive to grow them.  All of that has to be taken into account.  A lot of businesses won't invest in something if the return is less than what they could get putting their money into a mutual fund.  That's a lot easier with less risk than investing into a business/idea directly but will have lower possible returns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW I grew up on a commercial apple/peach/cherry orchard in the US and growing fruit for money isn‚Äôt really that easy here. I can‚Äôt speak to ROI on apples vs pineapples but farming anything takes a lot of effort. I‚Äôd have loved it if our crops were pest, disease and drought resistant lol. There were many years that we‚Äôd put a full years worth of work in but had little to show for it because a late frost shot our entire peach or cherry crop before the trees had a chance to pollinate.</p></div>		</li>
