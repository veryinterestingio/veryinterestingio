			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes exactly. The last time this was posted, the responses were pretty much the same. I don’t think anyone is wrong, per se, but I like to take a different approach to answering the question (copy/pasted from my reply 2 years ago):</p>
<p>The respondents so far are essentially saying “yes”. They’re not wrong, since each body cell requires a blood supply- so the BIGGER you are, the more blood you have. But let me tackle another angle: No.
Take two people who are both 90kg. Same weight. One of these two runs 4 times a week and body builds at the gym. He is filled with lean muscle mass, which requires a vast network of vasculature to deliver oxygen and nutrients. His 90kg counterpart is made up of adipose tissue (fat storage cells) which just deposits energy for future usage and does not require extensive vasculature. A kg of lean muscle mass has a ton more vascular volume than a kg of adipose tissue. Sure, while your weight goes up due to obesity, you have more vascular volume than before, but the rise of blood volume per kilogram is lower than previous. It makes (accurate) drug dosing of narrow therapeutic range drugs that are dosed per kilogram much more difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore, obesity actually = LESS blood volume when compared to comparators of the same weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I understand what you're saying, the answer to OP's question is still yes (since the obese patient has more absolute blood volume in any context). This is still important to distinguish, since for medications, the obese patient you describe would still need a larger dose even if that increase does not scale linearly. </p>
<p>To avoid confusion, you should call it something else when you describe blood volume per kg, like &quot;relative blood volume&quot; or &quot;blood volume density.&quot; I understand that the difference seems so minute and insignificant, but it helps with the clarity of your concept a lot and is also just different than what OP was asking about (but still useful and interesting information).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said there is the &quot;obesity paradox&quot;.
Although they are at increased risk of getting cardiovascular disease, obese people with said disease such as heart failure have a lower mortality compared to normal bmi individuals.</p>
<p>Obesity also has a sepsis mortality benefit. </p>
