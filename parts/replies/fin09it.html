			<div class="markdown"><p>The Nintendo N64 put its adaptor at the device end of the cord, so the plug was as small as the socket. And the <del>Wee</del> Wii put it in the middle of the cord, so both ends were small. There are ways, but I guess those are way more expensive to make and it isn't worth it for a cheaper device.</p>
<p>Edit: Wheeeeee!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that explains why gaming AC adapters had a thick box thing in the middle of the cord. But yet the PS3 adapter has a long thick cord and no box.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very nice technical answer. I love these. </p>
<p>The side to sides seem to work so much better though; in that the shape of it extends outwardly; as not to block other ports.</p>
<p>Otherwise vertical ones you deal with not only the brick itself; but the cord leaving out the bottom as well offering even MORE cord encumbering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Use short (less than 12 inches) extension cord to solve this problem. Plug your power adapter into the extension cord and then the cord into your outlet.  By moving the bulky adapter down the power line, you will be able to fully utilize all of your outlets. Look up &quot;extension cord outlet saver&quot; on your favorite online store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I plug an Apple charger into my power strip it’s going to block 2-3 other outlets or the power switch on the strip. The ones I have that are oriented sideways don’t block anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a short wire leading off the power brick would be better than putting the power prongs directly on the power brick itself though. Basically like most laptop charging cables.</p></div>		</li>
