			<div class="markdown"><p>I've experienced that.  Suddenly my living room seemed like a strange place, a place I didn't feel I'd ever been in before.  Later I was diagnosed with a form of epilepsy, so there may be a connection there...a connection that doesn't quite work as intended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it definitly follows some common logics - which is a good sign. i read the title and started formulating before i actually clicked the tab and got as far in my own head as &quot;...maybe something to do with how our minds dont like to focus on a literalsingle thing for more than a few seconds...so when you keep slamming the &quot;definition&quot; button by saying/thinking the word, instead of making those connections from that cluster of sounds to the emotions, mental images, and so on <em>of</em> that thing, your mind instead starts to wander off topic. but since youre trying to forcibly make it do something its never had a need to, instead of actually getting to drift around and think about/ observe/ chew on <em>new</em> information, it just sort of fizzles and you get that unfamiliarity. uuh...i guess kinda like...</p>
<p>say chair. immediately i have an image of a chair in my head. i get the edge of a feeling of comfort/ release of burden...you know - chair associations. those associations are what my brain is actively processing as i speak the word and think about the further associations that come up. but chairs arent particularly interesting, so i move on and think about other things soon. but if im saying &quot;chair, chair, chair&quot; eventually my brain gets bored of the same stimulus and bringing up those same associations and images. buuut since im actively still trying, my brain either forces the blank as a kind of fatigue, or i think about something else. sort of like how staring at something long enough and then closing your eye quickly can leave a decently clear &quot;afterimage&quot; because your retinas start to get bored and stop doing their job (since nothing is changing anyway) </p>
<p>so a common connection in theory between fatigue. </p>
<p>i dont think thats sufficiently eli5 enough for OP, though. the first half is at <em>least 50%</em> jargon as I organized my thoughts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My inclination is that a song is spread out over a much larger network of neurons and never dwells on any one section for very long, while a single word comparatively occupies fewer. It's like if I asked you to hold up a weight but you can take turns passing that weight from hand to hand, using one set of muscles while another recovers, vs asking you to hold up a weight but only use a few isolated muscles. You'll tire out the isolated muscles a lot sooner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your neurons are a complicated network of connections. When you first think of a song certain neurons fire. Then any neurons downstream of the activated neurons may also fire. This continues for each word in the song. However, downstream neurons can also reactivate the neurons that originally were active as long as enough time has passed. So by the end of a 5 second jingle, the original neurons may be ready to fire again repeating the loop. I feel this is especially true for music since there tends to be repetition strengthening that loop of neurons activating each other.</p></div>		</li>
