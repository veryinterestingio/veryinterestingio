			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people see a number and fail to realize it's based on data, which may, or may not be representative of the population to which the findings are intended to apply.  And that this finding based on data has uncertainty!  e.g, a candidate is leading by 5 percentage points: what is the &quot;plus or minus&quot; on that estimate of &quot;5%&quot;?  Is it +/- 3%? or +/- 10%? (If the latter, then the candidate may not be leading when more data are collected.) And was the sample representative? Or did they solicit response from only a segment of the population (ages, location, access to technology, etc.)? -- KK</p></div>		</li>
