			<div class="markdown"><p>We had something similar in my part of Maryland. We were able to get all DC and Baltimore channels so we had
2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 20, 22, 26, 32, 45, 50, 54</p>
<p>On a good night, we could get a very fuzzy and unwatchable signal from 8 in Hagerstown, but it was pretty far from me and on the other side of some very tall hills</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming these numbers were chosen to avoid overlap from other stations (two stations use CH11 to broadcast, but are in two separate areas, but both can pick up say, CH13)? Here in the UK, analogue TV channels prior to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_switchover_dates_in_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank">digital switchover</a> were pretty much standardised to be 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 across the country — for BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel 4, and Channel 5 respectively. Even now in the age of digital TV, that order remains.<br />
From a UK perspective it seems weird that you'd have 14 channels going from 2–54, when you could have them tuned to 1–14. Heck, I was able to tune my old analog TV to use CH6 for games consoles since 1–5 were already in use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Living in Maryland, we had it good. Halfway between DC and Baltimore. Since I lived a little north we could pick up a few PA stations too. I could get channel 8 out of Lancaster, Channel 43 from Harrisburg. I also remember being able to get channel 19. Have no idea from where. You also missed the original PBS from Baltimore channel 67,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember the era before PBS came to town. We had 4, 7, and 10. NBC, ABC, CBS. PBS took Channel 3 (maybe it was Channel 2 back in the pre-cable days). And back then, if the President came on, your night was shot. I hated President Carter because of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally, someone with fewer channels than me! We had 3, 6, 7, 12, and sometimes 13 (ABC, NBC, different ABC, CBS, and on the right day PBS). When UHF came around we added 33 and 51</p>
<p>When the cable company came through they ran it to everyone's house but we couldn't afford it. I had an old TV with a fine tuner on it so I could watch HBO (cable channel 2) in black and white if I unhooked my antenna and got the fine tuning in just the right place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning old tv's also didnt have multiple inputs like today so the only way to connect was simulating a broadcast channel.</p>
<p>Now turn to channel 45. 'grabs dial' pbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbt, and gets yelled at for going warp speed lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What was stopping them from separating the channels so there was no/less bleed but still number the channels sequentially?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They could have separated the channels more, however that would have either reduced the total number of channels or they would have needed more frequencies in the band plan.</p>
<p>Bleedover could be avoided by assigning channels geographically. So you can use both channel 7 and channel 8 as long as the two transmitters were distant enough from each other to avoid interference. So the tight channel spacing allowed for more channels nationwide, just not locally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because that's how it's always been?  Channels are allocated in fixed Hz increments and then utilized however they work out well &quot;in the real world&quot;.</p>
<p>Even channels on wifi have this neighboring frequency bleed issue, even worse when they are in wide-band modes (which use two sequential channels at the same time, or a center channel and half of each channel next to it...</p>
<p>Has to do with licensing mostly, must be fairly divided up and national if not globally even if it's not technologically the best division.</p>
<p>And older transmitters were noisy and could have spurs of radiation on harmonic channels or frequency shift due to reflection (such as in a city you would get ghosting/shadows due to reflections off buildings with a lot of steel in them).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WiFi, from the beginning, was designed to handle this &quot;bleed issue&quot; elegantly.  Sure, you'll get moderately better throughput by trying not to place channels too close together, but the protocol was designed to handle it with little or no problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing, really, they choose to physically space out transmitters instead.</p>
<p>But also the channel numbers are arbitrary mapping of frequency, channels 6 and 7 aren't actually next to each other, there is a gap for the FM radio frequencies.</p></div>		</li>
