			<div class="markdown"><p>Before I knew what I wanted to do I thought I wanted to be a stenographer seemed like a fairly interesting job. It is super expensive to start. At least it was 20 years ago. I decided against doing it because Im really a big wimp and i realised that the majority of the job is just hearing horrible things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a great program called <a href="http://www.openstenoproject.org/" target="_blank">Plover</a> that is open-source and works with keyboards. It lets you get started with stenography. There are fairly inexpensive stenography boards (around $150) that work with the program that you could get too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m intrigued by the idea of being a sort of fly on the wall in some intense court cases; but I don’t know if I could keep my mouth shut.  </p>
<p>If the defendant or the prosecutor or the defendant’s council says something like, “What happened after your wife <em>hit you in the head with a frying pan</em>?”  </p>
<p>I’d burst out laughing. I don’t know how bailiffs do it either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did transcript for six years before changing careers. There's a lot of memories I'd like to burn from my brain, it really lowers your expectations of people...but there's some good ones too.</p>
<p>I had a lawyer, straight-faced, pretending to know what he's doing, ask a computer specialist if the computer seized was <em>analogue or digital</em>. He just giggled for like 30 seconds before he could reply.</p></div>		</li>
