			<div class="markdown"><p>It's most likely a very virulent addition to mirror neuron activity.</p>
<p>Being very social creatures (Yes, I know where I am), our mirror neurons help us signal our bonds to the people around us. Next time you see people standing around talking (especially one-on-one) take a look at their posture. Are both of them leaning on something? Are both of them are crossing ankles? If one folds their arms does the other follow suit?</p>
<p>You'll probably catch yourself doing the same. It's just our way of signaling our relation to each other. </p>
<p>It goes the other way too. When we really don't want to be around someone our feet often give us away. If someone is uncomfortable they'll probably keep a foot pointed out of the &quot;conversation circle&quot;. (This isn't a mirror neuron)</p>
<p>We use a ton of these little indicators, and our minds are highly attuned to picking them up. You might not notice, because your conscious mind is too busy talking about the weather or a rerun of Friends; but your unconscious mind is having a deeper conversation with the person. It's reading their body language, their micro expressions, the subtext of the conversation, and showing agreement or disagreement through the same means.</p>
<p>Yawning is just one of these very virulent indicators like laughter or smiling. These are so ingrained that even our higher level cognitive functions interpret the symbols for the real thing. Whether it's the word Y-A-W-N, or one of these ?, our mind interprets the word less as a language and more as a physical phenomenon.</p>
<p>As an extension of this, there are some pretty decent theories out there about emoji's as well. They appear to have developed as a necessity to communication. Before Apple started rolling out these little icons we used basic forms to add expression to digital communication. I recall those AIM days of =) or  ;-).</p>
<p>So think of reading the word &quot;yawn&quot; as an emoji of sorts. It's a symbol for an expression, and our subconscious is bonkers for expressions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno, but million dollar idea of the day is to write a book about the science of yawns, and describe different types of them in intricate detail. Almost like a romantic novel for yawning. Better than counting sheep to get to sleep. Hell, maybe even more effective than ambien!</p>
<p>I'll call it 50 Shades of Yawn^^^TM</p></div>		</li>
