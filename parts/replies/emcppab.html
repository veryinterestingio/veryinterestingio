<p>In fact, most of the symptoms - runny nose, sneezing, coughing - are really the effects of your immune system fighting off the virus, rather than the doing of the virus itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not strictly true. Most common symptoms like a running nose are deliberate manipulations by the virus to increase transmissibility. Activation of the histamine channels - used to clean your nose when your body is trying to stop inhalation of dust or pollen - has no benefit to your immune system when fighting a cold.</p>
<p>This is also why taking antihistamines is perfectly fine when you are sick.</p>
<p>Same goes for coughing, excluding something like bronchitis. The build-up of phlem in your throat is another manipulation of the histamine channels by the virus to increase transmissibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the correction. I was under the impression this was a method to expel the virus, as the phlegm is full of the debris of white blood cells, but that may just be incidental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought so too, and that that was also the reason that your nose clears itself up when necessary (try doing like 10 pushups and it will temporarily clear up)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered, but if you have a soar throat or runny nose, isn't it better to actually leave the mucus there in order to do it's job ? I often felt like I was getting in the way by excreting it..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As Agouti mentioned, it isn't necessarily there to do a job. If you have clear liquid dripping out of your nose, that's probably the virus's doing. If it's more solid and yellow/green, it's most likely waste meant for disposal: its job is getting byproducts of the immune response like dead white blood cells out of the infection site, so it's good if you cough it up or blow it out of your nose.</p>
<p>I've personally noticed that if I have phlegm in my throat for too long (when it builds up during the night, for example) it starts to become irritating and painful, but if I clear it out, the pain is reduced substantially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is interesting... I actually noticed quite the opposite, if I eliminate the phlegm, the pain grows stronger, I think it is probably because of the air touching the sensible zone.</p></div>		</li>
