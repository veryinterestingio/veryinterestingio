			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the stresses placed on materials during an impact at higher speeds are pretty crazy. There can be all manner of tiny defects hidden somewhere in the engine, frame, etc that may not be visible or detectable in a shop right after the accident. 6 months down the road, a bolt might sheer off, or a seal break, or... all kinds of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is exactly what happened to my bro's car. one evening he picked me up from class and we were driving in this crowd traffic. we were chatting and he was like driving at 40kmh. one second he took his eyes off the road and then bam, we hit this car from behind. we stopped and checked whether both cars were okay, at the time they were. anyway a couple of days later, my bro was driving through highway and some smoke suddenly came out of the engine and he pulled over. the car he said, stopped and never worked again. he had to call the tow truck and guess what, apparently even from that minor car crash a few days back, engine and some other important stuff inside were damaged really good. so you never know, indeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good reason why you NEVER want to walk away without the other guy's insurance.  I had one guy bump me at maybe 5mph and it seemed like a scuff on the bumper cowling.  But from owning several German cars I knew better.   I insisted on getting his insurance information, and I wasn't wrong for doing so.  It turned out that little scuff was actually $1200 worth of damage... Cars are designed to collapse to spare the occupant the forces exerted during an accident.  So a bumper that looks OK may actually need all its brackets, mounts, etc. everything that absorbs impact, to be replaced, even after a very low speed collision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah something like this happened to my old car.  I had a little bump with another car, the repair shop fixed it up (new headlight unit, bumper etc.),and it looked fine.  However on my next mot it turned out that the chasis was bent in such a way that the headlight didn't meet the directional requirement, and shone slightly higher than it should've so couldn't pass.  You'd have never have known looking at it but that sort of damage isn't really worth getting fixed (especially on that shit heap car).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess every Jeep and Audi must suffer a same little bump on the way out of the factory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you replace a headlight you have to aim it, there's even a piece of equipment shops can buy specifically for that purpose. Sounds like they put a new headlight in and just neglected to aim it for whatever reason.</p>
<p>If the front frame rails were bent they should have replaced the front support that bolts to the rest of the frame or in the case of older one-piece frames they should have pulled it if it was that out of whack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s kind of like when you drop a glass.</p>
<p>The first time it bounces off the floor even though you dropped it a meter high. The second time it shatters even though you only dropped it 1 foot this time.</p>
<p>The structural integrity is compromised after the accident. The same thing happens to helmets, that’s why you should replace it when you fall on it even if it looks good enough.</p>
<p>It doesn’t necessarily look broken, but it very much is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father owned a body shop, repair shop and used car shop. Most of the cars he sold were salvage repairs and as I grew up, every car I had was one as well. None were like new. Every single one had something that gave it away like seams between panels were uneven  or alignment issues because the frame wasn’t exact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s the big one. If something is off by just a smidge it won’t be noticeable visually but you can tell. I had a Camaro than I raced that hit a wall. Everything looked great once I got it repaired but it didn’t drive like it did before. I changed from nitrous to turbo. With that I did a kmember swap because that’s what is needed to go turbo so that there is space. All of the sudden the car drove perfect. Having my old stock k member sitting around I inspected it. It looked perfect and untouched. Got out a tape measure and sure enough it was off by 1/4 of an inch. Not enough to make it unsafe to drive or even notice. However it made a big enough difference that it was noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an anecdotal story to prove this point:</p>
<p>Drove a car, got in an accident- basically just front end damage. Insurance paid for me to take it to the shop, shop did the work and told us it was all perfect.</p>
<p>3 months later we needed an alignment.</p>
<p>3 months later we needed another one.</p>
<p>3 months later we needed Another one and said “enough is enough” and ask them to check it out. They tell us that everything looked good, and that there is apparently nothing wrong. My alignment just Magic’s itself out every few months.</p>
<p>So there it is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's incredibly expensive. I don't know what it costs where you are. But I had my alignment done a few weeks back here in the UK and it cost me the equivalent of $140. Doing this every 2 to 4 months would ruin me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They may not be finding the problem because visually everything looks fine. If possible, take a paint marker with you and ask them to mark the final location of any adjustments they make. If some thing was sllightly bent or warped during the accident, it could be causing that piece to come out of adjustment. Marking the location of any adjustable components after the final adjustment will give you or a mechanic a breadcrumb to follow to locate the root cause. If you didn't have your ball joints replaced after the impact, I would put those under special scrutiny. They're basically the attachment points between your wheels and the suspension, and a developing failure will cause your front end to come out of alignment faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your alignment is not static and it never will be. Any dip, bump, sudden disturbance can easily throw your alignment out of spec. This is exactly why you should rotate your tires every other oil change and get it aligned to prolong the life of your tires. Also if your suspension components are leaking, worn out, damaged, or complete trash because nobody knows anything when it comes to cars they just hop in and drive to point a and b; your alignment will always be out of spec. This goes for any car, accident or not. Don’t blame a shop for your negligence</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehhhh... If a shop is doing an alignment every couple months on the same vehicle, and there's an obvious broken suspension part, like leaking strut, or cracked leaf, and 1) the shop doesn't notice, or 2) the shop notices and decides not to say anything, then yeah, I would consider that the shops fault.</p></div>		</li>
