<p>The problem with the debate is that humans like clear lines. Male or female. The same species or different species. Alive or dead. Red or blue. Planet or no. </p>
<p>Problem is, nature don't play that game. There are always fringe cases, and the only real answer is &quot;kinda.&quot; If you say viruses are or aren't alive, you end up with new fringe cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it's that we gave labels to things that didn't have it initially. What is alive anyway? For nature being alive and not being alive is the same thing, both follow the exact same natural laws.</p>
<p>Before arguing if something is alive or not a definition has to be created, and nature doesn't provide us with one. We made a definition and viruses do not agree with it, therefore viruses are not alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses are not alive. They are the equivalent to a USB flash drive containing an automatic replication script. They do not move, they are carried by the wind and water droplets in the air. They can not have any conscience of their existence because they don't have any sensing components.</p>
<p>Virus do not live, they exist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>First of all, we still don't know what life IS.</p>
<p>Yes we have a definition of &quot;alive&quot; which encompasses certain behaviours of what we define as &quot;living things&quot;, but it's a <em>description</em>, not a rule.</p>
<p>We don't know <em>where</em> life arises from or what its <em>essence</em> is.</p>
<p>Also what the other dude said about humans liking clear lines and categories. Life, like gender, disease, illness, electromagnetism, sound, and pretty much everything, is a spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to agree. I view the the first proto-bacterial organisms as the first form of life. My view is that the replicator genes split into more complicated life, while the other half became parasitic and stayed as simple viruses. This is obviously speculation though.</p></div>		</li>
