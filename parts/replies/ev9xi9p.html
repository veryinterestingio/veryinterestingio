			<div class="markdown"><p>My original gameboy from the early 90s has several orders of magnitude more processing power than the apollo guidance computer. My home computer likely has more processing power than every single computer in the entire world in the 60s combined. The advances in computer technology is probably by far the most important reason why spacex is able to develop things so much faster.</p>
<p>Nowadays, you can do advanced fluid dynamics simulation on computers. They can just make a 3D model on a computer, and send it to a supercomputer that will tell them in extremely great detail exactly how it will behave when flying through the atmosphere at thousands of miles per hour, before anyone has even manufactured a single physical part of the rocket. This is just one of the things that is possible now, but was impossible in the 60s.</p></div>		</li>
