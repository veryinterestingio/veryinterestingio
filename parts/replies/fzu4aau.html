			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the injury -- like an injection -- alcohol kills the germs but does not cause issues with the skin. This is where it gets used.</p>
<p>After the injury clean water is best, followed by a thin layer of petroleum jelly (or an antibiotic ointment) to provide a moisture barrier. Cover with a bandage to keep clean.</p>
<p><strong>NEVER use hydrogen peroxide on a wound.</strong> It does destroy germs, but also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide#Adverse_effects_on_wounds" target="_blank">destroys and damages body tissue.</a> It slows healing and increases scarring because it kills the tissue that could have healed together. Instead it creates a layer of dead cells which must be slowly grown around with scar tissue. It was used in the 1930 or so before modern understanding, and stopped being recommend in the 1960s when it was better understood. It has sadly stuck as a home remedy because people like the fizz it creates, thinking it is a good thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So I should pour alcohol over myself before doing anything where I might get injured?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, if you’ve bled onto clothing, hydrogen peroxide WILL take out the stain, or at least disrupt it enough so you can get it out in the wash. So not good for wound care, but excellent for bloody stain care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. We irrigate wounds with sterile saline or water and dress them often with a moist dressing then leave them alone. Most don’t get infected. Disinfectants damage the delicate healing tissue. If they get infected then again we irrigate with saline or sterile water and consider oral antibiotics. Topical antibiotic ointments really aren’t recommended for wounds because they only kill surface bacteria and don’t get to infected tissues. They tend to promote antibiotic resistance. They aren’t really used outside of North America and there just isn’t an evidence base for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that isn't why it feels like you are being burned. you feel like you are being burned because it's literally burning you. alcohol strips lipids from your cells and denaturizes proteins. its the same mechanism that kills germs.</p>
<p>it's basically causing a chemical burn on your exposed wound.</p>
<p>alcohol and peroxide don't just kill bacteria, they kill everything including your own flesh</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are supposed to wash the wound with clean water and clean the surrounding of the wound with alcohol before dressing it with sterile gauze. Not pouring alcohol directly onto the wound. Unless you are a masochist that enjoys pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fastest way to heal is to usually just let your body do it’s thing and only cover the wound to stop blood flow till it clots or to protect it from more damage and dirt. And the ways to prevent infection go saline rinse,soap scrub, antibiotic ointment, alcohol, peroxide. The harsher cleaning methods do more damage to cells in the wound increasing healing time but prevention of infection can offset that a lot. The fastest way to heal is to keep the wound clean and dry it’s been found that constant medication or bandages interferes with your natural healing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they really aren't. They kill most cells (even skin cells, tho much slower), if it's small scratch then it's &quot;mostly ok&quot; as they kill and coagulare blood, but You REALLY shouldn't apply them on large wounds.</p>
<p>In case of big gashes/scratches clean them with water (or saline solution) and disinfect AROUND the wound, then apply gauze if you have any (try to avoid tissue paper if possible).</p></div>		</li>
