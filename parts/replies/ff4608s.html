<p>I had no idea it takes up to 10 minutes to disinfect surface and not actually achieveable using alcohol 70%. I thought soaking small medical equipments and disinfect surfaces could follow the same way. I learned somethig new today, thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that sucks about modern hospitals is that they can't get everything wet and everyone wants their hospital to look like a home. Vets have lower transmission rates because they can literally take a power washer with foaming disinfectants (the best kind) and soak EVERYTHING. Let it dry for an HOUR and then rinse everything off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, best comment in tread. </p>
<p>Can confirm, part of my job is to validate disinfectant to make sure it is usable on specific surface against specific type of bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha! It's such a great description of my job.</p>
<p>Generally my job consist of making sure that everything related to bacteria, yeast and mold is respected within a product. So we look for certain pathogen, total count, test antimicrobial activity in product, test disinfectant. </p>
<p>Every time I feel unhappy with my job I remember myself that I save life by making sure that nobody gets sick because of microorganisms in product. But that I sadly do this &quot;in the shadow&quot; since nobody really thinks that we make these tests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you feel about peroxides? </p>
<p>My industry often uses Optim 33TB from Scican, mostly for OPIM on hard surfaces. </p>
<p>Our main concerns are toxicity to the user (both in contact and aresol) and contact time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never tested peroxide alone only combined with acids, your product is only 0.5% peroxide. The clients we have are pharmaceutical industries so they need really strong disinfectant. </p>
<p>So I cannot tell for sure (disinfectant studies can takes weeks and depend on the surface) but peroxide is a good intermediate disinfectant that act fast. CDC tell it start to act in a minute and that it needs 15 minute of exposure time to get rid of 10^8 bacteria or 30-60 minute for certain type. It won't kill spore at this concentration. </p>
<p><strong>Your important part</strong>; your surface will be sanitized (safe for use, 99.9% of bacteria inert) in less than a minute.</p>
<p>For safety, it's perfectly safe, peroxide at this concentration require no protection from the user. Even if you accidentally take a sip there's no action to take. Here is the <a href="https://www.scican.com/media/cleaners-disinfectants/optim_33_tb__cdn__ghs.pdf" target="_blank">safety sheet</a>. </p>
<p>What do you mean by OPIM?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bactericide would be another example.
Alcohol does a good jog on germs but not so good on spores.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's more of the other way around. As seen in my other comment: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Germicide is only the term to say it kills microorganisms. Disinfectant is the term used for a substance you use to kill microorganisms on a surface.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So all disinfectant are germicide but all germicide are not disinfectant.</p>
<p>Because a antiseptic would be a germicide but not a disinfectant for example. </p>
<p>Also bactericide is a term to say it kill bacteria, either on the body as an antiseptic, on a surface as disinfectant, ect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alcohol does a good jog on <del>germs</del> vegetative cell  but not so good on spores.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to be nitpicking but germs does not really mean anything its more of a synonyms to microorganism.</p></div>		</li>
