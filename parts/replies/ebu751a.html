			<div class="markdown"><p>Many deep sea creatures actually will come to the surface at night/day. Certain shrimp, for instance, will spend days deep in the water column and then come up at night to feed on plankton and algae.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fish will also follow the Shrimp up from deeper water to shallow water at night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not entirely sure about this answer, but they potentially would still be exposed to a solar cycle as the ocean still undergoes certain patterns throughout a day. </p>
<p>E.g., plankton will fall at certain times of the day in higher quantities, currents of warmer/colder water, certain vegetation may bloom at a higher level and the pollen could fall down to another stage of the ocean floor, or any other number of unforeseen oceany circumstances. </p>
<p>Also, because we’re tidally locked and what not the organisms in the deep sea may have some way of incorporating that into their cycles</p>
<p>Edit: sorry I meant cyclical tides because of the moon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, sand fleas (a crustacean that lives on the ocean floor) are usually only active at night.  If you leave a longline on the bottom into the nighttime hours in areas where sand fleas are present, they will attack the hooked fish.  During the day they aren't a problem at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060216" target="_blank">review</a>, which is open access, examined several cases of animals that have been claimed not to sleep or to not have a sleep-like state, including some amphibians, fish, birds, and insects. The authors conclude in all cases that there is no clear evidence of a species that does not sleep.</p>
<p>Like the original question, the answer to this will come down to how far you are willing to stretch the definition of a &quot;sleep-like state&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
