			<div class="markdown"><p>But that &quot;movement&quot; is not movement in the sense of the velocity of an object. Velocity is change in distance over time, but &quot;distance&quot; has several meanings when you're at cosmological scale, and the one you're talking about when you describe the size of the Universe that way is <em>not</em> the kind of distance you use when measuring the speed of an object.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Entropy is lowering, the universe is expanding, and all the top Minds including Hawking himself assert that the universe is simply going to expand infinitely until entropy reaches maximum dissipation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, and I would never say that. What I do know is that all the major astrophysicists and theoretical physicists believe the world is going to continue expanding infinitely. Why do you suggest otherwise? What do you know that I don't? I would love you to educate me if there was anything to be educated on</p></div>		</li>
