			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazon as a company has a goal of like 10% employee turnover every year.  But sometimes one department in a location is expected to take it on the chin and get 15 or 20% turnover to protect a different department.</p>
<p>I have a lot of coworkers from AWS,(and worked there briefly as a tech too) and they were frequently asked to sacrifice workers from Ops because RH was understaffed.  Or an individual building had to sacrifice to protect another one (with a more popular manager).  Following year, the manager who had to lose 40% of his workforce gets a bad review because his building:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Went overbudget on overtime. (They didn't have enough workers to keep the building staffed otherwise.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had too many outages. (Not enough people to do the day-to-day and do rounds to find issues.)</p>
</li>
<li>Outages that weren't resolved fast enough. (Not enough workers to do all tasks to support a casualty.  Especially when they're all half-trained.  During my brief time there I was literally required to choose between a rack level outage and a lost of cooling to an entire data center.)</li>
</ol>
<p>That sets off a chain reaction where senior management are taking super-close looks at his building and its paperwork.  Usually results in the manager and lead engineer(s) getting fired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And a union doesn't necessarily have to be just for those amazon workers. Where I live unions are a fact of life and they usually cover an entire branch of work.
So you have some that focus on IT workers, industrial workers, office workers etc.
So a company makes and agreement with these giant unions to ensure that they can find workers.
It has basically meant that a lot of the regulations on work are left to employers and unions to decide, not the state. We don't have a minimum wage for example, as unions take care of that.</p></div>		</li>
