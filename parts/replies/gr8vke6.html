			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat death of the universe is not broadly accepted as the consensus in cosmology, there are a few competing theories. I don't think it's helpful to suggest that this is a settled matter. Moreover the heat death theory doesn't suggest that time will &quot;stop&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is definitely a valid interpretation, but a strict relativistic interpretation that pegs time as a literal dimension is just as valid, at least at the moment. Both are useful models that provide predictive power. I tend to prefer the dimensional interpretation simply because it's more intuitive for me to wrap my head around and is very beautiful to me.</p></div>		</li>
