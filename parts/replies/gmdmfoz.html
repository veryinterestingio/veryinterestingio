			<div class="markdown"><p>If you refer to &quot;natural death&quot; as death by old age and it's related diseases, then yes, it's very rare for people to see those in the wild. The vast majority of deaths in the wild are due to predation and natural disasters. As the saying goes, life is nasty, brutish, and short.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume the primary means of corpse disposal are being eaten by a predator, being eaten by a scavenger or decomposition, then the more uncommon situation where the corpse is preserved. This would dovetail with what we see in the fossil record.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm disappointed in the lack of info on death response to an animal that was killed. Surely there are seperate behaviours for such events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant it how the article does, meaning death in nature as opposed to in captivity. It's much easier for humans to witness deaths of animals in zoos, preserves, studies, etc., but that might not be an accurate representation of what they do in the wild.</p></div>		</li>
