			<div class="markdown"><p>i found your post really informative and interesting. Given how unlikely it is that there is any calculated intentionality to what viruses are doing, I'm curious, how you feel about rephrasing, &quot;rabies virus targeted&quot; with something more neutral like, &quot;rabies virus ended up utilizing&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see your point thought I think targeting is a fairly common phrase used in medical literature.</p>
<p>The phrase target does not imply intent rather it denotes evolutionary selection on the organism to rely on this specific receptor for entry into the cell.</p>
<p>To sort of show the common use of this phrase a few examples &quot;target receptor&quot; or &quot;biological target&quot;. Even when used for things that are a step below even a virus like hormones which still target specific receptors.</p>
<p>&quot;Human and avian influenza viruses target different cells&quot; or &quot;CD4 cells are the main HIV target&quot;. As a few more examples. Again I see your point in that it might be misconstrued to imply intent, but that's not the meaning behind the use of target.</p>
<p>A virus targets something solely because a virus, through evolutionary pressure of requiring entry into a cell to start reproduction, needs to evolve a molecule on it's surface that will allow it this entry. So a virus can still be said to target a receptor despite not even technically being alive by the most common held definitions because it is under evolutionary pressure to break into a cell or stop existing.</p>
<p>Happy to hear your counter to this though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is a simple single strand RNA virus with it's own ribosome. Meaning that all it needs to replicate is access to a cell. It can then just pluck amino-acids out of the cytoplasm and replicate itself.</p>

<p>Do you have a source to back this up? I tried doing some research, and I couldn't find anything saying rabies has its own ribosome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope sorry I messed up. Thank you for fact checking. </p>
<p>I meant Polymerase. I mixed the two up and will correct the original post!</p></div>		</li>
