			<div class="markdown"><p>Me, too. I get a really bad headache when I get them, too. I wouldn't call it a migraine because those sound terrible, but it's a bad headache still. I know as soon as my vision starts acting like I stared at a light bulb it's best to go find a comfortable quiet place to close my eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get mild pain from it, but I also pop a couple excedrin (sp) migraine pills and go lie down in a dark room for about 30 mins as soon as I can. Usually if I catch early enough it will go away pretty fast, though the next few days I’ll get pressure and pain when I do shit like bend over. I know I’m lucky as others get way worse migraines, but they still suck ass.</p></div>		</li>
