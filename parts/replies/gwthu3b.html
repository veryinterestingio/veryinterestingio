			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a very old scam. You write a letter to your dean/rectorate/whatever asking for funding to organise a field trip to <foreign country> because you strongly believe that studying that one thing at the source will greatly help your scientific efforts. You get your institution to fund a 5-day field trip, where you spend one afternoon doing the actual work and the remaining 4 days enjoying your free vacation.</p></div>		</li>
