We're designed to consider certain things cute, and not just appearance - that lovely bumbly movement that kittens have and the relentless energy of puppies IS SO CLOSE to how my infant behaves I find both things EVEN CUTER now. Not to mention they're all slightly dumb in a creatively intelligent way - so they don't feel like much of a threat.</p></div>		</li>
