			<div class="markdown"><p>MD here. Yes. Bleeding from veins looks very different than bleeding from arteries. Venous blood looks dark and doesnâ€™t get oxygenated and turn bright red the way arterial blood looks simply by being exposed to room air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your blood doesn't actually turn blue when it's low oxygen, but as the other person who answered the question mentioned, it is a darker red, so there is a color change as well. for reference, next time a nurse draws blood snap a picture of the tube and then compare it when you cut yourself. Oxygenated blood is lighter in color by a bit. That, and not having the light scattering tissue over it are the difference. i do like the other answer a lot due to it's high level of detail. There's medical knowledge there, I think.</p></div>		</li>
