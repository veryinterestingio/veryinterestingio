<p>And finally, most sporting events can be fully enjoyed without announcers. It's akin to watching a game in person live, and it's the preferred way for a lot of people to take in the action. For on-field announcements, modern television graphics handle most all of the information not immediately obvious to someone watching.</p>

<p>An interesting thing I experienced when I went to my first MLB game.  No announcements or commentary in the park.  TV and movies make it seem like they pipe the commentary into the stands, but nothing.  It was a weird reality check.</p>
<p>Then another time I went, I was in luxury room that was fully glassed in and you couldn't hear anything, so they piped in sports radio covering the game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you really want to blow your mind, listen to the radio announcers for a game, then listen (without video) to the TV announcers. You'll quickly see just how much difference there is between each style of broadcast, and just how much TV relies on instant replay to keep the flow of the show moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think #2 is very important, in that it's a task that would take time, effort and training for the staff to actually get the captions on, for little benefit, or actual disadvantage as shown in your other points.  </p>
<p>If you need to work to probably make something worse, or you can leave it alone and it's fine, probably just leave it alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Source: guys who’s worked at a lot of bars</p>
<p>Sometimes we don’t have a choice on the floor. Some bars are only changeable from a main station in the back, or by a manager. Others are preset. Sometimes this is because a bar is so busy and you get one guy who wants a really obscure game or sport that no one else wants (or wants you to look for a game that you can’t even play due to local restrictions or programming) or there are competing groups asking for different games, and meanwhile the bartenders time is being wasted when he needs to be making a fuckton of drinks.</p></div>		</li>
