			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this answer gets a lot closer to the root of the answer. Certainly a lot closer than the people saying, &quot;we don't.&quot; Or, almost as bad, Mr. so-and-so made it that way. That's all true, I guess, but it's truth without depth.</p>
<p>Threes and sevens are important to humans. Sevens seem to be important because we can remember seven things, but not eight. <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/fashion/sundaystyles/12three.html" target="_blank">Here's</a> a neat article from the <em>New York Times</em> about three. I don't think anyone really gets why three is important for us, but it is.</p>
<p>If you have a moment to amuse yourself, read one of Kennedy's speeches and find all the ways he threads three through them. Here's an excerpt of one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?</p>
<p>We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the moon! We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win.</p>
