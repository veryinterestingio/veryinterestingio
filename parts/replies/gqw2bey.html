			<div class="markdown"><p>No kidding. Its crazy how big some families were. I decided to look up some of my ancestors when they immigrated to the US back in the mid 1800's. One of them had 14 children. I can't even comprehend having that much offspring. All I want is one kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>14 kids is NUT. Assuming no twins, that’s literally 10 years of continued pregnancy. It’s entirely likely there was at some point one kid that only really remembered her mother pregnant for 10 years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a definite factor for my family.  My parents were both the children of rural farmers in the Appalachian foothills of Georgia.  My mother was one of seven children and my father was one of eleven.  They described their childhood days as full of work, clearing rocks from fields, milking cows, toting water, etc.</p></div>		</li>
