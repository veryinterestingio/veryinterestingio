			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats how you dont pop. the air in your lungs expands larger than your lungs and they &quot;pop&quot; so to speak. </p>
<p>Bends has to do with dissolved gas in your blood. The deeper you go, the more gas you can dissolve in your blood. Come up slowly and the gas comes out of your blood in your lungs. Come up quickly and it comes out of your blood everywhere placing bubbles in your joints or maybe even causing you to stroke out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take a huge breath and hold it as long as you can, most of the air is still going to be in your lungs, especially the nitrogen which makes up about 78% of the air around you. If you were a whale and dove deep, much more of the air would get dissolved into your bloodstream and other tissues, including much of the nitrogen.</p>
<p>Surfacing slowly will allow the air to come out of solution slowly. You will get itsy bitsy bubbles inside you but they will be carried back to your lungs by the bloodstream with no problem. But surfacing quickly will cause the air to come out of solution quickly, which of course makes bigger bubbles. The bigger bubbles are the problem. The bloodstream can no longer deal with them and they can destroy all kinds of tissues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true for humans.  Free divers never get the bends.  However, it appears that deep diving mammals seem to exhale before going down, while shallow divers inhale.  This suggests the bends is an issue for marine mammals.  The duration they spend at depth and the speed with which they need to ascend may make the bends an issue no matter what.</p></div>		</li>
