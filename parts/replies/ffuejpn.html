			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert but with math I picked up everything seamlessly until about algebra and I remember all the kids who just didn't get it.  I've always thought that instead of assigning homework and spending all class describing math problems and asking who wants to try and solve something on the board the teacher would've accomplished way more spending time with each student individually.</p>
<p>The kids who got homework wrong obviously got a bunch of it wrong and all they did was spend 15-30 minutes screwing up that fresh learning foundation.  There's a thought process with every kind of math that isn't always easy to develop but it can be even harder to break through bad habits and simple misunderstandings once they've had a chance to develop instead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same with me. </p>
<p>Problem was, when the math got hard i had zero ability to persevere* and work through it, while classmates who have always had to work at it steamed on through all the same.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You didn't understand a certain concept properly? Too bad, we're moving on to the next thing. Then it builds up and you are in year 10 and still struggling with year 8 work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I teach it to seniors who are bad at it (or have learning disabilities). If I’m going person to person, no doubt a handful will take out their phones and just check-out; I would love to go around after the lecture and see if each kid is getting it, but they themselves make it so I can’t to it; I’ve had short response questions on tests, but I recently added them to the lecture notes and that’s helped a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, if a student has already grasped the material, the homework won't do them much good, because they already understand it. And if a student <em>hasn't</em> learned the material, it's also not going to do them much good, because there's nobody there to show them how to do it right, so they just sit there reinforcing the wrong way to do things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: To add on, technically I could attempt to bring it up to high ranked people with the little time that I do have at my school but by the time anything would be put into place I would be long gone and gain no benefit and a ton of lost time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I just learned to strategize tests in high school, master the easy shit and completely ignore the harder stuff. I wouldnt touch complex word problems in math. Fast forward to upper level college business classes and every problem on a finance exam is a complex word problem. Worst time of my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. Sometimes there are concepts that students just need to repeat 20 times until they get it, but those are usually small things. I did a homework like that once to reach a student that sqrt(x) <em> sqrt(x) = x (where x is positive, blah blah blah). That student got a dozen problems of sqrt(7) </em> sqrt(7) = ? so they could see that it would always work, then take the shortcut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, there are plenty of instances were practice and constant exposure made a huge difference. Best example to me was U-substitution in calculus. Teacher would teach it but you wouldn't exactly know which is the best part to substitute unless you had a lot of practice. Teachers can do their best to teach something but in the end, it always falls into the individual to do their part as well.</p></div>		</li>
