			<div class="markdown"><p>Arteries, not veins. Venous pressure is unnoticeable.</p>
<p>It's not about injury. It's about focus. Lay your finger on the desk and focus on what you feel on your fingertip. You now can measure your pulse by just feeling it. It's about brain stopping signal inhibition that naturally occurs. </p>
<p>Also, afaik, there aren't pathways that connect nerve endings on vasculature to cerebral cortex. What you feel is probably mechanoreceptors(pressure), and not nocireceptors (pain). There are different pathways and stimuli for each.</p></div>		</li>
