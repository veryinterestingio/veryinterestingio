			<div class="markdown"><p>Long covid is just a term for the side effects of residual damage from the virus and resulting inflammation. This could be damage to the lining around the heart, lung damage that reduces lung capacity, neurological damage, or damage from blood clots. In extreme cases, people have even had limbs amputated. </p>
<p>Long term damage from a illness is not a new phenomenon. People have gone deaf from Measles and lost kidneys due to strep infections. Covid-19 is just another virus. Considering that the vaccine prevents most illness and even more severe illness, it definitely reduces the odds of developing &quot;long covid&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The first paper looking 2 weeks after hospitalization in Italy shows 5-50% depending on the symptoms, with the most common ones being fatigue and dyspnea (shortness of breath). Similarly, the second paper also tracks people who were hospitalized in the UK and found 74% for any symptoms, though again most frequent ones are also fatigue and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Since vaccines lead to milder infections, I think it's fair to assume that the damage done would also be in the less severe category. I believe the study done in Israel showed there was zero severe cases on the vaccinated population?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>38 cases ended up hospitalized, out of only 531 who contracted the disease. Thus about 7% of those who still got Covid, in spite of being vaccinated, ended up in the hospital. Symptoms ranged from &quot;moderate to critical&quot;. 3 of them died. This was all in the &quot;over 60s&quot; category. And it was out of 750k vaccinated. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's unfortunate. It's a good thing you don't need your appendix. I just pushed back at all the mysticism that goes around this. Everyone who's uneducated in disease likes to treat this one as though it's some mystical new phenomenon. Nothing about it is new. It's primarily a respiratory disease. Like the flu. It's asymptomatic and some and quite symptomatic and others. Like polio. It's extremely contagious, like Measles. Unlike SARS, people are at peak infectiousness right before they show symptoms. (With SARS, it was 10 days after) It can do long-term damage in some people. Like many other diseases. There is literally nothing about it that is unique to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is extremely disingenuous. While we haven't specifically studied the vaccines in relation to some longer term impacts of COVID, we know that the vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic infection, which is a necessary prerequisite for &quot;long COVID&quot; so in turn the vaccines must be effective against it.</p>
<p>I'm actually very annoyed this is the top comment, it's got a strong agenda.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah lately there's been too much defaulting to &quot;we don't have a perfect 20 year study of x so we know nothing&quot;, rather than &quot;based on our limited, imperfect information and tons of knowledge of similar viruses, it's reasonable to assume y for the purposes of decision-making&quot;.</p>
<p>In this case we know the vaccines are reducing the severity of the cases that do happen dramatically, so why wouldn't you at least start out by assuming they're likely to reduce the risk of long covid?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I understand the caution from researchers, but policy makers need to be willing to make some inferences based on the data we have. The data we have tells us that it's very likely that vaccines significantly reduce longer term impacts of COVID.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In respect to OPs two questions, I stand by my answer. No agenda. We’re talking about the effect of vaccines which have only been in use for a short time, we can’t possibly know for sure what impact they’re going to have on a long term symptom. We definitely can’t predict the comparative level of protection across multiple vaccines. </p>
<p>You’re right though, maybe I should have been clearer on the likely outcome. </p>
<p>We can make some pretty strong guesses that if the vaccine stops you from getting seriously ill it will also stop you getting long Covid. I think that’s likely, but it’s not guaranteed. </p>
<p>There have also been some reports of people who had very mild cases of Covid getting worse long term symptoms. It’s clearly a very complex picture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vaccine doesn't just stop you from getting seriously ill, they're 95% effective at preventing symptomatic illness altogether. </p>
<p>You can't have long term symptoms if you don't get symptoms at all. That's why your post is so disingenuous.</p></div>		</li>
