			<div class="markdown"><p>China declares 7 Yuan is worth 1 USD. To enforce that means the Chinese government is willing to pay 7 Yuan to anyone who brings them 1 USD, and 1 USD to anyone who brings them 7 Yuan. (minus a small 'transaction fee', usually)</p>
<p>That means China can print Yuans without reducing its value, and get USD in exchange for the Yuans they print. A net gain for the government.</p>
<p>The bet they're making is that more people want to convert their USD to Yuan than vice versa. Limited imports, sweatshop-salaries and an internal Yuan-only policy makes sure the Yuan that goes in to the country stays in the country - most people that end up with the Yuans don't have the means to use them if they were to convert them to USD, so they don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry this is not correct.  China actually buys dollars to devalue it against the USD.   It does so primary via exports and purchasing US debt, and in so doing reducing the USD money supply while increasing RMB (hence, devaluation).    You're making the same basic misunderstanding that the current--and extremely misinformed--top comment is making, which is to confuse depreciation via printing of currency with devaluation.   That is NOT what China is doing here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both the IMF and WTO set out strict language when it comes to currency manipulation but in the end they lack enforcement... In the end, Sovereign Nations can do as they please to be honest - not saying there won't be consequences (i.e. retaliatory actions) but in terms of &quot;legality&quot; China's not really beholden to any governing body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly it benefits other nations in a sense.</p>
<p>Remember, having a high exchange rate is the desirable end game. It means you don't have to work as much to enjoy the labour of others'. That your people spend a little bit of time, and get a lot of foreign stuff for it.</p>
<p>When viewed this way, it is obvious that exports are a real cost to a nation, and imports a real gain - just look at the flow of goods, and consider that poor nations have low valued currencies.</p>
<p>The only reason one would fight against this is if you're (a) concerned that strategically China is doing this to end up beating you at the exchange rate game, with a more valuable currency than yours (eg via importing &quot;knowledge&quot; via all that offshoring), or (b) you're wanting to make your exporters work for the sake of having something to do.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't mind so much. As long as they're not making a mess of markets by throwing their currency around with great volatility, just consider that they want to sell more stuff than they buy in return as something we can benefit from.</p></div>		</li>
