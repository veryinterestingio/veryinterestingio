			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a an interesting viewpoint supporting an evolutionary advantage, however my ancestors must have gone through some shit cause I'm still awake at 5 am.  My dad also has trouble going to sleep, so it's pretty much genetic.  He'll just lay in bed and he approaching his 60s now.</p>
<p>It just seems like our natural sleep schedules are both around lunch to 3 am, and we've never really lived together.  We both get up for our jobs, but anytime I'd visit for holidays, he sleep schedule would slip forward 3-4 hours after a couple days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also exacerbated by our relative lack of daylight. Even a house that looks bright inside is 5 - 20x darker than a bright day outside.</p>
<p>Light resets our body clock (which for most people isn't exactly 24 hours). So if like me, you're a natural night owl, <em>and</em> have a body clock that's longer (e.g. 24.5 - 25 hours long), no routine + a lack of daylight = your sleep/wake time gradually getting later every day.</p>
<p>Edit: spelling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anybody's clock is 24 hours. Hence why it's called circadian rhythm (from latin circa dies, meaning approximately a day)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine must be for sure longer than 24 hours. I've done a complete circle in my sleep schedule. Since quarantine started, I've gotten up at 6am, stayed up later and later every day without trying (wake up at noon, then afternoon, then night), and started waking up at 6am again. I'm about a quarter way around the next trip. ðŸ˜´</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetics and even childhood history can be fun. I was looking at my early childhood medical book (ie baby and toddler checks until 5 years) and some things stood out for me as very similar to me today:</p>
<p>*I had asthma, colds and allergies/eczema </p>
<ul>
<li>I was not a good sleeper. Stopped having an afternoon nap before a year old and went to sleep late. Took ages getting to sleep and was restless but then once asleep, slept for hours. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is me exactly, 40 years later.</p>
<p>I still got places into my bassinet/cot for a rest I might add. I might not have needed the break but my mum sure as hell did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From age 13-20 I was told by every doctor that my constant exhaustion was caused by depression, and nobody would listen when I suggested that maybe constant exhaustion was <em>contributing</em> to my depression. Then at 20 I got a sleep study done and <em>surprise!</em> it turns out I have a disorder where my brain doesn't go all the way to sleep at night and sleeping pills + stimulants fix it right up. </p>
<p>After that it was all &quot;well of course, even your childhood medical records suggest that.&quot; Thanks guys. Real helpful. I'd like my teenage years back, please.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Myself, my brothers and my Dad (not sure if anyone else in our family did this) all fairly regularly wake for 1-2 hours in the night around 2-3am. We all live apart now but itâ€™s funny at family gatherings when us lot are up eating cereal and chatting in the early hours.</p>
<p>This pattern can get disrupted if, for example, weâ€™re getting less sleep, but just now in lockdown Iâ€™m most definitely falling back into this preferred method of sleep/wake.</p></div>		</li>
