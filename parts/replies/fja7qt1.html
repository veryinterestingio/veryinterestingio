			<div class="markdown"><p>30 seconds is usually the limit with standard DSLR cameras and consumer lenses. Longer lenses have an even shorter limit before the star streaks become too noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The general rule of thumb being t=500/f, where f is the focal length and t is time in seconds.</p>
<p>For a 35mm focal length lens, that gives 500/35 ~ 15 seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are conflating two things. First exposure time on DSLR cameras is 30 seconds you can increase it with remote controller, but that has nothing to do with lenses. Second if you shoot without tracking mount then you have to take into account exposure time and lens focal length otherwise you get star trails. To avoid that you apply 500 rule it's 500/by focal length = ideal exposure time you might also account crop factor if your camera sensor is not full frame. If you use tracking mount then you can go increase exposure time as long as you want, but there are problems with that, occasional clouds, iridium flare, planes etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is fairly costly. a good camera/telescope, servo controlled mount for that, some sort of controller for the servo to automate it's movement, etc. Then you need software to render the whole thing, which could be easily done with gimp, but there may be more mainstream ways of doing it without shopping the images together.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, that's about what the &quot;Mainstream&quot; software does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to be expensive. I have a comment a bit farther down with my previous kit. Maybe 300-400 depending on the deals you get on the lens and body (used is a great option for lenses, they don't reply 'go bad' as long as there aren't any scratches or something like that)</p></div>		</li>
