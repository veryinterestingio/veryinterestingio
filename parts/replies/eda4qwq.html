			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole thing is dumb to me. Why do we go around with the idea in our heads that Greek Mythology is an interesting bunch of stories that are essentially make believe, while at the same time touting our own religions as a real thing? It's not like they are wildly different. </p>
<p>It's just as you said, a collection of stories to make sense of everything. I would go to a church and ask a pastor this question to get some insight on their perspective, but most pastors I have seen just throw a straw man to any potential atheist inquiry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience the worth of the conversation is not just on the party your are asking, but your intent.
Keep in mind that religious figures  are very often the target of &quot;trolls&quot; and individuals looking only for either an argument or to prove their own superiority. As a result they become pretty adept at sniffing put those that are there for growth or understanding and those that just want to &quot;fight &quot;.
I'm not saying that's what you are doing, but if you make it clear you are asking this because you genuinely want an answer or at least a different perspective you will likely get a different response than if you approach with what amounts to an attack. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. As an atheist I've met some seriously philosophical religious people. They are great, and in my opinion usually good/social humans. Trouble is all those who believe unconditionally, in whatever they believe</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gives purpose to life. Non religious people have other purposes for their life, but we need a purpose in life.</p>
<p>Be it worshipping sometbing/someone, worshipping a concept (progress, humankind)</p>
<p>We need that drive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree they are similar and both serve to provide meaning and order to world around us but I disagree that one is archaic and one is civilized. I would argue that’s it’s a matter of whether or not you belong to the religion/culture. If you don’t it’s just mythology and stories. If you do belong it’s more than just a story or myth, it’s a fact if the world </p></div>		</li>
