<p>Why doesn't CO2 make seltzer taste bad?</p>
<p>I think something else makes water taste bad when it sits out. Most tap water is quite cold and cold water dissolves gas more easily and when it warms up and sits, dissolved gas (N2, O2, CO2) all percolate out and make the water taste bland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A matter of opinion, of course. I like seltzer.
&quot;Flat&quot; water that's lost its disolved oxygen (either from distillation or standing) tastes insipid to me. It can be made more palatable by shaking. Contrarywise, tap water, which I avoid, tastes better from standing until it loses some chlorine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you mention it, that is a good question. Just remember reading it somewhere.</p>
<p>My guess would be that the carbonic acid reacts with other impurities in the water, such as other gasses getting dissolved into it over time. But carbonic acid also do add a very specific taste to carbonated drinks, which is something soft drink producers make use of. Maybe we are used to the taste in bubbly drinks, but not in flat regular tap water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that water tastes different, or dusty as some people describe it, after being left out is due to the loss of gas dissolved in it.  Cold liquids dissolve gas better and once the water is left open to air for an extended period of time and has equilibrated is likely less dissolved gasses overall.  There are also aerators on faucets that help dissolve gas into the water initially.  So I think u/mckulty is correct.  I had read an article about this a few years ago, I'll see if I can find a decent source.</p>
<p>Edit: I haven't been able to find any real scientific sources but most &quot;news&quot; articles seem to be referencing <a href="https://www.wimp.com/heres-why-your-water-tastes-weird-when-you-leave-it-out-overnight/" target="_blank">this</a> video by discovery news and agree with you u/rhn18.  I just find this somewhat hard to believe because I would be under the impression that when the water was cold initially there would me more carbon dioxide dissolved in the water than there would be when it's warm.  I guess I'll have to go with your explanation until I find out differently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The answer is that it does... seltzer tastes sour/bitter. The German for it translates to &quot;sour sparkling water&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold water also reduces the taste of the water itself so when a glass of water is colder you taste less of what’s in it than you do when it’s at room temp. </p>
<p>The salinity of your saliva also affects how water tastes. If your saliva is more or less salty the glass of water can change flavor drastically.</p></div>		</li>
