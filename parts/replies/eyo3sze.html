<p>And yes, less dependency on lactate, but current thinking is that lactate is a friend (and food) of the muscles as they use it as an energy source. The problem lies in the fact that hydrogen ions are released which are acidic, and that is what caused the ‘burn’.</p></div>		</li>

<p>True, and a persons ability to either tolerate the pain, or their bodies ability to clear lactate is what can separate the average from world class. Supposedly Michael Phelps can clear it really well so he never gets to a level that is painful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Explain to me how anaerobic uses more atp when people who are respiring this way are more fatigued</p>
<p>Genuine curiosity</p></div>		</li>
