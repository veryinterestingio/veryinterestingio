			<div class="markdown"><p>I love phage therapy (there's a great book about it called The Perfect Predator). My concern is with the economics of it. There was a front-page story in May about phage therapy curing a 15-year-old girl from England who had an infection with M. abscessus. She was treated with a cocktail of three phages. Sounds great! But it's gonna cost a billion dollars (or more) to determine if it's safe and effective for all patients with this condition. It's ultimately a narrow spectrum treatment and I'm not convinced Big Pharma will take it on. May the federal government should.</p></div>		</li>
