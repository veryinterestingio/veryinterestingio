			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I’ve seen they just leave them if they have died “naturally.”  It’s actually not that uncommon to find primate parts when working in the forest.  Working at several sites, I’ve found bones or bodies of baboons, ring-tailed lemurs, sifaka, lepilemurs and vervets over the years. </p>
<p>I’ve heard that chimps will sometimes eat dead infants in cases of infanticide, but I’m not a chimp person so take that with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some cases, animals will eat the dead to prevent the body from attracting predators. I have no idea if chimps do this. It does seem logical that there would be some instinct to get the body away from the nest/pack.</p></div>		</li>
