			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, a liver damaged by too much alcoholconsumption has been growing back cells over and over again causing too many transcription flaws.</p>
<p>While when it's cut off for transplantation it theoretically only grows back once with only a minimal amount of flaws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is ONE factor. Everything you consume is a factor. If you regularly do something your particular liver doesn’t like then it will yield different results. Will your liver look like an alcoholic after you drink a trumps worth of Diet Coke, likely not unless you coupled it with something else, and that still doesn’t qualify or disqualify you for donation. If your ultimate goal is to be a liver donor, there is a good chance if you try and be healthy that your liver will be selected but maybe it won’t, and that’s ok.</p></div>		</li>
