<p>Why? It’s not driven by consumer demand. The goal is to force competitors to also spend huge amounts on R&amp;D (hopefully money they don’t have) or risk falling a generation of chip design behind.</p>

<p>I don't get. You describe competition. And competition is also defined by the consumer. If performance is not consumer demand then no company would spend money for this research topic. </p>
<p>But thanks for the link.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If it is, then there is an aim to keep the entrance in the market very difficult, and one may be the spending in R&amp;D, getting away with competition</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They exactly spend on this topic because although demand isn’t driven by performance (in other words, consumers are generally satisfied with current performance levels), when people <em>do</em> want to upgrade they will choose a supplier who is ahead technologically. </p>
<p>Apple did much the same thing with the iPad. They poured so much into R&amp;D for the chipset that any challenger would have to spend billions to make a comparable device. Instead the competition used mobile phone CPUs which could not compete directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, what? iPads use the same chips as iPhones. Did you mean to say that Apple spent that money designing their own SoCs for both iPhone and iPad and competitors just used off the shelf stuff?</p>
<p>And yes, not every specific iteration of their SoC is used on both but there is overlap.</p></div>		</li>
