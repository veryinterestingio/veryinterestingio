			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is closest to the best answer. While confirmation bias plays a role, we can reflect on our regular lives and see tons of instances of this negative survival bias influencing us.</p>
<p>A positive feedback translates to status quo for survival &quot;yep, you're still alive, keep going&quot; while a negative one means something needs to be fixed to to back to status quo and survive, making it seem at times life threatening (like being rejected by a potential partner) when it's just a part of our survival skills ultimately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Negativity bias is in fact game theory. In game theory, every player will try to loose as little as possible. Gaining is also important, but not loosing is the most important factor. Evolution taught as that this strategy has the best survival rate. It's not the best in every situation, but in a majority of situations. A tribal war, if won, may yeld spoils of war, but if lost, you die. But there are many wars to win and you only die once, so 50/50 ain't gonna cut it. I think this and confirmation bias are totally different mechanisms that both come into play into this particular situation of expending resources to try and aquire something that may or may not yeld resources in the future. This actually proves that they are not random, that our brains decided to pass this decision through not one, but 2 defense mechanisms. And our brains are even now fine tuning those mechanisms for maximum yeld with discussions exactly like this one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard people explain this concept for ELI5:
Our ancestors living in the plains Africa-or wherever-survived because they learned to be on guard for threats like lions, tigers, and bears (oh my!).  The ones that weren't focused on the dangers, like admiring a beautiful sunset instead of scanning for those lions, tended not to make it and pass down their genes.<br />
So we survived and evolved by focusing on negative things that could threaten us-like in this case a negative review even when there may be many more positive ones.</p></div>		</li>
