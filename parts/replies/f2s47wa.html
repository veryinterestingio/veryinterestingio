			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, while normal white LED bulbs use white phosphor and thus have a full range of color when you break it up through a prism, the LED bulbs that let you change the color of the bulb to red or blue etc, actually are a bunch of red, green and blue LEDs next to each other that make white light by having all three on at once. </p>
<p>So with those type of bulb you would get three very distinct color bands, and they also have a pretty bad color rendering index (CRI).</p>
<p>edit: it turns out RGB bulbs are now RGBW and include white LEDs so this isn't true anymore, but leaving it up for the discussion about CRI.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most color mixing lights have very high CRI ratings, that's why color mixing is chosen.  They usually do not use pure red, green and blue LEDs for the reasons you stated.  Instead they are using technically white LEDs which have a red, green (or yellow), and blue hue.  This lets them have an extremely wide color gamut, without banding.</p>
<p>One of the lighting projects I'm working on actually uses 5 different color channels.  A deep blue, lighter blue, green, yellow, and red.  Besides the deep blue, all of the other LEDs are technically white LEDs, just with an emphasis on the particular color hue they are tuned for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I didn't realize the cheap color LEDs included white LEDs in them, but yeah looking at them they are all listed as RGBW bulbs and have ~80-85 CRI like normal white LED bulbs. Perhaps a long time ago they didn't have the white element in them and I never updated by brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would they have a bad CRI? LCD backlights that have wider gamut (higher CRI) intentionally use RGB LEDs. Arenâ€™t you getting that backwards? The lower CRI diodes are the ones with just a single color and a phosphor to emulate the other colors. This is why cheapo LCD monitors have that awful blue tint to their colors and tend to reproduce reds and yellows very badly, and why older or cheaper LED replacements for light bulbs will make your red shirt look brown indoors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>White light composed of a few narrow bands, like an RGB display, produces a much poorer CRI than a broad spectrum, even if the light itself looks the same to our eyes. That is because, with only 3 monochromatic bands, most of the absorption/reflection spectra of objects is lost when the light hits it. An object that reflects only a narrow band of yellow light would appear yellow under a phosphor LED, since the object is receiving some yellow light to reflect. However, such an object would appear much too dark under RGB LEDs, since no yellow light actually hits the object, only red and green, which get absorbed. Of course, in practice, few objects are monochromatic reflectors, and RGB LEDs aren't perfectly monochromatic emitters, so you usually won't get problems <em>quite</em> as severe as yellow objects appearing black - but colors will still look noticably off compared to broad-spectrum light.</p>
<p>Basically, the R+G+B = white trick only works on our eyes (and by extension a camera's detector chip, since they're loosely based on human vision). It does not work on arbitrary objects. You can see this in action <a href="https://youtu.be/uYbdx4I7STg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Direct and reflected light work a bit differently because direct light can trick the eye. The human eye has three nerve receptors that have response curves to R, G, and B wavelengths like <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cecilia77/graphics/a6/images/human_vision.png" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>A perfectly red (~620nm) LED and perfectly green (~500nm) LED  can trick the eye into seeing yellow (~580nm) by stimulating the R and G nerve at say, 80% each, even though no 580nm is emitted.</p>
<p>But if you have a hypothetically perfect yellow <em>object</em> that <em>only</em> reflects 580nm light and perfectly absorbs <em>all</em> other wavelengths, it would actually look <em>black</em> under that RGB light because the RGB light isn't emitting any light that the object reflects. Under 'white' light or sunlight it would reflect the 580nm light at 100%, which would in turn trigger the R nerve at 80% and the G nerve at 80% due to the nerve's response curve and appear yellow.</p>
<p>Even though the RGB light can make your eye see yellow when you look at the light itself, it can't make a yellow object reflect yellow light to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the emission gamut doesn't need to take into account the interaction with pigments, so, the light coming directly off the screen might look like the same &quot;white&quot; but the way it interacts with different colorful objects can be dismal by comparison with, say, the light off a nice hot piece of tungsten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If kept below the manufacturer recommended temperature (typically 80C or so), at least 50,000 hours before you lose 20% of the light output or have significant color shifting.  This is a limitation of the phosphor which generates the white light, not the LED itself. The actual diode junction itself can last indefinitely and can withstand extremely high temperatures if its made from silicone carbide.</p>
<p>It's pretty rare to actually encounter a failed LED that failed from old age.  Failing LEDs usually happen from over temperature, over current, manufacturing defects, or improper handling.  A good example of improper handling is having rubber bands in close proximity to LEDs.  Vapors from the rubber bands will attack the phosphors in the LEDs.  Moisture getting under the protective dome is an issue too.  When the LEDs get passed through a convection oven for soldering, they'll burst open.  But most of those problems occur at manufacturing and assembly, not after something has made it to the field.</p>
<p>The power electronics are the weak link, those will fail before the LED will die from old age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Driver or diodes will go before the phosphors vanish. Cheap or older LEDs didn't have it vanish but did have the phosphors performance change a bit over time. Which isn't that noticable on its own but if two lamps drifted differently or one was replaced you could see the colour shift.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are blue LEDs covered in phosphors that absorb some of the blue and emit the rest of the spectrum.</p>

<p>This is why there is a Nobel Prize for developing the blue LED, as it turns out, it wasn't just so that your PC could look like a gay unicorn vomited on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming blue LED's were harder to manufacture for a while? It seems like red ones have been around forever, green came later (even then it seems early green ones were more of a yellowish green and not the &quot;true&quot; green you see today) and blue seems relatively recent outside of monitors/screens.</p></div>		</li>
