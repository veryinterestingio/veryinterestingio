			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eötvös_effect" target="_blank">Eötvös effect</a>, and it was first measured experimentally around 1900.</p>
<p>Edit: Although it's measurable by scientific instruments, it's not nearly enough for you to &quot;feel&quot; noticeably heavier as a human body at any sensible speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something of a related phenomenon in rotating space habitats (like an Oneal Cylinder or a ring world like Halo) where if you move against the spin fast enough your apparent gravity drops to zero since you're not actually rotating anymore.</p>
<p>Moving with the spin will of course do the opposite; squishing you more into your seat or shoes or whatever.</p>
<p>And about centripetal vs centrifugal forces (you didn't ask but it was mentioned elsewhere):
In this scenario they are reversed from how they would be in OP's scenario. As you stand inside the spinning habitat centrifugal force is what feels like gravity to you; pushing you into the outer wall because your body wants to fly off in a line into space, but the structure is (hopefully) keeping you from doing that.</p>
<p>Centripetal force is what feels like the firm ground under your feet pushing up to support you, constantly accelerating you away from that tangent line 'up' towards the center of the habitat. Generally as you interact with surfaces in the habitat these forces will be equal and opposite in a way similar to normal gravity and surface force.</p>
<p>Uuuunless your habitat is small or spinning quickly, because there's a rabbit hole of weird things that make spin gravity behave oddly when you're not using Niven sized (HUEG) ring worlds. Or at least a couple km across if you want 1g.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The specific speed required for a stable orbit decreases the higher up you are, so it will be somewhat slower at the ISS's altitude compared to the earth's surface but the ISS is in a relatively low orbit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Centripetal means “centre seeking”; in the above scenario, gravity is the centripetal force - it pulls you towards the centre of the Earth. Centrifugal is the opposite, and it comes from the apparent motion away from the centre of the object. Centrifugal force is a fictitious force because really it’s all down to your inertia (tendency to travel in a straight line at a constant speed) whilst your frame of reference accelerates around you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further clarify from the others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centripetal force is not an independent thing.  It is a label we stick on some other real physical force, indicating the job it's doing.</li>
<li>Centrifugal force is an independent effect, but it's an &quot;apparent force&quot;.  It feels like you're experiencing the force (Also Coriolis and Euler forces) in a &quot;rotating reference frame&quot; -- when you look at the situation from the perspective of someone rotating.  If you back out and look at the situation from a non-rotating perspective, the force doesn't exist: it's just that things want to keep moving in a straight line.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't feel like either of those comments answered your question, so let me try.</p>
<p>Centripetal force is what keeps you moving in a circle. On a merry-go-round, it's the force of you holding the bars and pulling yourself inwards, hence applying a force towards the center of the circle to keep yourself moving around the center.</p>
<p>Centrifugal force is not a real force but a phenomenon due to an inertial body that is in angular (circular) motion. It feels like you're being pulled away from the merry-go-round, but really you just want to fly off tangentially to the circle. It's the force inward that makes the force outward apparent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please don't perpetuate the phrase &quot;centrifugal force is not a real force,&quot; it only serves to confuse people more. In the rotating frame of the merry-go-round, the force appears just as real as any other, and will manifest on a force diagram. The feeling people get of being thrown out of a turning vehicle isn't their imagination, as it sounds to them when we say it isn't &quot;real.&quot; </p>
<p>Instead, maybe say that centrifugal force isn't Newtonian, or say that it is a result of their frame (e.g. their car) rotating. Like, you aren't wrong to say that it isn't real... it just isn't helping to reduce confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question, the ISS is approximately 400 km and the people are in a near weightless environment, however, at an altitude of 2600 km gravity is halved. </p>
<p>Is the weightlessness experienced a combination of gravity and centrifugal force?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No. It is the result of being in freefall. An orbit is quite literally a way to permanently fall while missing the ground. That is, on object in orbit gets pulled towards the center (what it is orbiting) but moves sideways fast enough that it can never hit ground. Imagine that by the time it &quot;falls&quot; towards the center, it has also moved the same distance sideways, so in combination ends up in a position a quarter circle around the center, but still at the same distance.</p>
<p>So, as for the ISS, the important part is that an orbit is in freefall, meaning there is no force acting on it besides gravity. The same applies to the astronauts inside, so because they and their enviroment are experiencing identical force, they seem to be weightless. Identical situation can be experienced in freefall towers (for research) or the famous vomit comet, where a plane goes into a freefall dive for some seconds so the passengers inside experience weightlessness. There is no centrifugal force involved.</p>
<p>This is different to you being in, for example, a house, because while both you and the house also experience gravity, there is a second force: the resistance of the ground preventing you from falling. This second force is not uniform, but only applied from the ground. If you are in the air in the middle of the house, somehow, you only experience gravity, not the resistance from the ground, so you fall down, while the house, still sitting on the ground, can't fall. So you don't experience weightlessness relative to the house. If you were to glue a bathroom scale to your feet and then jump, it would read zero while you are in the air because again, you're both in freefall together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered. Is there any perceivable difference between being in freefall (either in orbit or not) and being in deep space (such that you effectively feel no pull of gravity)? What experiment could you do to tell the difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In orbit gravity is the centripetal force keeping you from flying straight into space. If we removed gravity and replaced it with a string, the string would hold you but you would feel a tug at 1g from the string. The reason you don't feel the tug from gravity is because it tugs on all of you at basically* the same amount. Gravity in orbit is the same but opposite as the apparent centrifugal force so the net for you feel is zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Weightlessness is essentially falling towards the ground and constantly missing because your 'horizontal' velocity is so big.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Objects in orbit are basically in a constant freefall. Any centrifugal force they experience is vastly outweighed by the earth’s gravity, which keeps them in orbit. The reason it’s a weightless environment is because in relation to the ISS itself, the astronauts and objects inside of it experience negligible amounts of gravity.</p></div>		</li>
