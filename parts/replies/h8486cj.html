<p>I passed my eye exam in 8th grade. But when I got glasses I realized how barely I passed it. It was so blurry but I guessed right. I thought the test was supposed to be hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people with poor eyesight compensate very well until they get corrective lenses.  Many don’t even notice until they are challenged (usually with an eye test.)</p>
<p>This can be pretty extreme.   I went to med school with a girl who was completely blind in one eye and had no idea until we started practicing eye exams on one another.   She’d had an untreated lazy eye as a child, and her brain had basically “switched off” her poor eye and never clued her in.   (Yes, this is a thing that can actually happen.) It wasn’t until her good eye was covered and she was asked to look through her poor eye that she discovered she could not see through that eye at all.   She was nineteen.</p>
<p>As a less extreme example, I have one eye that is long sighted and one eye that is short sighted.   I genuinely did not know this until I had my eyes examined in my late teens.   I have corrective lenses now but honestly I tend to forget to use them… then I go for a regular checkup at the optometrist and get surprised at how different the vision is between my eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true.  The first hour of me getting glasses in high school involved walking around a mall astonished that this is what the world looks like to normal people.  I had managed fine, driven safely even, long before GPS was good and you had to rely on actually reading street names.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a child, my gene-donors would often say things like “Look at that!” whilst pointing out something like a waterfall outside the car. “Look at what?” I would reply. “You need to pay attention to the world!”</p>
<p>Yeah: turns out I was short-sighted, with astigmatism. When finally diagnosed, my prescription was -6.25 diopters - you get to -8, and you are considered blind. </p>
<p>Just another thing my female gene donor gaslights me about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are your parents abusive assholes too?</p>
<p>I don’t speak to mine any more but my therapist tells me to refer to them as my “birth parents” as they weren’t real parents because they were so abusive etc. But I might start calling them ‘gene donors’ now, thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a good point. If you weren’t reading, maybe you weren’t affected as much - maybe close work wasn’t as common. I wear glasses, but I can do distance work - cooking, hunting, farming - without glasses.</p></div>		</li>
