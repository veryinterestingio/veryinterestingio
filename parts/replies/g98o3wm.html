			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve experimented with this and I agree. Getting the lettuce and other veges dry before applying the dressing is like night and day. Lettuce that isn’t sufficiently dry (simply draining is not enough) is soggy, dilutes the dressing, and starts draining again when dressing is added. Key to a good salad is fresh, clean, and dry lettuce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. Cut up your lettuces, soak in ice cold water for no more than 3 min, spin like your life depends on it. You want it crisp and dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you think it’s the lettuce, just ask the manager next time you’re there where they get their lettuce from. It’s highly likely they get it from a commercial distributor, but I know that the best restaurant salads where I live use local farms for their produce. Speaking of, regardless of where the restaurant gets their lettuce from, you’re going to do so much better getting any produce from a farmers market versus the grocery store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. Temperature plays a huge role. Even serving on an ice cold plate makes a difference.</p></div>		</li>
