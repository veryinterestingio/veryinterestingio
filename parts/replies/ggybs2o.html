			<div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: The article below is <strong>NOT</strong> about the most recent mutant strain. This is about a new strain occurring in the UK from a while back that out competed the dominant strain that existed at the time. Although the most recent strain is not well characterized but evidence seems to point in the same direction of <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/21-december-2020-sars-cov2-variant-united-kingdom/en/" target="_blank">increased viral</a> loads being the driver of increased transmissibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32697968/" target="_blank"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32697968/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32697968/</a></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We present experimental evidence that the G614 [<strong>the new strain</strong>] variant is associated with greater infectivity as well as clinical evidence that it is associated with higher viral loads. &quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Using a GLM to assess viral infectivity of the D614 [<strong>old strain</strong>] and G614 variants across cell types and to account for repeat experiments, we found that the G614 variant had an average 3-fold higher infectious titer than D614 and that this difference was highly significant (p = 9 × 10−11) &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So there is more viral material which they link to more infectious potential.</strong></p>
<p>The skeptic in me says that although I don't disagree with their findings, if you wanted to strongly correlate infectivity with transmissibility you would need to show that this variant keeps the viral load higher for longer as well (or at least above the threshold for infectivity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So by having a higher viral load, does it then mean that the virus replicates itself more (successfully) in its host and thus ends up existing in higher quantities? Also viral load has implications for symptom severity from what I remember, scary...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that they also found that within the population, this virus variant was being found in increasing numbers, so over time this variant made up a larger and larger percentage of all positive cases. I think this is also what the original 70% more infectious was based on. </p>
<p>Of course this is always hard to test causality for, if a variant is equally infectious but just happened to be involved in a few superspreader events, you would find the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>G614 did not occur in June; it was well known in February. <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/11/17/coronavirus-origin-story-chinas-frozen-food-wuhan-theory/" target="_blank">example</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prior to March 1, 2020, it was found in 10% of 997 global sequences;  between March 1 and March 31, 2020, it represented 67% of 14,951  sequences; and between April 1 and May 18, 2020 (the last data point  available in our May 29, 2020 sample), it represented 78% of 12,194  sequences. The transition from D614 to G614 occurred asynchronously in  different regions throughout the world, beginning in Europe, followed by  North America and Oceania, and then Asia.</p>
