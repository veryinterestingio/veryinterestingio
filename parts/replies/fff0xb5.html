<p>Drone strike is just a <em>powerful</em> modern metaphor because of the controversy in the media regarding casualties. Yet it's targeted, unlike antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dreadfully <strong>bad</strong> metaphor! Antibiotics are a much more sophisticated attack than some &quot;Kill 'em all and let God sort it out&quot; sort of mass slaughter. Antibiotics most often don't kill bacteria so much as they just limit their ability to reproduce. Given that slight advantage, the body's own resources can finish off the infection on its own.</p>
<p>Of course, the body's natural biome takes a hit, many antibiotics cause bowel distress as a result. If all of your gut bacteria were to die it would be likely that you would too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah original comment is way off base. Antibiotics are also more effective against certain bacteria. It‚Äôs not like they just magically kill every bacteria in your body. There‚Äôs a reason we have many kinds of antibiotics. </p>

<p>Abx are more like missiles.   Different ones are better for different situations.  They hit their target but can be ineffective or have collateral damage.   And you can develop defenses against missiles</p>
<p>Not perfect metaphor but closer.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>And it also does this for good bacteria. Most antibiotics are broad spectrum. </p>
<p>Ps. antibiotics target a vulnerability, a weakness in bacteria, one of these is dividing/reproduction, there are others.</p>
<p>So he said &quot;nuke&quot; where he should have said &quot;no, it's like sterilizing an entire city when there's 100 bad guys in there&quot;. Then you would have been fine with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even then. Antibiotics target not only certain traits (vulnerabilities as you put it), but even certain areas of the body in many cases. While there may sometimes be some ‚Äòfriendly fire‚Äô so to speak, the comparison he made is just flat out wrong. They aren‚Äôt weapons of mass destruction nor are they targetless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This is why it's often recommended to eat yogurt or take a probiotic supplement when you're on antibiotics and afterward to help you build the good ones back up again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CAREFUL WITH YOGURT. Some antibiotics don't work if you consume dairy products. So double check with your doctor or just be safe wait until after you're done the antibiotics to eat yogurt.</p>
<p>I had a friend who almost died from pneumonia because nobody told him not to drink milk while on antibiotics. And when I say almost died, I mean he was one foot out the door. Lungs filled with pus and everything. So consider this a strong admonition.</p>
<p>Probiotics are super important though. I'm not knocking that at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often times interactions of medications and food can be avoided by following the directions such as &quot;take 1 hour before, or two hours after a meal&quot;... </p>
<p>So for dairy and antibiotics ( specific ones like Cipro and tetracycline), just take them in between meals and you're good.. No need to  fanatically avoid dairy.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other foods you SHOULD avoid while taking other drugs...  For example grapefruit and Erectile dysfunction drugs, or calcium channel blockers or statins or thyroid meds and iodine rich foods...</p></div>		</li>
