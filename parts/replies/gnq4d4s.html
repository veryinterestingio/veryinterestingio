			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a level of pedantry that is unwarranted in an ELI5 situation.  Terry Pratchett's brilliant science books refer to those sorts of simplifications as, &quot;lies to children&quot;.  They're necessary omissions to prevent the unnecessary details from swamping the necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is ELI5, exact terms can be used in a less literal sense to make a point go across for easier general understanding. It’s not necessary to go into specific genus’ of mammals when going into a brief discussion of vertebrate physiology as it relates to homeostasis. But you’re right. Rabbits while considered rodents, are actually classified as Lagomorpha, not Rodentia which is what the term rodent comes from. Although these animals are absolutely considered rodents and pests, they are not classified in the Rodentia family and so are not true rodents. Again, none of which has anything to do with the topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To call a rabbit a rodent is an oversimplification at best, sure. To call a raccoon a rodent is wildly inaccurate.</p></div>		</li>
