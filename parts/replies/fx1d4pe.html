			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, some of the teeth are together. Others have a notable gap. </p>
<p>Non of this nonverbal communication is done in a vacuum. If someone is mad enough to be making that face they're probably screaming as well. Hard to do that with teeth closed. Chimps do the same thing, they screech and yell and bare their teeth all at the same time.   </p>
<p>In the same sense, smiling to show happiness or friendliness (like OP asks) isn't just the act of showing your teeth. Any model can tell you that smiling involves just as much eyes as it does teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, we absolutely do. When interacting with others, we naturally use smiling to make our actions or words feel less threatening and show that we arenâ€™t intending any aggression. In fact, this serves such a critical function in social interaction that we ended up inventing a new linguistic convention to simulate it when communicating via text :)</p></div>		</li>
