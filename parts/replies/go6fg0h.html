			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a real issue especially when the port was dying. Most of the union bosses during that time would've come up in the late 60's to 80's. Unions were more than a pay check but a sense of pride. To be a union guy was to be a man. Losing the union means you are a wage slave chump like all the rest.</p>
<p>I lived in Baltimore during this time. there were families that lived in the same house since the War of 1812 (Locust Point). It's not just one guy or one family but a way of life that was dying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very insightful. I’ve never had my way of life, and people I care about, threatened to become obsolete nor have I had to ask myself what I’d be willing to do to maintain it. Also appreciate your comment above, I’m quite ignorant of unions, their impact and history, thanks again</p>
<p>Fwiw I find season 2 most rewatchable, where as the first time through I actually quit cause I didn’t understand ziggy, the docks or why it was relevant. The scope of the series didn’t dawn on me until much later lol</p></div>		</li>
