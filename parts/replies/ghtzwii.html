			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! simple answer is that a blue glow can be caused by both factors: temperature and combustion material. </p>
<p>According to this site, the flame of a gas stove is around 2000 degrees C, or about 2300 Kelvin. This temp would produce a warm orange light, if it weren't for the fact that combustion of methane burns blue:

<p>So when gas stoves are working poorly and NOT completely burning their fuel, their glow is orange-red, not blue:

<p>That's a dangerous situation, with unconsumed fuel leaking into the house.</p>
<p>TL;DR: If your burners are red, they're still the same temperature as when they're blue, but you're collecting free-range methane, in your house. That don't go there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! Objectively, blue light alone <del>leads to</del>  <em>is caused by</em> hotter temperatures than <em>temperatures that cause</em> red/yellow light alone, but the sun is more than just red/yellow light.</p>
<p>Before we begin, we need to establish that UV light is more high energy and will <del>cause</del> <em>be associated with</em> an object <del>to</del>  <em>that</em> release<em>s</em> more heat than any <em>object associated with</em> visible light (think rainbow colors). And that in the rainbow, blue is definitely higher energy than red/yellow.</p>
<p>The idea is that a Bunsen burner releases only blue light because of the way it <em>burns</em> the gas. The gas takes the heat energy, and releases it as blue light only. <del>This would definitely be hotter than a yellow flame.</del> <em>This has nothing to do with temperature because it works by energy in, energy out as light (on an emission spectra). It isn't directly related to heat in this case because the energy would need to be released as heat, not light.</em></p>
<p><em>In the case of the sun, the color comes from blackbody radiation, which does have a correlation between light and heat.</em> The sun <del>however uses</del> <em><del>fusion</del></em><del>, which allows it</del> releases white PLUS UV wavelengths/light. White light means a combo of every color. The UV part plus blue light are the super hot, high energy parts. These contribute the most to the sun’s temperature and the <del>UV</del>  <em>blackbody radiation part, where heat is released as well as light,</em> is what makes the sun even hotter than a blue flame. However, because the sun also releases other colors that are lower energy like red/yellow, the sun’s appearance is a combo of all the visible colors, and therefore, white.</p>
<p>If you compared our sun to a blue sun/star, then the blue star would release <del>only</del>  <em>a lot of</em> blue and UV light. This means it <del>only</del> releases <em>a lot of</em> super high energy wavelengths and high temperature.</p>
<p>This person explains it pretty well with graphs:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/If-blue-fire-is-the-hottest-then-why-isnt-our-sun-blue" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.quora.com/If-blue-fire-is-the-hottest-then-why-isnt-our-sun-blue" target="_blank">https://www.quora.com/If-blue-fire-is-the-hottest-then-why-isnt-our-sun-blue</a></a></p>
<p>TLDR: sun releases UV (non-visible) wavelengths that contribute to the higher temperature due to blackbody radiation releasing light AND heat. But it also releases all the visible colors, making it white. The flame releases only blue light <em>through the emission spectra</em>, <em>which does not release heat, and</em> is why it would <em>not</em> be hotter than <del>a flame releasing only red/yellow light, but not</del>  the sun.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: I was wrong in quite a few places! Please look at the responding comments for people who are more experienced with this!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Light on the emission spectrum (bunsen burner case) is not related to temperature, but on a blackbody spectrum (the sun), it is!</li>
<li>Fusion has nothing to do with this lmao.</li>
<li>I'm still waiting on an answer about why blue stars are or are not hotter than red/yellow stars. Thanks for your patience and for everyone providing feedback!
<ol>
<li>Edit: Blue stars are hotter than red/yellow stars because the temperature is what causes the color in blackbody radiation. However, the amount of light emitted can vary between star sizes as they would have different surface areas. So a bigger red star would have a larger amount of total light emitted than a smaller blue star, but the surface temperature of a blue star would still be hotter than the red star. </li>
</ol></li>
<li>Heat level causes light colors not the other way around!</li>
<li>At this point, this is comment is mostly just notes for what I've learned from awesome people.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is a little off in places. First off is that the color of light emitted by an object does not necessarily correlate directly to its temperature. There are two major types of spectra which a radiating body can have, an emission spectrum and a blackbody spectrum.  </p>
<p>Emission spectrums are due to electron transitions between energy levels, each energy  level has a very specific energy associated and so the light emitted comes in very narrow bands of wavelength/colour.  </p>
<p>A gas burner is blue because of its emission spectrum, the excited electrons in the gas release blue light. This is not directly related to temperature at all. A small blue bunsen flame can have a cooler temperature than a large orange/white fire.  </p>
<p>Other light sources like candles, wood fires or the sun emit light due to blackbody radiation, here the spectrum emitted is directly related to the surface temperature. This has absolutely nothing to do with fusion other than the fusion in the sun is what provides the energy to keep its outer layers hot. So the sun emitting 'white' light as well as UV isn't because of fusion, its because it has a blackbody spectrum.  </p>
<p>A blue star doesn't emit only blue/uv light, increasing the temperature of the star increases how much light it puts out at all wavelengths, including the lower energy ones. A star which was exactly the same as our sun but hotter would emit more</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for clarifying! I'm still a novice in physics and would love to learn more. </p>
<p>&quot;A gas burner is blue because of its emission spectrum, the excited electrons in the gas release blue light. This is not directly related to temperature at all. A small blue bunsen flame can have a cooler temperature than a large orange/white fire.&quot; </p>
<p>This makes sense! I kept associating higher energy/shorter wavelength with  temperature. So to answer OP's question, it would simply be that the bunsen burner and the sun are different ways of emitting light? And that the blue light of a bunsen burner has more to do with what is being burnt, but no association with temperature. While the case of the sun has to do with blackbody spectrum, which IS directly related to temperature?</p>
<p>&quot;A blue star doesn't emit only blue/uv light, increasing the temperature of the star increases how much light it puts out at all wavelengths, including the lower energy ones. A star which was exactly the same as our sun but hotter would emit more&quot;</p>
<p>So does this mean that the total amount of light is proportional to the temperature? So if we took the area under the curve of a blackbody emission spectrum of a blue star and saw that it was smaller than the total area of a red star's blackbody emission spectrum, the red one would theoretically be hotter? And how is this possible? Would it be different star composition? Size shouldn't matter right?</p>
<p>Also how does the Wein's displacement law come into play? Is it just saying that there's a pattern in naturally occurring stars, but theoretically, you could have a hotter star of the same blackbody spectrum except bigger?</p>
<p>Also will definitely edit my original answer so people don't leave misinformed! Thank you in advance if you have time to answer!</p></div>		</li>
