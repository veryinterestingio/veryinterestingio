			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind many large trees are only partially &quot;alive&quot;. They're not like humans with parts that will kill the whole body if they fail. Each part of the tree can live independently while others die off. So the whole tree is it's own ecosystem really and calling it one organism makes it like a ship of Theseus, if all the parts have died and been replaced, is it still the same tree?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really true...</p>
<p>Trees can live for a long time but they eventually do die. It becomes very “expensive” to support itself at an increasing size.</p>
<p>And there’s specifically parts that if it loses, it will die. Lol. It doesn’t replace all its parts or cells like humans, not at all. Trees... trees don’t work that way.</p></div>		</li>
