			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I’m just like you. At 28 years old I was diagnosed with lung cancer. It is obviously highly unusual for my age. Well after some testing they determined is was stage 3b alk positive adenocarcinoma of the lung. I come to find out I have a defective alk gene which is the cause of the cancer. </p>
<p>For treatment I had my lower left lobe removed in a major surgery as well as a second surgery where they removed many lymph nodes by my airways in my chest (all cancerous) and went through concurrent Chemo and radiation for months (all while my girlfriend was pregnant and gave birth to our first). </p>
<p>It is now nearing a year and I’m still cancer free but as I’m writing this I’m waiting for an MRI for recurrent headaches and blurred vision. If this MRI shows the cancer has returned it will be highly unlikely that the standard or care (surgery, chemo, radiation) will put the cancer back into remission but I’m still luckier than 90% of lung cancer patients. This is due to my genetic abnormality. </p>
<p>Through the use of a series of modern drugs called TKIs my cancer can’t be cured but it can be contained for an average of 8 years. If they do find cancer today it will likely be a death sentence but not for many years. The best thing I can hope for then is a cure. My daughter is the best thing that had ever happened to me. I hope I can continue to be the best father I can be for her.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good luck with your scans!</p>
<p>I'm coming up on my fifth anniversary. Never smoked, nor considered high risk. I went into the ER as I hadn't taken a dump for nine days. Just constipated. Scanned to make sure I didn't have a blockage. Colon was fine, but doc said &quot;how long has that mass in your lung been there?. What?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dumbest of luck. My tumors doubled in mass every 24 hours, so when I first scheduled my doctors appointment I was healthy. I literally scheduled the appointment as a generic physical and wanted to talk about the acid reflux that had been bothering me for a few years. According to my doctor I didn't even have cancer 2 months prior, and if I hadn't gone to the doctors when I did I would have ben dead within the week.</p></div>		</li>
