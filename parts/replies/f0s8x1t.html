			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completely.  Both of my knees pop a lot, and it's not just the dopamine rush that feels good, it actually physically feels better.  When it needs popping I feel a hitch in my kneecap every step until it pops.  Others can feel it if they put their hand on my knee.  Then it's good for a little while</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like Patellar Maltracking. I have this where the knee cap sticks. Essentially the groove your kneecap slides in is misshapen and so it sticks or tries to pop out and then gets snapped back. Can lead to dislocations (particularly in women as they have more flexible tendons and ligaments) so get it checked out.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:* not a doctor. Just a young guy with knees like an 80 y/o</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My doctor said it’s a combo of that and normal popping I think, was a while back.  I’ve also got one shoulder that pops. Both thumbs, some fingers, both wrists.... and they pop without forcing it down just by flexing or straightening properly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this similar problem then one day I popped my knee and ended up tearing my meniscus. After the surgery and working out to strengthen the muscles around my knee I no longer have that feeling that my knee is locking up and needs to be popped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband gives me AMAZING backwards hugs where I wrap my arms around his neck from behind, and he wraps his arms around my back and hugs upwards to crack my back in the most satisfying way. It feels phenomenal and I love it. I love how he can crack my back sometimes just by a normal bear hug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be cautious of doing that. There are right and wrong ways to do that. As I stated in my original post, the potential dangers are ligament laxity and improper joint movement that can lead to damages. Each joint has correct vectors and forces to make them move.</p></div>		</li>
