			<div class="markdown"><p>It just means you can't see stars that are verey far away but you can see ones that are near. As far as we know, all of space has stars that are somewhat near, but there's no way to find out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is largely true. Except I'd challenge the no way to tell. You may see specific gravitational influences on other bodies, if they are close enough to induce a wobble or directional shift or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it just means that sources that are closer, but dimmer may not be visible.  It was meant to illustrate that light is never unimpeded. There's always little bits of stuff that get in the way, regardless of where you are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means that if you get far enough away from a particularly light source, the photons from that light source won't be able to reach you. But if you go 'deep enough into space' you're still going to be bombarded by photons from <em>other sources</em> (stars). </p>
<p><strong><analogy target="_blank"></strong></p>
<p>Imagine you're standing by a calm pool and you throw in a pebble to create a small ripple. The wave you create will be stronger close to the center of the ripple, and weaker as the wave travels outward; at the other end of the pond, the ripple will be hardly detectable. If you do this during a rainstorm, it will be almost impossible to detect your wave amidst the other ripples caused by rain drops. However, there are still lots of ripples in the water.</p>
<p><strong></analogy></strong></p>
<p>A flashlight shining from here to the moon is likewise too hard to see because (A) the photons emitted from it are dispersing in many directions (it's not a laser) as they move away from the source, and (B) there is a lot of other light shining from here to the moon that 'drowns' it out (interference/cancellation).</p>
<p>Your question is interesting from another angle, because it hinges on the idea of space is an infinite, mostly-empty room filled with cosmic objects at odd intervals. Maybe you're wondering what happens if you get so far beyond the edge of the known universe, past all the galaxies and all heat radiation, that you're really striking out into a deep, unknowable void. Is there a distance at which all the light fades away to become absolutely imperceptible, like a ripple on the surface of the ocean? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javelin_argument" target="_blank">Can't we just keep going in a straight line</a> until eventually we get to a place where it's pitch black?</p>
<p>I think the answer is probably no. I'm pushing at the outer boundaries of my own, dusty physics education, though, so I am ready to be corrected. I believe that General Relativity theory has us living in a curved space-time continuum, i.e., you can't just keep going and going and getting farther and farther away from <em>everything</em>.</p></div>		</li>
