			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow I seem to understand something from your explanation but I don't know if what I understand is correct.
So here's what I understand </p>
<p>Let's say an object is at rest, its coordinates are (x,y,z,t=c) where c is speed of light (idk if that makes sense)</p>
<p>Now let's say the object is moving at some constant speed, in that case, its coordinates would be (x',y',z',t= less than c)</p>
<p>Another case where object is moving at the speed of light then its coordinates would be (x'',y'',z'',t=0)</p>
<p>Can you please verify if I'm visualizing things correctly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yessss precisely.
Vs + Vt = c (constant)
Vs= velocity through space. Vt = velocity through time
So if you're moving at the speed of light, you do not move through time.
And the boundaries of past, present, future collapse.
I recommend you read 'The elegant universe' by Dr. Brian Greene. Actually explains it like we're 5 y.o :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohh so that's why time is the fourth dimension. Because Vt is perpendicular to Vs and hence to all the three x,y,z dimensions right? Damn that's awesome.</p>
<p>It all makes sense now!</p>
<p>Also, I assume by Vs + Vt = c, you mean magnitude of (Vs vector + Vt vector) = c. How did we get this equation?</p>
<p>I'll surely read the book you mentioned. I thought I'd never grasp these concepts unless I complete my uni but guess I was wrong. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>
