			<div class="markdown"><p>I ran into a barbed wire fence on a four-wheeler and got my right arm pretty cut up (thankfully, only flesh wounds that barely even bled). Because of dizziness I had to lie down for my sister-in-law and another nurse to scrub me before they took me to the hospital a half hour away. I also had cactus in my leg and left buttcheek so it was a tough ride in the back of a Suburban, but for the most part I had no pain. </p>
<p>At the hospital, while the nurses plucked one side of me and stitched the other, I felt pain for the first time. Adrenaline carried me that far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you and grew up in the same area. I also crashed into a barbed wire fence while on a 4-wheeler. Also, bled very little and had a 1/2 hour drive to get stiched up. Luckily I did not encounter cactus on that trip. I did get cactus in my forearm another time when I slid down a hill while hiking where I shouldn't have been.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sliced my thumb straight through almost to the bone, and up the entire length of it. I never looked at it. Not once. From the moment it happened, I put my arm cross body and squeezed my thumb as tight as possible. I never stopped squeezing it until I got to the hospital. I didnt look at them giving me stitches, all 9 of em. </p>
<p>It never hurt. Not for a second. In fact, the shots they gave me to numb the area for the stitches hurt worse than the wound. </p>
<p>In contrast, 2 years earlier I got &quot;the sliver from hell&quot;. It literally went in my arm and almost came back out the other side. I didnt stop looking at it. I got a panic attack, it never stopped hurting. </p>
<p>I'm wondering if acknowledgment contributes to the pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physically, you sliced through the nerves in the first injury. In the second you did not. This directly changes whether pain signals can travel to the brain.
There are huge psychological factors in the perception of pain, so not looking at your wound kept it from contributing to your psychological perception of pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could definitely be true. I was worried I hit my nerves but I can still feel my thumb so I'm not sure. I also think it could be because it was a fresh razor blade, perhaps the pure sharpness made a clean cut too?</p></div>		</li>
