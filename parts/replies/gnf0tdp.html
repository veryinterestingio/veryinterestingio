Send me a reminder that I have to pay or else I can't use your program anymore. That way <em>I</em> decide wether I want to continue or not.<br />
Same goes for almost everything like magazine subscriptions, maintainance subscriptions and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly why they won't do it, though. Arguably it's our responsibility to manage our finances.</p>
<p>This is why consumer protection regulation could help force them to remind customers of subscriptions. I don't like silently recurring subs any more than anyone else, but companies won't stop doing it unless they're forced to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>XBox Game Pass does this, the first month ever is a $1 as a trial, then it's like $30 after that. Given you can cancel the recurring billing immediately after starting the month, and retain all benefits through till the end and relieve your risk of forgetting immediately</p></div>		</li>
