			<div class="markdown"><p>Aquifers are kind of like sponges—rocks in random orientations that have enough space between each other to allow for water to fill them up. As we drain them too quickly, the rocks will collapse and reorient themselves and become way less permeable to future water filling in the space.</p>
<p>Obviously we can't go down there and reorient them ourselves, so once they've collapsed, that's it. The aquifer is ruined.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it the two big issues are land subsidence and saltwater intrusion. Land subsidence is where the land above collapses down into the aquifer. Without water filling the space dirt and rock fills in the aquifer. Saltwater intrusion is a particularly nasty one for California and other costal regions. If the water table drops low enough we have a whole damn ocean of salt water that will seep into the aquifer. Thats why we have those desalination and reclamation plants I mentioned, to pump freshwater back into the aquifers and keep the sea at bay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>industry and agriculture can basically take as much water from wells as they want and its not even metered in most places. Those aquifers will collapse soon if nothing is done, and once an aquifer collapses its done. No bringing it back.</p>

<p>This makes me so angry.</p>
<p>So much environmental responsibility is pushed on the consumer (take shorter showers, recycle, stop eating meat, etc) when the reality is that corporate interests are the true culprits of the ecological disasters we're facing.</p></div>		</li>
