			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and what's even worse is that these banks have to operate in an interest based economy. They have to hold treasury bills that pay interest, borrow money from the central bank and pay it interest on that and borrow and lend money on the interbank market. So it's all just fake. A way to fool muslims who wouldn't otherwise save money with financial institutions because they are afraid of the boogeyman i.e. interest. Even conventional banks in Pakistan call it profit instead of interest for that very reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's still a thing in post-revolutionary Iran, (and related concepts in Sunni Islamic countries as well) the debate is only over whether it constitutes prostitution.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this concept exists in some sects of Islam and is known as <em>Nikah Muta</em>. Whilst the way you describe it is correct, the purpose of <em>Muta</em> was so that if a child was borne from that meeting, the father would be traceable. This practice was common during wars when army’s would travel far and wide for extended periods of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, we (the Jews) are the masters of technicalities.  A loaf of bread for $120 is nothing.  Here, step inside my eruv and let me explain.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For anyone who isn't into Jewish loopholes, let me tell you about the eruv.   In Jewish law there are certain things you can't do on the sabbath.  For example, push your baby in a stroller.  Or carry your house keys in your pocket.  You can do it indoors, but not outside.  Now, faced with this situation, do you a) simply not bother going for a walk with baby on Saturdays, or b) string a thread of wire on poles for 10 miles around the neighbourhood and declare that anything within that wire is considered &quot;indoors&quot; as far as the rules of Judaism are concerned?</p>
<p>Yup.  B) every time.  And then we wonder why orthodox religion gets a bad reputation!</p></div>		</li>

<p>In order to use Murabaha, either Allah doesn't understand the difference between predatory and beneficial lending, or Allah doesn't understand the spirit of a transaction if it uses clever terminology.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's like the Orthodox Jew who cannot press one button on the sabbath, but he'll prevent 9 other buttons from pressing themselves, thereby sending the exact same information into an integrated circuit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between Usury and Murabaha is that while you may pay a little more for the bread than its original value, that extra you pay is fixed. Usury can grow to the point that you can be indebted for life (which is the point of it being forbidden by Islam and Christianity). Yes, this is still a fun game of semantics, but there is a distinction between paying $120 on a $100 loan, vs 20% interest indefinitely against a $100 loan. I’m just the Mohamed here, don’t shoot me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laws on banking/economic transaction is part of laws regulating social life (muamalat). Some stuff are deemed forbidden not because it would be against God, but because it is considered as harmful to the society. So it's less about tricking God than tricking ourselves the humans (or at least the revered religious scholars). I think it's kind of a way to survive in &quot;modern&quot; economy, as Islam certainly didn't expect capitalism when it was first codified.</p></div>		</li>
