			<div class="markdown"><p>In the video description:</p>
<p>>  As well as the visible green or red glow of the Aurora Borealis (or Northern Lights), there is also created an intense radio emission that can be converted to sound. </p>
<p>So yeah sure but if i understand correctly it's not like you see the northern lights and then start hearing noise, which is what most people would think when reading your top comment</p></div>		</li>

Didn't sound like them in person at all.
Source: am an Alaskan who has heard them clearly twice in over 30 years watching.</p>
<p>Actual audio emissions (not picked up over radio and converted) were recorded by Finnish scientists in 2012;<br />
and it sounds very similar to the descriptions over the last hundred years or more.   </p>
<p>The same team also followed up, and in 2016, came up with a very likely theory for what makes the sounds, and why they are so rare.</p>
<p>A good NatGeo article on the team here, for the more skeptical:   </p>
