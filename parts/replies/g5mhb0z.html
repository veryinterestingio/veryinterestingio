			<div class="markdown"><p>Good stuff, but caffeine actually doesn't directly touch the dopamine systems, it does so through an indirect mechanism: adenosine receptor activity results in less activity in dopaminergic networks, so by antagonising the adenosine receptors, it encourages the brain to release dopamine in these networks. It also increases the sensitivity of related networks to dopamine. This contrasts with other agents that act on dopamine directly, like modafinil and cocaine, which are dopamine reuptake inhibitors, and Adderall and methamphetamine, which are dopamine-releasing agents.</p>
<p>Also, as someone who has bipolar, I'm not sure I agree; caffeine's stimulant properties are why it's super common for manic episodes to coincide with high caffeine consumption. If you hang around the coffee machine on a psychiatric ward, you'll almost certainly find some manic patients frequenting it to try and combat the heavy tranquilizers and prolong their state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there anything else that works similar to coffee and gives the chemicals your brain needs to begin the sleep cycle? For example can eating protein or carbs or eating in general increase dopamine or neurochemicals and give the brain energy to fall asleep? I ask because the way you described it is what I feel sometimes at night, I canâ€™t fall asleep or feel weird and then I eat something and I instantly feel my brain get so exhausted and sleepy, then I fall asleep. It got me wondering if I am lacking something</p></div>		</li>
