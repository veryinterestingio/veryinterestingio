			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! The one on your motherboard is called a CMOS battery and serves exactly that purpose as well as facilitating the storage of certain BIOS information.</p>
<p>Phones don't typically work in that way exactly, but you're correct about the motherboard in your desktop/laptop computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That wasn't the point. No one my age would assume something like timekeeping would be done through an internet connection because we grew up with lots of things that could tell the time like that way before there was an internet. It shows that it's so integral they haven't seriously considered life without the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another question? Why don't we have to replace the batteries?</p>
<p>Watch batteries last from a few months to years, they'd eventually die, and old Gameboy/GBAdvance cartridges are dying nowadays because of their internal clock batteries.</p>
<p>You'd think the internal clock battery might run into a similar issue here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a pc is powered, the Real Time Clock (RTC) can be powered from the main supply. So the battery just holds the clock data when its off and it draws tiny amounts of power. Some pc power supplies also constantly provide a bit of power (for this purpose) whenever plugged in. </p>
<p>For a phone (and a laptop) , the battery is is so large (energy capacity) that the RTC can run for many years without issue. A phone has an average battery capacity of 2.5 amp-hours. The RTC has a power requirement about 250 thousand times smaller.</p>
<p>As for GBA cartridges, the power efficiency of the RAM used is probably not as good as a chip made in the last 15 years or so. So that may be why. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. Just surprising that they don't need to be replaced as often as watches or other appliances that use batteries for the same reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had digital (dumb) watch that not only kept the time, but also displayed it on a 7 segment display and the first battery replacement I did was after 15-16 years. Keeping the right time really doesn't take a lot of power compared to everything else your devices do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but some manufacturers have poor quality in that regard. I'm surprised that the internal clock batteries last so long on phones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Low power usage and phones typically aren't owned long enough to matter. The battery might die in 15 years but who is still using a 15 year old phone?</p></div>		</li>
