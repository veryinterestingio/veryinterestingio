<p>I’m posting this all over this thread because I’m seeing a surprising amount of people who seem to think masks only help others. They definitely provide the most protection is everyone wears one, but even a little cotton mask will provide the wearer some protection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They filtrate particles really well in labs.  But the primary means of transmission for most of these viruses is by larger droplets.  They've never been shown to be superior to surgical masks for this purpose. </p>
<p>If you're reading this and surprised to hear this, here is a good jumping off point to learn more:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing I would say is that by fitting more snugly, it would reason that less droplets would get around the edges. Anyone who has used those masks should know you don’t want them getting wet as it becomes very difficult to breathe. I can’t attest to clinical studies, but it seems pretty clear that higher levels of filtration correlate with higher levels of protection.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's what you would think, but that's never actually been shown to be the case.  Filtration would likely matter more for viruses that have more considerable airborne transmission, but that's not what is going on with COVID or most other common respiratory viruses.  The bulk of the battle is keeping droplets off your mucous membranes, which surgical masks do a pretty decent job of.  Additional layers of filtration don't really aid in that goal.</p>
<p>An analogy would be trying a build a wall for a bathroom.  You want it opaque enough that nobody can see you taking a shit.  Sure, 1ft of solid reinforced concrete will work.  But so would a single layer 1/2 inch OSB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the reason there isn't much evidence of that is because it is really difficult to study. You would have to do the study in situations where there is a high risk of viral transmission (i.e not during an average flu season), and you would have to insure everyone was wearing the masks constantly. Even health care workers don't wear masks all of the time. So in the studies referred to in the link, it's not surprising that there is no difference in infections between people who are not wearing an N95 most of the time to people who aren't wearing surgical masks most of the time</p></div>		</li>
