<p>I'm up at 4:00 and I have to be up at 6 to get ready for work.</p>
<p>Looks like an all-nighter for me!!! But I'll just get back on track tomorrow. Should be fine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it's considered extreme night owl when you stay up till dawn or just after.    Nocturnal has a nice ring to it though, I actually like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither of those conditions are &quot;normal&quot; for me.</p>
<p>Pre-COVID, I slept at night and was up during the day. Then during quarantine it was what the fuck ever, because I'm bipolar and with my routine and stability gone my depression took over and I alternated between sleeping too much or too little.</p>
<p>Now I'm transitioning from that back into daytime work with no warning, so adjustment is probably going to take a couple all-nighters here and there. I'm not used to having anything to do these past two months so being excited to leave the house makes it hard to sleep.</p>
<p>Besides, if you're not tired at a certain point (like 1-2 hours before you'd have to get up anyway), there's no point in trying to sleep, because then it'll be hard to wake up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m just wondering for people who would follow their night owl schedule wouldn’t that be u healthy as well since you hardly get any daylight?
That’s the reason I’m a morning person. I wake up early everyday because of the daylight (5/6 am in summer 7/8 am in winter). I love getting as much daylight as I can. Now, I am a very outdoorsy person but still natural daylight does improve your (mental) health a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't nite owls get sunlight?    How many hours do you think we sleep?</p>
<p>Even if I go to bed at 6am, I'm up by 2pm, sun doesn't set till 9pm currently since it's almost summer time, but even in the winter the sun is still up for 3 or so hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get precisely the same amount of sunlight working nights that I got when I worked days. One leg of my commute is during night hours, one is during sunlight hours. </p>
<p>I get sunlight going to and from my mom's on the weekend. I get sunlight when I drive to kroger and have to get out of the car.</p>
<p>I'm 100% not slamming your way of life, but I just don't like being outside. It's hot, and there's rarely anywhere to sit down (personal problem, i know) , and i hate exercising.</p>
<p>This next statement is very subjective and medically unreliable, but I don't feel 'better' during the weekends I get more sun. I do feel better working nights because I've always been a nights kind of person, and my emotional state is generally more stable on night shift.</p>
<p>I do miss being able to go places after work, though. That's the one thing that sucks most about getting out of work at midnight. Darn day shift world, closing things after dark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess everybody is different then yeah. I’m just wondering because seasonal depression is related to daylight and also countries with the highest suicide rates are countries where there’s almost no daylight in winter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what you mean.</p>
<p>I'm a barista and as such I wake up at 5am for work. I get home and I'm exhausted but unable to sleep until 11pm at the earliest.</p>
<p>During quarantine my normal sleep schedule was 2am-10am
I've never been a morning person and after 10years of making coffee I still have to fight myself to get out of bed.</p></div>		</li>
