			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends - as the dimension of lumber grows the shrinkage also grows. e.g. a 2x6 is really 1.5 x 5.5... though I suspect its a shade less than that, there's rounding going on. A 2x8 is really 1.5 x 7.25, a 2x10 is 9.25... if you had a 4x20 it would probably be 3x18.5 and so on. </p>
<p>What you're looking to google is &quot;nominal&quot; vs. &quot;actual&quot; lumber sizes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note is that &quot;nominal&quot; means just that, it's not 2&quot; - 0.5&quot;, it's 2&quot; + or - 0.5&quot;.  I recently bought 16 2x12s, and 15 of them were 11.25, while one of them was more like 12. Also, one of my 6x6s was 5.5x5.75, so it didn't fit in the metal butt cap quite right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The planer removes 1/4 of an inch of material from each side. So simply subtracting .5 from each axis will give you proper dimensions. A 2x4 is 1.5x3.5 and a 1x10 is .5x9.5           </p>
<p>Also remember that all lumber is approximate. So it might actually be 1.51x3.48 it is close enough to not matter for 99.9 percent of applications, but where it does, planing yourself might be a better option</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sad to say it isn't quite that simple. A 1x10 is actually 3/4&quot; x 9-1/4&quot; and yet a 10x10 is 9-1/2&quot; x 9-1/2&quot;.</p>
<p>Here is the chart I use when drafting  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/19T7H0g.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/19T7H0g.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/19T7H0g.jpg</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You can however buy &quot;true&quot; sizes.</p>
<p>Edit: shit, I just saw the comment you replied to mentioned true sizes. :-\</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Before we used the 2x4 unfinished, 1.5x3.5 finished standard, houses were built (at least in the US) out of 2x3 rough cut lumber. This wasn't just a bit of momentum that carried over from earlier days.</p>
<p>Edit: in fact, modern lumber sizes also take into account blade width and amount of warp after kiln-drying. It also is part of the reason why blades are 0.125 (1/8) inches wide. There is a lot more going on than you may think</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>No. No. No.</strong> and <strong>No</strong>. </p>
<p>Construction grade douglas is always used wet. Buggy wood? Warped? Pressing? Straightening? What are you talking about? Oh yeah. You have no idea.</p>
<p><em>&quot;true size treated lumber</em> cost you a fortune<em>&quot;</em>? No again. Rough cut is cheaper by far. Treated means chemicals and that costs more but that's not what you meant.</p>
<p><em>**and this adjustment happened so long ago and just became &quot;standard&quot; accepted practise that noone ever bothered to go back and change it.</em>  No. It's a system devised to get wood from forest to the mill to the carpenter in perfect understanding.</p></div>		</li>
