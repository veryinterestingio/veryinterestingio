<p>When the vaccine is efficient in blocking all other variants, the only variant that can &quot;break through the defenses&quot; has an advantage that can aid it in spreading.</p>
<p>Quite similar to antibiotic resistant bacteria. The antibiotics do not cause the mutation to happen, but when all that don't have the mutation die, the one that doesn't die will be able to spread itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, however, if vaccination were taken seriously and done thoroughly in most societies, it wouldn't have the chance to break through.</p>
<p>It takes time and large populations for the mutation to occur. Had we timely dealt with the virus, we would have gotten control of it before it ever had the chance to mutate. </p>
<p>Considering how we're basically giving the virus the perfect opportunity to mutate, whether it be through allowing misinformation to be spread about vaccines, or allowing high population countries like India to become breeding grounds for new strains by not doing everything we can to endure they have enough vaccines, we (as humanity on a whole) are giving the virus huge populations of unvaccinated people to infect and roll the dice for newer more potent strains. </p>
<p>I do see where you're coming from, though.</p></div>		</li>
