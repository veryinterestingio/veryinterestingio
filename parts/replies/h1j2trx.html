			<div class="markdown"><p>Because your brain isn't aware of the arbitrary numbers humans have created to let our concious mind accurately measure the pasaage of time, it's just aware &quot;oh it's later now&quot; or &quot;oh about now yesterday was a beep beep, let's get up and not get the shit scared out of us&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but you can train your brain to recognise the passage of time, and although it can wake up with a variance from the previous day, it can be &quot;reset&quot; once you wake up and check what time it is/practice setting the tempo of time.</p></div>		</li>
