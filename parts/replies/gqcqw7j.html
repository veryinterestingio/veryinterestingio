			<div class="markdown"><p>I like like this line of thinking. Skepticism is always your friend! </p>
<p>It’s important to remember that it can often lead you to conclude that you CAN trust someone with expertise just as much as it can lead you away from that conclusion. </p>
<p>This isn’t aimed at you, OP, but getting a little concerned about folks in this thread seeming to take away the idea that this means doctors and other experts are by default untruthful. Being skeptical about them should be a tool to help decision making, not a final conclusion about them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it’s okay to be skeptical about something and end up trusting it. You should be skeptical of your approach if it consistently makes you distrust folks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should trust people not because they are trustworthy, but because you know enough about yourself, and them, that you can handle how and what they would be untrustworthy. Don't, like, keep waiting for people to 'show their true colors' or something, and don't expect <em>anyone</em> to be a white knight of pure goodness without faults. </p>
<p>Instead, grow as a person, love people because of who they are, accept that they have the capacity to hurt you if you trust and love them, do it anyway because it's more important to trust and love people, within reason, than to not do so, and have enough self respect and self love to be capable of handling the inevitable breaches of trust, either be they small, or large, with grace. </p>
<p>What 'grace' means is different based on what kind of breach of trust happens. If your partner becomes abusive, obviously removing yourself from that situation is the healthy and proper thing to do. It's also reasonable to be sad if this happens. It's just that your sense of self worth should not be wrapped up in how other people treat you. If anything, you should refuse to remain in an abusive situation <em>because you love yourself and nobody who loves someone wants them to be abused</em>. </p>
<p>If a breach of trust is something like, your partner or friend binge watching a TV show that you said you'd watch together, handling that with grace is different. Context matters. It's still okay to be sad, and acting out of self love means not denying yourself the right to be sad when you're sad, nor denying yourself the right to self expression that what someone did hurt you, because you had trusted them to uphold their end of an agreement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  Even when we all work together through a very well engineered process, we are still limited to the distilled sum of our collective abilities to record and reconcile our memories.  There are many potential sources of error in that process, and though we can do better, it is impossible to account for them all fully.</p></div>		</li>
