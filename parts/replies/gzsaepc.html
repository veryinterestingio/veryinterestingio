There would be a lot of perfectly good chips that were underclocked, just to give them something to sell at the lower price point.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>A lot of that is due to contractual obligations. </p>
<p>e.g. If I sign a deal to sell 500,000 low end chips to Dell for use in their low end systems, I'm not going to say to them partway &quot;hey, my chips are coming in great now, so I'm going to sell you only higher end chips for a higher price, thanks.&quot; </p>
<p>Likewise, I'm not going to go &quot;hey, my chips are coming in great now, so I'll only sell you my higher end chips now, but still at the same price as the low end chips. you can stick em in your low end systems, even though they might not be designed for it, and the flooding of the market with these powerful cheap chips probably screw with your higher margin high end products, but whatever dude my margins are being screwed too haha&quot;</p>
<p>If they order 500,000 Celerons, they're getting 500,000 Celerons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a Statistics for high end manufacturing class once and the teacher told us about a company that just couldn’t hit target when they completed their process, some was thin, some was thick.  Acceptable, but they were confused</p>
<p>So the statistician said, “let’s see what the incoming looks like”.  So they test the incoming material and let’s say they specified it needed to be between 10 and 20 millimeters thick to start.  They had a bunch of 10-13 and a bunch of 17-20, but nothing near their ideal goal of 15.  So they went to the supplier and said “what the hell is this?”  The supplier basically said, “we gave you a really good price but someone else came along offering more money for the same stuff, so we sold them all the 14-16 material. I think the teacher/statistician may have just shared an urban legend to make a point, but I am sure that kind of thing happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just to due to the obligations. The obligations themselves exist to capture a larger part of the consumer surplus.</p>
<p>Imagine the demand line from your Econ 101, say 10 people value the chip at $100, 10 people value the chip at $200 and 10 people value the chip at $300.</p>
<p>If I only sell 1 chip, priced at say $250, I'd only get 10 customers and even with those customers, I am leaving a lot of money on the table. I could have simply priced the chip at $299 and made $490 more.</p>
<p>However, even better would be if I could sell the chip at $99, $199, and $299. Then everyone would be able to buy my chip. But if I sell the same chip at all three price points, the $300 people will eventually figure out that they can simply pay $99 and get the chip.</p>
<p>One way I can overcome this hurdle is by underclocking the cheaper chips.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's right in the general sense. There is a considerable element of reuse of what would otherwise be defective parts. But there are also production runs of those mid-range and low-range parts, with similar processes to separate fully functional chips from ones that need to be either discarded or have parts fused off. nVidia does this quite heavily, and you can see how their GPUs have 3-4 different sizes of chips, each generating 1-3 individual parts depending on how defect free they were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of when my physics prof and I decided to sample a whole bunch of resistors across different levels of precision (10%, 5%, 2%). Discovered that the ones marked 10% were almost always between 5%-10% off their listed resistance. 5% were almost always between 2%-5%. Shows that they don't have a different manufacturing for different precisions. They just test them afterwards and mark them accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In computer tech there is what's called &quot;binning&quot;.</p>
<p>You run a test and have( for the purposes of illustration) 4 outcomes: Fail, Markdown, &quot;Standard&quot;, Superb(mark-up)</p>
<p>Possibly 3 more: locked versions that function but don't overclock, and &quot;unlocked&quot; versions that can bin higher.</p>
<p>Another thing they do is take the really high bins and sell them to manufacturers to go in the high end of high end products.(EG VideoCard maker has value, performance, enthusiast, and Premium lines <em>all in the same &quot;model&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>A basic cooler with a reference design board(technically runs in spec), a slightly upgraded one(maybe better power delivery and cooling), a Plus+ model that boosts even better custom PCB, Innovative cooling, backplate, and then a model with superb capabilities that's saddled with bigger branding and custom boards and all the bells and whistles including heavy duty cooling, all the best board components, etc...marketed to the top professional overclockers and their fan-boys with oodles of spare disposable income.</p>
<p>That's before the cut-down for a step down in a lower tier product(which people always talk about in threads like this).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a really rough comparison, imagine a car engine factory that only makes V8 engines, but where individual cylinders or pistons may randomly not work. </p>
<p>If one cylinder doesn't work, the factory can block off that one and one on the other side, readjust the piston timing, and make it into a V6 engine instead. If multiple cylinders on the same side are broken, it can convert it to an inline-4 engine.</p>
<p>This doesn't necessarily work very well with real engines, but it's basically how chip manufacturing works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yea, i guess it makes sense for chip manufacturing.<br />
It's easy to reliably make V8 pistons, but transistors are only a few nanometers wide these days, with millions of them on a chip. And even 1 error i guess would mess lots of things up, so it makes sense that their process isn't perfect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is part of why Ryzen is such an enormous leap in CPUs in the past few years. Whereas all intel cpus and older amd cpus would be like trying to make a v8 and sometimes ending up with less, Ryzen is like making sets of 4 pistons apiece and having a way to connect them into a bigger engine. This way they can make CPUs with 16 cores without the inaccuracy/inconsistency of working with an enormous die.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, pistons must always run in pairs of two with the opposite piston firing! </p>
<p>IE) A v6 cannot be a v5, a v6 could operate as v4, v2.</p>
<p>...and if it's v6 -&gt; v4 then the piston adjacent to each cylinder must fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some automobile manufacturers do this: they deactivate some of the cylinders in a V6 or V8 when the power isn't needed, so it runs and consumes fuel like a smaller motor. There's a little bit of horsepower loss as the engine has to move the rotational mass of the pistons and cams no longer actively generating power, but it is overall a decent way to increase the fuel economy of larger motors.</p></div>		</li>
