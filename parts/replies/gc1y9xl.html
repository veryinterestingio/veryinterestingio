			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that everyone is missing the fact that all the animals in and around the boat were just animal versions of humans, that's the way Pi managed to survive all that horrors, by methaphorizing humans and their personalities into animals. </p>
<p>If you watch the movie knowing this, it's pretty disturbing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not the story I choose :) I choose the one where the hippo is happy and there's a magical green island with meerkats and the kid and the trained the tiger and survived against the odds. And bananas do float.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The book makes it very clear at the end that either it is horrific story where horrible things happen and all the animals are just people who did horrible things.</p>
<p>Or itâ€™s a fantastical story where Pi and the animals had a wondrous if slightly scarring journey.</p>
<p>You choose your story. Pi chose the animals one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was talling a fantasy tale wich he created to cope with the horrors that the castaways did to each other in the boat. Some parts of his story are more fantasy than others because of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's how it goes in the book:</p>
<p>Pi tells his story with all the animals. The insurance agents don't believe him, and say as much.</p>
<p>So Pi briefly retells essentially the same story, but with all the animals replaced by human survivors from the ship. It's more horrifying, because while you'd expect panicky animals to kill each other, human survivors adrift at sea murdering each other is worse in some ways.</p>
<p>The insurance agents say the second story sounds more plausible and ask which one is true. Pi tells them they (and, by extension, the reader) can choose whichever version they like better and believe that one is true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean there were literal animals on the ship with them, they just didn't make it onto the life rafts (assumedly no one let them out of their cages and they just drowned in the ship's hold).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible that the hippo would have succumb to the immense pressure of the ocean before it drown. Google says a hippo can hold its breath for 5 mins. The real question is, what is the density of a hippo compared to sea water, and at what depth of water would the external pressure be too great for the hippo to survive and could the hippo sink to that depth in under 5 mins.</p></div>		</li>
