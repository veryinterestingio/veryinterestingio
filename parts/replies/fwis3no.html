			<div class="markdown"><p>Do yourself a financial favor: buy the external drives that pack SSDs and just tear them open to get the drives out. It's <em>much</em> cheaper that way. I just got 2 4TB external drives (HDDs, not SSDs but still) for $99 each but the <em>exact</em> same drive without the housing (internal drive) was over $400 a pop. Plus I got the USB to SATA converter and two cases to spare if I ever need to build one if I'm bored (or I can use the converter to examine old drives which I did).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have any insight to share whether your drives tend to fail more using this strategy?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Side note: holy crap a 2TB 2.5&quot; drive is $80!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP asked &quot;ELI5: Why are there no SSDs with more capacity, if 1TB MicroSD cards are a thing?&quot;</p>
<p>The lead comment in this thread wasn't asking a question, it was answering using 32TB SSDs as an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>32TB SSDs have been around since 2018. But they are very expensive. They are aimed at the enterprise market.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you just merged the two in your head and read a question about 32TB SSDs...</p></div>		</li>
