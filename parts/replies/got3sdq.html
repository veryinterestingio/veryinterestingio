<p>If you compare notes you can see the effect of quantum entanglement on scales of time that in theory would violate relativity. However you need to compare notes to figure out that it occurred.</p>
<p>It is basically &quot;if only we realized we could have communicated&quot; except the very math that shows the instant transfer fundamentally includes &quot;but you can't do anything useful with the data&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Quantum entanglement is well established theoretically and experimentally.  So well, in fact, that it served as the solid basic foundation -- the starting point -- for experimental physics methods that <a href="https://www-public.slac.stanford.edu/babar/Nobel2008.aspx" target="_blank">resulted in the 2008 Nobel Prize</a>.</p>
<p>But entanglement only relates to the quantum statistics, for the entanglement's correlated state variables, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem" target="_blank">not transport of matter or physical information</a>.  That's a key point, since all particle interactions are based on probabilities only, not classically deterministic.</p>
<p>So a person interacting with an entangled particle can't &quot;know&quot; (without a separate traditional communication channel) whether their particle was even entangled or not, or how it related to another measurement elsewhere.  And after a particle interaction, that entanglement is lost (that's why teams have so much trouble building quantum computers today).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read lots of explanations of entanglement and cannot seem to figure out how we ruled out the whole &quot;hidden variables thing&quot;, that we can determine that there's actually action in the spooky action. </p>
<p>If I split a coin in half and put each half in an envelope and opened them 10 lightyears away from eachother I should be very unsurprised to find one envelop containing heads and the other tails.</p></div>		</li>
