			<div class="markdown"><p>Only if they are not linked. Many helicopters have multiple engine especially if you what to fly them over water. 2 is the most common but for example Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion and AgustaWestland AW101 have 3 engines and the experimental Mil V-12 had 4 engines.</p>
<p>To operate out at sea you like to have 2 engines that are linked so one can fail and you can continue to fly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He' is talking about a Auto Rotation, regular choppers can do a auto (Change to a negative pitch with the blades) if the engine fails and and land safety (usually)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorotation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorotation</a></p>
<p>I should also note with quads / up in rotors you cant do this. A large hurdle with the Osprey was it cant do a auto itself. If you loose a engine in a quad, you spin wildy (been there) in a reg style chopper if i loose the tail rotor i can kill the engine power and begin a auto and try to land safety. </p>
<p>Another safety issue with quads is if you decent to fast with 0 air speed the up coming air will cause what is known as a ring vortex state.  This is also known as Settling with power where vortex's start up around the blades, with a normal chopper you have 2 options, lower your power and get into a auto or lower your blades pitch for lift and try to head into the oncoming wind to try to get rid of the vortex's. The hotter it is outside the easier it is to enter into a vortex. </p>

<p>When i first started messing with a RC chopper id fly it high, then drop soem power let it start to fall, then hit the power hard, to my surprise the craft would only shake and fall even faster, it was a vortex ring state. Kinda neat until it smashed off the ground and took off like a rocket. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple notes.  You don't use negative pitch while in an auto.  In fact the vast majority of of helicopters don't have the ability to feather the blades to a negative pitch angle, nor would you want them to in an auto.</p>
<p>An auto-rotation is performed with the blades in a fairly normal position.  You need to go close to flat-pitch initially (to recover the rotor RPM), but after that you raise the collective and put pitch on the blades just like normal flying.</p>
<p>The recovery from Vortex Ring generally (actually almost never) would not involve getting into an autorotation.  You're going to be encountering VRS while on approach at low altitude, so you're not going to have the height to do an auto.  All you need to do is get out of your own downwash, so any lateral or forward movement will do if you have the height.  </p>
<p>There is another technique to get out of it call the Vuichard Recovery Technique, but the best way to get out of VRS is to not fly like an idiot and not get into it in the first place.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lack of autorotation performance in quadcopters isn't intrinsic - it's largely because they don't have enough inertia in the rotors, the pitch of each rotor is fixed, and the back-torque from a failed motor is high; plus there not being control laws in multirotor designs which would allow for autorotating flight. There's also the issue that most drones are operating entirely in the &quot;autorotation unsafe/prohibited&quot; low-speed, low-altitude flight phase which conventional helicopter pilots try to avoid operating in. </p>
<p>If autorotation was a requirement, you'd have to use larger, heavier rotors (which store more inertia and thus get you from powered to autorotating flight before you lose too much speed and height) with variable pitch (essential for being able to enter an auto; engine failure = collective down) and crucially, you have to detect the motor failure, put the failed motor into either clutched-out or minimal back-torque mode, and adjust all the other rotors to keep the centre of thrust within the controllable area - probably apply zero net torque to the diametrically opposite one, have that auto as well, and use small torque inputs to it to provide pitching moments along the axis between the failed motor and its' pair. </p>
<p>Obviously this now puts you in a serious lift deficiency - in the worst case (4 rotors) you have only 50% of your usual power available and with more rotors you lose less from single failures, so you're coming down in most cases anyway, barring very high rotor count drones which can survive a stalled motor on excess thrust alone. The whole point of an auto is to trade forward speed for rotor inertia now, and then inertia for lift next. In the case of a quadcopter which has insufficient power reserve for a controlled crash and needs to exploit some altitude and speed energy reserve (which is what an auto is, really) there needs to be enough energy sloshing around in the system initially, and also the quadcopter must be able to transform it into rotor inertia and then lift, which is not usually possible as discussed earlier. In general it's simpler to just modify a quadcopter which must survive rotor failure to add two or four more rotors (the drivetrain complexities of helicopters being a major factor in why multirotors are rare; electric drivetrains make this problem go away but scale poorly to very high power requirements) rather than do all this work just to preserve a quadrotor configuration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quadcopters with internal combustion engines already exist. One engine powers all of the rotors. I'm not entirely sure but if I had to guess I'd say they get that immediate and variable thrust on the different rotors you mentioned as a necessary component by using electric servos to change the collective pitch on each of those four rotors. I think the bigger reason that larger helicopters don't exist using four rotors is that there's no need for such an absurdly complex system and becoming airworthy by any reasonable standard would cost a shit load of money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question becomes, how many different moving/wearing parts do you want to completely rely on for your life?  The other answers here are all correct in pointing out just how different a tiny electric quadcopter flies compared to a full proper helicopter.  But, its entirely possible to make a quadrotor type large helicopter using a single engine and swash plate controls (variable pitch/tilt on each rotor) but by the time you take one rotor and turn it into 4, connect all the necessary linkages and come up with some slightly useful piloting process, all you have done is taken a helicopter and make it 1/4 as reliable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is so much easier to just control via blade speed, than blade pitch. And this is also easier done via electric.</p></div>		</li>

<p>prophecy is applied to anakin (whether that is right or wrong is up to discussion)</p>
<p>so anakin wants to know your location to learn how to balance the force (even though i don't think he even know about the prophecy? idk)</p>
