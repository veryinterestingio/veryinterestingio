			<div class="markdown"><p>A related question then: Do we have any reason to believe that these factors that limit the height of mountain ranges (and peaks) have differed throughout the Earths history?</p>
<p>As a corollary, is there something that could change (or is changing currently) to change these factors in the future?</p>
<p>Finally are the factors that lead to catastrophic geological events and the events themselves something that could change this (i.e. the creation and eruption of a supervolcano)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, so here we go. The major factors that control mountain height are the planets gravitational field, and the strength of the material you are building with. It also has to do with how buoyant the crust is compared to the mantle. Imagine you're building a sand castle. If you want to make it higher, you use wet sand. That represents stronger material. Or you build it on the moon, so it doesnt collapse on itself. Lastly we have buoyancy. From measuring how fast continents float back up after glaciers melt we have a pretty good handle on this one. If you build a mountain too high, that crust gets too heavy, and you reach an equilibrium point where if you keep adding material it sinks at the same rate, and gets no taller. </p>
<p>We do not think there has been any major change in gravity, the bulk composition of the crust or mantle since we have had continental crust. (Change in composition enough to dramaticaly alter its structural properties). </p>
<p>On earth large mountains like this are formed by continental colisions, or orogenys. This is becuase we have plate tectonics. In addition, it means that the plates move too fast over mantle plumes to allow a massive mountain to form over them. This is why we see Hawaii and not Olympus mons. A massive supervolcano, say from a new mantle plume head coming up is so large that it does not form a mountain, but what's called a large igneous province (LIP). Basicaly a massive ass lava flow which covers a significant chunk of a continent and likely causes a mass extinction. See deccan traps and Siberian traps. </p>
<p>TLDR for the last 3 billion years or so which we have had plate tectonics and continental crust, no processes would cause the variables to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two main factors affecting maximum height are rock type and gravity, neither of which really change over time. However, you will see a huge variety of mountain sizes throughout the solar system due to variation in these factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also as Mars tectonics petered out Olympus Mons sat on one of the only active parts of the Martian mantle for millions of years.  On Earth the mantle is active over the entire surface preventing anything the size of Olympus Mons from happening, for now.</p></div>		</li>
