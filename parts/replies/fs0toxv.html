			<div class="markdown"><p>Your fingers and toes are commonly affected by psoriatic arthritis so you can have a lot of inflammation in these digits. You're more likely to get pitting if you've got arthritis than just psoriasis though your nail beds are related to your skin so any sort of skin problem around that area will have an effect on the nails. Though I do have psoriasis and arthritis myself and the nails that are pitted aren't the ones with visible swelling which is strange. I guess you can't tell what inflammation goes on under the surface though.</p></div>		</li>
