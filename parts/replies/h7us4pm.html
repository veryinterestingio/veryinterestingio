			<div class="markdown"><p>The use of the term &quot;usually&quot; implies that exceptions exist. Also, speaking as someone who was once a child, the things that frighten someone as a child tend to excite them as an adult - because being exposed to it as a child showed them that something can be scary without being dangerous. This is literally why the horror genre exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may explain my wife's interest in horror (like American style haunting films, not Rob zombie stuff). She was raised Catholic so the material was there from the start. I was raised in a non-ghost and occult home so those films aren't enjoyable (not scary or entertaining).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It varied by region and era - but more than you might realize. There's been this idea since the 17th century that everyone before the 17th century was stupid, and that's simply not the case. As one notable example, the iron-age Greeks were well aware of PTSD - but war wasn't generally traumatic for them, since most of their &quot;wars&quot; were just shoving matches for bragging rights. What was traumatic was being attacked by a wild animal, a situation which is every bit as deadly as post-industrial warfare, and in which the person generally has little control and as little prior notice as in an artillery bombardment. They had laws excusing people who had been attacked by wild animals from certain obligations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the whole &quot;Grandpa's just sleeping&quot; mentality.  Kids can process quite a lot, it's usually the aversion they sense in adults that causes problems.  Kids are curious and open minded and don't have lots of preconceptions and hangups.  Meantime while you're waiting to ease kids into a concept, they're usually learning about it anyway but without any guidance.  For instance, I thought sex physically hurt women until I was like 8 or 9 because all I had seen was bad porn and no one explained it any differently.</p></div>		</li>
