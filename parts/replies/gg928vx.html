			<div class="markdown"><p>Having worked at a tire plant, I can tell you that manufacturers <em>hate</em> making colored compounds because you have to keep the equipment extremely clean.</p>
<p>This means separate mixers and lines for the colored rubber to keep carbon black contamination away.</p>
<p>It’s a lot easier to make every rubber black and let the plant be an absolute filth pit - black hides all your sins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the misfortune of working in a carbon black warehouse for a bit and that stuff gets absolutely everywhere and is nearly impossible to clean. </p>
<p>Really a nasty substance. </p>
<p>Also, carbon black will spontaneously combust occasionally, so that's fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible, but removing the carbon black from the rubber and replacing it with other fancy-colored compounds would change the chemistry of the tire enough that the new colors would have to go through <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/tires#nhtsa-action" target="_blank">NHTSA safety testing</a>. That's a big upfront commitment from the manufacturer. </p>
<p>Plus there's the difficulty of finding something with the same properties as carbon black that looks bright red, blue, etc., after everything is mixed together. I'm sure it's possible, but it's gonna be a lot more expensive than carbon. </p>
<p>Then you have to consider the cost of manufacturing the tires-- you'd be taking at least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_manufacturing" target="_blank">two of the five departments in a tire plant</a> offline to change out the chemical ingredients for the colored tires. </p>
<p>So making fancy-colored tires for cars could be done, but it would be really expensive. No manufacturer would take on that risk unless they were sure they could sell a LOT of those colored tires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw tires with red blue or yellow strips on the tread in the late 90s. I heard they were quickly banned because they left colored marks after burn-outs that look like traffic lines and could cause a wreck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would probably explain why Goodyear's glowing tires from decades ago didn't catch on.  Sure they were cool, but likely too expensive to be practical (plus it opens people up to theft of their totally sweet glow tires).</p></div>		</li>

<p>they add carbon black to rubber though, rubber isnt naturally black</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have purple bike tires, and you can get other colors as well, Panaracer has yellow, green, blue, orange, purple... And tan sidewall tires are also common on bikes. The majority are still black though.</p>
<p>Interestingly the color panaracer tires cost the same as their black ones, but the color is one of the reasons I picked their tires over some other brand. And Id even be prepared to pay a bit extra for the color one if that was the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're similar. Carbon black kind of a more industrial, refined version of soot. It's also used in plastics and other polymers for similar durability reasons, but in tires it's also structural somewhat.</p></div>		</li>
