			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO only good answer here. Art is not primarily about skill anymore and is free to do whatever. We don't need another way to capture the reality if photographs can do it so much better and far more realistic. Oftentimes it is about completely different aspects of it than realism. Art has to be clever in a way to be considered good art and show some not so obvious skills like composition or how well it is executed in general for example. A trained eye can see a really bad composition or if someone doesn't know what they are doing on the canvas. </p>
<p>There are paintings or art pieces that are hard to understand, and that's why you should read the texts at the museum and try to understand the artists intention and maybe learn why they are important. Meaning of art goes far beyond of what you perceive in the first seconds of looking at it. Oftentimes what art is, is more metaphysical. </p>
<p>Also museums are there to gather art that somehow reflects on the society it is being collected in. It is used to find a collective identity through those examples.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd seen a lot of Rothko prints before standing in front of my first real one at Moma. I was very emotionally moved by the real one, but not really by any prints I'd seen before. I often wonder about that.</p>
<p>I should say that prior I wasn't a huge fan of Rothko, or abstract expressionism. Since then, I've spent significant time and money travelling to see art of this type. Something about a gallery - the collection and appreciation of art as opposed to it's functional use in making a wall less boring - really appeals to me.</p>
<p>I think that core idea, that there is a space where collected art is curated and displayed, a space dedicated to reflection and consideration, is special.</p>
<p>It's like the difference of travelling to a remote location to holiday and just hanging out at home for a week. The dedication of space and time, and change in surroundings to something different, the whole process of travelling ... it all leads you somewhere different. Gallery's are like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great points. Another thing about Pollack was that he was already famous for doing extremely realistic paintings, he became frustrated and felt limited by it, and that is why he broke free and starting doing the splatter paintings. If he just started with abstracts he would probably still be unknown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. There’s also a YouTube channel called The Art Assignment that does a really great job of tracing the conceptual history of art. She has a series called “The Case For...” where she explores the value (or perceived value) of certain artistic movements/styles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm definitely stubborn and as much as I watch 'The Art Project' on youtube and other short read/view mediums that attempt to explain modern art, I still don't get it; BUT</p>
<p>How does watchmaking have more romance in art... Than art. </p>

<p>We don't need beautiful handmade watches since a $10 quartz (battery) watch is more accurate than a $50k mechanical watch. It's about the beauty, which yeah it's subjective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answere, people like to think that modern art is about politics and branding but that is not the case. Modern art is about being interesting or deep, calling something pritty or accurate is really more of an insult in the gallery.</p>
<p>I think a good analogy can be found in reddit, we dont care how well crafted a meme is, we care about how clever it is in the context of our past meme history. This is why some of the best memes out there arnt even funny for the untrained eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go to a museum of contemporary art and tell me how much you actually find clever, interesting or deep. When I went to the museum in Barcelona they had fucking <em>colored toast</em> on exhibition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People learn about art for years befor they can understand it. I am not a contemporary art guy, so I dont know what colored toast means, but that is kind of the point. People who are into contemporary art need to see things that THEY find interesting not something for the plebs to enjoy. I dont mean that they can only enjoy something that the simple man cannot enjoy, I mean that they are having a decades long conversation with color and texture, It would be remarkable if you could jump in the middle of it, with no context, and understand what is being said.</p>
<p>My mom is a potter, so when I see pottery I can understand some of the language they use. For example: The handle of a cup needs to be thick on top and thin on the bottom, So if its the same width all throut it suggest industry and if its thicker at the bottom then its unatural and strange.</p>
<p>Another example is with big chanks of clay, if you just put a big chunk of clay in the oven it will explode, So if you see a big pice in a galery then you need to know its empty inside.</p></div>		</li>
