			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren’t mosquitos just a vector for yellow fever, dengue fever, West Nile virus, Zika virus, etc.?   (Malaria is caused by a protozoa I believe).<br />
I don’t know enough to know if those viruses are infecting the mosquitoes’ cells or if their guts are the perfect environment to keep the virus viable in order to be passed on to other mammals/birds without infecting the mosquito cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool. Is that unique to dengue? Or do other viruses replicate in mosquito cells too?          </p>
<p>It would be akin to this century’s Haber Process if we could replace a large percentage of the world’s mosquitoes with genetically modified ones that aren’t able to pass on all of these mosquito borne diseases. </p>
<p>Think of the lives that would be saved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As with rabies in bats, the togaviruses and alphaviruses don’t kill the insects because they replicate slowly at their much lower body temps. Any pathogen that is transmitted by vectors must be able to infect that vector and preferably don’t kill the vector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting!<br />
So there isn’t enough viral particles in the amount of blood that’s sucked up by the mosquito to consequently infect the next animal that’s poked by the mosquito?<br />
Or there is but there’s a much higher chance of subsequent infection because the virus can replicate in the mosquito and boost its numbers?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. I corrected that after I first posted. I knew that, I wasn’t paying close enough attention to what I was writing. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>And in an even crazier example, apparently there is a virus that can replicate in plant, insect, and human cells: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217494" target="_blank">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217494</a></p>

<p>That's amazing.  Does this mean that this virus is VERY OLD, that it was around before plants and animals diverged, maybe 1.5 Billion years old?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, it's just that a plant virus evolved to infect insect cells to spread more easily.

			<div class="markdown"><p>From reading the study it looks like it can replicate under laboratory conditions in human cells but I don't think it will actually infect a human. I agree that there isn't much characterization, though.</p>
<p>Plant viruses infecting insect cells is a known phenomenon, though. See: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215001622" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215001622</a></p></div>		</li>
