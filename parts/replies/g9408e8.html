			<div class="markdown"><p>I solved this by combining 2 methods.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Put a cup of water on your night table in the evening, to drink right as you wake up. I have read Japanese are doing it, gave it a try and  it works wonders for me. </p>
</li>
<li>Put second alarm on the other side of room, where you have to leave bed to turn it off. Prefferably some annoying loud alarm. </li>
</ol>
<p>After a short while, the combination of fresh water that gives you energy, need to sit up to not spill water all over your bed as you drink it, and threat of loud alarm going on that I can't just snooze, made me simply wake up on the first run.</p>
<p>After a while I dropped second alarm, it's no longer needed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly, I'm not advocating anyone else do this. But I LOVE snoozing for half an hour in 5 minute increments in the morning. I feel like I get time to process, mentally prepare (groggily) and not feel rushed.</p>
<p>I sleep 7.5 hours and snooze for half an hour for what it's worth, so I guess I get good sleep and then just take 30 minutes to wake up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend used to do this. She would go into work an hour before me and also took longer to get ready. So she’d be waking up 90 minutes before me. One alarm, fine, I’ll fall back asleep. Five alarms? Nope. I’m awake. Thankfully she’s been sleeping in since we’ve been working from home!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t want to sound like a new age hippie, but you might want to try mindfulness/meditation if you haven’t. I used to do the same thing as you. Now I have the Calm app and I do the daily meditation when I wake up. It takes ~10 minutes and I feel SO refreshed and awake when I get up.</p>
<p>Really sorry if this is preachy or weird. I just kind of rediscovered meditation in quarantine and it has seriously helped me. I wanted to spread that help around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plan to get 4.5, 6, or 7.5 hours</p>

<p>I don't think this is likely to work. 90 minutes is a very rough average, but it varies throughout the night as well as from person to person. </p>
<p>If you have a consistent bed time you can probably find the best wake time for yourself by trial and error, and also use phone apps to help estimate your cycles. But it's unlikely to be an exact multiple of 90 minutes.</p>
<p>The other thing is, it only affects how you feel when you first wake up. If you sleep for 4.5 hours and wake up at the perfect time, you'll still be in much worse shape throughout the day compared to sleeping 7 hours and walking in the middle of a cycle, other than the first few minutes of grogginess.</p></div>		</li>

<p>i just wrote a similar thing in another comment. i think 7 hours is better than 6 hours - the grogginess wears once you've started your day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each person is naturally a bit different, but it's a good baseline to start experimenting with. Personally once I started making an effort to fall asleep at a specific time in order to wake up at a specific point in my sleep cycle, I found it much, much easier to get up in the morning.</p></div>		</li>
