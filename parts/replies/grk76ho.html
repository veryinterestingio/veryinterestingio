			<div class="markdown"><p>Im from Israel and a good friend of mine is part of this project mentioned. The caves are mostly up in these cliffs where the entrance can be accessed only by repelling down the cliff face with special mountaineering equipment. He told me that most caves are knee deep in bat excrement, some go pretty deep into the rock face. They use special 3d mapping systems to map the entire cave and do a complete survey including the geological make up of the exposed layers. Their biggest find till now was a skeleton of a young boy, that find gave them further funding. No new scrolls found though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning that luck played a big role. They were placed in containers that happened to survive, inside a cave that happened to remain unfilled with rock or water. It's possible there were many more placed on top of or around the containers that had long since turned to dust</p></div>		</li>
