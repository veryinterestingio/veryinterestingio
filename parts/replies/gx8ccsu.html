			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually makes a lot of sense. So even if the ICE is using energy to charge the electric motor, the electric motor can use that energy much more efficiently than the ICE can at lower speeds, stretching out your mileage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, gas engines basically want to go around 55 mph and are less and less efficient as you go farther away from that. Right up to the extreme where you are stopped at a stoplight and the engine is literally spending gas and not moving. </p>
<p>Having a second electric motor let’s you just skip the gas engine all the times it would be especially bad and use it only when it’s more reasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The design of the Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive is brilliant, because of what it eliminates with a conventional drivetrain.</p>
<p>There are times when you can move the vehicle using battery power alone, do you need an electric motor for that, which isn't directly coupled to the ICE.</p>
<p>There are times when you want to charge the hybrid battery when the vehicle isn't moving, so you need an electric motor that isn't directly coupled to the wheels.</p>
<p>With the minimum requirement of two motors, you can cleverly use a planetary gearset to couple them to eliminate the transmission entirely. This is a costly and complex mechanism on most cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about the engine running slow; actually the engine's point of highest efficiency is at quite low RPM.</p>
<p>The main point is running at low output torque. Just to run, the engine must overcome a fixed amount of torque (to a first approximation) coming from internal friction. If you demand an output torque that is similar to that, you're wasting a lot of energy.</p>
<p>This is why automatic transmission chooses high gears when you don't accelerate hard: the lower the gear, the higher the torque output to produce the needed power output.</p>
<p>One way to improve the efficiency of an ICE (not used in cars, but used in diesel-electric), is to optimize its engineering towards a very narrow band of RPMs and power outputs and let it drive the electric generator within that regime all the time, producing fixed energy output that gets stored in the battery and delivered as needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Japan-only Nissan Note e-Power is (or maybe was, it might have been updated) a straight up series hybrid without even a way to plug it in to charge the battery like the i3... just an engine/generator that runs the electric motor, and a small battery that allows for brake regen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to mention though that the combustion engine is not the primary energy source in the i3 REx. It is merely there as backup in case you didn't get a chance to charge your car. </p>
<p>The thread is about hybrid cars that use an electric motor to assist a combustion engine. The i3 is a battery electric vehicle with a backup generator. </p>
<p>Using setups like that permanently has a major drawback; converting mechanical energy to electric and back is inherently less efficient than using it directly, and the vast majority of time you're driving a constant speed anyway.</p></div>		</li>
