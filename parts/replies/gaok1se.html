			<div class="markdown"><p>100% this. First time I went camping and to music festivals in Germany was weird. People walking around naked going to the shower in the morning or swimming. Then I just go over it because it's ridiculous. It's just people's bodies. I think it says allot about a culture where nudity or semi nudity is considered sexual and body parts everyone has being displayed by accident is somehow disturbing. Case and point: Janet Jackson's boob.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to a public swimming bath/sauna/health complex in Austria when I was in my teens. There was one big changing room where pretty much everyone of either sex was changing, and comfortably nude. There were some cubicles for American visitors, and others who wanted somewhere to hide. Once you've seen a bunch of 80 yo grandparents nude, and people of every age, body type and degree of fitness, you start to realise that nudity is a just a big fuss about nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The thought often occurs to me that cultures which shame the human body, must surely be full of humans that don’t actually know what humans look like. Can you even imagine? People who only know what a human looks like via the mirror and photoshopped super models. How depressing to not know what your own species looks like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This!
When I was in High-school I mistakingly thought I was fat and didn’t like my body because I had never seen anyone else’s except for models on TV. My college had a streaking team and after seeing a bunch of naked students I realized that people look pretty weird and my body was totally good and normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very relaxing to see what real bodies look like. I grew up where swimwear was optional and even as a teen, while still self-conscious about my body, I also knew that no one looked like the people in magazines (not even the people in magazines). Seeing people who are comfortable with their imperfect, perfectly human bodies is a good example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even still, that's a fairly recent thing. Women in the US could get a citation for indecent exposure as recently as the 1960's for wearing a two piece bikini. And even to this day there are incidents where people will call the cops or start a confrontation over a bikini that they deem to be too revealing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heavy on the control freaks. The most easily offended are often the loudest and well, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Those people are also most likely to participate in local governments, which are where most of these prudish rules come from. Those who just want the govt (and everyone else) to leave them alone and mind their own business tend to do just that and not participate in politics at any level. Leads to a lot of local tyrant, big fish in a small pond, kind of people. See any HOA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree here!  As Americans, the first time we went to a nude beach (St Martin) it was a little weird to be naked and have a normal convo with a stranger until I thought about how crazy stupid it was to be uncomfortable.    Years later we accidentally walked onto the nude beach in Barcelona and could appreciate how much of a non issue nudity is.  Americans are pretty judgy and uptight.</p></div>		</li>
