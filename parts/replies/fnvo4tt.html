<p>i've always wondered if different PEOPLE experience time differently. you know professional athletes, or even esports professionals with next-level reaction times- could it be that the world around them just seems slow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think everyone can experience time moving slowly. A car crash is a good way to slow time down. </p>
<p>Also jumping off a cliff into water or snow... what looks like a second to observers feels like an eternity falling through the air to the jumper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People definitely experience time differently. There is something called time blindness, which is basically the inability to gauge the passage of time. It could be that time is going faster or slower than it really is. Many people with adhd have this, which is why they can hyper focus on something and have no idea how much time has past and then miss something they were supposed to do. It also goes in the other extreme and they can get bored instantly and 10 seconds can feel like an hour. Time is a weird concept I don’t really understand, probably because I have adhd. Time is passing but I never know how long and sometimes a month has past and I haven’t even realized it, like it seems something happened yesterday but it was actually a month ago.</p>
<p>Edit: in response to your comment about professional athletes or esports professionals - their awareness of the situation is higher. They are able to take in more variables than an average person because they have practiced so much. So playing a game, it might seem like things are going fast because everything is new to you, but for them, it becomes very repetitive and habitual. This is why you need to practice to be good at things. So in some sense, they are experiencing time more slowly than you but it’s something they practiced and prepared for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really a perception of time issue. Flies resting for three seconds may seem, to them, like they rested for three years but they still only rested for three seconds. The reason why that three seconds is enough for them to &quot;catch their breath&quot; is because they're tiny. They don't need nearly as much oxygen as we do, and the way they breathe is a lot more efficient at their size.</p>
<p>That's different from sleep though. I dunno anything about how that works with insects.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's <em>literally</em> what &quot;perception of time&quot; means: not <strong><em>reality</em></strong> of time but how it is perceived by others in a different frame of reference. That linked article gives a nice ELI5 explanation.</p></div>		</li>
