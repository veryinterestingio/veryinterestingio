			<div class="markdown"><p>If the horse is put down because it is suffering but kept alive if it has valuble sperm then I'd say the reason it's put down or not is economic and not compassion.  The prospects of putting in the time energy and money to help the horse recover to a level where it will never <em>win</em> races again seems to be the reasoning to put it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years upon years ago I worked at a stable for a guy who didn't race horses.  He rented them out for rides occasionally, had studs for hire, and just loved horses.  He put down his favorite horse because its leg broke.  It would have healed over a very long period and he tried to, but it got infected so he put it down.  </p>
<p>These scenarios happen fairly often. Only a small fraction of horse owners actually race their animals.  Most have them because it is a pet / family member that they love.</p>
<p>They are extremely therapeutic and help a lot of people with PTSD, anxiety, depression, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You have it backwards. The reason it is kept alive is economic, not compassion. A horse with a broken leg kept alive for it's sperm will be in pain for the rest of its life, which will be short and unpleasant.</p></div>		</li>
