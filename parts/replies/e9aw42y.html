			<div class="markdown"><p>You mention a 1000 amps can go through the pan. I have 2 questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If my pan is completely metal, why are those amps not going through me when I hold the handle?</p>
</li>
<li>What would happen if I held a copper wire to the bottom of that pan (presumably the part that is reaction to the induction) when the induction stove is on and I held it with my bare hands?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current circulates around the base of the pan.  Also, it's a very high current at rather low voltage -- just a few volts.  The resistance in the pan is a few milli-ohms, and the resistance of your dry skin is a few mega-ohms -- so, compared to the pan, it's basically an insulator.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So... I kinda can hear my induction cooker. Does it mean I have really good ears or a bad cooker?</p></div>		</li>
