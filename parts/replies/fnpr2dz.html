			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't explain its origins, only what the hand sign means. it might be its origin from that saying yes, but in my language we have a saying &quot;doorgedraait&quot; which literally translates to, &quot;turned too far&quot;, &quot;twisted too far&quot;. Which could just as easily explain the hand gesture. &quot;doorgerdraait&quot; as referring to someone who went crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a similar &quot;wound too tight&quot; or &quot;too tightly wound&quot;, but that's more somebody who's very tense or hyper. I've also heard not-too-tightly wrapped, which is closer to crazy, I think.</p></div>		</li>
