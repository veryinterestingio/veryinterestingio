			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's exactly like this is my country. The IRS sends you a note saying this is your tax this year, if it's okay, you don't have to do anything. If you think it's not right, tell us about it. The end. It's super comfortable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Norway, we get an SMS that our tax report is ready in March each year. Then we log in to a government run website where we can see it and change the numbers if we have to. </p>
<p>Then you have to pay the owed amount by June, or if you paid too much already you automatically get a refund in June/August. </p>
<p>I spend about 15 minutes each year just double checking that my deductions and earnings are correct. Then I press OK and I'm done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, pretty much every country outside the US. The answer is &quot;regulatory capture.&quot; Almost all major US agencies are controlled by large organizations that use regulation to protect their revenue stream.</p>
<p>Here's the story of Intuit spending millions of dollars to prevent the US from making tax prep easier: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/03/29/521954033/stanford-professor-loses-political-battle-to-simplify-tax-filing-process" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/2017/03/29/521954033/stanford-professor-loses-political-battle-to-simplify-tax-filing-process</a></p>
<p>The US is only going to get worse until we get money out of politics and increase voter education and turnout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew there had to be a word for it.</p>
<p>Regulatory Capture. This is the thing that has made the US so backwards? </p>
<p>Almost every tradition/custom in the US seems to come from some insane marketing scheme that everyone has just accepted. Diamonds, weddings, insurance, taxes, TSA, tipping, almost everything food related, work hours, so on...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't you have to confirm their calculations at least?</p>
<p>I forgot to do mine in NZ and was fined $50 with the note that &quot;I now joined a minority of Kiwi that had not paid their taxes in time&quot; and then lists a number of government services.</p>
<p>I then did them and found out I had a $2000 rebate on my PAYE and my delay actually them a few extra interest cents. Still had to pay the fine though.</p>
<p>Not complaining, still beats the system of my native Belgium where if you do everything right, you're still paying more than twice as much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This idea of the IRS just sending you what they think you owe/what they owe you and amending that statement has been brought up multiple times in the past</p>

<p>One example was the <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/as-tax-day-approaches-senators-will-introduce-bill-to-simplify-tax-filing" target="_blank">Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2017</a></p>

<p>The Act would give all taxpayers the right to download third-party-reported tax information that the IRS already has, and would provide those with simple tax situations with a return-free option</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Free market, except &quot;regulatory capture.&quot;  </p>
<p>It would be pretty easy to buy a new car without having to waste your life at a dealership... but nope.  The car dealers have angled laws though state houses to protect their positions - even though they do not benefit the communities at large in any way.  </p>
<p>The mattress industry sucks in just about the same way as the auto industry, but somehow the mattress and furniture stores have not managed to &quot;capture&quot; the market... so now we can get ripped off by the two mattress manufacturers directly.  I prefer this, because that takes out a layer or two of middlemen that don't need to add their markup an BS.</p></div>		</li>
