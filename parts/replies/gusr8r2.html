<p>The risk of blood clots and venous thromboembolism is significantly decreased when estrogen is taken in a transdermal or vaginal route.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not for nuvarings. It's often promoted as a less hormone, local effect thing, but nope, the daily dose released in the blood stream is the same as oral combined BC, just at a more even level. The clotting risk is the same if not slightly higher (depending on the study). For patches I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, as far as vaginal hormone, I was referring more to products like Estrace which is not used for birth control. Same with the patches I am referring to. </p>
<p>We need to also make the distinction between synthetic estrogens/progestins and “bioidentical hormones.” I realize that term has become something of a marketing term, but most forms of contraception contain progestins which have higher incidents of breast cancer compared to estradiol and progesterone. </p>
<p>I don’t think either product should be demonized, but there may be unnecessary health risks with certain hormones over others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, there are also significant health differences between synthetic and bioidentical estrogens. To the point that, for hormone replacement therapies, it's arguable that synthetic estrogens should be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>I also cannot stress Ravage135's point that route of administration for estrogen, in particular whether or not it is metabolized in the liver, matters quite a bit when it comes to clotting risk.</p>
<p>While this is mostly through the lens of transfeminine research, there's a lot of great information and citations on this page regarding risk of blood clots and different kinds of estrogen and progesterone: <a href="https://transfemscience.org/articles/estrogens-coagulation-blood-clots/" target="_blank">https://transfemscience.org/articles/estrogens-coagulation-blood-clots/</a></p></div>		</li>
