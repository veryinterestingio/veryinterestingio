<p>Additionally, packing of cylinders in a hexagonal lattice is pretty close to packing of hexagons, so the gains are relatively minimal and if you need cooling channels regardless, may be non existent.</p>
<p>edit: according to wikipedia (and easy to verify geometrically), hexagonally packed circles fill up slightly over 90% of the area: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing</a></p>
<p>so for it to make sense to go with hexagons or squares, the space (rather than weight) has to be an extreme premium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In electric cars they have to circulate coolant through the gaps to keep the batteries at an even temperature - they have to be heated when it's cold and cooled when they get hot, and if they get too hot your car burns to the ground because yay, lithium fire!</p>
<p>Tesla actually worked out that if they start to warm the batteries up as you get near a charger they can charge faster - burn some power to speed up the charging.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And edges and corners create potential failure points from any number of causes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this- the surface area and space between cells is important when it comes to heating/cooling needs, especially for outdoor applications like an electric car battery- you want to have a good volume/SA ratio to allow for sufficient thermal management. </p>
<p>If you have a lot of square batteries all pressed up against each other, with no space between them, they could overheat much easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Comment edited (less general assertion about packs in general) to reflect corrections by u/DovtorWorm_ below</p>
<p>That is not neccessarily as important as you think. The rolled up sheets has terrible thermal conductivity through the layers, but quite good along the sheets (since they are copper/aluminium). This means that battery cells conducts heat poorly radially, and much better axially. Battery packs for electrification can be effectivly cooled by water cooled plates in contact with the end (typically negative end), for both cylindrical and prismatic cells (I am unsure about pouch cells, but it should be true for them as well). Prismatic cells can then be packed tightly without thermal problems, provided the cooling system is adequate, but that goes for all high power batteries</p>
<p>Your train of thoughts makes a lot of sense when looking at it from the outside, but less so when the inside is considered.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In addition, you have the highest ratio of volume to surface area with a round container. But if you go with a sphere you lose a lot of volume when you pack them. It turns out that a great balance of volume to surface area and packing units comes from cylinders instead of spheres or square prisms.</p>

<p>This is only tangentially related, but this video by the Engineer Guy on youtube explaining the design of aluminum cans touches on this as well:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw</a></a> </p>
<p>The whole video is surprisingly fascinating if you're at all interested in product design or engineering.</p></div>		</li>
