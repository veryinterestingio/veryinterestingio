			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any examples where you can see the whole strawberry? I feel like this video could easily be a situation where someone shoved a magnet in from the other side of the strawberry, since we can’t see that the other side is intact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know there are limits to a magnet’s strength (neodymium magnets being the strongest there is), but I'm saying, can you create an electromagnet (having no limit to magnetism because it can almost infinitely gain power by making more solenoid loops) that can pull/push electrons in nonmagnetic material?</p>
<p>It is said that electric current is the movement of electrons which are negative. Most metals will cling to an electromagnet because the electrons in most metals flow. So when a field from an electromagnet is presented upon the metal the electrons are pushed away from the electromagnets negative current or its (flow of negative electrons). However, most materials we consider nonmagnetic hold on tighter to their electrons not letting them simply flow around. This makes them nonmagnetic and do nothing in the presence of an electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>So basically i want to know if its possible to produce enough negative electric current from a battery and crazy strong electromagnet, so that you can push their electrons to one side rendering them positive on the side the magnet is on, making them stick to the magnet like metals do.</p>
<p>If not, are electrons in materials like wood/nonmagnetic material unmovable? This must mean that the nucleus of wood has a super powerful attraction to the electrons.</p>
<p>This guy pushes electrons away in water leaving the positive protons and pulling water close to his negatively charged hand.</p>

<p>Side note
—————-
Also what you said diamagnetism lifting mice and strawberries was interesting. So does this mean you can make diamagnetism/paramagnetism stronger? Can you attract/push away nonmagnetic materials in heavier amounts? Say something instead of a mouse, a pile of wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you’re conflating a few different principles here, but I can speak to the first paragraph. What you’re describing is exactly how the electromagnet in an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) works. In this case, a superconductor allows for huge currents to be carried without generating significant heat, thus generating a massive magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are heavily conflating magnetism and electrostatics.  In theory yes, you could use the wood as just a really bad wire in an electromagnet.  But electromagnetism and permanent magnetismmare fundamentally different things caused by different phenomena.</p>
<p>Any electron that moves will result in a magnetic field.  So I think what you are asking is technically possible?  Electrons will still move in insulators like wood, they are just really really bad at it and would probably catch fire/melt before working.  But if you ignored that it would probably work.</p>
<p>Also, metals won't cling to an electromagnet any better or worse than a permanent magnet. The water thing is entirely electrostatics, nothing to do with magnetism at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you can move wood like they moved water with powerful negatively charged viktage? Say i used way more voltage than he did and pointed it near (not touching) the water so it could attract it like they did in the video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we’re just using different words. The video you linked uses static electricity to bend the water. This doesn’t have anything to do with magnetism. On the other hand, electromagnets produce magnetic fields but they are not “magnets” in the sense I described in my original post. But I think I better understand your question now. As I said before, all materials will exhibit one of the 4 magnetic properties (although they may change which at different temperatures). A material such as wood is mostly carbon, and I believe it is diamagnetic. So yes, in principle with a strong enough magnetic field (generated either by an electromagnet or a ferromagnetic) you could induce a repulsive magnetic field in the wood and overcome the force of gravity. But it would require a crazy strong field. Here’s the video I was taking about of the frog: <a href="https://youtu.be/KlJsVqc0ywM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/KlJsVqc0ywM</a> Frogs are mostly water, which is also a good diamagnet.</p></div>		</li>
