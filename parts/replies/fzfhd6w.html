			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, that’s difficult for me to explain since I have no experience on the other side.</p>
<p>My moral compass lives in the greyest possible area and if I knew for a fact I would get away with it, I would probably do it. The only thing that really stops me is self preservation. </p>
<p>I change my personality to suit whatever social setting I’m in, and I find it really easy to do. I get along with everyone but don’t really like anybody. </p>
<p>I can understand “why” you are upset/sad/angry. But only on a logical level, not emotional.</p>
<p>I hate funerals because I have a hard time emulating the appropriate emotions and constantly feel like I will be outed.</p>
<p>I struggled a lot with impulse control when I was younger. Shoplifting, compulsive lying, snooping through people’s things, manipulating people to get what I want, etc.</p>
<p>This all still happens but becoming more self aware has allowed me to catch myself and stop the behaviour more often than not.</p>
<p>Edit: That turned out longer than I thought, apparently I like to talk about myself too.</p></div>		</li>
