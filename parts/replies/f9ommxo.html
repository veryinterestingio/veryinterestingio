			<div class="markdown"><p>There are likely several things going on here. There are follicle-associated sebaceous glands that produce sebum (waxy esters, lipids, etc.).  In puberty, these glands increase in size.  Later in life, as we exit middle age, these glands take a down turn, and sebum production/secretion will decrease.  This will change the texture and &quot;quality&quot; of hair.  </p>
<p>The hair matrix cells (the cells that will eventually become keratinized) are a source of some lipids, cholesterols and fatty acids, and age-related declines in the productions of these substances can result in changes in the texture, quality, and even &quot;look&quot; of hair.  </p>
<p>Concerning changes in coarseness, there really isn't much evidence to suggest that graying hair actually becomes more coarse (increases in diameter).  Not as a general rule, anyhow.  It may be the case that hair that is losing pigmentation may appear to become coarser, but the phenomenon is an optical phenomenon associated with the loss of pigment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently underwent treatment for oral cancer. (Successful so far. All clear.)  I was treated with X-ray radiation daily for six weeks and weekly infusions of CISplatin. I lost about 70 pounds, so calorie restriction could also be a factor. I never lost hair other than beard in the irradiated area of the neck. </p>
<p>My scalp and torso hair is now fuller, darker, finer, and faster growing than before. I’m over 60 years old and certainly won’t complain about this unexpected side effect !  It certainly beats the other possibilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might sound like a rather basic question, but is there some reason we have hair color to begin with? I.e. what's the selective pressure at play here? Is it sexual selection or is there some kind of advantage to having hair of a particular color or any color at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question to consider. Let's start with hair in general.  We (homo sapiens) are functionally hairless (with obvious exception being axillary, pubic and scalp hair).  </p>
<p>The best evidence to date suggests that the genus Homo became functionally hairless as our ancestral populations transitioned out of more densely forested tropical zones and out in to the open savannah.  It seems as if this functional hairless-ness coincided with increased epidermal keratinization and epidermal 'thickening', as well as an increase in the density (concentration) of eccrine sweat glands in the skin.  Why was all of this necessary? </p>
<p>Thermoregulation.  You had a bunch of hairless apes literally running around in the hot, sun-bright grasslands.  The hair had to go.  But when you look at our closest extant relatives (gorillas, chimpanzees/bonobus, orangutans), what do you see? Dark hair.  Nature selected for hairlessness, increased eccrine density, increased keratinization...and richly eumelanin-pigmented skin.</p>
<p>In the tropics, sunlight is more intense and less variable. The same can be said of the UV component of sun light. As we ventured out of the tropics, this was no longer the case.  Not only was solar radiation less intense and more variably intense, the UV profile changed.  Vitamin D synthesis requires a relatively narrow band of UV-B radiation.  We experienced this band less often as we ventured out of the tropics.  And eumelanin is a sunscreen! We needed Vitamin D. As a result those populations needed to lose some eumelanin.</p>
<p>We're talking about skin, now.  But the hair situation is somewhat analogous. The scalp hair still serves a purpose.  And of course the hair on our scalp experienced pigmentation changes as we ventured out across the globe, although Non-European populations continue to have predominantly dark hair.  It seems as if hair has not been nearly as powerfully selected for (in terms of natural selection) when compared to skin, and it has probably been subjected to some degree of sexual selection (if we're going to say that sexual selection isn't really just a subtype of natural selection). Not as much as iris pigmentation!   </p>
<p>So to reiterate the main point:  We had to ditch the hair (most of it), but we needed protection from solar radiation.  This led to eumelanin enrichment (among other changes).  And as we migrated, qualitative and quantitative changes in solar radiation necessitated further changes in pigmentation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cutting our hair is a very relatively recent phenomenon (hard to cut hair with a sharpened rock.) Our head, facial, underarm, and pubic hair would be long and bushy. Any color to the hair would make it contrast to the body causing us to stand out from one another and other primates. It also would trap our body odors leading to more pheromones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, what we think of as 'graying' is really 'whitening'.  We see it as 'graying' because we are viewing a composite of white hair and 'colored' hair.  It is also possible for hair to be whitened at/near the root yet pigmented for the remainder of the shaft.  Eventually time takes its course, and what we see as gray hair (a mixture of white hairs and pigmented hairs) will eventually become completely white.  This will occur at varying rates from person to person, of course. The most ancient among us will reach that all-white point.</p>
<p>Blonde hair is pigmented.  Firstly, it's a question of total melanin concentration.  Blonde hair will have a lower concentration of total melanin than, say, black hair (or brown, or red, and all hues in between).  Secondly, it's a question of the eumelanin:pheomelanin ratio. Darker hair tones will have a slightly higher concentration of eumelanin (98-99%) than blonde hair, and less pheomelanin that blonde hair.  Blonde hair may contain about 94-95% eumelanin.  Initially it may defy belief that such a small differential in eumelanin can result in such a noticeable difference, but when you pair the differential with a decrease in total melanin concentration this accounts for what we see.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that our hair can and does transition through a spectrum of hues over our lifespan development.  Without exploring the genetic mechanisms involved, you can be sure that these changes result from shifts in total melanin concentrations and shifts in that eumelanin-to-pheomelanin ratio.</p></div>		</li>
