			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this...</p>
<p>You specifically want to launch from the east coast (i.e. Florida as opposed to California). This is because the Earth spins from West to East, so you get an extra boost from the Earth’s rotation if you launch in an eastwardly direction.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes the Earth rotates at the same speed at all longitudes of <em>equal</em> latitudes. The reason for launching on an East coast is to </p>
<p>A) launch over the ocean and away from people</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>B) benefit from velocity boost by launching Eastward</p>
<p>You can only satisfy <em>both</em> conditions from an east coast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you want to go into a Polar orbit, then you launch from the west coast (e.g. Vandenberg) because you are launching north/south and the land areas rotate away from the launch vehicle on its way to orbit.</p>
<p>You still launch from the coast to avoid going over populated areas during the ascent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Especially because if you wanted to get into a true polar orbit then you would actually need to aim your rocket slightly west of true north (geographically speaking not magnetic), to counteract the spin of the Earth, which is carrying you at 1000mph East (assuming you launch from the equator). </p>
<p>Or of course you could just launch from the North pole where there is no east/west velocity from spin. But it might be a bit of trouble to lug your rocket all the way through the artic ocean to save a bit of fuel...and I don’t think Santa would be too happy about launching rockets in his backyard either</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They recently approved polar launches from Florida for rockets with an automated flight termination system (currently only the Falcon 9/Heavy). They will suffer from a slight performance penalty due to a small dogleg to avoid flying over Miami, but they will fly over Cuba.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in that case you'd be wanting to launch from a point with an as high (absolute) latitude as possible, so there is less momentum in the rotation direction of the Earth you need to cancel out, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, to get the most boost, you want to launch from as close to the equator as you have available. In the United States, that means Cape Canaveral.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Granted you could also launch from a site at a certain latitude to get you the oribital inclination you want while only having to burn due east.  Off the top of my head I'm not really sure which would be more efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s cool, didn’t know that. I actually just recently learned quite a bit about the shuttle’s landing procedures. It’s incredible how they got that thing on the ground.</p>
<p>The most amazing thing was that it’s pretty much an aerodynamic brick. It’s not like a plane thet can glide for ages in comparison. The shuttle as it was “gliding down” to the runway was falling (just vertical velocity not including forward velocity) at about 120mph, or roughly the same speed as a skydiver.</p>
<p>A typical plane would come into the runway at about a 3 degree angle, but the shuttle would come in at about 20 degrees. So this thing was like a brick hurtling towards the Earth before the nose was pitched up at the last second for landing. It’s incredible from an aerodynamics point of view...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a good example of why you want your launches to be done as far away from population as possible:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelsat_708" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelsat_708</a></p>
<p>A Chinese Long March 3B rocket carrying an American satellite failed to launch as directed. The Xichang Space Center, from where it launched, is in the mountains in western China as opposed to a coast. When the rocket landed, it plowed into a village. The 'official' report says that it killed 6 people.  Of course that number is disputed because China. It probably killed 200-300 people.</p>
<p>By putting rockets on the coast, especially on a peninsula like Florida, you cut the risk of something similar happening dramatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have doubts about the general authenticity of China's reports, but 200-300 people killed is a ridiculously large number. Unlike the cities, China villages don't have very high population density (no high-rise buildings) so unless half the entire village was gathered in a single building that just happened to be underneath the satellite, I think it'd be unlikely that more than a few dozen would be killed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not familiar with the area at all, so only have 'The CCP tends to skew numbers as it suits them' as a guide. I was thinking 'small-to-medium mid-west town if a fuel-laden rocket exploded inside the city limits'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m guessing the number is somewhere in between as well, but having watched what I <strong>think</strong> is all extant footage, I wouldn’t doubt it if someone told me they ended up confirming 300.  Not just flaming death and concussive shock but nasty toxic hell in the air for a wide area made worse by delayed emergency services.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important factor is that China (and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqW0LEcTAYg" target="_blank">Russia</a>) doesn't use flight termination as a range safety practice. US and European launches have explosives that destroy the rocket (by unzipping it and allowing the fuel to combust) in case the rocket or the range safety officer decide something wrong is happening. There's still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_IIR-1" target="_blank">a lot of burning debris</a> that could fall on  people, but it's not the same kind of risk. An out of control rocket could head towards populated areas in Florida (several of which are not much farther than the affected Chinese village), but it would quickly be destroyed. </p>
<p>On the one hand, launching from inland uninhabited(ish) areas has mostly been successful for the Russian and Chinese space programs. On the other, there are necessarily towns in proximity to launch facilities for support crew, and a flight termination system would have saved a lot of people in the case where rockets did land in populated areas.</p></div>		</li>
