<p>the idea that dispersion forces are generally weaker than a dipole-dipole interaction is true</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it actually isn't true at all.  </p>
<p>What people forget is that *every* molecule can do dispersion forces. The polar ones can just do dipole-dipole PLUS dispersion forces, where a non-polar one only has dispersion. It isn't that dipole-dipole is stronger, it's that it's an *extra* force of attraction on top of what's already there.  </p>
<p>Also that general pattern only really works for comparing molecules of the same size/ mass. Because otherwise the stronger dispersion forces screw up the pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it could still true even when we consider it as extra, right? It's like, if I get hit by a bowling ball AND a baseball, it doesn't mean that the bowling ball doesn't hit harder than the baseball. Right? Am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think his point is more that dipole-dipole forces and dispersion forces can vary, depending on electron count, bond polarity and molecular size. The dipole forces are not guaranteed to be larger by nature, they just happen to be when molecules are of similar size - which HBr and Br2 are not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the kinetic theory of gases, the average kinetic energy per molecule then equals 3/2*kT with k being the Boltzmann constant.</p>

<p>The posts talking about the mass of Br are wrong. At the atomic scale, the gravitational forces due to mass are vastly outweighed by the electrical forces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I don't have the expertise to confirm those explanations overall, it seems incorrect to assume that the weakness of gravitational interaction would have anything to do with whether they are right or wrong. Mass is vital to understanding the inertia of atoms, the amount of kinetic energy that they possess at a given average velocity, and the way their motion is influenced when they are acted upon by electromagnetic forces of a given magnitude. </p>
<p>The difference between getting hit by a bowling ball or a beach ball has a great deal to do with mass even though it has virtually nothing to do with gravitational interaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No he's right. The intermolecular interactions are doing the lions share of the work in this situation.  You're right about Bowling balls and beach balls, but bowling balls and beach balls aren't as sticky as atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point, though, wasn't about whether mass or other factors were more relevant for determining the outcome that OP is asking about. It was that the strength or weakness of the <em>gravitational interaction</em> is not going to be what dictates how relevant mass is. Pointing out that the gravitational interaction between atoms is very weak on these scales doesn't meaningfully answer the question of mass' role. And so even if it turns out that that mass isn't the key factor here, I think that to have explained it away by reference to weak gravity is still too misleading to be called &quot;right&quot;. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm missing or misreading something, though?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It has nothing to do with phase equilibrium however which is what determines the gas vs liquid phase of a substance at a given temperature and pressure.</p>
<p>Mass in general doesn't play much of a roll in thermodynamic equilibrium.  It shows up more in kinetics.</p></div>		</li>
