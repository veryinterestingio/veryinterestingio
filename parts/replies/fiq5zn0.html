<p>Results similar to x-ray crystallography are usually obtained with cryo electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), particularly using an approach called single particle analysis (SPA). A solution containing the desired protein/virus/cellular organelle is transformed in vitreous ice by very fast freezing, ginving you a sample with many randomly oriente identical copies of the protein. A TEM is used to acquire thousands of extremely poor images of these protein. The poor image quality is due to how sensitive biological materials are to irradiation with electron beams. These images are then merged together in software, yielding a higher quality tomography of the protein which is then transformed into a model, in the best cases even a complete atomic model. More information is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_cryomicroscopy" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, or plenty of other places. It's gaining popularity, as reflectred by the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2017/summary/" target="_blank">nobel prize in chemistry of 2017</a>, which was assigned for the development of this technique.</p>
<p>In SEMs you can look at much bigger objects (i.e. entire bugs) but one is mostly limited to observing their surface, and with lower resolution of around a few nanometers.</p></div>		</li>
