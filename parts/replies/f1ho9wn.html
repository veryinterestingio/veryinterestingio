			<div class="markdown"><p>Can anyone explain what is happening in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*#/media/File:Dusty_cloud_G2_passes_the_supermassive_black_hole_at_the_centre_of_the_Milky_Way.jpg" target="_blank">this image</a> from the Wikipedia page?</p>
<p>The caption says, &quot; Dusty cloud G2 passes the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.&quot;  Is this multiple images of the dust cloud stacked into one image, and showing red/blue shifts or is something else going on in the image?</p>
<p>EDIT: Whoops ... looks like I didn't scroll down when I looked at the image.  Didn't see the description.  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was interested in this too, if you click on details for the image, it will give more info. Here‚Äôs a copy paste:</p>
<p>This composite image shows the motion of the dusty cloud G2 as it closes in on, and then passes, the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. These new observations with ESO‚Äôs VLT have shown that the cloud appears to have survived its close encounter with the black hole and remains a compact object that is not significantly extended. In this image the position of the cloud in the years 2006, 2010, 2012 and February and September 2014 are shown, from left to right. The blobs have been colourised to show the motion of the cloud, red indicated that the object is receding and blue approaching. The cross marks the position of the supermassive black hole.

<p>Bob Brown provides the following rationale for the name: ‚Äú Scratching on a yellow pad one morning I tried a lot of possible names. When I began thinking of the radio source as the ‚Äúexciting source‚Äù for the cluster of H II regions seen in the VLA maps, the name Sgr A‚àó occurred to me by analogy brought to mind
by my Phd dissertation, which is in atomic physics and where the nomenclature for excited state atoms is He‚àó, or Fe‚àó etc.‚Äù</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Forgot to mention that.  Bob Brown is both the guy who named the star and one of the authors of the referenced ArXiV paper.</p></div>		</li>
