			<div class="markdown"><p>not anymore in the EU and the European economic area... fund transfers are rapidly migrating to instant transfer due to regulations from the european common bank. in my country for example you won't find a bank that doesn't have instant payments to other banks that support instant payments. we still have to wait for refunds though, and the time hasn't become any shorter. the reason for that is mainly payment providers (braintree, skrill, etc) which are the mediary between the company trying to refund and your bank, the other major reason is fraud detection and other bureaucratic fumbling on the company side. technically speaking there is no reason for refunds to not be instantaneous anymore in the EU.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Trying to explain to most Americans (and I'm American myself) that government can work and regulations can be a good thing is exactly as hard as trying to de/convert a religious person. Probably for the same reasons, it's hard to question dogma you grew up with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The faster payments system still operates as suggested, it’s just that when your bank puts a hold on your money the receiving bank adds “apparent” funds in the receiving account. The money isn’t really there until days later, but your bank gives you an interest free overdraft for the expected money. </p>
<p>When everything works this behaves exactly like an instant transfer, but if the batch transfer process (the slow one) fails you can find the money disappears from the receiving account, and if you’ve already spent it that can put you in the red. </p>
<p>This fraud mitigation process only works in the banks favour and actually opens up a whole host of potential frauds on the end user.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that's a common scam on Venmo, but I don't think that's quite how it works here in Sweden (with the Swish app) - once you've sent someone money, it's out of your account and in theirs in seconds, and there's nothing you (the sender) can do to cancel the transfer other than ask the person to make a new transfer back to you. My guess would be it's the same with the other European national instant-transfer systems.
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i mean if you want to get this pedantic about it the money never actually transfers, only an I owe you token for money. so the transfer is never instant because the money is never instantly transferred. the point is that the recipient and the sender both see it happening in real time regardless of bank. i know that the banks archaic balance management system does bulk transfers to other banks and vice versa, but that doesn't really matter in the end result except some fringe cases, like you literally can't get the money back from the bank even if they wanted to not fund it to the other bank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can happen instantly.  I've had refunds happen within minutes of the initial authorisation (I've had transactions finalised that fast too - this is the 21st century and there's no need for there to be delay any more - although overnight is more common with large stores).</p>
<p>What a lot of retailers do is they don't do refunds at all.. they simply never finalise the transaction, so it takes 14 days for it to disappear from your account and 'refund' you.  They then blame the bank when queried.  Luckily my bank lets me reverse transaction holds early.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone with modern enough systems I'd expect. </p>
<p>There was some talk of removing the split between hold and finalisation as it's a relic of the past, but never happened because a lot of large processors simply wouldn't have been able to cope with it.  Something close to it was actually mandated for fuel purchases (they can reserve £99 then have to finalise within 10 minutes) but even that seems to be slow going.. there's a <em>lot</em> of legacy hardware out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These answers are all sort of the same and don't address <em>why</em> it's that way.  I can click send on an email and it doesn't take a day to get to gmail, then another day or two to arrive at the destination.  The transaction happened, computers are quick, this should be instantaneous shit and most likely has more to do with investments and interest than any limitation on tech.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, for one there are more laws and regulations in place for financial transfers than there are for sending emails.</p>
<p>Also, I don't it's possible to commit fraud just through the act of sending an email (ignoring the contents of said email)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Banks transfer funds through a clearinghouse process, that's what waiting for something to &quot;clear&quot; means.</p>
<p>They batch up all of the transfers for a day and send them to the clearinghouse.  There they are combined with other banks, and instead of sending money bank on forth thousands of times, they are consolidated into a small number of lump fund transfers between banks.  This is a much more efficient way to move money around, and results in savings for the banks and ultimately the customers.</p>
<p>The reason the banks still do this is there is no reason not to.  The system works, and those few times you have to wait on a slow refund are rarely more than an inconvenience.  I can't think of a time when my life was ever disrupted in any serious way because I had to wait on a refund.  If you need to truly transfer funds instantly, that's what wire transfer are for.</p>
<p>Finally, the whole &quot;they are stalling so they can earn more interest&quot; is a silly conspiracy theory.  Unless you are hiding cash under your bed, that money is always in one bank or another.  Any money gained by stalling would be lost when another bank was stalling on them.</p></div>		</li>
