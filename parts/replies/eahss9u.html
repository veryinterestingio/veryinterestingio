			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I smoked literally 24/7 for 2 years whilst in college... I'd say it took a little more to get high after a while, but I think that's only because I was constantly high! Now, I smoke about once a day (a small pinch through a bong), and I often miss a few days. But, depending on the weed, even one puff can get me high... sometimes a little too high!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not as frequent of a smoker here (like every other night or so), but I have a slightly different experience. I'm naturally a super-lightweight, (for those of you who don't know, a lightweight is someone who can get high, drunk, etc., off of a very low amount of substance), and so usually i'll take a bong rip and be set for hours. But when I smoke daily, or bi-daily, I notice I go from 1-hit and being ripped to having to take 3 or 4 after a few months of repetition. </p>
<p>That being said, it's a common practice (at least in my group) to go a week or two (or longer) without touching the jazz salad just to &quot;reset&quot; our tolerance. I only did that when I used to smoke daily. I find that, for me, if I smoke irregularly, or mostly on the weekends, my tolerance sort of lessens and I get to save money by smoking less weed. </p>
<p>Edibles, on the other hand, are a whole different story. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was diagnosed with Myelodysplastic syndrome a few years ago, it's a form of blood cancer where my bone marrow doesn't work properly and produces immature cells or not enough cells. It was affecting my platelets mainly, the normal range for platelets is around 150-300. My levels were 100 two years ago, then over the past two years they steadily dropped all the way down to 65. Four months ago I started taking a full spectrum CBD oil every day and literally the month after I started taking it my platelet levels started rising. With my last blood test a few weeks ago my platelet levels were at 155. The only thing I've changed was taking the CBD oil, obviously I can't prove that this increase was due to the oil but I have no reason to believe otherwise given my levels started rising right after I started taking it.</p>
<p>edit: I've been getting a lot of requests for the oil that I use. I use Nuleaf Naturals CBD oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom has a severe case where she no longer creates even immature platelets.  The doctors keep trying to keep her between 20 and 40 and so she is always low.  I believe it is a mistake.  Her doctor finally did suggest CBD oil and so did I.  However she is being stubborn and quit taking it.  She will die in the next year or so.  It is difficult for me and my stepdad.  All I can do is be there for her when she needs me.  Three transfusions a week is just not a sustainable life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you mind listing the specific CBD oil you're taking? </p>
<p>My wife has the exact opposite issue -- over production of platelets due to a myeloproliferative disorder. She currently takes chemo medicine to manage her platelet count, which was nearing 1500 at one point. We tried CBD oil awhile back (non-THC) but it didn't appear to positively affect her condition. Wondering if a different blend might do the trick.</p></div>		</li>
