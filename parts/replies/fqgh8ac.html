			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an effect called coriolis deflection which affects objects in free fall. The helicopter in your example is not in free fall, but in controlled flight, so iy can land anywhere the pilot directs. If the helicopter were to drop out of the sky, then, barring air resistance, you can use the coriolis deflection equation to tell you about where it will land.</p>
<p>The coriolis deflection equation is (ω/3)(cosφ)√(8h³/g), where ω = Earth's spin rate ≈ 0.000073 radians/sec, φ = your latitude, h = height above ground, and g = acceleration due to gravity ≈ 9.8 m/sec.</p>
<p>If you are at 40° North and are falling from the edge of space, assuming no air resistance, you will land about 657 meters west of the point over the ground you started at.</p>
<p>If you were 500 meters high, you would land about 19 cm away. </p>
<p>The deflection is highest at the equator and goes to 0 at either pole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High enough that a helicopter cannot go. Yes you have to go faster to keep the same rate of revolutions as you get further away because you have to cover more distance in the same amount of time, but you forget that the atmosphere isn't disconnected from the earth. It's pulled right along with everything by the spinning earth. The higher you go the thinner it gets and there will be a point where you are not getting pulled along very easily, but your helicopter needs the air to stay aloft, so it cannot reach the hights needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is not how high, but how long. </p>
<p>What u/inlarry omitted is that the real reason you land on roughly the same spot is inertia. Simply put, when you are on earth, you move at the same speed as the earth rotation. When the helicopter takes off, it continues going at that speed, plus some vertical speed. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>On earth, the air moves at roughly the same speed as the earth, so the helicopter would pretty much stay in place however long you wait (winds may move it but that's beside the point). </p>
<p>If there were no atmosphere, it would be different. Since the helicopter now doesn't touch the earth, it now goes on a straight line. This means it would move away from the earth as time goes by.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure this example answers the question.</p>
<p>Hovering is kind of an active thing and your reference point for the hover is something on the Earth, which is rotating. I'm not sure how you could &quot;hover&quot; using the Sun or some stars as your non-rotating reference point.</p>
<p>Also, note that the Earth is not only rotating, but it is also orbiting the Sun. So, your hover using the &quot;fixed reference point&quot; needs to move around the Sun to match the orbit of the Earth, without correcting for the rotation of the Earth under you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you trying to miss the point?   /u/inlarry didn't mention a reference point that is fixed upon to maintain a hover.</p>
<p>The earth is moving, the air i moving with it, the heli is moving with it, it is all moving together.  It is a thought experiment involving a reference frame.   The same thing as if you were tossing a tennis ball between people on a jet plane.  You idealize the environment to make the model easier to understand.</p>
<p>If you wanted to nit pick heli physics, you could have started another comment thread yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why the hostility?</p>
<p>How do you &quot;hover&quot; a helicopter and adjust for drift and wind in any of the 6 directions without taking reference from something on the Earth? That's why you would end up in the same spot you took off at. Hovering requires constant correction.</p>
<p>But you want an idealized helicopter.</p>
<p>If your &quot;thought experiment&quot; requires a magic hover button and idealized helicopter that holds you in place relative to the Earth's center of mass and unaffected by air movement, then you actually would end up 4 rotational hours of distance away.</p>
<p>Only if you define the idealized helicopter and magic button to work such that it is not affected by local wind but is affected by the motion of the air and Earth do you end up with a helicopter that stays in the same place.</p>
<p>This is not a helpful thought experiment because you've had to assume a lot of odd things to get a very specific result, and you've had to define &quot;hover&quot; in a very specific way to get the result you want - affected by rotational air movement, but there is no wind or it is unaffected by wind.</p>
<p>It's not remotely close to the jet plane thought experiment. There, it is a lot easier to imagine that ball throwing is unaffected by the reference frame moving at a constant velocity.</p>
<p>Now consider the jet plane thought experiment when the jet is doing a loop to get you are rotating reference frame. Can the two people still toss the ball normally? No. Rotating reference frames aren't as intuitive to many people, including myself.</p></div>		</li>
