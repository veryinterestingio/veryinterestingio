			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding on because someone might find it interesting. </p>
<p>These photos are from a beach here in Alaska. We often get trash washing up from all over the world. All beaches have whole trash items piled up but some beaches have a way of collecting even smaller bits, not quite micro plastics. This plastic confetti covered the ground below the logs and was piled up, sometimes a few feet deep all over. We've found thousands of beaches covered in trash but nothing like this before. </p>

<p>Edit: Some people seem more upset I no type good, instead of being upset by the trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of interesting. I didn't take photos, but I never understood the whole &quot;plastic degrades in sunlight&quot; thing because I have many plastic things and they've never looked to lose their shape/features despite existing for many years. </p>
<p>Well, I have a window in my spare bedroom that is letting the heat out in winter and since the room is mostly where I keep my electronics workbench, I sealed up the window with plastic window film and bubblewrap insulation my first winter here and left it alone. Because I am lazy like that. It has been three years and I've decided to remove the film this summer. Turns out the bubbles of the bubblewrap part disintegrated and turned into what basically looks like dandruff when touched. The plastic is dry and brittle from years of direct sunlight. It was a nightmare to clean up!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally that's one of the reasons why people have to replace pool stuff like nets, brushes, and chlorine dispensers way more frequently than one would expect at first, between the constant exposure to sun, water, and often rather harsh chemicals it just all breaks down rather quickly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer.  One thing to add: the plastic is much more spread out than people think.  Take an Olympic swimming pool and throw <em>one</em> empty plastic bottle into it, then grind the bottlecap into a fine powder and add that as well.  Mix thoroughly.  That's the concentration of plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</p>
<p>The total mass of plastic is huge because the area is so big, but people envision the garbage patch as being a thick raft of plastic as far as the eye can see, when in reality it looks like any other patch of ocean unless you look carefully.</p>
<p>Dramatic photos of the GPGP almost always show places where the plastic has been concentrated, either by artificial means (nets and trawling) or natural processes (wind blowing onshore). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another issue to consider is because the garbage patch is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it isn’t really in the jurisdiction of any one country, and no country can claim full responsibility for it. The cleanup and maintenance would also cost a tremendous amount of money, so several countries would need to cooperate on the project, and the countries that seem to be the most responsible for the garbage aren’t historically great at cooperating to solve environmental issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree in times of emergency, just trying to get cool, or get cool.  Tresspass, walking down the middle of the street, emergency flagging, and just continuing on the way home.  Setting up an emergency AC unitit because you are about ready to collapse?  Beeen there done that.  In an absolute emergency, do whatever you want to save your own life.  :(  Been there, done that.  I was just tying to not die.  I've boarded the metro before, with not mask at all, very very close to heat stroke, he le altered the route and drove me directly home.  It was an emergency.  Developing very quick.. :(</p></div>		</li>
