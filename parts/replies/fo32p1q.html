<p>So how sickle cell was described to me by my bio teacher was that some people had red cells that mutated to be sickle cell, these people were less susceptible to malaria and so survived malaria. Having survived, they were able to pass on their genes whereas the people that did not have the sickle cell mutation died of malaria and were not able to pass on their genes.</p>
<p>The HIV/AIDs immunity would be another mutation but it didn't happen because of exposure. It happened because we, as living creatures, mutate. This mutation just happened to be an immunity to HIV.</p>
<p>We see this all the time in things like fruit because we do selective breeding... take watermelon for example. The watermelon used to be mostly bitter green flesh but after centuries of humans only eating the ones that were sweeter, juicier, and had more red fruit for us to eat, those ended up being the seeds that we planted. It was a useful mutation (to us) and so survived to mutate again, get selectively chosen to be planted, and after hundreds of years of this we have modern watermelon. </p>
<p>This National Geographic article has tonnes of info and pictures of old watermelon from old rennaisance artists <a href="https://api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/news/2015/08/150821-watermelon-fruit-history-agriculture" target="_blank">https://api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/news/2015/08/150821-watermelon-fruit-history-agriculture</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Well done, honestly, that was probably the best word you could have used.</p></div>		</li>
