			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for your voice sounding funny to you in recordings is because when you talk you are hearing your voice resonating through your nasal and sinus cavities which make it sound more resonant and usually deeper to you. When you hear a recording you are only hearing the sound from outside your body and not resonating through it. Also most recording devices do not have the ability to pick up the low end, more resonant tones in everyone's voices which adds to the only hearing the higher tones. </p></div>		</li>
