			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi Eleadnor_konik, we gave a rather long answer around this to u/MarijnBerg. Sorry, we saw that one first! If you have any further questions or want us to expand on anything in that answer though please let us know!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In a real laymans term...</p>
<p>It looks at normalised harms in our leisure activities. Deviancy is inverted by commodification and commercialisation. Think of how tattoos are seen now compared to before... which shows deviancy cannot be viewed in its traditional sense.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense, let us know if not and we can re-word it!</p></div>		</li>
