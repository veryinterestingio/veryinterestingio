<p>But actually, you have to do a lot of the same stuff to make a patient feel comfortable, obv not the slutty stuff I listed or you'll get fired.</p>
<p>Some doctors arent very good. They won't introduce themselves, confirm patient name, ask the patient how they are doing, or anything really. They'll just come into the room, be like &quot;hey I hear you have a flu, here's a script and the nurse will take a sputum sample to confirm. Have a great day.&quot;</p>
<p>Those guys get a really bad score, if they miss more than 70% of the target items, they get a complaint card and have to get tutoring on how not to be a dick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I had one of those doctors today actually, I've just got out of hospital. He wasn't a dickhead or anything, just very blunt and to the point. He was older though, so I'm guessing he's just a bit old school.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do have a question, do you choose your stage name or is it given to you? And if you did choose it, why candy? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, my real name and stage name isn't Candy, I just picked it for this.</p>
<ul>
<li>You normally choose your own stage name. The management might make you pick a few and then they choose one. Sometimes your first choice doesn't match the clubs vibe, a really ghetto name isn't acceptable at a fine establishment, vice versa. Ghetto/trashy names and classic stripper names are usually discouraged. </li>
</ul>
<p>Your first choice is normally always taken and you can't have more than one girl with the same name. You see a lot of girls with the name Alexxx, Candiii, Alexxxis, Kenziii, ect. This is how they keep track of the girls who may have worked there in the past and are inactive, so the name is sort of free again. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I chose my name because it was sort of my middle name. I've only ever had to go by my backup name for a few weeks when a more senior stripper with my name showed up. She had danced for 15 years, myself only 7. I use my backup name as my stripper last name.</p>
</li>
<li>Needing to know a girls real name is annoying. Guys who are insistent have got issues. We make fun of them. They think this is a game, and my real identity is 50 points or something. I give them another fake name to satisfy them. Sometimes the want a last name too. They don't realize how creepy they are being. You know they went home and tried to look up my &quot;real&quot; details on FB.</li>
