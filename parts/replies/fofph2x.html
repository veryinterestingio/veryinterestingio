<p>Most food, especially those in the &quot;healthy&quot; category, have a variety of vitamins, usually more than you need.</p>

<p>I will also add that a many foods today are 'fortified' to add vitamins. Most dry cereals for example will have 10-25% of a lot of those vitamins and minerals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t exactly right. Your body can take beta carotene and turn it into vitamin A. I’m not sure how many other nutrients this is the case for, but there are some that you only need the precursor for. I haven’t eaten animal products (sources of actual vitamin A) in a year and a half, but my doctor confirmed I have no deficiencies. The advantage to eating beta carotene is that your body only converts what it needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not gonna get into a big discussion about this on the Internet because quite frankly I just don’t have the energy, but if you look at my comment it says “in useful quantities” or something to that extent. The word “vitamin” is a portmanteaus of “vital” and “amine” - the term was derived to denote essential nutrients that our bodies simply can not produce in sufficient quantities if at all. I’m glad that you don’t have a deficiency (I do thanks to an unusual genetic condition and trust me it fucking SUCKS) but that doesn’t have any impact on the science behind the matter. Also, if it’s of interest to you, there is a vast wealth of vitamin A in MANY non-animal sources, including lots of leafy greens and melons. Perhaps you’re thinking of B12 which is the vitamin most vegetarians lack as animal proteins are the primary source outside of B12 fortified foods (of which many can be found on grocery store shelves).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A shorter version of what the other person said:</p>
<p>Vitamins, by definition, are essential <del>amino acids</del> nutrients that your body can't produce in any quantity as to fulfill that essential need.</p>
<p>The only reason Vitamin D is considered a vitamin is because in some parts of the world (and in winter time), people don't get enough sunlight to produce enough vitamin D.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so I have been stressing about this for a few months - I'm pregnant and they tell me to take a prenatal vitamin throughout my pregnancy. Occasionally I forget to take it (and even went a whole month ignoring the vitamins altogether because I felt too sick to get them down). You're saying my body probably has a nice little reserve going? I always assumed once you went to the bathroom your body flushed it all out and you needed to replenish... So I've been stressing for nothing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgetting a multi vitamin once in awhile isn't a big deal. But prenatals are important for folic acid. This is necessary very early in the pregnancy for formation of the spinal cord. As far as I know, that's the most important reason for taking prenatals. They told me to start taking it for 3 months before even starting to try.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You will be perfectly fine! When I was pregnant, there were weeks I couldn’t stomach a vitamin whatsoever (especially those gigantic ones, which are horrible). Even if I couldn’t take the prenatal, I would try and take a folic acid one (very small pill by itself). Honestly though, you will be totally fine either way!!!</p></div>		</li>
