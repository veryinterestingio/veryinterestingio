			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to capitalization, there are some other differences between languages.</p>
<p>In German all <del>Proper</del> Nouns are capitalized. Not just Names of People. So red House on a narrow Street behind Trees.</p>
<p>In finnish nationalities and languages are not capitalized. So when you write finnish, you write finnish, not Finnish.</p>
<p>EDIT: Mistranslated the word to &quot;proper nouns&quot; when I meant &quot;nouns&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Polish, we capitalize nationalities, but not languages.</p>
<p><em>He was German and was speaking german</em>.</p>
<p>We also capitalize personal pronouns in letters when referring the person we write to (out of respect), e.g.</p>
<p><em>I am going to visit You and Your family next month</em>.</p>
<p>It is also considered rude to capitalize <em>I</em>. In Polish, it should always look this way:</p>
<p><em>When we finally meet, i will be happy to have a drink with You</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Though there is no hard and fast rule on i, English is the only language to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I</em> is actually also a pronoun in Danish, and is always capitalized there, too—but it's the second-person plural pronoun (&quot;y'all&quot;). The pronoun with the same meaning as English &quot;I&quot; is <em>jeg,</em> which is not capitalized. Unlike in English, lowercase <em>i</em> is also a word in Danish, but it's a preposition generally equivalent to English &quot;in&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
