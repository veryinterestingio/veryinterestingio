			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be a whole wide range of things. Internally most likely you could have a micro muscle spasm, or cells in a certain area of your body will try to discharge something from itself and hit the nerve cells from the inside which can trigger the same response. Externally water/sweat and wind blowing the right way could move hairs in such a way as to mimic something crawling on your skin. Additionally small particles such as dust, dirt, or pollen on your skin can also trigger than same response</p></div>		</li>
