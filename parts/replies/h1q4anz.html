			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really super interesting and I'm glad you shared it, seriously. If it makes you feel any better I'll say ow when I bang into something and it doesn't even hurt. Maybe it's a surprise thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I think it's just an automatic response as a surprise. There's often a delay before you feel the pain, so I'm guessing we just assume it's going to hurt, so we say ow almost preemptively.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's mediated by systems similar to those involved in the  &quot;hand in the mirror&quot; illusion (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00200/full" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00200/full</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to say “ouch” when an object I’m holding hits something else. Definitely learned, possibly surprise.
Tends to happen more when the object is valuable (violin, laptop).</p></div>		</li>
