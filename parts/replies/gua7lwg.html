<p>it's the part involved in viral entry into human cells </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also wanted to emphasize this as part of the reason. Adaptive immune response (what we generate with vaccines) has two sides - cellular and humoral (in the blood). The cellular response is basically training your cells to recognize and kill any of your infected cells, which is great and all, but humoral response is training your cells to make antibodies that can circulate in your blood and stick to viruses. The cellular response can be to any part of the virus, but it has to wait until a cell is infected to help, which is usually slightly less ideal, so targeting internal proteins is usually not as good of an idea.</p>
<p>But even if the protein is on the surface of the virus, the humoral response isn't quite as effective as it is if we target the spike protein - the part that actually lets it enter your cells. The antibodies stick to the spike, and literally prevent the virus from getting into a cell, as well as marking it for eradication by your body. So spike just makes the most sense to target. Not that others can't be effective vaccines, but if you're gonna choose one thing to target, it might as well be the spike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.. But not really. Science, especially immunology, is pretty much a case of &quot;it's always somehow newly broke so let's try to fix this part of it that we sort of seem to understand at this particular moment&quot;.. It's more so that the work, money and time involved in getting a new or even half-baked vaccine (so to speak) targeted to the nucleocapsid is very daunting and far-away-seeming, given the current availability and current efficacy of Spike-directed vaccines.</p>
<p>The relatively low mutation rate and the robust antibody response to nucleocapsids is very promising compared to the high mutation rate of the Spike, and you can bet that research teams are all over this at the moment.. </p>
<p>Here's an open access and layman-oriented take on the matter:</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/covid-vaccines-focus-on-the-spike-protein-but-heres-another-target-150315" target="_blank">https://theconversation.com/covid-vaccines-focus-on-the-spike-protein-but-heres-another-target-150315</a></p>
<p>Note that it is written by one of the researchers involved in the characterisation of TRIM21 in this novel mechanism of nucleocapsid antibody action mentioned in the OP, so could be seen as a little biased in that respect. But it gives a pretty good overview in my opinion.. </p>
<p>And on that note, this would be the time to state that I have no direct involvement in vaccination/COVID research üòä</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spike vaccines are not new.  The technology has been around for quite a while, and is reasonably well studied and understood.  You just haven‚Äôt seen more of it because all of the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù targets for it already have effective vaccines with decades of historical and safety data on 100‚Äôs of millions of doses.  </p>
<p>N is newer, and there is still fundamental research being done on it/them.  When you are already rushing a new vaccine to market, you use the technology that has been in public beta for a couple of years, not the one in pre-alpha/tech demo.</p></div>		</li>
