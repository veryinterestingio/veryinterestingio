			<div class="markdown"><p>This point needs to be stressed more. No one is analyzing the data from the black box of an aircraft for anything less than highly-important, highly-public reasons. There is zero benefit to speed and extraordinary downsides to carelessness. Why would they take any less time than the amount needed to be 1000% sure?</p></div>		</li>

<p>highly-public </p>

<p>This is a huge part of it too. The average murder case maybe will make the local news, maybe. But even then they aren't going into tremendous detail on the news.</p>
<p>An aircraft crash is both a court <em>and public</em> trial about the death of dozens or hundreds of people. It's hugely public, locally, nationally, internationally.  So they need to be infallible. Aside from blame for this particular death of 100s of people, it could also lead to industry-wide changes that cost $billions. </p>
<p>Now with the weight of all that, imagine they release their &quot;hunch&quot; early. Or release their ruling when they're 90% sure. Then some new data comes in that proves otherwise. Not only does that fuck this up, but it tarnishes their record forever. All it takes is 1 mistake.</p>
<p>Then the next time you are 100% certain that Boeing/Airbus needs to change something that's going to cost them $billions, even tho you're right, what are they gonna do? The CEO is gonna be on the national news that night talking about &quot;look at their record, look at their past mistakes, they're wrong this time too&quot;. They'll be courting public favor, and they'll be lobbying the hell out of politicians to remove any authority you have to force the change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a pilot, but I am a control room operator for a large industrial system which is similarly complex.  I've got 10 computer screens, 5 TVs, hundreds of control elements and thousands of instruments wired into my system.</p>
<p>If something goes wrong, I can (usually) pinpoint the cause of the failure within minutes.  I can tell you X sensor went bad which caused Y valve to open and increased the pressure on Z.  I don't need to sort through an Excel file filled with a wall of numbers, because each of those columns has a unique tag which can be visualized and cross-referenced to other data.  That's how these complicated systems work- we're not hunting through binary looking for a 1 that's supposed to be a 0.</p>
<p>I feel very confident in saying that sorting through the data is <em>not</em> the largest part of the investigation process.  It's probably one of the shortest parts.  The real delay comes from the fact that when one of my sensors fail, I just put in a work order to get it replaced.  Nobody needs to go find a tiny piece of circuitry in a massive pile of smoking debris to examine every possible explanation for why it failed.  The black box data can tell the investigators where to look, but that's only the beginning of a very long and exhaustive investigation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you’re right on the money. It isn’t just getting the data, it’s working it over from every angle to make sure that they haven’t missed anything, because many human lives and an enormous industry and trillions of dollars  depend on the safety of airplane parts and operation. And airplane crashes are ALWAYS a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still cannot comprehend how these investigators investigate, find the causes, come to conclusions, complete investigations. I understand investigators in murder crimes as there is usually a motive (still complicated); but when it comes to incidents with complex machinery like airplanes, it always completely baffles me. Like e.g. how they reached the conclusion that a fault in a tiny screw caused a whole plane to fly upside down uncontrollably. I can't even reach a conclusion on what i should eat today and these people do big brain moves every single day for years on end. They somehow have the brains to do magic. I wish i was that intelligent and an intellectual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s already part of the analysis. There’s probably some algorithms that can go through an point out where data deviates from normal response. As someone who deals with large datasets, these algorithms are helpful in identifying abnormalities and other interesting phenomena. It then just takes some time to verify the results through secondary or tertiary analyses. Those additional analyses are probably even more rigorous when it comes to preventing the same thing from happening again, which is what I imagine flight crash analyses are actually aiming for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to that having to rerun simulations to identify downstream effects, gathering data from other sources to compare against, and the time it takes to process all that data. Just uploading the data to a simulation could take days depending on the hardware being used, and then finding the right data to manipulate for each simulation could take days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easiest thing to do is to just plot it and look at what is happening, plotting multiple parameters together to get a feel for how one parameter spike and another might indicate something.</p>
<p>Also make a bunch of calculated columns that are the derivatives of the sensor values, that way you can quickly highlight large changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't the imputs also get logged? I would guess state of cabin would not be too far fetched to log. Maybe not the continuous &quot;analog&quot; imput, but maybe a once every second snapshot of the controls and change of state of any relevant toggle.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Problem is that you only have the things that are instrumented.</p>
<p>As a hypothetical, let's say the plane's 3rd engine hit a 12&quot; rock tied to a balloon.  Your sensor data is going to have a lot of &quot;interesting&quot; results in terms of what that engine is doing, but a simulator will have no idea how to work with that.  There no &quot;rock hits here&quot; sensor for the simulation to work with.</p>
<p>So, instead, you have to have some humans seeing all this weirdness in the sensors on that engine, and working backwards to identify what could possibly cause such a thing.</p>
<p>Simulation will help you verify hypotheses (e.g. &quot;what would happen if a stray meteor hit through the right wing and destroyed a pair of hydraulic lines?&quot;), but it can't identify unknowns.</p></div>		</li>
