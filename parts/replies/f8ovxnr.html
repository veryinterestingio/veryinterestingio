			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to that - the Hubble telescope was launched in my lifetime and every extrasolar planet observed ever has happened since then. </p>
<p>Also - the Hubble deep field and subsequent ultra deep field photos - obviously - also in my lifetime.  </p>
<p>That might be less impressive to some, because we had an idea of how huge the universe was prior to that; but on a personal level, I consider the HDF and subsequent photos to be among some of the most important images in human history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You think that's fun?</p>
<p>The first confirmed exoplanet (a pair actually) was found in 1992. Prior to that we had no actual objective proof that other stars had planets, it was merely thought extremely likely.</p>
<p>To date we have confirmed the existence of 4,126 exoplanets spread across 3,067 different star systems and have several thousand more candidates awaiting confirmation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these tend to be the big ones like Jupiter and Saturn. Those same star systems could possibly have Earth-mass planets that we cannot yet detect with our current instruments. New space telescopes and the like are already being worked on that will help us find those worlds.</p>
<p>You are quite likely to live to see the first confirmed planet that humans could potentially live on be detected!</p>
<p>As a slightly more sobering counterfact though, habitability is an EXTREMELY narrow thing all things considered. We might find a planet within 5-10% of Earth's gravity that confirmed has oxygen and water in useful amounts, but has too much nitrogen or something in the atmosphere such that you'd merely die slowly instead of instantly if you walked around without technological aid. Unfortunately my precious scifi view of us walking around unaided and unmodified under alien suns isn't really likely. Chances are pretty good that it will be far easier to genetically engineer colonists to be able to handle that sort of atmosphere than it would be to try and make do through other means, inclusive of terraforming. Terraforming will most likely only ever really get you in the right ballpark to use other means to close the final gaps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd take that bet. We still have a very rudimentary understanding of how exactly our genes become our bodies. Some questions like &quot;what mutation causes this syndrome?&quot; are dead simple compared to the task of custom designing an entirely new respiratory system to deal with a different atmosphere for example. </p>
<p>Meanwhile we actually have a pretty good understanding of how to change atmospheric makeup. We're doing it right now just as a byproduct of our other activities. The timescales and energy levels involved are immense but if we just assume humanity's available resources continue to expand, then there's a pretty clear process for how we could, for instance, add a bunch of oxygen to a planet that already has the right gravity, orbit, magnetic field and day length. It's clear how, given say 1000 years where we don't bomb ourselves back to the stone age, we could get to a neighboring star system, develop an orbital economy (this would be the very first step, development in other solar systems will look like development in ours only backwards from space to planet), and get well on the way to changing the atmosphere of a suitable rocky planet if needed. Whereas 1000 years is a long time and genetic research is coming along quickly but custom tailoring the human body for significantly different environments is probably a much more complex ask than designer babies ot any of the stuff we can expect in our lifetimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a little bit of historical flavor to this, here's the paragraph in which Eddington discusses problems with the contraction hypothesis and proposes nuclear energy as the source of the Sun's burning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the contraction theory were proposed today as a novel hypothesis I do not think it would stand the smallest chance of acceptance. From all sides—biology, geology, physics, astronomy— it would be objected that the suggested source of energy was hopelessly inadequate to provide the heat spent during the necessary time of evolution; and, so far as it is possible to interpret observational evidence confidently, the theory would be held to be definitely negatived. Only the inertia of tradition keeps the contraction hypothesis alive—or rather, not alive, but an unburied corpse. But if we decided to inter the corpse, let us frankly recognize the position in which we are left. A star is drawing on some vast reservoir of energy by means unknown to us. This reservoir can scarcely be other than the sub-atomic energy which, it is known, exists abundantly in all matter; we sometimes dream that man will one day learn how to release it and use it for his service. The store is well-nigh inexhaustible, if only it could be tapped. There is sufficient in the sun to maintain its output of heat for 15 billion years.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What did Eddington think about the postulation of fission? It seems counterintuitive that both processes would release energy, so I would imagine Eddington might be skeptical that splitting an atom would release energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what Eddington thought about fission (it wasn't really his area of science, and he was essentially out of science when it was discovered — he died in a nursing home before WWII ended), but it's not counterintuitive at all if you understand it more than superficially.</p>
<p>(It's only counterintuitive if you think of it as &quot;how can opposite processes both give off net energy?&quot; But they don't operate on the same isotopes, at least not in a way that both gives off net energy. You can think of both as a subset of the same family of reactions — modifications to the nucleus — and they give off net energy only when you apply them to elements on the opposite side of the periodic table.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A chemist/physicist would know that certain things have high potential energy, while others have less. If you go from something with more to something with less, you will release energy. Whether the starting materials are large or small is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The key is to find high energy atoms, and figure out which lower energy states they can be converted to. In the case of nuclear stuff, this is really easy, since mass = energy.</p></div>		</li>
