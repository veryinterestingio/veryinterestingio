			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that it's not so much an estimate, but an approximation based on assumptions about future use. You can measure the power being used at any instant and integrate it over time to know how much energy you've used and compare it to previous discharge cycles.  </p>
<p>But to say 50% is remaining, isn't really meaningful if your consumption is all over the place.  </p>
<p>Here's an example: Back in the day, some phones would start using a lot of power if they were searching for a cell tower. So, you might get a day on the first 50%, and then go out of range and use the last 50% in an hour. Was that 50%? Well, it was 50% of the energy available, but, not 50% of the lifetime of the battery.</p></div>		</li>
