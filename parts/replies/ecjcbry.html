			<div class="markdown"><p>For me sleeping is the only thing that helps a migraine, although I have to do it within two hours. If I can’t get to sleep I ended up vomiting which sets a cycle of pain causing the vomiting and vomiting making the pain worse and then I’ll be in pain for around 48 hours. I use the Kool N Soothe packs on the nape of my neck and my forehead and they stay cool for 8 hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may have a combination of things going on. The fact that vomiting makes it worse and sets off a sequence of more pain makes me think that dehydration might be ONE factor at play.  </p>
<p>Have you tried drinking water with ginger in it to quell the nausea and to head off any hydration from vomiting?  If not, give it a try a few times. Drink plenty of the ginger water (or ginger ale with added ginger) and see if that stops the vomiting-headache sequence.  It might not help with the migraine but it might keep all your other symptoms at bay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I attributed them mostly to stress, but now you’ve mentioned dehydration I do wonder if the stress makes me forget to drink water. I’ve followed so many food/sleep/daily diaries to try and see what triggers is and we’ve never been able to pin it down. I haven’t been able to take migraine meds because I’ve been either pregnant or looking after my kids. Any meds I’ve tried have made me drowsy which is beneficial, but not great for good parenting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Migraine also induces vomits to my mom. Thankfully I've never puked out of pain. For me it's hours and hours and hours of every noise or light hiving a lot of pain and not being able of doing absolutely nothing but curl in my bed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be able to just sleep off a headache or a migraine maybe with a little bit of caffeine or something, but these days I can't at all. :( I usually have to combo painkillers, ice pack, sleep, and sometimes a massage from one of my parents if they can. I've been trying to take less painkillers these days since I feel like I take a LOT for my frequent headaches, but sometimes I just can't do it without them and it sucks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does caffeine help? I know that without my morning coffee I'll most probably have a migraine, but I think that's because I'm kind of and addict. But for me the only thing is ibuprofen and hope that it goes away in a couple hours</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it does! </p>
<p>It used to be a part of my “migraine routine” once I started seeing the aura I would chug a cup of coffee and go to sleep as fast as possible, usually with my ice pack eye mask, and that would take care of it most times. </p>
<p>Caffeine is also an ingredient in Excedrin, I don’t know the science behind it though. </p></div>		</li>
