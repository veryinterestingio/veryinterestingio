			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one of the hardest aspects of this is that infants/toddlers develop language when it is socially appropriate to learn from the bottom up, whereas the months of just listening, babbling, repetition, and limited meaningful conversation isn’t socially appropriate as an adult. Imagine sitting at a dinner party with native speakers - they’d have to be very kind and patient to keep inviting someone over who can’t really participate in any conversation for months and months.</p>
<p>I am no linguist, but I did an immersive language program in Italy in college and I became partially fluent by 4 months only because daily language lessons went in tandem with speaking in the community and living with a very encouraging host family. If I didn’t have the courses to learn basic grammar, common phrases, and simple vocabulary to get started, I don’t think I would have done very well aside from maybe picking up common greetings in the grocery store or using constant context clues to understand the gist of what people were trying to say to me, let alone understand isolated words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a native English speaker that has always been interested in languages. I speak Spanish pretty well and have studied German, French and some other languages as well.  I have tried immersion with no knowledge and I don't find it helpful either. Now immersion when I know the basics is a completely different matter. I also find immersion even more difficult when it is a different alphabet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely? Please don't say that unless you have scientific studies and theory to back it up. Because, as far as current Linguistic theory goes, it doesn't agree with you.</p></div>		</li>
