			<div class="markdown"><p>So, things in nature don't like to suddenly change. When you try to stop your car, your speed doesn't just go to zero, it follows a curve to zero as you slow down. </p>
<p>Water is like this. For example, a faucet of water represents a pretty consistent flow with near constant speed. Since nature doesn't like to let sudden changes occur, the <strong>air near the surface of the water is moving as fast as the water.</strong> As a corollary, the water can never move faster than the air could. </p>
<p>This represents the no slip condition: the velocity is consistent between the borders of two mediums. Otherwise, there would be slipping as one medium moves faster than the others. </p>
<p><strong>If on border of a stream is on a rock and the rock isnt moving, there is a super small layer of water that is also not moving.</strong> So I guess it can freeze there. Now the border of the ice isnt moving, so the process repeats and forms layers (?).</p>
<p>From my very general understanding (Which is only a semester of fluid dynamics and heat transfer). So the following is just an ELI5 of OP. </p>
<p>ELI5:  Say you have some play dough and you have to move it without picking it up or rolling it (as water can't do either). You'll notice that the top moves very fast and the bottom doesn't move much at all when you press it over short distances. If you have a lot of play dough, this is true for even longer distances. Now, consider the dough is cooling down. The slower stuff can freeze, while the stuff that isnt moving can. The stuff that isnt moving becomes thicker and thicker until the flow stops entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So imagine some water flowing through a pipe. Now let's zoom in all the way to the microscopic level exactly where the water is making contact with the inside of that pipe. At that exact point, the water molecules aren't moving. Like at all. The water as a whole can be flowing at 100mph through that pipe but but those molecules right there are standing still. That's the no-slip condition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is assuming the rock is cold enough to have the water freeze, which it wouldn't. This would imply the heat sink is in the ground, which in freezing conditions is highly unlikely. </p>
<p>The beginnings of the freezing would likely be on the fringes where there is very little water running but just enough for some significant ice to form, and go from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could have several rocks lying on each other isolated by air for the most of their surfaces. Surely there will be rocks that would be cooled down below zero.</p></div>		</li>
