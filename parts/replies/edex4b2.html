			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on relative mass and directions of earth and meteorite.  Assuming earth is bigger (baseball) and meteorite (bird) is smaller and collision is inelastic (absorbed not bounced), earth will slow down slightly but not reverse.  Since our orbit around sun is a balance between outward force due to velocity and inward force due to sun's gravity, the speed reduction would also degrade our orbit slightly. (Haven't done physics since 1978 don't ask for a calculation.) </p></div>		</li>
