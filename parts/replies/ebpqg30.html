Optically they are hues or the extremes of other colours (saturation) which is why they arent on the colour wheel</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly, I wish they just taught in school that there are eight planets and five <em>currently recognized</em> dwarf planets - Eris, Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, Pluto. It's not hard to remember, there are some fun names in there, it teaches people what Pluto <em>really</em> is (and how to tell the difference), and it makes Pluto not seem &quot;alone&quot;.</p>
<p>Granted, it's a little more complicated than that - it always is - but as a science nerd I hate people talking about how Pluto <em>used</em> to be a planet (or even worse - 'still is a planet <em>to me'.)</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>Some people may be able to see the color &quot;Yellow–Blue&quot; in this image by letting their eyes cross so that both + symbols are on top of each other</p>

<p>I can actually see &quot;yellow blue&quot; and it's really weird. I wish there was a way to describe it to those who can't, it reminds me of the riddle of how to describe colour to a blind person. I've never seen it in real life, I've only ever seen it in this &quot;cross your eyes&quot; diagram thing. All I can say is it's not green, it's definitely it's own thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Brown is absolutely a color, it's just not a <em>spectral</em> color, i.e. there is no single wavelength of light that triggers the visual experience of brown. It's hardly unique; magenta and all the rest of the purples aren't spectral colors either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the key to answering the actual question &quot;why isn't brown in the rainbow&quot;: because the rainbow is made up of only the colors that are caused by a single wavelength of light. And brown isn't just not a spectral color, it's not even a composite color, one made of several wavelengths of light. Brown is an orange that is less bright than it ought to be given the amount of light available.</p>
<p>Everyone talking about primary colors and additive or subtractive color models are missing the point; those answer the question &quot;how do I make brown&quot;, not &quot;why is brown not in the rainbow&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally someone who sets the records straight. It's not so much light itself which has a color, light just has a wavelength. Color is simply our interpretation of that wavelength, and for some colors (yellow, lightblue, magenta) there are multiple ways we can come to the same interpretation, and for others the only way is a mix of wavelenghts (like brown). It's simply wrong to say that &quot;we can only see three colors&quot;. More correct would be &quot;we can only disambiguate three classes of wavelengths&quot;.</p>
<p>Our brain will even assign different colors to the same combination of wavelengths depending on ambient light. Your white tabletop still looks white under incandescent light, just like it does in sunlight. This is why color shouldn't be seen as a property of light, but an interpretation of the light made by our brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But brown <em>is</em> a spectral color (certain shades anyway). Light at ~615nm produces the visual experience of brown - <em>when juxtaposed with a brighter environment</em>. The key to brown is that it has to be darker than everything else around it. It's just dark orange, and you need a reference to perceive it as &quot;dark&quot;.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://mrcn.st/t/brown.png" target="_blank">demo</a> using fully saturated, but darker, orange (the actual wavelength would depend on monitor calibration etc, but the point is it's as pure a color as you can get using whatever monitor you have - no white mixed in).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and this is the key point. Some colors can only exist relative to other colors. Grey and brown are examples. Grey is just darker white, and brown is just darker orange. You cannot have grey light all on its own, because that's just white light. You cannot have brown light all on its own, because that's just orange light. But you <em>can</em> have light that looks grey, or brown, relative to other light. This is how your monitor makes those colors.</p>
<p>In normal reflected light (paint, things that are brown, etc) brown is what we perceive a surface to be when it is basically colored orange but also doesn't reflect much light at all. In this case, we perceive it in relation to ambient light.</p>
<p>So the rainbow (and a color wheel) doesn't have brown because brown is just a dimmer version of a color that <em>is</em> on there (orange).</p></div>		</li>
