			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It was small. I guess. The turbine was in a 4 story building with the top half of the unit on the 3rd floor and the bottom half in the ceiling of the 2nd floor, and the plumbing on 1st and 2nd floor.<br />
It ran at 60 cycles a second = (60 x 60) = RPM and sat on &quot;gas bearings&quot; which I think was really just an injected steam cushion of some sort.<br />
A very nifty piece.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are some refineries, especially petroleum refineries, that constantly burn off natural gas because in some places it is cheaper than processing and transporting (or consuming) it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another thing is refineries tend to have an excess of hydrogen which is also constantly being flared, however you can only see the pale blue flame during the night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CO2 equivalent of methane depends on your time scale. The usual number (50 times) is over a period of 100 years, while of we measure over, say, a thousand years, the CO2e is about 1.</p></div>		</li>
