<p>Since were talking about wavelengths, this is one of those rare times that it's important to note that violet and purple are very different from each other. Violet corresponds to a specific wavelength, but there's no such thing as a purple wavelength. Purple is essentially an illusion created by the brain (and, as such, is a non-spectral color like brown, gray, pink, or magenta) when it receives both blue and red light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, suuuuurrreeee.  What are you going to say next, that there's some sort of infra red on the other side that can't be seen directly but can be seen as red if the energy level gets low enough?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Since violet is the highest visible frequency, all the other visible colors are also lower frequencies than ultraviolet. Some pigments will fluoresce in other colors than violet, but they're all longer wavelengths than UV. The statement is therefore true.
However, fluorescent is spelled wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question.  Usually light sources tend to emit light over a broad range of frequencies.  There will be some center frequency where it's brightest, but then it also emits lights above and below this frequency with less and less energy. </p>
<p>So if this is the case with UV lights, you'd expect some amount of energy to be emitted at lower frequencies and if this is low enough, some will be emitted in the purple color range. And still some in blue, green, yellow, and so on, but getting exponentially weaker to where we mainly perceive the light as purple.  </p>
<p>This all depends on the type of light source, though.  LEDs for example, famously have very narrow frequency ranges to where they emit all their energy in essentially one color.</p>
<p>Tldr; bright light in UV leaves a smaller echo down at purple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh... That's a good angle too. Unfortunately, i don't have a clue about why we can see the purple (or, I'd guess violet) glow.</p></div>		</li>
