			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be to do with how your body metabolises ingested THC differently to regular people. A bit like how some people can drink a  whole bottle of spirits with no hangover the next day and another person canâ€™t have 2 shots of vodka without waking up dustier then a desert the next day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also depends on the quality of the spirit,and how much of the 'heads' is included in the final cut.</p>
<p>Source: I home distill and don't get hungover unless I drink cheap store brought or beer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_effect" target="_blank">first pass effect</a> is a thing with edibles.  Eat a snack with some fatty/oily content about 20-30 mins before you eat an edible.  I've been consuming homemade edibles for many years, and doing it this way is very reliable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always eat something fatty or oily before and it's still really random for me. I didn't know about first pass effect but an old budtender told me to eat something fatty a lil before for it to take a better effect. He said the liver just crushes it without. Maybe I need more fatty and oily foods?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I wouldn't pretend to be high cuz that sounds like a lame thing to do. I would just explain to them that edibles don't work for you and then thank them for making it but suggest giving it to someone who can appreciate it. Just be honest and gift it to someone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't mean pretend in front of them, but when they give it as a gift...well, it sort of falls into the realm of accepting it and telling them &quot;Thanks I Loved It&quot; even if you really didn't. </p>
<p>And I mean I ate it thinking &quot;Who knows, maybe it'll work this time.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
