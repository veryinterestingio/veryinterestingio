			<div class="markdown"><p>Last gen we started having Physically Based rendering instead of the old school Phong model and it tried to simulate subsurface scattering a bit better by finding ways to fake it.  Skin needs to look like light is inside the object scattering around but games make it look like it's as solid as a piece of plastic or metal or dirt.  </p>
<p>For example, DooM 3 had the problem where they couldn't control how shiny things were because they didn't have enough space or something to hold one of the variables, so all objects in the game had the same specularity, whether it was skin or metal.  They just made things look less shiny by controlling the color of the reflected specular highlight, so skin was reflecting dark gray while metal was reflecting bright white.  That's why, especially in the early days, skin looked so plastic.  Normally in graphics you can also control the specular exponent so the size of the specular highlight could change, so metal would have these really sharp reflected highlights while matte surfaces like skin would have really wide and barely noticeable reflected highlights.  But since they didn't simulate subsurface scattering, skin still didn't manage to look as real and we saw something was off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently raytracing, even on the brand spakin new RTX cards, comes at such a high performance cost that it's just not worth it. You can't even use it and get playable framerates without also using DLSS. I have a 2080 super and the first thing I do on newer games is make sure any raytracing features are disabled. It is, no joke, the difference between playing at 30-45 fps or playing at 100+ fps... and the difference in visual fidelity is just hardly noticeable. It's no contest right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's coming. Did you see the demo for Unreal engine 5? Once the hardware is there, it's gonna be a real thing, and it's gonna be... scary honestly. Imagine looking at a character like Ganondorf and legitimately having a hard time believing it isn't some tall dude with a lot of makeup in a costume.</p></div>		</li>
