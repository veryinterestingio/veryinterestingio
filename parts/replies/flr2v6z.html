<blockquote>
<p>Crazy story. I used to work in underground mining, specifically hoist maintenance. This meant we routinely worked on the infrastructure inside of the mineshaft.</p>
<p>The mineshaft at the mine I worked at, is a 37 foot diameter hole, that descends straight into the earth, for 5180 ft. Yes that's 100 feet short of a mile, straight down. If you could look at the shaft from a top down view, you would see the beams holding the tubular shaft structure stable, much like drawing a circle around a tic tac toe game. We often times had to venture out onto those beams in the open shaft with a clear view of the speck of light a mile down at the bottom.</p>
<p>The message is clear, DONT LOOK DOWN, because looking down a massive mile deep concrete straw messes with your perception so bad it can make people go into a shock state. Many experienced guys who had worked at heights for years in construction or the likes, would freeze up immediately after stepping out into the shaft. I personally have had to rescue more than one grown man who was frozen cock stiff on a beam, petrified of falling because there just isnt the visual cues to regain your bearings. A persons balance is highly depend on the visual cues around them.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, one afternoon at work, we heard a large crash up on the hoist floor. Something had fallen down the shaft and was crashing into all the beams. We never did figure out what it was, because debris buries itself in the rocky muddy mixture at the bottom of the shaft. It did however take out the shaft bottom LED light panel, and all the lighting in the shaft went dark.</p>
<p>When we ventured into the shaft to make the repairs, there was something off, nobody could really put there finger on it, but we realized after a while that nobody was timid or grabbing stuff for balance anymore. The fact that you couldnt see the bottom anymore, just what was right in front of you or under our feet had removed all the perception fuckery.</p>
<p>From then on out, we did all work in the dark. Just personal flashlights, and nobody ever felt uneasy anymore, providing us the worry free heads to actually do our job safer and better.</p>
<p>It's all in the perception.</p>
