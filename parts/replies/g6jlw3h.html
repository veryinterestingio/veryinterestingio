			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. In addition, there are many more cellular processes that affect neuronal signalling than just synapse location and strength.</p>
<p>The entire milieu of the metabolome of a given neuron at any given instant will be constantly changing, and will impact the response that neuron generates.</p>
<p>This means that <strong>it is more accurate to think of each individual neuron as an individual computer</strong> that is itself capable of synthesizing and processing environmental stimuli, and producing different outputs based on the &quot;computations&quot; it does. Each individual computer then interacts with other computers via synapses.</p>
<p>Based on the various possible states the metabolome of an individual neuron could be in, an individual neuron can likely encode billions of bits of information. </p>
<p><em>(Given the tens of thousands of individual proteins/enzymes, enzyme substrates, lipids, etc that are constantly in a state of flux within a cell, I would feel safe wagering that the true number of &quot;bits&quot; of information that a neuron can store based on changes in the overall state of this complex system would be multiple orders of magnitude larger than billions.)</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>Then it is still a legitimate question to ask how many bits are required to describe its state at a given time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, each neuron has a normative behavior. But as soon as you flood it with a hormone such as dopamine or adrenaline, or if the surrounding sodium levels change then that informative behavior changes to something else. So, do you count those hormones or chemicals as bits, states or what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Legitimate yes, approachable no. Even if we knew what it took to describe it's state, we'd need to know how that state couples with other states</p></div>		</li>

<p>there's a limit to how much you can compress data. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example: We can think of a &quot;tree&quot; or an entire forest even. It doesn't require to re-create a 1:1 memory of the tree including all its leaves, branches and all the zillions of details that make a tree. (Like a computer does if we'd to render a tree).</p>
<p>I can also instantly imagine, for example &quot;rain&quot;, without needing to invoke huge &quot;storage capacity&quot; for billions and billions of rain drops. Or I can instantly recall the memory of a landscape, even if the actual landscape has zillions of details that would need HUGE computing power to store all the information what is making the landscape.</p>
<p>This I guess is why some say the mind/brain works &quot;holographically&quot;, very differently and frankly MUCH more efficient than a computer.</p>
<p>. We can instantly &quot;image&quot; a tree</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how you define efficiency. The human brain's compression and storage is incredibly lossy. You remember the big picture but overtime you forget or swap out the details. This would be like if your images on your computer started replacing the trees with clip art of trees. They both serve their own function, one serves to store a huge amount of &quot;good enough&quot; data the other serves to store all of the data exactly as it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More efficiently is debatable, there is an astounding amount of detail lost in human memory (all the stuff we don't consider important). </p>
<p>For example, walk down a street you've never been and try to remember everything. Try to remember what every sign said, how many people there were and what they were doing, the make, model, color, licence, etc. of every car,every single detail, Then try to remember an hour later, or a week later.</p>
<p>Do the same thing again with a high-resolution camera and it becomes clear that we immediately forget all least 70-80% of everything we see and we forget even more over time, but a camera stores those details perfectly forever.</p></div>		</li>
