			<div class="markdown"><p>What most people do not understand is that it's not the ship that can take the beating, it's the people and the machinery that goes first. Being on a ship in heavy weather for days on end is hell on the body. Then if you lose propulsion you are in real trouble, not the ship, you. </p>
<p>Mariners use different techniques to ease the ship motions in heavy weather, the most common is heaving to. You put the bow into the wind, and ride up and down the waves with just a slight propulsion to keep the bow pointed in the right direction. You can do the same with a sea anchor or droque on a small boat. </p>
<p>Having been in 60-70ft seas on a ship built in 1969 I can tell you, never worried about the boat. Put the bow into the suck and just hang on. Staying in my bed on the other hand...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly the point. But the thing is, if the ship has correct stability it will be fine if it goes sideways. It's the people and machinery that will experience violent and deadly motion. </p>
<p>For the most part, up to a point, a boat will right itself if caught in a heavy sea. That is if all watertight openings are properly secured.</p></div>		</li>
