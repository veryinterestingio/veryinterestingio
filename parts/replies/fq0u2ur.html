			<div class="markdown"><p>I once worked in mainland China leading a team of software engineers on a three month project. Of the 12, only one spoke and understood English. The rest had zero spoken English skills at all but all could read and write in English because of English language documentation.  This isn't universal but is also not that unusual.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not knowing English is not a problem, there are a few keywords to learn, you don't even need to know what they mean in English. There are many courses in other languages. </p>
<p>The only drawbacks is it's harder to use libraries only documented in English, and less cases already encountered you can google.</p></div>		</li>
