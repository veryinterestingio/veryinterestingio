<p>Btw I'm a dude, so much for the clich√©. But I think my problems is not having cold feet constantly so much as ignoring them for way too long when I get them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact:<br />
This happened on La Palma, Canary Islands. So, yeah, you can call that a warm climate. However, the warmer the climate, the lazier people get with thermal insulation and heating. At 700m above sea level, we'd still see single digit temperatures at night in the winter. The stove could barely keep up with that. Add to that a stone tile floor laid directly on the concrete foundation. This led to my six years on the Canary Islands being the time of my life where I was cold the most. And I grew up in Germany. </p></div>		</li>
