			<div class="markdown"><p>I call this Mental Chess. I don't know if that's an actual term for it, or for something else, but that's what I call it. </p>
<p>If I'm in a tough situation, I'm thinking about all the possible things I could say, and all the possible responses, before I open my mouth. As of right now, I'm 32 years old. It's not as bad as it was before, but I still sometimes catch myself doing it. </p>
<p>The thing is, there are likely thousands of possible things you/I could say, and multitudes of responses the other person could reply. </p>
<p>No human, aside from some INCREDIBLY brainy person (who's probably smart enough to avoid this situation entirely) is able to figure out all the responses. </p>
<p>Recognizing that was one of my first steps in dealing with this. I can't expect the other person to say a certain thing in response to me. So, rather than standing there, mouth shut, I'll just take a second and figure out what <strong>I mean</strong> to say. English is a very precise language, so if I think for a second before opening my mouth, I can deduce exactly what I want to say, and then I can say it. </p>
<p>If the other person reacts negatively, there's really nothing you can do. That's their choice. You can speak softly and with respect, but some people just won't understand, no matter what you say. So, don't worry so much about how they'll react. Instead, focus on making yourself as honest and precise as possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm thinking of 12 different things to say and I don't know which one to say first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any one of the things that I'm thinking of saying could be misconstrued into something else and I'm also thinking of all of the different ways it could be misconstrued. </p>
<p>Same for me:</p>
<p>This thing that troubles me, which aspect of it do I start explaining? How do I describe it? The other person will have multiple ways of misunderstanding it and I can't know for sure if they take it the way I intended. This will lead to me having to correct their perception with further explanations. But even then, I wouldn't know if my words weren't misinterpreted... [repeat recursively]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This is a feedback loop and some people are good at functioning through these but a lot of people just shut down because it is too much to process all at once.</p></div>		</li>
