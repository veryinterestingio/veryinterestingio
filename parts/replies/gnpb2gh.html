			<div class="markdown"><p>switches, they turned shit off and on by hand. One on, two off and one on equals 1001, which means the 9th position to us. What the 9th position means to a chip is specific to the chip, aka Chip Instructions. Some chips are clocks, some are gates, some do things like turn on lights. A simple example is a wall switch which only has a 0(off) and a 1(on). Your lamp knows to be ON when it sees a 1, though it is literally just electricity flowing, that is how ALL chips actually work, just a series of on/off switches, until it gets to a [Lamp]. 1001 is just 4 light switches in a row, the first and last in the up (on) position and the middle in the down (off) position.</p>
<p>Eventually someone made a thing called a &quot;Keyboard&quot; which allowed you to press a single switch which in turn, turned One on, two off and one on to equal 1001 in a single movement. Then we started coming up with more advanced Chip Instructions that took more inputs which we then made larger and more complex Keyboards, and systems to interpret or relay said Instructions.</p></div>		</li>
