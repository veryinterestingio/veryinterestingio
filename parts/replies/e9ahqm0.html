			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, this is Natalie Beck. I am a certified genetic counselor in pediatric and adult genetics here at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests are not designed to be diagnostic medical genetic tests and can be falsely reassuring or falsely alarming because they are often done without any of the patient’s medical and family histories and without pre test and post test counseling by a genetics professional.</p>
<p>Many DTC test kits often look for several different categories of genetic changes:</p>
<p>1) Carrier status for recessive disorders such as cystic fibrosis. DTC kits only look for the presence of a select few common genetic variants in these genes, and would have a much lower detection rate than clinical carrier screening tests, especially for people who are not of Caucasian or Ashkenazi Jewish descent.</p>
<p>2) Markers or traits which might influence physical characteristics or health. These are often single DNA letter alterations called “polymorphisms” which can be commonly seen within a population. Some polymorphisms have been linked to a higher risk for different medical conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, even if someone carries a polymorphism for Alzheimer’s disease, this is not necessarily predictive of whether or not they will develop this condition. Conversely, just because a person tests negative for a polymorphism does not mean they cannot develop the condition.</p>
<p>3) Genetic health risks: some DTC companies test for a limited number of conditions that may directly impact a patient's health, such as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.  The testing for these is also only for a limited number of variants more common in certain ethnic populations and would not test for many other causes of these conditions.  Therefore, if you or a family member has a history of one of these conditions, you should see a genetic counselor in your area.</p>
<p>4) Some DTC companies can look into ancestry of an individual.  This testing looks for markers that can be traced back to different geographical areas to give a rough estimate of a person’s ancestry.  </p>
<p>There are many things to consider when deciding to do a DTC genetic test.  Some people may find out information about their family that they are not expecting.  It is also important to consider how your genetic information may be shared once these tests are completed. We recommend seeking an evaluation with a genetic counselor before pursuing any type of genetic testing (clinical and diagnostic, research, or direct-to-consumer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi Natalie! Thank you so much for posting the drawbacks to the DTC tests, which I did not know. As far as this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests are not designed to be diagnostic medical genetic tests and can be falsely reassuring or falsely alarming because they are often done without any of the patient’s medical and family histories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please keep in mind that many of us that were adopted in closed adoptions have zero idea of our biological families medical histories. In our case, some information is better than no information, as long as the some information is accurate. (In my case, I found out I had every variant tested for for one condition, so now I know to look out for it as I age)</p>
<p>Also, there is another company out there that you can run your raw DNA info through and it provides you a far more detailed and scientific breakdown than the DTC tests. </p>
<p>Just a few thoughts from an adoptee with no family health history to go off!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While vigilance for certain health conditions is important given family history, I feel most heritable conditions which can be mediated by lifestyle choices come down to eating a reasonable diet and moderate exercise (you can't change your genes, but can change your exercise level what or what or how much you eat. How often are the recommendations from genetic testing something other than eat well and exercise? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ashkenazi jews have a higher than normal susceptibility to certain genetic diseases because of common ancestry and because they tend to marry within the community. </p>
<p>This is why matchmakers are so important since they keep track of these markers (including Gaucher’s disease, cystic fibrosis, tay-Sachs and muscular dystrophy)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m an adoptee and I did 23 and me. Once they really upped the family connections part, I wondered if I would find anyone. There were plenty of distant cousins, then last month I got a notification of a first cousin. I know my birth mother and her sister were the only ones who knew about me, so I’m not going to reach out to this person...but it’s definitely a risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did Ancestry for fun. I have since had a few people contact me about relations, the most notable being a woman who learned (through my results and I connected her with family members who would know more) who her biological father was - and that it wasn't who she was told was her dad her whole life. This summer she met all of her half brother and half sisters at a family reunion. She was an older woman (in her 60s I think - I was in my late 20s). </p></div>		</li>
