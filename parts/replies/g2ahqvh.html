			<div class="markdown"><p>I think either r/theydidthemath or r/askhistorian did the proper math one time (can't find it now), and the amount of salt needed to render even one city and its suburbs infertile are way more than the entire humanity back then could produce in many decades, and now would be a crippling international industrial project that would grow to absurd proportions to have any effect. </p>
<p>(Add to this the fact that salt itself was literal money at the time. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wkbj7/what_was_the_deal_with_salting_the_earth_after/c5e4lag/" target="_blank">comment</a> amusingly turns this question on its head: yes, there <em>were</em> completely salted and lifeless fields in history, but they attracted people and made them rich, not bankrupted and ruined a nation!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I have a few hundred feet of a gravel patch/road driveway past the side of my house, and have spread salt on it (rock salt bought in bulk) and over the years have probably put 5+ tons on it, 300 pounds at a time. It kills the weeds, but 300 pounds only buys you a few months if that. And the same weeds are growing again more happily than ever.....so it doesn’t seem to be bothering them much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can kill the weeds with heat. Put a opaque plastic cover on and leave it to let the weeds die off due to heat stress and no light. The humidity can also make seeds sprout that will also be killed off. </p>
<p>I do this on an area where I want to raise new garden beds and I have very little problem with weeds since I started doing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My parent's next door neighbour thought he was being clever when he put down rock salt under some new paving to stop weeds growing.</p>
<p>My dad lost half his garden, including a tree he'd being looking after for a couple of decades. And of course it did nothing to stop the weeds.</p>
<p>The neighbour was a very nice man, and felt so guilty he offered to pay for the whole thing to be landscaped (which my parents declined), but he just didn't think his actions through.</p>
<p>Weedkiller only needs a small amount to be effective, and can be easily localized, while salt dissolves the first time it rains (in the North East of England that's more often than not) and spreads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this becomes even more obvious if we take a look at the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Salzberg_kaliwerk_wintershall_heringen.jpg/1920px-Salzberg_kaliwerk_wintershall_heringen.jpg" target="_blank">Kalimandscharo</a> in Germany.</p>
<p>a giant 200m high salt mountain that surprisingly is not  in a bare wasteland but right next to some forests.</p>
<p>obviously if you would spread that salt out it would totally kill the plants but only for a short time as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Nature can work at a scale that defies even modern logistics and capabilities. </p>
<p>Back then when people were fighting wars over salt, paying people in salt, and had to transport everything on mules, camels, or oxen......moving that much salt would have been an insane thing to attempt just to deny your enemies a few months to years of crops. </p>
<p>I’ve played around using salt as a weed killer/preventer, and while it does work, it doesn’t last long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, even if it doesn't prevent everything from ever growing again, it would kill everything that was on the land at that moment. So like, all the original plants would be gone. That seems like it could be the point, even though it's not permanently ruining the land.</p></div>		</li>
