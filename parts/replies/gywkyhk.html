			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok right on, now I get the effect of surface area to mass ratio. This probably applies to most materials. Now I need to post another ELI5 about Styrofoam's general ability to generate static charges versus other materials, like wool socks vs cotton socks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The TLDR there (refreshed myself real quick) is that some objects collect charge (electrons) but hold onto it weakly, and other objects lack charge and desire it.</p>
<p>By rubbing one object made of the former against an object made of the latter, the one with electrons will lose them while the material without gains them.</p>
<p>Exactly WHY the objects that lack a charge don't just accrue it, I'm honestly not really sure. &gt;.&lt;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I initially suspected when reading this question. Seeing that surface area is a square growth, while volume (assuming you keep the shape of the object as spherical as possible) will grow at a cubic rate. Surface area/volume tends to 0 as you get larger objects.</p></div>		</li>
