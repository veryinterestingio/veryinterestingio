The amount of times new suppliers are like “we have tire/tyre chips that can be used as roads - which is so much bette than-“ sorry but asphalt is not the material construction industry is looking at replacing anytime soon, for the fact that it’s so bloody cheap and..... is recycled!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people really need to understand the size of our planet and just how much we consume. It is not physically possible to make a city the size of the earth that is as dense as NYC because the amount of material needed simply doesn't exist unless we start mining other planets. There is not enough stuff in the world to just use and use and use and expand while never recycling or reusing. To replace roads with concrete not even factoring labor costs would get prohibitively expensive very quickly as we literally run out of materials on a global scale.</p>
<p>People only seem to care about how much oil we have and ignore the limits of all other resources</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>Liquid</em> asphalt. What most people mean, including OP for the purpose of this post, when they say asphalt is asphalt <em>concrete</em>. Pavement, blacktop, etc. Liquid asphalt only accounts for about 5% of the pavement mixture. </p>
<p>I'm also not 100% sure you're correct in the waste product element, but that's slightly out of my realm and I'll refrain from comment.</p>

<p>You are correct about %. Typically Asphalt Content runs from mid 4% to 7%, depending on the lift.</p>
<p>So you are both correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find anything that corroborates that it's a &quot;waste product&quot; online. It has a use. That use/sale is factored into the drilling/purchasing element for refineries. I don't know about the whole &quot;lower the price to just get rid of it&quot; bit. I've never heard that before. It's cheap, but they aren't exactly paying people to take it off their hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so what's the rest of the crap if asphalt is literally less than a tenth of it? I tried looking it up but even the wiki article kinda doesn't explain (it literally says &quot;For economic and other reasons, asphalt is sometimes sold combined with other materials, often without being labeled as anything other than simply &quot;asphalt&quot;), I was like wtf.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tbh I am never sure what people mean when they say waste product from refining. Everything is used and is profitable and purposefully produced throughout the refining process. </p>
<p>The only waste I know of are different hydrocrabon sludges like API which essentially just stuff people wash down the drains (which is never supposed to happen but universally does) throughout the refinery. It is possible to reclaim most of the hydrocarbon in the sludge through various processes like centrifuging and then using the hydrocarbon as feed stream for the coker unit but that is not universally preformed. Many places put the stuff in boxes and send it to the dumps or cement furnaces.</p></div>		</li>
