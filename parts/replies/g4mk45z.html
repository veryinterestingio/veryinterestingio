			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... they're pretty placid though. It just kinda feels like there's a dog wandering around but not really interacting with people. </p>
<p>But feeding time though!!! Being surrounded by howling wolves is otherworldly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mum is a dog breeder and I've seen the older dogs 'bear their teeth' to the pups in a friendly kind of way and it's called 'mouthing'. They'll all show their teeth and bite each other softly to show that they're friendly and want to be friends. It's SO WEIRD a puppy will put their mouth inside an older dog's mouth when they show their teeth to show they're friends!</p></div>		</li>
