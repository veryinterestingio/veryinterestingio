			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah for me it's weird. During cold season I'll end up &quot;having&quot; it like 4 or 5 times but it's only for like 2 or 3 day increments at most. I'm probably just dragging one or two actual sicknesses out and only notice it it when it's at it's worst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah I actually strangely don't mind the actually full blown cold part, it's the incubation stage where you feel a scratch and generally pretty lethargic that I hate, it's the anticipation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar experience when I was a pharmacy tech. During the first few months, I got sick as hell - especially during flu season - but then I went <em>years</em> without being sick (aside from minor inconveniences like runny nose/sniffles). I just assumed after being exposed to sick people on a daily basis that my immune system did what it's supposed to do and did its job like a f'ing boss. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the exact virus that caused the cold and the status of the immune system. I used to only get colds that lasted a few days too, but I got one this past January that knocked me out for two weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Preschool kids are in their own category of disease cesspool. I've worked in hospitals with adults for 10+ years, and occasionally gotten sick.  But when my son started daycare? Oooooh boy. Never in my life have I contracted so many illnesses. It's like I have zero immunity to whatever nastiness children breed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm in first grade but they're still gross. Put their hands in their noses, mouths, butts and then they'll hold your hand. Or cough into your mouth. Or try to feed you salt (this happened this week ?). And don't get me started on the having lice every other week. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pre-school kids are plauge rats. My kid just &quot;graduated&quot; pre-school, for two years I think I caught all the things. I work in a public building that is at it's busiest during flu season. I was fine until my kid started pre-school. </p>
<p>I hope kindergarten is better but I suspect it's about the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard it's better once they start kindergarten...I may be clinging to false hope though. In the past two years, we've gone through several stomach bugs, bronchitis, RSV, pink eye, norovirus, the flu, and of course the never ending colds that inevitably end with either an ear infection or a sinus infection. It's exhausting. Once something hits a kid in a daycare or preschool class, there's almost no stopping it.</p>
<p>On a funnier note, my kid has always been really....tactile. I once turned around at the grocery store to see my preschooler thoroughly licking the handle of the grocery cart, and blurted out, &quot;THIS! This is why we're sick every week! What are you thinking?!?&quot;  May have gotten a couple &quot;crazy mom&quot; looks from that outburst. But WHY, kid? Why??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Not a teacher, but am a lawyer. Worked for years with prisoners, the homeless, and with the immuno-compromised, not too bad. Started working with schools as an education attorney and BAM! Sick so often.  Unfortunately I don't have a functional immune system so I didn't get any super-immunity, I just kept getting sick.</p></div>		</li>
