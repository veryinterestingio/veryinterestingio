			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually three different areas that you need to continue to improve to make better quantum systems. The first is the device properties such as the lifetime of the qubits (T1) which we have continued to improve to the point where the average over our devices is around 100 microseconds. The second is gate fidelities which depend strongly on the calibration routines. We are continuing to see these improvements and get our gates close to what we call the coherence limit (limited by the device). The third is to improve the overall system. In recent years it has become more important to focus on the system metrics. This is why we developed metrics like quantum volume <a href="https://ibm.co/2ArbPv9" target="_blank"><a href="https://ibm.co/2ArbPv9" target="_blank">https://ibm.co/2ArbPv9</a></a>. They take into account errors such as cross talk that only appear when you go beyond measuring single and two-qubit gate fidelities. We have shown that with novel improvements in design and control we have been able to double this for that last three years. Continuing this progress will require continued improvements in both the device properties and the calibrations to get the performance of our systems to the limits needed to demonstrate quantum advantage.</p></div>		</li>
