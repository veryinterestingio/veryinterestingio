			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot; Equitable supply is the major issue. Pricing is relevant but less immediate (we know the EU <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n281" target="_blank">paid</a> less than South Africa for the AstraZeneca vaccine for example).&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah but to be fair, the EU also contributed to development costs as it is a co-op between AstraZeneca and Oxford University and some of Oxford's studies that have contributed to the development were financed with public money.</p></div>		</li>
