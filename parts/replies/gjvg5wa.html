<p>Edit: thanks! Informative and as others commented, somewhat scary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One conundrum revealed by recent estimates of the time line of RABV emergence has become evident through such investigations. The clade comprising all terrestrial RABVs is estimated to have emerged in the past millennium, but this appears to be at odds with the interpretation of historical records suggesting the recognition of a rabies-like disease associated with dogs in ancient times of both Western and Eastern civilizations (Baer, 2007, Wu et al., 2009). If indeed current estimates of the evolutionary time line of all RABVs are accurate, this would require that either the disease interpreted as rabies by historical scholars was actually a different disease or alternatively rabies has emerged in this species independently on at least two occasions with die-off of the lineage responsible for cases recorded over 1500 years ago. Given the dynamic nature of virus–host associations, other lyssavirus lineages are likely to emerge in the future; identifying such outbreaks and responding to their threat in a timely manner will be facilitated by genetic characterization (preferably complete viral genome sequencing) coupled with epidemiological data that together should provide essential insights into viral phylodynamics (Holmes and Grenfell, 2009).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why it’s possible for rabies virus to be &lt;1500 years old &amp; for rabies to exist in prior historical record is that rabies virus isn’t the only virus to cause the disease known as rabies.</p>
<p>All the viruses in the Lyssavirus genus (of which rabies virus is one) cause the same disease - rabies. If you look up “lyssavirus” you can see a list. The non-rabies lyssaviruses are probably underreported, since they are partially cross-seroreactive to rabies virus antigens. This means that the tests we use for rabies virus may come up positive for these viruses as well.</p>
<p>But for what it’s worth: just because it’s possible doesn’t mean it’s actually happening. More modern testing (such as PCR) can distinguish between lyssaviruses without a problem, so we may find out in the near future. This also doesn’t mean that rabies virus actually did emerge only 1500 years ago - only that it’s possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really any spillover from a bat is going to be bad for humans. Bats have a combination of suppressed inflammation and an almost constant state of antiviral activation. So a virus that is used to the bat immune system causes havoc to our relatively much more sensitive inflammation processes and delayed antiviral response.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thank you for sharing all of this knowledge in a way that’s easy to digest - even after a 12h shift. Hope you have a great night my friend!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In relation to its severity on humans, why does it take a long time for rabies to incubate? And why is it so severe once it gets activated? Is its severity on humans relatively the same to its severity on cats/dogs?</p></div>		</li>
