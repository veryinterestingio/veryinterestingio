			<div class="markdown"><p>So in highschool I was a big dbz fan and played basketball. I had this idea to wear ankle weights all the time, only taking them off to shower (even wore them to bed and during gym. I did this every day for about a month, when we had our first game I took them off and felt like I could fly. Instant +9000 power level.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So when he took them off, his hands would be quicker and he'd have a much better handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people pass out at sustained 5g in airplanes (straight vertical acceleration). With training you can make it to 10g, but not for long. More than that is likely lethal</p>
<p>In horizontal g tests (the spinny thing in that Bond movie) 20g is doable by most people for a very very short time. 10g can be done for a few minutes</p></div>		</li>

<p>Overall the benefit seems minor, but as long as you're not overtaxing yourself (and don't do anything silly like put the weights around your ankles or wrists rather than using an actual vest) I don't see much harm in trying it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s also no evidence it causes any harm, but it empirically does make you stronger, hence why fatter people typically have crazy strong legs after they lose 100-200 pounds.</p>
<p>Otherwise bulking would be way more dangerous than a weighted vest, my body weight can fluctuate 30 between bulking and cutting. You’re going to tell me that running with a 30 pound vest is somehow more dangerous than going for a run when I’m 30 pounds heavier?</p></div>		</li>
