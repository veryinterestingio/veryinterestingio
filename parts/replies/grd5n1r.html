			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with this question is it relies on the existing mainstream knowledge of reactors, which is mostly about accidents decades ago. Considering how close we are to industrialization and how long ago those accidents were, it's not comparable. Rarely do I see major concerns over nuclear reactors discussing current capabilities.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought they stopped because they were so expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now China, India, and the middle east are building most of them. </p>
<p>The cost is only part of the problem in the US. The other issue is that fracking has caused a huge drop in natgas prices and natgas power plants now dominate the energy stack as the cheapest thing out there. All other sources struggle to compete against it in deregulated markets unless there are subsidies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a short nuclear renaissance in the 2005ish. A lot of new plants were planned for GEs ESBWR and Westinghouse’s AP1000 (plus others).  GE stopped their projects in 2009 then Fukushima happened in 2011. After that there were active AP1000 projects at VC Summer in SC and Vogtle in GA.  Vogtle is the only remaining active project and it is way behind schedule and has massive cost overruns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it ironic how anti-nuclear protestors actually had the effect of preventing safer nuclear plants from being built. They are the ones holding new technological designs and forcing the hands of some governments to go with older, more expensive and more risky plants when newer, better, safer and cheaper designs are available.</p></div>		</li>
