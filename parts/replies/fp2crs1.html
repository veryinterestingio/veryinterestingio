			<div class="markdown"><p>When sleeping, you're still producing body heat, just less of it. Your body likes to be colder when sleeping then when awake. If you sweat in the blanket while asleep, you'll probably sweat even more intensely when in the blanket and awake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body specifically wants to be colder. The purpose of sweat is to cool you down. You are sweating in your blankets because you are too hot under them, and your body is trying to cool down via sweating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are cold enough that you needed something to trap heat.  The thing you used to trap heat is too good at trapping heat, and after a period of time, the air and blanket warm up enough that you get hot under the blanket.   Try a thinner blanket or even just a top sheet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always heard that people warm up when they're sleeping, so while you're comfy going to bed with a blanket and be cozy, you wake up too hot and ready to uncover.</p>
<p>I can tell I've been sweating in the morning, usually. Friends have told me they have. Etc.</p>
<p>so idk what's real anymore...</p></div>		</li>
