			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! Many many many of them have been archived on places like sfwchan and similar. You can download and run them locally using a sfw player of some sort. People have seen this coming for years. You won't be able to play them in a modern browser over the internet anymore though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell no:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>many non mainstream browsers will still support it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can always use an older browser version ( just stick to just flashgames with it, don't go about your daily browsing with an out of date browser )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can download standalone version of flash player ( called <a href="https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html" target="_blank">flash player projector</a> ) to play games you downloaded.</p>
</li>
<li>There are already a few open source alternatives being made ( like <a href="http://lightspark.github.io/" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/" target="_blank">this</a> )</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flash won't receive updates at all. Mainstream browsers might still allow Flash but they'll start dropping official support. Browsers are pretty heavy on improving security and have proven to be pretty aggressive, especially Chrome. Without security updates it will go the way of XP, you can still install it but good luck finding decent support for something left to atrophy away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, it is. Lots of legacy code out there using it. </p>
<p>Two years ago I was working in a company whose main product was a webapp built in Apache Flex (a tool for developing flash-based applications) and I remember they were discussing options to replace it. Many government websites in my country still use Flash as well.</p>
<p>So yeah, not many applications which began development in the last 5 years use Flash, but older ones still use it.</p></div>		</li>
