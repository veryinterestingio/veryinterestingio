<p>I could have been up for 72 hours and unless I actually closed my eyes and decided to sleep it wasn't going to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m 29 and I think the only times I have fallen asleep by accident have been super drunk after being at a festival for a week and had been up for at least 32 hours. Falling asleep accidentally without a bunch of intoxicants is a foreign concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>anyone else wiggle their toes going to sleep? I scrunch one foot, then the other, back and forth....actually I think I only did that when I slept in the dark and with quiet. Now I just sleep with the light on and some form of sound to sleep to. I noticed how I felt when I woke up 2 weeks ago when our power went out and I slept with no sound or light. I knew when I woke up I slept with the light off. Hmm</p></div>		</li>
