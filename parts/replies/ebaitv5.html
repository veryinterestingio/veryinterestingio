			<div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring temperature, why would you be crushed if you tunneled to the center of the earth? If that tunnel is open all the way to the atmosphere, wouldn't you be experiencing atmospheric pressure? Or no pressure at all, since the air in the tunnel will be experiencing an equal gravitation force in all directions? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now there is a column of air above you that is approximately 50 miles high. That column of air is pressing on you at 14.7 pounds per square inch. In general as you go deeper there is a taller column of air above you making more pressure.</p>
<p>Compared to water, air is a lot less dense. This is why you can go much deeper in the air than you can in water. In saltwater every 33 feet of depth adds another 14.7 PSI of pressure. In mines you need to go approximately 3200 feet to add another 14.7 PSI.</p>
<p>The details of all of this vary with a lot of factors and is actually a very complicated subject but this is the basics of it.</p>
<p>Stole this from r/masteradkins because I didnâ€™t want to type it out </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but the reason you experience the weight of that column of air is because it's being pulled towards the mass of the earth. If you're down near the center, wouldn't that air be pulled equally in all directions, therefore not weighing down on you at all?</p></div>		</li>
