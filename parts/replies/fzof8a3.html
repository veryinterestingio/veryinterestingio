			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a big surprise that AI has gotten to the top of the comments. (Amended: Your comment is more to the point.) <del>However,</del> OP's question suggests an interest in earlier beginnings that became the foundation of explosive technological growth. Here is a great video on how the lathe enabled great strides in the industrial revolution, by bootstrapping across several areas of human societal development. <a href="https://youtu.be/djB9oK6pkbA" target="_blank">The 1751 Machine that Made Everything</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My comment <em>can</em> apply to AI, so it’s understandable how you came to that conclusion, but if it makes any difference I actually just had the IRL history of people inventing things in mind, the phenomena of inventions making inventing other inventions more practical IRL, ex: “I’ve invented the lightbulb! Now I can work on that automatic hammer idea both day <em>and</em> night! I’ll double my productivity!” If left uninterrupted and access to every previous invention/technology is assumed, both the level of tech (if that can be objectively quantified), and the rate of innovation will increase exponentially. It works in both simulation and reality! </p>
<p>I didn’t see anything about beginnings in the question though, seemed like they were pretty adamant about acceleration. They used both “progress” and “sped up” in the question, and no words or phrases that refer to origin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My AI remark wasn't about your comment; it was about the current
top comment to OP's post (4 hours in), and the busy threads spawned by it. Sorry for the confusion. I came down in the comments looking for more like yours, and meant for mine to echo and expand on it.</p>
<p>Edit: I took the question's given frame of 150 years liberally, but thought that OP was looking for a cause for the acceleration. Of course there are many causes throughout the last 100's of years, too many to ELI5. The video touches on how one invention can cause a paradigm shift that ripples across human endeavors and affects our potential for achievement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let’s take a simple example: the steam engine. Once you have something that is mobile and can produce torque you can do an insane amount of things, from ocean liners to trains to factories, it’s used are immense. Plus people making better engines based on that same idea.</p></div>		</li>
