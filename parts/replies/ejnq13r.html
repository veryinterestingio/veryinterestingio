<p>Vinyl is pretty well suited to the task and lasts damn near forever. It is easy to scratch but so is practically anything else at the scale of the grooves on a record. If you've ever owned a phone or laptop with a textured aluminium cover you'd know how easily that surface gets damaged. The softness of the material gives it some self healing ability as well, lightly damaged grooves can be played and the needle will push through the damage, a scratch in a metal groove would destroy the stylus as it passed over. </p>
<p>Anything harder would be much more difficult to manufacture, vinyl records are made by simply pressing a puck of vinyl between two stamps with the grooves etched into them. Imagine the cost involved to do this with something harder like metal.</p>
<p>Other than all this of course there just hasn't been the demand. We likely could develop a slightly better material now, but vinyl is still pressed on the original machinery left over from the 60s, there isn't the market to justify replacing all that now, although they are building new presses finally. I also don't think we could improve on it very much. We haven't gone past plastics for most uses after all. </p>
<p>There is an example of a record made in a much longer lasting material though. The record of the voyager probe is made of copper coated with gold. However this is to allow it to last for millions of years, a gold surface would damage even easier than vinyl I expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand on this, the gold surface would damage more easily with repetitive physical contact, however the design of that record is for it to withstand radiation for as long as possible so gold was the best choice at the time Voyager was launched.</p>
<p>Oh, and I'm so hipster, I only listen to music on my Edison Phonograph.</p></div>		</li>
