			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, just look at how a person as a baby is when it first tries to catch a ball, compared to how they are at 10 years old.</p>
<p>Your brain isn't working out numbers, years of experience have trained it to be able to work out the path the ball will take and try to move the hand to intercept it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is blatantly incorrect. I am 33 and I still can't catch a ball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not saying your position is necessarily wrong, but your argument that it isn’t the same because it’s down to experience doesn’t debunk the OPs point: you have to learn calculus over years as well</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also notice how when baby learn how to walk, at first it is very clumsy. Brain does not know body very well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which also happens when 11 year olds become 12 and 13 and practically double in size. Suddenly the brain's model of the body is waaay off and awkward hilarity ensues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah neural networks are pretty amazing. From what I gather they are basically creating their own algorithms and we don't really know exactly what's going on which can also make it dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Deep learning&quot; is essentially a neural network with many layers between input and output layers (hence &quot;deep&quot;). Cheap computing power has made this very easy to do - and is basically driving all the AI advances today including things such as self-driving cars and facial recognition.</p></div>		</li>
