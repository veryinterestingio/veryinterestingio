			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there also a gravitational effect, considering the water srface is not flat? The coffee grounds landing in the middle of the puddle, having n amount of hydrophilic property itself, would naturally 'roll' downhill to the edges, upon which a barrier of coffee grounds constructs itself. Dehydration ensues, dried coffee rings appear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but gravitational effects are super duper negligible compared to other forces at play.  </p>
<p>Major two involved in transport are a surface energy gradient that moves particles downgradient along the surface to the rim of a droplet, and fluid circulation to replace evaporational losses that transports to the rim of the drop and stagnates.</p></div>		</li>
