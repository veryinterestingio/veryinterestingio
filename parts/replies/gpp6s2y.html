			<div class="markdown"><p>It is to hear their mix better.  Good DJs are going a lot with the mix itself, and the headphones are necessary for them to hear the details to make the mix good.</p>
<p>They still have to care about what the crowd hears, though, so they will often only listen to one of the headphones so they get a 'mix' of both audio profiles.</p></div>		</li>
