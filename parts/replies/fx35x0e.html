<p>If those are the spiders that are in Florida, then yes, several times.  They seem fairly harmless, but their webs are extremely large and sticky, and the spiders instinct seems to be to &quot;go up&quot; when disturbed.  That means, they climb towards your face.  In cultivated pine forests, they're fairly easy to avoid, but in thicker/natural woods, they're easy to run into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to live in South Korea for a bit. During my time there, I once rode my bike home from work (20 miles). Once. Korea is fucking filled with them. I was riding through a beautiful bike path from I-forget-where to Seoul during summer. I cannot tell you how golden orb shadows I saw on that one bike ride. And those fuckers are big, apparently big enough to cast a very identifiable shadow. I had such a bad nightmare afterwards...I ended up freaking the fuck out and diving inside a giant spider's mouth at my elementary school. </p>
<p>But at least the web is cool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you mean walking into it face-first again because you forgot about it, then sure.</p></div>		</li>
