<p>However, this does not relate to the ratio of male and female born, as it skews to the other direction, 51.4/48.6 in favor of males.</p>
<p>And then the population skews back to female the older you get.</p>
<p>As for individual differences, a few studies were performed asking that same question in families that had all sons and daughters, and saw no statistical deviation of X or Y spermatozoa from the average.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the silver!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This whole question thread is awesome, I never even thought of it!</p>
<p>...so the reason the population skews female (51-49 i believe?) is not more females being born but being more likely to survive? Or is it that they live on her and outlive men skewing the numbers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are slightly more humans being born as male than female. But women tend to live longer than men, so that when you count humans of all ages there will be more women than men. At some average age, there will be more women of that age than men. That age probably depends a lot on where you live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, female fetuses are actually better at surviving high stress levels compared to male fetuses. So if there's some really stressful event, like a natural disaster something like that, there will actually be more females born within the months following then males. The male fetuses are more likely to have miscarried. I can't remember off the top of my head if that's just at a certain gestational age (aka weeks of pregnancy) or over all during pregnancy, but there have been studies after serious earthquakes and other sick disasters that show majority of females being born within the months following </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit 2: Also digging deeper, <a href="https://genetics.thetech.org/ask/ask296" target="_blank">this answer from a Stanford PhD</a> seems to contradict the above, saying that XYY produce mostly normal sperm and the reason why is currently unknown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Klinefelter and Turner syndrome arise from improper segregation of chromatids during meiosis. </p>
<p><em>i.e.</em> when the cell replicates it’s DNA and is packing it into gametes, sometimes multiple copies of the same genes can end up in the one gamete. This isn’t good because ideally you get one from mom one from dad. </p>
<p>What this ends up meaning is that you could get say a “y” from your dad and an “xx” from your mom which results in the child having the “xxy” genotype, this is klinefelters syndrome.</p>
<p>Where does this seemingly extra sex chromatid come from? It was originally supposed to be in a different gamete entirely. This means that there’s now a gamete which has no sex chromatid at all. </p>
<p>This second case can result in turners syndrome. Where the child has the “X<em>” genotype. From my understanding a “Y</em>” genotype is theoretically possible, but is 100% lethal to an individual.</p>
<p>Good question, I’m glad someone asked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I said you can have splitting problems. But it doesnt make more Y or more X cells. Sometimes the chromosomes dont divide properly and one cell will end up with 2 and the other 0. Depending on what the mix is will determine whether or not it has an effect on the individual. But you dont ever end up with X, X, X, Y as your 4 cells you might end up with XX, O, Y, Y with O bring nothing and nonviable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry there might be a misunderstanding. It sounds like you are explaining how you would end up with an offspring with XXY or XYY, I was suggesting what if you choose an individual with XXY or XYY, would the ratios of that individual's X and Y sperm cells differ (to the OP's question)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting. Could a splitting problem possibly account for someone only ever having male or female children? Curious because a woman hasnt been born into my dads side of the family in almost 600 years. At least according to my grandmother, no one's bothered to do the research since she died.</p>
<p>Edit: Since I guess this wasn't painfully obvious to some people, the grandmother I'm talking about was married into the family. </p></div>		</li>

But if you flip a coin 1000 times and then do THAT millions of times, there might be an instance where you get 1000 heads. There are so many families, yours is just the statistical anomaly in this one facet. Other families have their own statistical anomalies. It happens. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Just a heads-up here, as you've worded it, this is incorrect.</p>
<p>You <em>expect</em> to get 500 heads, i.e. 500 heads is the average. However, the probability of getting 500 heads is BinomialPMF(n=1000,p=0.5,k=500) which is ≈0.02523, which is much less than the 0.5 necessary to be <em>likely</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dunno if that is possible. However there are other reasons that could cause that issue.</p>
<p>Maybe there is some genetic thing is causing the X chromosome to be damage, leading to either a not properly function sperm, or an embryo that doesn’t make it far into pregnancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be strange though as each x from &quot;Patrick's&quot; family would be from a different woman. (I.e. there isn't one faulty x that's being continuously handed down that's causing all the problems.)</p>
<p>My guess would be that it's most likely some girls that grandma didn't know about. This isn't a knock against grandma, girls are just a bit harder to track. They change names at marriage and have fewer legal documents. It also would be hard to know how many children died in infancy/ young childhood in say the 1520's. The family could have chosen to only keep males (especially if they only wanted an heir singular), or sometimes when you flip a coin you can get ten heads in a row. It's unlikely but possible. I'm also kind of assuming grandma isn't counting any cousins or anything like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlikely. All males get their X from their mother, so there would be a constant stream of fresh new X chromosomes in that family.</p>
<p>Long runs that appear to defy statistics are quite possible to reproduce. Go get $3.00 in pennies. Toss all 300 pennies in the air. Remove all the tails. Keep repeating -- shake, toss, remove the tails. You should get 8 or 9 repeats out of that, meaning you have a small pile of coins which came up &quot;Heads&quot; 8 or 9 times in a row. If you want more runs of consecutive &quot;Heads&quot;, get more pennies -- they are super-cheap. Only cost $1 for 100 of them!</p></div>		</li>
