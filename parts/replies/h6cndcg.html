			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very important point. The gasses in our air are mostly made up out of N₂ (atomic weight of 28) O₂ (weight of 32) and Argon (weight of 40) They really don't differ all that much in weight which is why the atmospheric disturbances <strong>and regular diffusion</strong> mix them up pretty good. This is also why He (4) and H₂ (2) are much higher up because they are significantly more light <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Nyos_disaster" target="_blank">and why CO₂ can 'float' near the ground even in open air conditions with wind and such</a></p>
<p>(Atomic number and density don't track exactly one to one, but in atmospheric gasses they do to a pretty high degree)</p>
<p>EDIT: I was being dense (very much intended) and remembered the atomic number in place of the atomic mass. I have changed the numbers accordingly, but because of how the ratio between protons and neutrons stays pretty much at 1 to 1, the argument still tracks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to point out that O_2 and N_2 have atomic weights of 32 and 28 respectively as they have two atoms per molecule. Important when compared to the noble gas Argon which doesn't really form bonds and has the atomic weight of 18 you mentioned. Same as H_2 having atomic weight of 2 rather than 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha wow, I wasn't paying attention again and wrote the atomic number instead of the atomic mass (classic physicist tries chemistry) . I did multiply the atomic number of O and N with 2 for their diaotomic gasses and didn't for Ar, but thats of course half the story.</p>
<p>I have edited my comment, thank you. The argument still stands though, because other than H₂, all these molecules have pretty much the same amount of protons and neurons and this just doubles their atomic mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fyi, it's molecular mass when referring to the diatomic molecules (or, ofc, any molecule). Atomic mass of oxygen is 16. Molecular mass of diatomic oxygen is 32.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't imagine the thoughts in all those people's heads as this was happening, it really must have seemed like the world was ending. Just think about it, you're going about your business with nothing seemingly wrong around you, then suddenly you can't breathe for some reason and nobody around you can either. You run outside to get some air and it makes no difference, your entire world has suddenly become uninhabitable for you. It's not a peaceful way to go either, like nitrogen. Many people think that &quot;suffocating&quot; pain you get in your lungs is a lack of oxygen, but it's actually from a build up of CO2. Our bodies can't detect low oxygen, if you go into a room filled with something else like nitrogen you don't feel a thing, you just simply fall asleep and don't wake up. A pure CO2 environment though would be nothing short of absolute torture. Fortunately it wouldn't take too long to lose consciousness, but until you did it would be utterly agonizing. Through all that pain you would be automatically trying to gasp for air, and all this does is build the CO2 up in your body even more</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) it’s not actually in danger of running out soon, but the supply is low, that is it’s being extracted pretty slowly so it’s just not super abundant. Funnily enough a considerable amount of that supply gets pumped into storage by the US government. Back into underground caves. </p>
<p>2) yeah it leaks up and a bunch of it gets blown away into space by solar wind. But you can also take helium out of the atmosphere so it doesn’t mean the helium in your escaped balloon will end up in space</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The helium that exists on earth is a product of the natural decay of radioactive atoms deep underground. This helium comes up with natural gas, and it's a decision at that point whether or not to bother capturing it. The USA had a gigantic helium stockpile created during the cold war, but more recently started selling it off at very low prices. So companies stopped bothering with capturing helium, as it stopped being economical. So while it's not super rare, if you don't grab it right as it comes out of the ground, it goes away and you never get a second chance at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was just at the top of the sky that'd be nice, we could collect it.</p>
<p>First recall that 'temperature' is just an average measurement of random kinetic energy in a group of atoms.  That means that any individual atom in a group of atoms at a given temperature will, on average, be moving at that speed. And some atoms slower than that, and some atoms faster.</p>
<p>Then there's the concept of escape velocity.  That is, at what speed is an object moving so fast that the gravity of the given celestial body it's on won't ever be enough to decellerate it to 0, and thus the object will not orbit the body but leave and go off into space.</p>
<p>Well... turns out that helium will float up to the top of our atmosphere, but the temperature at the top of the atmosphere is actually high enough that the individual atoms are close to escape velocity.  Especially those faster-than average atoms in the mix.  Plus there's the solar wind which comes from the Sun that constantly blast the upper atmosphere and kicks away any atoms, not just the light helium and hydrogen atoms.</p>
<p>So helium quite literally floats off, not just to the top of the atmosphere, but into space.</p></div>		</li>
