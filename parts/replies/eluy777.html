			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically not true. Stars certainly have angular size, as they are (roughly) spherical like our Sun is, but very far away.</p>
<p>For reference: Mars has average radius of \~3400 km, at close approach it is \~60 million km away, which gives around 23 arcseconds angular size. Alpha Centauri A, the closest star outside the solar system, has radius of \~850 thousand km, and is \~41e12 (41 trillions) km away, which gives around 4 milliarcseconds angular size - 5,7 thousand times smaller than that of Mars at close approach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about no <em>appreciable</em> angular size when viewed by the naked eye, and are therefore effectively points for practical purposes?</p>
<p>Edit: Now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/bhnokg/why_dont_planets_twinkle_as_stars_do_my/elvfro3/" target="_blank">some guy below</a> is saying they <em>are</em> literal points of light due to quantum thinggummy, so I don't what to believe anymore...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not single points of light. The light passing through your pupil produces a diffraction pattern and you will see a star with an appreciable size. This will be significantly larger than your calculated geometric angular size. Observing a light source with zero angular size doesnâ€™t really make any sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that arcseconds number just measuring the difference in radii along one Dimension though? So the difference in 2d surface area would be pi*(5.700^2) times smaller, or about 100 million times smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arcseconds represent an angle, a one-dimensional number, just like a radius. If you want angular representation of surface area, you need solid angles, which are measured in square degrees or steradians. So yes, you are right.</p></div>		</li>
