			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, sorry! It is super creepy, but I also think it's fascinating. If you do an image search for &quot;child's skull with baby teeth,&quot; you'll see a huge number of them (though some are of the same skull from different angles). It really helped me understand what's going on and how teeth &quot;coming in&quot; works.</p></div>		</li>
