			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking a telescope like Arecibo does not produce pictures in the normal sense. You can think of it like a digital camera that only has 1 pixel. The real power of Arecibo is the sensitivity of that one pixel, which is the result of a massive 305 m wide dish. That sensitivity allows us to detect signals that are just too faint for most other radio telescopes. So generally the telescope is used to detect objects or to keep records of how the brightness of objects change over time. Arecibo also has (almost) unique capabilities to <a href="https://www.naic.edu/ao/scientist-user-portal/planetary-sciences" target="_blank">actively map asteroids</a> by emitting a concentrated burst of microwaves and observing the reflection off the asteroid several minutes later (when it arrives back to the telescope). That isn't a picture in the traditional sense, but it's pretty cool.</p>
<p>Some of the instruments on the telescope also allow us to look at multiple directions of the sky simultaneously. For example, the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/alfa/gen_info/info_obs.shtml" target="_blank">ALFA</a> (Arecibo L-band Feed Array) has 7 pixels. Using this, or even with 1 pixel, you can build up a &quot;picture&quot; of a part of the sky by raster scanning in lines. This is essentially the approach that the <a href="http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/index.php/" target="_blank">ALFALFA</a> survey used to image 1/6th of the sky. Even with that data however we are normally interested in detecting galaxies, not making pictures (as most galaxies would just be points), but there are exceptions. Here is an <a href="https://academic.oup.com/view-large/figure/57280613/stw2083fig3.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> made by Luke (using Arecibo data) showing two galaxy groups where there are enormous (many times larger than a galaxy) plumes of hydrogen gas that have been ripped out of the galaxies. For comparison, <a href="https://www.legacysurvey.org/viewer#10:20:00%20%2021:00:00" target="_blank">here</a> is an optical image of the same part of the sky.</p>
<p>Other radio telescopes can take &quot;pictures&quot; of the sky, but this is typically done with arrays of smaller dishes such as the <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/visit/very-large-array/" target="_blank">VLA</a> or <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/" target="_blank">ALMA</a>. An example of such an image you may have seen from ALMA is from a proto-planetary disc around a young star, <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-releases/revolutionary-alma-image-reveals-planetary-genesis/" target="_blank">HL Tau</a>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that you guys had a ridiculously high resolution compared to optical telescopes.</p>
<p>Sometimes people want to take a picture of the lunar landers (descent stage) but it's of course impossible with an earth based telescope or Hubble because their angular resolution was too low.</p>
<p>But, could you guys have done that?</p></div>		</li>
