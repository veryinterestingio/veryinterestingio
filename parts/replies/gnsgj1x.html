			<div class="markdown"><p>We tend to think of our brains kind of like a computer. There's sensors that deliver information, we store files (memories) in a specific spot, and retrieve them when we need to, etc. And the real &quot;me&quot; is kind of like the OS that organizes and monitors everything.</p>
<p>And that idea of how we work is almost completely wrong. </p>
<ul>
<li>Our brains are <a href="https://definitionmining.com/index.php/2019/05/06/attention-and-expectations/" target="_blank">expectation making machines</a>. We experience the world, find patterns, and create expectations. Essentially all of our thoughts and everything we observe is really &quot;expectations&quot;, predictions our brains make</li>
<li>For example, our eyes see two flat images, and our brains create a 3d view of what the world looks like, what we expect the world is like. Those original 2d images don't exist anywhere, the &quot;OS&quot; doesn't see them, they're not saved, they're just steps in a process</li>
<li>We don't have memories stored in specific places to be retrieved. Forming a memory is kind of like rewiring the CPU while it's running so that it works differently.</li>
<li>Our thoughts are &quot;files&quot; or &quot;programs&quot;, they're predictions. Think about touching the wall or getting a glass of water or licking the floor. Your head is filled with expectations of what those experiences would be like. All of our imagination is a series of predictions/expectations, and we can even though if memories as &quot;what would it be like to relive that moment&quot;, another kind of prediction</li>
<li>It's possible to describe almost everything we &quot;think&quot; as different kinds of expectations. Every &quot;thought&quot; is a bunch of predictions of what we expect the world to be like in since situation</li>
</ul>
<p>We're constantly bombarded with predictions and expectations and have to have some kind of way to sort through them all. There's lots of different ways to do this, but the hormones our brain releases play a big role in what seems important at any moment. This is what we mean by a &quot;fight or flight&quot; response, in some situations our brain releases hormones that shut down a lot of possible pathways/predictions, and only leave us with two options.</p>
<p>Have you ever been trying to remember the name of a movie, and you can't remember it and it's really frustrating? And then you give up and 5 minutes later it pops in to your head? That's because our brain suppresses unimportant pathways (like pop trivia knowledge) when we're under stress and need to do something important. Our brains evolved hundreds of thousands of years ago, when &quot;movie names&quot; wasn't something that could cause stress, so we're not evolved to deal with that kind of &quot;problem&quot;.</p>
<p>Keys that I'm already holding aren't that important, there's no circuit in my brain to constantly remind me of everything I'm currently wearing/touching/etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everybody has different talents. It may mean that you're a typical in some way, or it may mean that you will keep a particularly large model and so are less sensitive to individual changes.</p>
<p>In all probability what it is is selection bias. You notice all the times you have a problem with this issue but you don't notice all the times you don't.</p>
<p>Having posited the idea that your particularly bad at this, you are now looking for examples of being particularly bad at this, so you notice them.</p>
