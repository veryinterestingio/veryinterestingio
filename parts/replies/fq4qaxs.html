<p>One of my friends did a bodybuilding competition and near the time, he would have to be restrained to stop himself from eating, like he would have Homered a bag of flour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very difficult standards all around. Even people who work their ass off to get strong and just consume calories to make muscle will look like a strongman type of body. Just big all round with less tone. Then you have people like me who just try not to eat too much and do light workouts here and there and I can sort of border on the trim and muscular frame. just from not eating excess calories and some semi-intense body weight exercises. I never had the desire to get super ripped because that huge spike in efforts and starvation would only make me nominally &quot;more attractive&quot; I will stick with my &quot;He looks like he kinda could be ripped under that sorta baggy shirt&quot; look. Spoiler Alert. I'm not ripped. tricked you :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends. &quot;Bodybuilders&quot; get very very lean a few weeks prior, with the last week of sodium manipulation to achieve thin-skin appearance. &quot;Fitness models&quot; are fairy lean year round (it's their job) and would peak for photos shoots or fitness model shows; these peaks are not at bodybuilding level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this just because being lean means you aren't overweight and being overweight makes you die earlier? Or is there a genral rule where leaner = healthier?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I know is, when an overweight person loses weight, all the &quot;bad-if-high numbers&quot; drop (blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.). So it's probably better to not be overweight.</p></div>		</li>
