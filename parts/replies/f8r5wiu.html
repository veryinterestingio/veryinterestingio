			<div class="markdown"><p>the same way the sun heats up the earth despite there being almost nothing in between--radiation.</p>
<p>basically you pump all the heat to a radiator to one area of the ISS that's not in the sun or at least angled so that it's surface is not in the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I didn’t realize it had to be radiated out in the shade. That’s interesting. I guess I though all the suns energy got to us in photons. To be fair, I don’t really know wtf a photon is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are three methods of heat transfer: Conduction, convection and radiation.</p>
<p>Conduction is where energy is physically passed from one area to another through direct contact.</p>
<p>Convection where heat conducts from a hot area to a free-fluid (e.g. air) which then is free to move away and transfer the energy elsewhere.</p>
<p>And radiation where the thermal energy is released in the form of electromagnetic radiation - mostly infra red.  This is how the sun transfers heat to the earth through the vacuum of space.  Because the ISS is in a near-vacuum, the only way to get heat out of the closed system is via radiation.  THis is where those fins come into play:  They will use a system similar to a refrigerator to get as much thermal energy from other areas of the station into those panels where the panels can then radiate the heat away.  These panels will be set at 90 degree angles to the solar panels so that the solar panels can maximise energy absorbtion from the sun while the radiators can minimise it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know I've loves space ever since I was a kid and I gotta say that it <em>never</em> occurred to me that spaceships would get too hot in space. So you're saying that when movies like Apollo 13 showed the crew freezing their butts off when they had to keep shutting down the LM's power supply to save battery, it was a lie? </p>
<p>Or were those ships so small that they <em>did</em> need heaters?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand for Apollo 13 the sun was shining on the back of the aircraft, which blocked a lot of the heat from coming through. I don’t know if that explains all of it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, once they shut down the systems, there was no heat being produced, so they actually did freeze in the capsule.  Thete was a huge worry that as they brought systems back online, the water would wreck havoc with the electronics.  And, surprisingly,  most of the condensattion that froze was just moisture from the 3 astronauts exhaling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for taking time to answer! I work in the film industry so I never get to talk with literal rocket scientists, like ever!</p></div>		</li>
