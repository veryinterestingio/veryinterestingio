			<div class="markdown"><p>Many many years ago. Got it at work, was sick. Quite a few people thought I was messing around (I wasn’t entirely sure what was going on to be honest). Thankfully my superintendent knew. Not necessarily the science behind it, just the symptoms and the (relative) cause.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not necessarily easy to do -- almost everyone will just pee more -- but it can happen and you don't want to be the person that this ends up happening to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been water intoxicated. It's not fun. My legs felt so dizzy and heavy. I had a massive headache. My parents took me to lay down and I puked clear vomit into my sister's shoes.</p>
<p>Looking back on it, none of us realized the danger at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading how dangerous this is is crazy. Back in high school, my friend and I thought it would be really funny to try and see how much water we could drink throughout the school day. It got to the point where we felt “drunk” but I always assumed that was because we were just giddy. Guess it was the onset of water poisoning!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is essentially correct. Your blood becomes hypotonic, meaning the concentration of electrolytes decreases from the increased volume. Your blood pressure climbs (initially anyway) because more volume in the same space equals more pressure. More concerning is you suffer the effects of not having enough sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. These are the biggies for causing life threatening symptoms like brain function impairments/seizures (sodium) and heart problems (potassium, magnesium, calcium, and to a lesser degree sodium). The problem is compounded by an increasingly inefficient heart trying to move an abnormally large volume of blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been dealing with a complicated problem that is essentially the mirror opposite of this. I take an ACE inhibitor for blood pressure. It has a diuretic effect, but is potassium-sparing. I am chronically dehydrated. Also massively overweight. Getting enough water and the proper balance of electrolytes is crazy hard. I’m not supposed to supplement potassium. Have no way of knowing daily how much sodium to take in. Blood sugar levels look artificially high due to blood concentration. Lipolysis is “turned off” in hypohydration. Doing keto to lose weight causes further water loss, fatigue, and BP roller-coaster. I really need a doctor who knows how to factor in all these variables and give me a course of treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, had a friend die this way. It was many years ago so the exact details are fuzzy, but he was a young, healthy cop,  training to be a bike cop. It was an insanely hot day in the city, and he was chugging tons and tons of water in a short period of time. It was a really rare thing, but there you go.</p></div>		</li>
