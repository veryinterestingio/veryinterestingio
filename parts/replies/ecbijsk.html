			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah development seems to be more about bursts than any steady growth, and kids seem to pick some things up ridiculously quick compared to what you expect of them.</p>
<p>I also find the more you talk and engage with them, the quicker they learn. My niece and nephew were great at conversation really early. A neighbour's kid who was a year older seemed way behind, but then his mum basically ignored him a lot of the time and they generally had less family around regularly to engage them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Must be nice to be home with the kiddo. I wish my wife could make enough money so I could stay be a stay at home dad. I’ve taken some time off this year for hand surgery. I spent the entire time reading and talking to her.  Her vocabulary skyrocketed in a the month I was off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was my mom's first kid, she was 24 and had a very strong support system. She doted on me and talked to me and read to me and tried to teach me as much as possible</p>
<p>I was speaking full sentences incredibly early and could read when I was three</p>
<p>My brother and sister, who are five and eight years younger than me, didn't get the same advantages as my mom was in a lot worse place in her life and their development was a lot more delayed </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Children can just learn a phrase and repeat it without really understanding what it means. They can understand that a phrase is used in a particular situation or context and rattle it off so that it seems they are acting older and understanding more than they really do. </p>
<p>Gestalt learning is the name IIRC. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. However, my child learns phrases and is able to ‘appropriate’ them in an advanced way according to an early childhood development professor who happens to be my mom. Some bias may exist:) you have to let me have this one, I live vicariously through and am validated as a parent by my kid’s success.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is for real happening now that she’s two going on 13 years old. When she gets mad she sometimes starts ‘wishing’ things. It’s almost like she’s praying, ‘ohh I wish mommy and daddy go away. Forever. And NEVER COME BACK AGAIN!! They go away forever.’ Joys of parenting. She’s usually sweet though.</p></div>		</li>
