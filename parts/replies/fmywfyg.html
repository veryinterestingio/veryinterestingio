			<div class="markdown"><p>I may recommend you looking for a therapist. It could really help you work that out (no joke). Living your life procrastinating something you need (sleep) just cause you are expecting a boring/unhappy day the next morning it might lead you to mood disorders, fellow redditor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lately at the end of the day once the kids are in bed, I feel like I need some time to <em>relax.</em> So I find myself staying up late for no reason, sometimes fighting sleep in an effort to get enough <em>relax</em> time. Forgot the fact that there is nothing in the world more relaxing than a full night of sleep. No, I want to stay up and watch just oooooone more episode of Picard. </p>
<p>My brain is stupid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>THIS !</p>
<p>I sleep at most, 6 hours a Night. I allways feel like 24 hours is too short of a Day/Night cycle, there is just so many other things my brain wants to do than sleep. Im even unemployed, so it’s not like i have to get up and “waste” half of my day at work :S</p>
<p>That being Said i Also have AD/HD (diagnosed at The age of 25), so that might have something to do with it :b</p></div>		</li>
