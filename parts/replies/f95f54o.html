<blockquote>
<p>At supersonic speeds, the opposite is true - an increase in area that the flow can pass through causes an increase in velocity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you elaborate on this ? Basically, why after the throat (in the diverging section) the velocity increases with the area while pressure and temperature decrease ? Considering this is already in supersonic speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The velocity increases in the divergent section because although the area is increasing, the density is also decreasing. The decreasing density causes the static pressure to drop and the flow therefore continues to speed up to preserve stagnation pressure across the flow. </p>
<p>Although the increasing area has the effect of reducing fluid speed, the effect of decreasing the fluid static pressure is greater than the effect of the in creasing area, causing the flow's speed to continue to increase despite the increasing area. </p>
<p>It's counter intuitive but as another comment mentioned, compressible supersonic flow is gonna behave quite differently to the stuff you learn at the start, leading to some very counter intuitive phenomena.</p>
<p>In relation to why velocity increases with decreasing temperature and pressure: as they decrease the fluid losses thermal energy, in order to conserve the fluids energy this energy is converted to kinetic energy. This is basically the purpose of a C-D nozzle, converting the internal energy of high pressure and temperature flows to kinetic energy. Which is what you need to produce thrust or spin a turbine or whatever</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't counting with the decrease of the fluid density (since the fluid is now compressible), thank you for your clarification. As you said, supersonic flow is nothing like subsonic flow and it is going to behave differently - I will need to look more into this stuff, it's really fascinating and counter intuitive!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the 'effective pressure' against the outlet of supersonic flow be 0, or very high?</p></div>		</li>
