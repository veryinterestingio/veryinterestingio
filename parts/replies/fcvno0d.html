			<div class="markdown"><p>ITE instruments have less features, and lower power due to it being harder to fit them everything into a custom shell, but they can be almost invisible. They can become clogged relatively quickly, especially if you have a lot of discharge, so need to be cleaned and dried every day to avoid becoming faulty. </p>
<p>BTE instruments have the most features, highest power output and are the most robust, but they are the largest aids. Great for people with dexterity issues. </p>
<p>RITE/RIC instruments fit in between the two - they have all the features of a BTE aid but, by moving the receiver into the ear canal, they are a lot more discreet. The receiver/speaker can be prone to failure if you have an ear with a lot of discharge or have issues cleaning it, but the HCP can replace it themselves in most cases, significantly shortening repair times.</p>
<p>EDIT: RIC/RITE's don't have as high a power output as BTE's, but it is sufficient for over 90% of patients. </p>
<p>As for cost, it depends on the HCP - as a manufacturer there isn't a huge difference between our wholesale price, but a lot of HCPs charge a premium for custom/ITE aids, due to there being more TLC required over the life of the aid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small note to that. ITE will soon be available without being highly customised and can then adjust to one's ear. This will give a significant boost in ITEs since retailers usually don't want to sell these because of the high customisation demand. If someone is recommending BTE over ITE, you should listen carefully to that person and question it. The trend is going to ITE as soon as it is more common to not customise them anymore individually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One key advantage of the RIC type is that you can control the amount of natural sound that gets in.</p>
<p>The ITE generally blocks the ear and you only get processed sound. The BTE is open so you get both natural and processed sound.</p>
<p>The RIC uses domes which are available in many different sizes, and in both open and closed designs. If you only have partial hearing loss, you can use an open dome and still let plenty of natural sound through. Or you can use a closed dome and get all of your sound from the processor. The domes are easily changed so you can try it both ways and see what works best for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wear hearing aids (RITE). one important distinction is that ITE hearing aids tend to block out more natural noise if there is a complete seal (no little air hole) to let natural sound come through. RITE style there is a little dome that site inside the ear but doesn't block out all the sounds since it's perforated. Kind of like Apple's new Airpods 2. This way you can hear what's being amplified and also sounds that are not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for taking the time to write all that out. Hearing loss runs in my family. About a year ago mine finally got to the point that I was prescribed hearing aids (I’m 43 now). In July I was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma on the right and had surgery to remove the tumor. Sadly they had to sever the auditory nerve to fully get the tumor, so I’m now deaf on the right.  </p>
<p>I got a CROS system, which helps a bit. Here’s my question...  </p>
<p>Would it be possible using my connected phone app to have an app augmentation that shows sound waves of current sound in real time, where I could tap a wave to select a sound and then tell the hearings aids to stop processing for that specific wave type? Effectively I’d be muting (or not boosting, however you want to think of it) a specific noise. Taking it a step further, could the aids be programmed to emit a countering noise to effectively block the sound I don’t want to hear, while still processing all the other sounds around me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry that you need a CROS system, while there have been significant improvements in that tech recently its still a major pain to have single sided deafness. </p>
<p>Unfortunately we're still a long way away from that type of functionality - some apps will allow fine tuning of overall amplification, but there's nothing that allows singling put of specific sounds, even during programming by an HCP.</p>
<p>The closest thing coming up is the remote fine tuning which a lot of manufacturers are moving towards - it has the potential of you sitting in a bar in contact with your HCP who can fine tune your aids to maximise performance in that environment, either by creating a specific program or by altering an existing one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thought I'd reply to you directly because as an industry/regulatory guy I figure you can best relate to what I'm about to say.</p>
<p>I think Bluetooth-capable hearing aids like mine are a Pandora's box of incredibly practical applications that aren't immediately obvious and have nothing to do with hearing loss. Some are legit; others are highly unethical.</p>
<p>For instance, I occasionally do spoken word performances in an amateur variety show hosted by my local community theater. I've done ten-minute monologues where I read my piece to myself through my hearing aids by streaming a recording of it via my phone, timed roughly two words ahead of my actual delivery.</p>
<p>It's like having a teleprompter. I can hit the words perfectly this way--no uhs, ums, forgetting where I am, etc.--but since it's an audio prompt I can also hit the inflections. It took me some practice to get used to, but it works like a charm and the audience has no clue. Granted that in-ear prompters aren't new, but as you know, modern hearing aids are common and essentially unnoticeable, and even when seen, nobody questions their purpose.</p>
<p>That's where the unethical uses come in. I could also cheat on exams, eavesdrop on private conversations, transmit proprietary information to third parties, convince people I have miraculous powers, etc. Hell, I could even use them to track people's movements through the &quot;find my hearing aid&quot; function. Not very far, or at least not yet, but ranges have a funny way of increasing. And of course their use is protected. And IIRC Bluetooth communication between paired devices has strong encryption.</p>
<p>If hearing aids have unethical applications, I gotta wonder what it's gonna be like someday when electronic vision correction is common and unobtrusive. And I don't just mean glasses...I'm talking about artificial corneas and such.</p>
<p>Is this being talked about in the industry?</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Note on that &quot;teleprompter&quot; thing: in case you haven't seen this, it's not uncommon for amateur spoken word performers to take out their phones and hit a couple of keys before beginning. The audience assumes they're recording themselves for future improvement. I'm just starting the playback.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Johnny Depp actually has a custom earpiece for the teleprompter function you described and, if you don't need the full functionality of a hearing aid, they can be even smaller than our smallest instrument. </p>
<p>As for cheating in exams etc, it does pose some difficulties for invigilators, but most aids with full Bluetooth functionality are visible to the naked eye at this time, so if they know what to look for it's easy to spot.</p>
<p>In 5 years time, that won't be the case, so it does pose some challenges, that's for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, sorry, I figured you knew all that. Just wanted to put it out there. Every technology has its ethical issues, and of course these aren't new questions, but judging from the comments in this thread, hearing aid technology is perceived as so beneficial that nobody's talking about its potential misapplications...not even hearing aid users.</p></div>		</li>
