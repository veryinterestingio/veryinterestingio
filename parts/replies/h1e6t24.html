			<div class="markdown"><p>So the internet is a series of tubes, and your router is like a toilet. You put your shit into the toilet and the toilet makes sure that it is makes it into the tubes of the internet when you flush the toilet.</p>
<p>Part of this is making this works is that the toilet makes sure that you gave it a proper poop, but you didn't you gave it an ungodly monster of both size and smell. The toilet will still try to turn it into several proper poops, and you may have to flush it a few times to get it all into the pipes. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of whatever fecal hellspawn you created, it just won't fit into the pipes. You've tried flushing it repeatedly so now you have multiple poo-beasts all trying to fit into the same pipe and your toilet is crying out from the load (and you too, probably).</p>
<p>The water in the toilet is backing up, there is no room for any more of your shit. So you try the plunger, but it's too late, the eldritch effluence has coalesced into a dark god of defecation and all hope is lost.</p>
<p>With grim determination you accept your fate and shut the water off.  You get out your poop-knife and get to work. Sacrificing your dignity, humanity, sanity, and olfactory senses you remove the offending obstruction. </p>
<p>As you turn the water back on and the sound of a proper test flush, you glance in the mirror. You have aged; your eyes no longer hold the gleam of youth and you innocence is lost. The world no longer shines with colors as bright as you remember and the spring breeze never smells as fresh again.</p>
<p>You wake up with a start, the dim glow of your monitor dragging you back to reality; it was all just a dream. A message appears on the screen, &quot; EMSG_RTR_TRAN_ROUTE_NO_ROUTE:&quot;</p></div>		</li>
