			<div class="markdown"><p>Dr. Anne Stone, A plenary speaker at Plant and Animal Genome (one of the biggest annual conventions in genomics), spoke about this very topic in January.</p>
<p>Her slides:

<p>Tb commonly goes between bovine and humans. However native Americans didn't bring any bovine with them. So how did they find tb scars on the bones of ancient Peruvian humans? </p>
<p>Best hypothesis: Freaking SEALS that carried it all the way from Eastern Africa (Ethiopia region specifically).  They sampled all sorts of animals known to get infected with Tb (which is rather sad) and found that the tb from seals was the best matching cousin of the strain found in the ancient Americans (nevermind the difficulty in sequencing samples isolated from old bone scars). </p>
<p>I focus on plant genomes personally, but jeeze that was good and fascinating work. It's worth a flip through the slides just to see how hard some of this work was to do. I'm going to go do just that to make sure I didn't misremember some of that and just spread untruths. Don't even get me started on the group that assembled a nearly complete dodo genome from the thigh marrow of a skeleton in the London museum.... Ugh Dr. Beth Shapiro is goals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The ancestors of modern bacteria are exactly as old as our ancestors from any given time. Our pre-human ancestors were also way older than humanity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TB hasn't really evolved to kill us, nor has any virus or bacteria. From an evolutionary standpoint, it makes more sense to fly under the radar and keep your host alive and transmittable. For covid19, one of its key strengths as a virus is the asymptotic carriers who feel no effects and can act as super spreaders. This is the same with typhoid, and in particular, thyroid Mary who was also a super spreader and infected many 100s of people. (The incorrectly named) Spanish flu is still with us today, but it evolved to be less damaging to its hosts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typhoid Mary is a very good example of an asymptotic carrier.. just one little note: she’s only been known to have infected around 50 people. However, since she used different aliases and refused to cooperate with authorities and doctors, the real number could be much higher like you say. Tony Labella is another interesting one! He’s an Italian immigrant who’s presumed to have caused over 100 cases (with five deaths).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Influenza mutates way more rapidly than corona, Spanish flu is probably around in a less deadly form than the 1918 version... Which was thought to have started/spread due to close proximity in trench warfare. A deadly virus loses its disadvantage when the next potential host cannot get away from the sick and dying. Spanish flu could kill a 20 year old 24-72 hours after symptoms began. The older generations were mostly spared because they probably had partial immunity from a similar less deadly flu that would have been 30-40 years previous.</p></div>		</li>
