<blockquote>
<p>British researchers who tested people for influenza antibodies before and after each flu season for 5 years found that an average of 18% of them appeared to have contracted a flu infection each season, but only 23% of that group got sick, according to a report in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time this stuff pops up I wonder &quot;Does that happen to me?&quot; just out of curiosity. I went a number of years no flu vaccination and ended up with worst case of mild allergies that I could never tie to actually getting the Flu. All the while people around me were dropping like flies.</p>

<p>I wish I understood more about my body and my immune system.</p>

<p>This has no relevance to anyone but myself...sorry...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold</p>

<p>Basically it is just a catch-all term for mild symptoms caused by any virus that can't do us a serious harm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's normally how it works, it's just in the cases of some diseases, your immune system will overreact and cause the severe symptoms. From what I've read, COVID-19 generally does very minor damage from the viral infection itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Cytokine storms are killing some of these people, but other people are getting pulmonary scarring and fibrosis from damage to the lungs caused by the virus. I've been told we're also seeing cardiac damage that's not really explained by the immune response. This is a nasty bug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Wouldn’t you expect that young people would have more severe symptoms if most of the symptoms were caused by an immune reaction? That was the case with swine flu in 2009, wasn’t it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've had it happen a handful of times while having the cold. The pain usually doesn't last more than a day, but it'll easily flare back up after a coughig fit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a balancing act. If you have a weak immune system the virus will take over, if the immune response is too strong the virus will be cleared rapidly, but the immune response continues and causes major damage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that it's an &quot;overreaction&quot; is pretty much BS. It's a reaction. The immune system is responding to a major infection. The work it does results in inflammation. If you give someone immunosuppressants that reduces that inflammation, then by definition you have blocked their immune system from clearing the virus and made the problem worse. Maybe you will delay the inflammation, but you are delaying it by allowing the virus to replicate more. Since we have nothing to treat viruses like this, you are kneecapping the only tool the person has to fight the virus.</p>
<p>This is also why people on these drugs long term before getting infected have high risk. An infection that makes its way into lungs that are immunosuppressed is going to have an easy time replicating and causing chaos.</p></div>		</li>
