			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my biggest pet peeve in life. The fact that I can't bank my sleep is such major bullshit and yes rationally I understand why, to some degree, but....... c'mon, evolution! You evolved my appendix to be useless, why not give me better sleep schedule options?</p>
<p>edit: I retract my statement about the useless appendix and have been thoroughly schooled that it does in fact have a use haha</p></div>		</li>

<p>We have a bad habit of labelling anything not absolutely necessary useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being able to postpone sleep, in effect &quot;borrowing&quot; from future wakefulness is already an almost exclusively human feat of evolution.   That combined with a fancy water cooled heat dispersal method (sweat) allowed humans to survive long enough to engineer language and cities and beer by chasing game animals until they collapsed from exhaustion. </p>
<p>Banking sleep would require healing injuries that haven't happened yet.   The best our bodies can do is try and bank energy in the form of fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For 1,999,850 of the last 2 million years, hominids nearly always got as much sleep as they needed or more. We may be evolving to need less sleep in general, but evolution takes millennia.</p>
<p>The industrial revolution and beyond have royally fucked our concept of proper sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually really like the concept of second sleep and I try to employ it if I can. </p>
<p>The idea being that I’ll go to bed around 9:30 or 10, and naturally wake up around 2 am, and instead of tossing and turning trying to get back to sleep, I’ll do something relaxing in bed, or maybe go sit in the bathtub and let the warm water run over me for a bit, put on a podcast or some Netflix or whatever, and then I’ll almost always fall back asleep by around 4 and wake up refreshed at 7:30. </p>
<p>Of course this isn’t for everyone but in Canada in the winter when it gets dark out so early, I just try to let my body roll with it and get into bed as early as I can and then make use of my middle-of-the-night quiet time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I mean if I didn't have to work 8-9 hours a day I'd probably spend an extra 4-5 hours a day just sleeping, it is honestly the shit and one of my favorite activities lol</p></div>		</li>
