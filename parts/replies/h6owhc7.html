			<div class="markdown"><p>The gap widens daily, after you buy it.</p>
<p>With an ICE, you buy the car, and as it wears it becomes less efficient (think those old beater cars that barely run with smoke coming out).</p>
<p>With an EV, you buy it, and then the next year your power company installs a new wind farm, your EV gets better emissions that day. It's part of the reason it's so hard to tell you specifics, because it actually depends on the efficiency of the grid 5 years from now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Three things this study does not measure or control:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Battery replacement.
Over the course of a 18 year, 200,000km life (the lowest cited in the paper, other figures include a 270,000km life expectancy for the vehicle), I would expect at least some of the batteries to be replaced since even the longest warranties are 8 years and 100,000 miles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Battery recycling and end of life.
Lithium is a lot more ecotoxic than an aluminum block engine and it needs to go somewhere. Recycling is ghg intensive using either smelting or a chemical process to extract the metals from the cells. This will have an impact on their figures.</p>
</li>
<li>Control for size of the vehicle
Most bevs are sedans or compacts. Including large SUVs in the data doesn't make sense when there's no alternative available. Some of these SUVs get only 20mpg compared to a large sedan at 30+ and compacts at 40+.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: I am very much pro-EV, I just want things to be studied well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The expected life of a battery is already about 250,000-500,000 miles. Your thought on looking at the warranty is like looking at a standard vehicle ice engine warranty of 4 year and 50,000 and suggesting the engine will need replacing not far after that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Absolutely! Always love more information on any topic.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Actually, the US has a really good waste oil recycling operation through the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/managing-reusing-and-recycling-used-oil" target="_blank">EPA</a>. All used motor oil can be re-refined into usable oil by cleaning it. The byproducts do include some heavy metals but at less than <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es034236p" target="_blank">0.5% of the total oil by ppm</a>. Contrast this with lithium batteries where the majority of the battery is lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely agree, oil filters end up in landfills en masse. Very much hate to see it. I'm not arguing for waste, just highlighting perceived faults in our current ev process and gaps in the research. The level of ecotoxicity attached to a quarter cup of used motor oil in a semi annual oil filter change is difficult to compare evenly with hundreds of pounds of used battery.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>We absolutely can and do reuse waste oil as already stated and linked. True, we can recycle the battery as well, but it does indeed release more emissions whether through smelting or chemical recycling. Both of these processes take far more energy and manufacturing capability than the process of re-refining used motor oil which is widespread and federally funded. We can recycle both, but we have to take into account the increased environmental cost of recycling batteries over oil. It may only move the needle 5% over the life of a vehicle, but we need to account for it.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually all electric cars need cooling, lubricating, airflow, and drivetrain systems as well. It's very much a fact that the number of moving parts is vastly diminished, but all other systems are needed both for passenger comfort and vehicle longevity. Motor on wheel still requires transmission, lubrication, and cooling parts, just far less</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't get to count battery emissions twice. Recycling a lithium battery into a new one is far LESS environmentally damaging than mining new materials. This REDUCES the footprint that the new battery going into the next car has, and that's where the emissions are captured. The cost to make the new battery. Nearly 100% of materials in batteries can be recovered economically. Think of recycling as the new mining, which is poised to explode as the supply of worn out batteries ramps up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're right, but you assume that the batteries will be recycled. This is beside the point since only about <strong>5%</strong> of lithium batteries are currently being recycled according to <a href="https://www.iisd.org/publications/sustainability-and-second-life-case-cobalt-and-lithium-recycling" target="_blank">2019 data from the IISD</a>. </p>
<p>The reason I think end of life should be accounted for right now, is that there's no good system in place that recycles or even disposes of lithium batteries safely. If we get to the point where the majority of lithium batteries are recycled, then we can stop accounting for the environmental factors of end of life.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Fully recycling lithium batteries amounts to about <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es302420z" target="_blank">54%</a> the ghg emissions of raw production. That's great! the second battery put into the vehicle will be 50% ghg cheaper in raw materials than the first, but this needs to be calculated in the study rather than simply hand-waved away. If it accounts positively, then awesome!</p>

<p>Yep, about 95% from what I've read although I can't come up with a source offhand. It is poised to explode, but not yet exploded.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As previously stated, I am all for EV's; and the evidence is clear there is a huge reduction in GHG emissions from ICE's. What I am <strong>not</strong> all for, however, is inaccuracies in methodology. What we seem to need to fix is the battery recycling industry. If we never talk about batteries being bad for the environment, we will never talk about fixing the problem. That's all I'm trying to bring to light.</p></div>		</li>
