			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment is fantastic, but I have one nit to pick. The Beatles absolutely intended it to be a concept album, though there was no name for that yet. It was written under the idea that they had this alter ego, &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, and that the album was a performance of theirs. In the beginning they introduce themselves, announce the show is starting, introduce &quot;Billy Shears&quot; who sings the next song, then at the end announce their departure.</p>
<p>It was also the first album to include the lyrics with it, and the album artwork was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Among many other things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are partly correct! Paul was gungho about the Sgt. Peppers concept, but John and George did not care for writing around it and did not take it into account when they wrote/produce their songs. They were wholly interested in making the album musically bound, though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This for sure. If you read about the writing of day in the life it is admitted that it is kind of a mess of a song that was pieced together. Definitely now bowing down to any larger concept, much less its own concept as a song.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember, it was mainly just Paul who was behind the whole alter ego band thing. I don't think the other guys were really into it as much, so I wouldn't say that they intended as a band to make a concept album.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would advice you guys to check out Geoff Emerick's (Beatles engineer) book &quot;Here, There, and Everywhere&quot;, on the processes of making records for the Beatles.</p>
<p>Geoff mentions Revoler lead to Pepper, Pepper was more experimental in its arrangement and tones.  During the rehearsals when John played the song &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; on acoustic, the engineers knew they were going to push the envelope as far as they could during the Peppers record.</p>
<p>One of the things he mentions during the making of Sgt Pepper is the use of images to create sounds.  John asked him to make him sound like &quot;the Dali lama on a mountain&quot;, Geoff's approach to put John's voice through a Leslie speaker (rotating speaker) from a Hammond.</p>
<p>Geoff also mentions that the Beatles were writing and rehearsing songs in a different section of the studio, and the engineers were listening to their process in a different room and making notes of the songs while they were being created.  Notes like the mood of the song, and the tonalities and colors of the song and instruments.</p>
<p>Check out Geoff speaking about the Pepper's records here:  <a href="https://youtu.be/neSNfOUIgQg" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/neSNfOUIgQg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny, the guy who would end up the core of a conspiracy theory about being replaced (&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_is_dead" target="_blank">Paul is dead</a>&quot;, Sept '69 per Wikipedia, starting with a rumor from Jan '67) was the one who like the alter ego band idea (Sgt Pepper's, released early '67).</p>
<p>If I were to spin this into /r/conspiracy material, I'd posit that record companies have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/9ym66n/eli5_why_is_the_beatles_sergeant_peppers/ea34mil/" target="_blank">protecting their profits</a> by killing their stars ever since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Music_Died" target="_blank">the day the music died</a>, and Paul and John were killed to keep them touring and quiet, respectively.  I'd then reference Jimi, Prince, Michael Jackson, and Kurt &quot;and I swear that I don't have a gun, no, I don't have a gun&quot; Cobain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A day in the life was a Paul song and a John song sown together. </p>
<p>Good Morning was inspired by a Cornflakes commercial. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think another part of the reason is that the US version of Revolver was missing three of the songs from the UK version (I'm Only Sleeping, And Your Bird Can Sing, and Doctor Robert). As a result, the LP was less than 30 minutes long and critics in the US didn't take it as seriously at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats one of the reasons Sgt Pepper bleeds from one track to another, so the US version couldnt arranged their tracks as they liked. Capitol records in the US, as opposed to EMI in the UK, would hold back several hits from an album so as to sell them with B-sides from various albums. That led Paul to find a way to subvert them, thus tracks that bled onto each other in a way that made reshuffling impossible. And with that Sgt Pepper was born.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny how it's 3 Lennon tracks. I wonder if this was partly because of his bigger than Jesus comments a few months prior to the release and the label were worried that the US wouldn't want to hear as much from him.  </p>
<p>Weird decision though, the first two are some of the higlights on the album and the latter, while not the best on the album is extremely enjoyable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda paraphrasing but I recall both Brian Wilson/Paul saying something like: No Rubber Soul, no Pet Sounds; No Pet Sounds, No Pepper.  One of the few times in music you’ll witness genuine competition leading to some of the greatest musical art of that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel the lead-up to his breakdown could be attributed to so many things; Brian’s on going history of abuse from his dad/indulgence in drugs, combined with his perfectionist approach to his music, and simply being in the music industry itself at the time he was in couldn’t have been an easy thing to keep oneself “sane” in. All that being said, you take one of those things out and we might have a very different musical history that we know and love today. </p></div>		</li>
