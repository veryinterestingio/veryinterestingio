<p>Curie points are (sorta) caused by the atoms being able to move enough so the electronic spin can't line up, this happens before the atoms have enough energy to break away and melt, so they're pretty closely related. </p>
<p>That's why &quot;homologous temperature&quot; is a useful concept, it is the temperature divided by the melting point(in Kelvin), so you can basically say things like &quot;the Curie point usually occurs in metals at a homologous temperature of 0.8&quot; (indicative value, that's almost definitely not a true statement)</p></div>		</li>
