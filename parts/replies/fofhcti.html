			<div class="markdown"><p>solar power enters an inverter.  The inverter chooses a load characteristic to match the solar and maximize the production.  However, when you do not need as much power the inverter can just as easily adjust the load characteristic to supply the coreewct amount of power instead of the maximimum amount of power.  If you are setting up a mini grid for a hospital or something I would recommend sunnyboy electronics.  The name is dumb but the equipment is good.</p>
<p>But this isn't being done at grid scale.  there they use contracts and load shedding and variable pricing rather than programmable electronics. Probably way cheaper at that scale.</p>
<p>tl;dr that applies to coal mines and wind turbines.  Not Hydro or Solar.</p>
<p>also I think that wind turbines can adjust their pitch to make them less effective, and therefore shed production.  But not the ones I play with</p></div>		</li>
