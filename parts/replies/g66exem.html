			<div class="markdown"><p>even if it doesn't have DNA similar to ours, we might not be able to rule out that it didn't originate on earth: suppose that earth already had weird RNA life at the time of the big splattery impact that formed the moon, and some of those splats ended up on venus with those now-extinct-on-earth biological pathways and moved in a different direction for a few billion years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply confirming that life can survive on other worlds with vastly different environments would give a huge boost to our models and estimates for extra-solar life.  Originating on Earth might not be as earth-shattering, but still an incredibly important discovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if life can travel from Earth to other planets and bloom there, then there's nothing to disprove that life didn't also arrive on Earth from another planet via panspermia. Since we know that interstellar objects enter our system from time to time, one of them could have brought life over here in one form or another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it fits anywhere within our phylogenetic tree of life (which would be obvious if it were more genetically similar to some terrestrial organism than that organism is to another) we would know with near certainty that panspermia occurred. If it uses similar molecules, like RNA/DNA, ATP, proteins, etc. then that may suggest a common origin but not definitively - it could also mean that those are just very likely molecules to be used in any origin of life. If it uses totally different molecules than we do, that would strongly suggest a separate origin of life from ours, which in turn would suggest that life is very common in the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a lot of biological molecules are what's called &quot;chiral&quot;, which has to do with the 3d structure. Proteins for instance are made up of amino acids that are all &quot;left-handed&quot;. Now &quot;right-handed amino acids can exist, and they could form proteins. Now if life on another planet used right-handed amino acids, or a mix, that would be really solid evidence that they weren't long-lost cousins of earth life. Ditto if DNA spun the other way, or their sugars were flipped. Extra-terrestrial life could be very similar to earth life biochemically speaking and still be recognizably alien.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Unless the emergence of life is extremely unlikely it is entirely possible early Earth had multiple life forms coexisting and one dominated the ecosystem. In fact it is unlikely, but not impossible that microbes on Earth exist which do no share our life form but they may be in an extreme environment which we haven't explored/characterized.</p></div>		</li>
