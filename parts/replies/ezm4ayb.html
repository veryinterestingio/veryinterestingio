			<div class="markdown"><p>Twins can be compared to the other twin, other people who are not twins get compared to.... whom?</p>
<p>>  then we would expect identical twins to have the same sexual orientation (NOT same sex sexual orientation, just the same one, i.e. both gay or both straight etc...) at a much higher rate than 2 other random people. </p>
<p>Twins having a correlation to the other twin, who do the random people have correlation with? Themselves? Siblings? What are you asking to compare to here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fraternal twins would probably be a good comparison.  i.e. Do identical twins have a higher percentage chance of having the same sexual orientation than fraternal twins?  That's probably more specific than OP intended to ask, but I think it would be a great thing to study.  If sexual orientation is genetically determined then we would expect identical twins to have a higher chance of having the same sexual orientation than fraternal twins.</p></div>		</li>
