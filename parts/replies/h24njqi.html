			<div class="markdown"><p>There are current or former volcanoes on many planets and moons in our solar system.  Plate tectonics aren't necessary for volcanoes.  And there's plenty of ice on other planets/moons as well.  Not inherently indicative of life.  Currently active volcanoes on Io, Titan, and Triton, heckuva lot of inactive volcanism on Venus, also on Mercury, Mars, and the Moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>most of the water is trapped in rocks and is near impossible to get out. the same thing would happen to earth if it werenâ€™t for plate techtonics and/or volcanic activity. the water could of been absorbed long before life started to emerge on mars</p></div>		</li>

<p>What part of life creates limestone? Shells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some inorganic mechanisms for limestone formation, but the vast majority of limestone on earth is formed by the accumulation of marine animal shells, mostly microscopic ones.  Inorganic limestone can form when mineral laden water bodies dry out or concentrate to such a degree that the minerals precipitate out. If a body of water repeatedly filled and dried, you could accumulate layers of sediment. On earth this is only a small fraction of the total limestone.</p></div>		</li>
