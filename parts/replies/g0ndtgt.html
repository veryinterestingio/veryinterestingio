			<div class="markdown"><p>We can also make similar reconstructions based on language. There's a broad consensus as to where the Proto-Indo-European people lived and we can make connections to archaeological sites, though this is more actively debated, but our best information about their society and culture comes from their language. We can assume that words in many diverse languages that share a PIE root do so because the PIE people had a word for it. (Copper/bronze, for instance, but not steel. Bear but not hyena etc). So we can then assume they used bronze but had not discovered steel and were familiar with bears but not hyenas. Similar names for gods (like the &quot;Sky Father&quot; family of gods like Zeus and Jupiter) give us insight into their religion, etc. We'll never have more than a general sense of their culture or history beyond migration patterns and the like, but we know an incredible amount about them when you consider it was mostly uncovered by comparing living (and recently dead) languages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the same vein, place names can tell us about history as well. E.g. as in this /r/AskHistorians answer on Scandinavian place names and their connection to religion: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ge6ph5/did_the_vikings_believe_that_their_opponents_in/fpmewqi/" target="_blank">https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ge6ph5/did_the_vikings_believe_that_their_opponents_in/fpmewqi/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is tricky. Mathematical models have produced very inconsistent &quot;ages&quot; for PIE in particular - ages so old that barring major archaeological disoveries make them hard to take seriously (such as ages that are older by thousands of years than the earliest wheels, when there is almost no doubt PIE people had wheeled carts based on widespread shared roots for words for wheel, axle, cart, wagon etc.) But there are methods of dating language and studying rates of change, they just aren't as precise as we would like. Within historical timeframes it's more useful - determining ages and relationships in Romance languages for instance, so mathematics plays a major role in modern linguistics. It's just that there isnt consensus on how &quot;deep&quot; these models can go. As with all things prehistoric, a single new find could change the whole paradigm but for now there is a definite divide amongst linguists as to how accurate or useful such models are, with a majority view that tends to rely on more traditonal linguistic and archaeological methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a relatively recent development though, the “multidisciplinary approach” to writing and studying history. Traditionally, the study of the past relied almost exclusively on written accounts. Yet, this newer approach has beared fruit, and our understanding is much richer as a result</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sounds weird but it overlaps with so many disciplines to help explain or provide context to human migration, interactions, social Inequality during the period, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even that is a little generous.... its one thing to know how to write; its another to afford paper and ink and copies to be made.</p>
<p>Until relatively modern history (the lifetimes of living people) you needed significant access to the means of producing written material to do anything more than a one-off curiosity that likely wont survive.</p>
<p>For you to write something that more than a handful of people ever read, you had to be literate, and either wealthy, or to be published by someone who was....pretty much until the internet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My google-fu is strong but now I am really wondering how well I could tell recent human history through records I found on the internet.</p>
<p>I'm now questioning the validity of historical expertise in any way. It's not just the confusing records, it's the confused historian trying to make sense of it all.</p></div>		</li>
