			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a shuttle launch from the Saturn v building parking lot viewing area.  We were told it's as close as humans are allowed except for the rescue crews in special bunkers, I think we were 3 miles away.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about noise, the shuttle was like maybe a half inch high on the horizon.  You could cover the whole thing with your thumbtip, easily. Then it starts up, and you see the flames and smoke for a few seconds and you think, well, that's kinda neat, but nothing amazing...and then  the fucking wall of sound from that tiny thing on the horizon hits you and the continuing vibrations feel like youre almost getting the wind knocked out of you continuously and you realize exactly how much goddamn power and energy is going off to get that thing to orbit.  Closest thing I have ever felt to it since was being at an indoor shooting range when the guy the next cube over was shooting some high powered rifle, but even that paled by comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My house growing up was 2.4 miles from the starting line of Houston Raceway.  Every time the NHRA came through I was there with my dad on the day of the finals.</p>
<p>You really cannot fathom something that loud unless you've experienced it.  It's scary the first time you are in the stands when a top fuel dragster takes off.  It never stops being uncomfortable if you're anywhere close to the starting line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was at an airshow at Travis AFB, and they did a flyby with a B1, they were going slow, but running the engines a lot and the plane was angled up like halfway into a stall or something. It was LOUD, and the flight line/runway was very thick reinforced concrete (had to be able to deal with C-5 military cargo planes) and the runway was shaking like it was an earthquake. I was told they could have gone louder, but they would have gotten in big trouble for hitting Mach 1 and blowing out every window for miles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the sound is directed away from the shuttle/rocket - and if you look at the platform, you will notice channels that will redirect the energy of the sound to the sides. After the launch, also water is released as drops - these have as a primary role the goal to reflect the sound waves all around and not simply back upwards as the sound/shock waves would simply rip a rocket apart.</p>
<p>In short, everything is done to avoid that sound waves are reflected upwards to the rocket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's loud. But the dB is an exponential scale. 10dB more mean something is 10 times as loud. Sounds beyond 200dB simply don't exist.</p>
<p>And the Krakatao explosion ripped eardrums apart hundreds of miles away. If rockets were that loud people in Florida would all be deaf</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10 dB is twice as loud, but contains 10 times the acoustic energy. A Bel is a doubling of volume, so a decibel is a tenth of a doubling of volume.</p>
<p>And 200dB does exist, just not at normal sea level atmospheric pressure. 194.1 is a limit at sea level, but that limit drops as you gain altitude. At the peak of Mt Everest, the limit is 183.9dB. Inversely, if you could dig a hole deep enough, you could reach 200db through air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, yeah, I get that.  As somone pointed out they just become shockwaves with vaccine in-between.  But I never truly understood loud untill I saw that launch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction, it would be 100,000 times as <em>intense</em> or 100,000 times the amount of power. Each factor of 10 (or 10dB) is perceived as twice as loud.</p>
<p>So really 200dB would be 32x louder than 150dB</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every 10db is around where a human would estimate something being twice as loud, however I'm not sure that holds up at these db ranges in which your eardrum would probably not survive. iirc 3db is a doubling in actual soundwave energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A rocket gets its energy from a chemical burn, which is effectively a contained explosion that will be directed opposite of the direction that the rocket intends to move. While generating such high amounts of thrust, that chemical burn also produces a lot of noise, and depending on the rocket, that noise can reach up to 220 decibels as NASAâ€™s Saturn V rocket did.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Okay 220dB is definitely wrong. That'd be 100 times louder even.</del></p>
<p>Let's just calculate the pressure of that:</p>
<p><del>p=0.02mPa*10^(220dB/10)=200,000,000GPa</del></p>
<p><del>Thats way beyond what solid materials can withstand. Over a hundred million times more than what you need to rip steel apart (1.1-1.3GPa)</del></p>
<p><del>That sound would just pulverize the whole rocket.</del></p>
<p>Wrong formula, mistook sound for a power variable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound pressure levels are 20log() not 10log() so 220 dB comes out to a much more manageable 2 MPa which is about right.</p>
<p>Chamber pressure on rockets is usually a couple hundred MPa so exhaust pressure being in the few MPa seems close</p>
<p>I wouldn't use dB to describe shockwaves but unfortunately many do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a NASA document stating that the highest they ever got was 204db, and that was on a test stand in ... Well, as close to &quot;lab conditions&quot; as it's possible to get with a fire breathing dragon:</p>
<p><a href="https://ia801208.us.archive.org/12/items/NASA_NTRS_Archive_19940004288/NASA_NTRS_Archive_19940004288.pdf" target="_blank">https://ia801208.us.archive.org/12/items/NASA_NTRS_Archive_19940004288/NASA_NTRS_Archive_19940004288.pdf</a></p>
<p>My suspicion, though, is that this might have been a reading of 204db at very specific points where waves happened to overlap fortuitously (or not), rather than a constant level of output.</p></div>		</li>
