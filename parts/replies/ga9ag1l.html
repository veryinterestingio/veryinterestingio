			<div class="markdown"><p>It says that's the target cell size, but unless you found something I didn't (entirely possible), that doesn't inherently mean 100m x 100m is the pixel size. It depends on their definition of &quot;cell&quot; for this purpose.</p>
<p>u/Clinozoisite - can you confirm? Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. The sea bed 2030 goal is 100m x 100m in the deeper areas of the ocean. The more shallow the water the smaller the resolution</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For bathymetry. (Multi-beam) cell size is essential resolution. For 100m cell you would take all soundings in a 100m x 100m cell (or bin) and produce one depth value from that. Typically surveys want 7-15 sounding per bin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I usually only hear of the big ones having real impact. (Navy ships) But it seems like every 10-20 years we figure out some activity we previously thought was safe now has results we never predicted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>he technology used to map the ocean is multi beam sonar and side scan sonars. These are fancy sonars the produce multiple aonar pings at once over a large swath. Think of mapping the ocean floor as shinning a flashlight on the ground. The closer to the floor you get the smaller your light pattern gets. This is why it is going to take us a considerably long time and effort to map the enite sea floor even</p>

<p>Did the search for MH370 add to the database at all?<br />

<p>It's a pretty large swath bathymetry survey for the deep sea.  The interactive page there shows some good before-and-after views of the bathymetry in the area that was covered.</p></div>		</li>
