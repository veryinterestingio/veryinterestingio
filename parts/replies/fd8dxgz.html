			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple other side notes for OP</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's unlikely you actually &quot;caught the virus&quot; that day, <del>though working out does create stress on the body which can cause succeptability to infection</del>°. Most infections have an incubation period during which no overt signs or symptoms are present.</p>
</li>
<li>Anything that dries out mucous membranes (like your nasal passages) increases your probability of getting sick because there is less of a barrier between your tissues and the pathogen. When it's cold our nasal passages typically get dried out (I know it seems contradictory because our noses run, but they'll get dry/inflamed - why they hurt. This is why lips chap.)</li>
</ul>
<p>°Edited for science: <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180420122807.htm" target="_blank">apparently exercise does not increase risk for infection</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, temperature definitely affects  the immune system. Curious where you read otherwise though, id like to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a study where subjects were exposed to virus sprayed onto them, and in that study their body temperature didn't influence the probability of contracting the virus. </p>
<p>However this is just from memory, and when I google it now I only find studies that point towards temperature actually affecting the immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is flat out wrong. You have to be subjected to EXTREME temperatures for your immune system to be significantly affected. If you aren't experiencing hypothermia, your immune system is completely fine.</p></div>		</li>
