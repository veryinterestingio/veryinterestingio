			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's what I've seen lately, it's not really &quot;glowing&quot; by human standards. Like the frogs don't have some chemical their body produces that can produce light. The animals <em>fluoresce</em>, like certain colors would under a blacklight. Last I heard, the function of fluorescence in fauna is either poorly or not at all understood, but its expression is something that has become of interest. The one friend of mine who has worked on it literally told me he just takes a UV flashlight to see what will fluoresce, then he just publishes a list of what does. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These articles are based on a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59528-9" target="_blank">new paper in Nature Scientific Reports</a>, which focused on salamanders but included some frogs as well. They're referring to biofluorescence, as opposed to bioluminescence. Bioluminescence is caused by a chemical reaction that emits light, like fireflies. In contrast, biofluorescence is the absorption and re-emission of light. Often, this is blue light that is emitted as another color, like red or green. Check out <a href="https://blog.luminescentlabs.org/tagged/biofluorescent" target="_blank">this site</a> for some really cool examples of biofluorescent organisms, including Hawksbill sea turtles! Some birds biofluoresce as well, including <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/puffin-beaks-are-fluorescent-and-theyre-not-only-ones-180968724/" target="_blank">puffins</a>, and <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5552/92" target="_blank">budgies</a>. It's even been documented in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/100/1/21/5299493" target="_blank">flying squirrels</a>. In this case, they're fluorescing under UV light rather that ambient blue light.</p>
<p>What's pretty cool about amphibians is that the authors of the paper looked at 32 different species, and every single one of them was biofluorescent under ambient blue light. Prior to this, the only tetrapods known to biofluorescence under blue light are sea turtles.</p></div>		</li>
