			<div class="markdown"><p>Former blackjack dealer here. My casino used 8 decks for blackjack and if we knew you were a card counter we would shuffle all 8 decks after every hand making counting impossible. You were welcome to stay and play but we would be doing more shuffling than card playing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I played at a 2 deck table at a downtown Vegas casino. It was supposed to be dealt face down so card counters couldn't see what other players got until the end of the hand. But we were all showing our cards anyway and no one cared. The guy next to me was pretty clearly trying to count cards. He was mumbling numbers to himself and changing bet sizes a lot between hands, but they didn't seem to care about him either. He seemed like a regular. Maybe he just wasn't very good at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Casinos that have one or two deck blackjack tables usually adjust the payouts to the point where even perfect card counters don’t have an advantage, just assuming everyone is counting cards there. If you are playing at these “for fun” and not counting, you are doing yourself a disservice</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just thought they always shuffled after that movie came out. Why wouldn't they? It takes a few seconds tops, a minute if you make a show of it, and seems like the natural thing to do when you are handed a bunch of cards so no one can identify the first card of their hand and know the next X number of cards value</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again I dealt 20 years ago so we weren't using shuffle machines like they do now but in blackjack school they would time our shuffle and we had to do it in less than two minutes.  Two minutes between hands meant a lot less hands being dealt which means a lot less money.  Remember we were shuffling eight decks together not just one deck.</p></div>		</li>
