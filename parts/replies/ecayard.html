			<div class="markdown"><p>I know in the last 10 years noone has been screwed (due to a shutdown) so I'm not sure when or what event you are referring to.  If you're referring to the 10 weeks of mandated furlough as part of the sequestration (which I believe only 8 were actually enforced) that was due to a battle regarding saving money during the debt ceiling debates if I recall correctly.  So yeah we got 80% pay for 8 weeks but got a ton of shit done around the house.</p></div>		</li>
