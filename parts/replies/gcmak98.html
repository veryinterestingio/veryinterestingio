			<div class="markdown"><p>With that being said, what about multi vitamin production. Do they insert a little of this and that into each, or are they done (as I would imagine) on a larger scale basis and injected into molds? Is there a decent margin of error for each tablet's actual dosage of each vitamin? Do they just spot test?</p>
<p>And your opinion of gummy vs tablet vitamin - do you feel they are both able to meet standards just the same?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose this sounds logical in passing, but how would you gaurantee that the &quot;big batch of vitamin mix&quot; is 100% equally distributed throughout the entire batch. I'd be surprised if that's how it's done, but I also have no idea</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's relatively easy to add (say at extremes), 10 kg vitamin c, 2kg vitamin b12 etc to a batch mix and be very accurate (when the total is in many kilos or even more, fractions of a gram either way matter less and less). The proportions being accurate at the batch stage (and well mixed) means that you just need the same accuracy as any other tablet for the final pressing. So your 1g tab can still come from the +/- 50mg press.</p></div>		</li>
