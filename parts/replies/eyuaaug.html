<p>Interesting guy. The topic of disinfectant and the 18th century reminds me of another dude who lived at the same time and was also interested in disinfectants, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis" target="_blank">Ignaz Semmelweis</a>. Attributed by wikipedia as &quot;saviour of mothers&quot;, for coming up with the brilliant idea that doctors should wash their hands before delivering babies. Especially if they'd just had their hands inside a corpse. But those doctors didn't like him much and refused to accept his explanations for why it worked, and when he didn't just go away after they dismissed him they had him committed and he died from an infection after getting beaten by the asylum guards, at age 47, tragically only years before Pasteur's and Lister's works validated Semmelweis's.</p></div>		</li>
