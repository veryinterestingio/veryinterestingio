			<div class="markdown"><p>Roughness matters in addition to the material composition. You'd want to compare a smooth and rough surface of the same material.</p>
<p>The cleanliness of the glass from minute amounts of grease and oils also affects its surface energy. If you do a very thorough cleaning if the glass (e.g. for scientific purposes) you may notice a change in apparent surface energy.</p></div>		</li>
