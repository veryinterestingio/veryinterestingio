			<div class="markdown"><p>Every piece of software has to explicitly ask the OS permission to do almost anything important; like get a piece of memory to live in or write data to the disk. The OS assigns an ID to each process - a process being the a place where programs are allowed to live in the computer - and it tracks that process. A process is eligible to do things and get CPU time to crunch numbers and do math. Any part of memory that is not allocated to a process is basically ignored.  When you use task manager to close an application that is the equivalent of an eviction notice. The place in memory where that process lives is no longer given any attention by the CPU so the 1s and 0s encoded there are functionally meaningless. Eventually, the OS will assign that part of memory to another process who will &quot;move in&quot;, overwrite whatever they need, and get attention from the CPU for their tasks.</p>
<p>Closing an application is a more graceful death. The program surrenders its resources back to the OS instead of having them taken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you go to the factory in space analogy, I think it's still pretty apt. The factory can't send or receive any shipments (IO), the workers are gone (execution hardware, mostly CPUs), and the factory being sent to space means that area (memory) is now open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this analogy, as it allows us to further extrapolate why we might get a hold up. </p>
<p>Say that the workers in the factory get confused. One thinks that his job is to feed flattenned steel from the pile into the press, while the other thinks his job is to take steel sheets out of the press and put them into the pile. One puts the steel in, the other takes it out. The first guy turns to start the machine and there is no metal in there, so he puts another in. Second guy see's the steel in the machine and the loop continues. This causes a loop which makes it so no actual product gets made and the factory stops pushing out product.</p>
<p>Now you tell the factory to shut down. Well the first guy thinks &quot;before I leave, I have to make sure there is sheet metal so that we can start quick tomorrow&quot;. The second guy thinks &quot;I gotta make sure there is no steel in this machine before leaving&quot;. They both continue the cycle and the factory stays open but still no work gets done. </p>
<p>The fire alarm goes off, and both men drop everything and leave.</p></div>		</li>
