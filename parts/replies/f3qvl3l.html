			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a reason that 10% of British income was spent on tea and sugar - it tasted better than turnips and mud. For most of our history, most of our income has been spent on food due to the price. When food became cheaper with agricultural revolutions, it meant spice, sugar and tea etc were more affordable. And due to imperialism, they were accessible in large quantities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just finished The Graveyard Book and in the beginning one of the old people is amazed by a banana. I've come across that in other literature as well, the banana/fresh fruit thing and its always to emphasize how in the time period things we take for granted were novel or foreign. </p>
<p>Same with vanilla. Today its considered a &quot;boring&quot; flavor but it used to be exotic and expensive.  Real vanilla bean is still relatively expensive but the flavor itself has become commonplace.  I read the Wiki history of it once and it was fascinating.  </p>
<p>Also the color for &quot;royal purple&quot;, originally from tiny snails, and reserved for the elite. Some dude figured out how to synthesize the dye and now anyone can buy something with that color and not think twice about it. </p>
<p>Not sure where I was going with this....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia we really try and push ‘Australian Grown’ ‘Australian Made’ etc. I was working as a chef in the UK a few years ago and remember reading a fruit &amp; veg invoice listing the produce and origin. Nothing was from the UK and it almost seemed like they were proud of that. Now I know that the UK climate limits much of what it can grow but it was like ‘Ooo. Look at this rocket from Italy.’</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Tbh the dramatic change in food price has had startling impacts on us and our development. It's not entirely unlike how the Romans subsidized food for the poorest few hundred thousand in Rome, enabling them to spend their money on other things.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The most common myth about medieval food is that the heavy use of spices was a technique for disguising the taste of rotten meat in the days before refrigeration. &quot;Yet spices had gone out of fashion by the seventeenth century, three hundred years before refrigerators were invented. In any case, municipal records show that the authorities were well aware of hygiene, and of the need for quality controls on fresh food&quot; (Santich 30). Besides, spices were expensive and not likely wasted on rot. Another myth is that the spices were used as preservatives, but medievals were not idiots -- spices do not function as preservatives.<br />
-- Michael Delahoyde, Washington State University</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first common myth is that spices were highly prized because they were instrumental in disguising the smell and flavor of the rotten meat that was a staple of the medieval diet.  [...]  the idea that any [spices] were routinely used to to disguise the smell and taste of rotten meat is just silly. [...]<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Along with everything everyone else has said, the value to volume/weight ratio is insane. You can fit a LOT of turmeric and saffron on a ship, and if you compare how much a ship is able to take with the amount of gold or silver you could take, a full load of spices would make a bigger profit in many places and times. The only thing that would be better would be aluminum.</p></div>		</li>
