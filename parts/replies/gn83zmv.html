			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly renewed, even though some (most of the DNA) are also for life, which is the way it was proven these neurons are for life (using isotopes incorporated at birth in people born during nuclear testing times). </p>
<p>Biology has this way of conserving structures while rolling through renewal. Think of your skin: old cells shed out on the surface, new cells coming from the bottom, structures conserved. A synapse will also involve many proteins, so there can be a rollover renewing all the parts one by one like you renovate a house without ever letting go of the conserved structure.</p></div>		</li>
