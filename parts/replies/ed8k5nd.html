			<div class="markdown"><p>This raises a very important point.  Laughter is instinctual, at least in mammals.  It's a hardwired brain response to the unexpected.  This is especially relevant to animals living in social groups - laughter conveys the message that &quot;it's all okay, we're fine&quot; and allows a physical mechanism to burn off energy of the fight/flight response after a perceived threat has been revealed to be safe.</p></div>		</li>
