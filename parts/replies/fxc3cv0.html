			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher frequency wavelengths are more likely to be dissipated, absorbed, or otherwise scattered on the way here, namely our own atmosphere, which scatters a lot of IR/Vis/UV light. Radio waves barely interact with it at all. The one of the biggest optical microscope (the Hubble) is in orbit to avoid this, but obviously it’s a helluva lot harder to build a whole array up them in space.</p>
<p>Edit: I should clarify that the frequency being lower isn’t technically the thing that affects interaction with the atmosphere - it’s a complex consequence of quantum properties of the molecules in the air as well as the EM effects of the ionosphere. There’s a large window of radio wave frequencies that <em>can</em> penetrate through, and astronomers are able to take advantage of this on the ground. There are significant difficulties with distortion and background noise when it comes to working with visible light, though not impossible to overcome with modern technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to know the phase of the incoming waves to do the math. That is possible for the MHz to GHz frequency of radiowaves. But not for the 100 THz frequency of visible light. Light just kicks electrons into higher energy states. Phase information ist lost with this method of measurement.
Even if you could measure the phase of visible light, you would need to have clock synchronization between the telescopes 10000 times better than needed for the radio measurements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;stitching together&quot; isn't like using photoshop. It requires you to analyse the signals and compute information based on the difference in phase between them and is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_interferometer" target="_blank">astronomical interferometer</a>.</p>
<p>This is easy at radio wavelengths as you can just record the signal with some decent time stamps and then collect it all together and process it. It <em>can</em> be done at optical wavelengths but requires you to send all the light beams to a single spot, very carefully so that the light can be combined to determine the phase difference optically. This can't be done from half way across the globe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the same way we get all images. Radio waves are just a frequency range within the electromagnetic spectrum, you can get any image from pretty much any frequency as long as there's enough data to process. <a href="http://solar-center.stanford.edu/comics/ref/em-sunspectrum.pdf" target="_blank">Here's</a> an example of what the sun looks like in various EM frequencies.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The same way we get an image from light: an array of sensors.  In a camera, it is a CCD chip that does the sensing.  A radiotelescope has something similar, except that it operates in much longer wavelengths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because you need to have all of the elements in phase, which in practice means they have to be recording at the same time. Sometimes you can add up data to get a better picture by taking multiple recordings (incoherent summing), but you lose the ability to combine them in the way that allows to get finer details, which is why you need such a big &quot;dish&quot; in the first place (coherent summing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this rest, essentialy, on the fraction of sky visible that something occupies? Say, for example, that a star and a flag on the moon both occupied \~1 arcmillisecond - would they be equally visible? And the fact that the flag is not is due to the fact that it is much smaller relative to the full span of the sky than is the distant star in question?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that is generally correct. The caveat being that stars are incredibly bright in contrast with the dark space around it. So even if the space it takes up in your viewing angle is below your resolution, it can still be detected on the one spot of film or sensor where it lies. Whereas the flag needs reflected light, but when it gets reflected light, so does the terrain surrounding it. There's very little contrast, so you would need better precision to differentiate it from its surroundings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I can tell you for the instrument above, the Event Horizon Telescope, which imaged the black hole, this absolutely is the case. When you use a radio telescope, you balance the size of the array (the distance between elements) with how filled in the aperture is (how many elements/how big each dish is). Ideally, you'd have a single dish as big as you'd need to image whatever you want, but when you need a dish a few thousand kilometers across, that's impossible. Distance gets you the small size, milliarcseconds, the amount of collecting area determines your minimum brightness. Essentially, imagine if in your camera you covered 99% of the lens, but left holes scattered throughout the covering. You'd still get some light in, but only from the brightest things. Same thing in radio astronomy. For the EHT, it can really only image things that are millions of kelvin, which thankfully includes the radiation disks surrounding black holes</p></div>		</li>
