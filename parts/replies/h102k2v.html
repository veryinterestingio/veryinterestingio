			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and you could argue that if you know that you're bitten by an animal of any kind and its unexpected, you should immediately get seen by a doctor as quickly as possible so that they can look out for any rabies before its too late. </p>
<p>Getting bit by a random animal (and I say unexpected, since you might expect a teething puppy to gnaw at you a little) isn't an everyday occurrence, so it should be something that shocks you and makes you want to act immediately to protect your health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got bit by a stray cat once and the hospital legit told me to really ask myself how badly I wanted the rabies vaccine because since cats aren't common vectors for rabies that my insurance wouldn't cover it and the vaccine was REALLY expensive. I'm poor so I didn't get it and suffered hypochondria and panic attacks over imagined symptoms for weeks.</p>
<p>Guess where I live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A new theory is that some people will actually recover on their own. There's like 1 or 2 documented cases with people who presented with symptoms, got tested positive and a few days later walked out fine again.</p>
<p>In these cases they found evidence of antibodies in later tests (during the hospitalization) so it seems that in some very rare cases the human immune system IS fast enough to fight rabies on their own. This pattern IIRC has been found in every successful case of the treatment protocols, casting doubt as to whether it was actually the protocol that saved them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure even if you had a &quot;contract&quot; set up before with an euthanasia group, I'd guess week wouldn't be enough for them to act because of legal hoops. It's insane paperwork.</p>
<p>You'd probably have better luck convincing &quot;normal hospital&quot; to put you in medical coma until you die so that you won't feel it.</p></div>		</li>
