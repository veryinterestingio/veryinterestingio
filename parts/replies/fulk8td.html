			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several lines of reasoning  that  suggest that Pluto has an ocean.  Charon does not cause tidal heating - the source  of heat is radiogenic from Pluto's core.  It is a serious conclusion and is taken very  seriously  by  the NH  team and other scientists trying to understand Pluto.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine Charon doesn’t cause tidal heating in Pluto because they are both tidally locked to each other, meaning there’s never a variation in gravitational pull from each other. Is my assessment correct? Or is there some other reason I’m missing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. Take for example, the Earth-moon system. The reason we have high and low tide on Earth is because the Moon's gravity pulls harder on the bodies of water closer to it than farther away from it. But since Earth is rotating, the points on Earth's surface closest to the Moon are always changing.</p>
<p>For the Pluto-Charon system, they're tidally locked to each other, meaning that the point of Charon's surface closest to Pluto doesn't move, and vice versa. Therefore there is no variation of the gravitational pull on their surfaces!</p>
<p>Fun fact, the tidal force the Moon exerts on the earth acts as a small &quot;breaking force&quot; and is slowing the Earth's rotation rate minutely. So Earth will be tidally locked to the Moon in about 50 billion years or so (assuming they're still around after the sun swallows them during its red giant phase).</p>
<p>Edit: <em>braking</em> force</p></div>		</li>
