			<div class="markdown"><p>Any time I or my peers at university (are we talking about all education levels? oh well) tried hard to get good grades and learn the subject I could count on a moment when we would lament that the effort was pointless because of the delayed feedback. Everyone other than the most grade obsessed people following the Lifescript (quickest description) didn't try hard because there was no reason to do so when faced with these bad odds. Most people end up with an average result. The winners are the exception, not the rule as Henry Watson Fowler's dictionary would explain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually really like the term 'Lifescript' as it applies to what is expected of a grade-A student in order to maintain their level of achievement.</p>
<p>I'd have probably been one of those students if other things going on in my life outside of school and my control did not annihilate my motivation. I was a classic over-achiever before high school. Sadly our system does not have much wiggle-room for well-meaning kids from dysfunctional homes...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does though.. if you have the ability to tackle those educational opportunities later in life, they're there waiting for you. It will probably cost you a great deal less than if you had gone straight out of highschool. Scholarships and fellowships love an older student from a broken, impoverished home kicking ass. </p>
<p>I had to do my engineering degree in 5.5 years because I had so little math education in HS. I started in single variable algebra. Literally like... a+5=7 solve for a kind of algebra. </p>
<p>Now I am a guidance systems engineer and I write control algorithms for launch vehicles. Graduated in my 30s. Zero debt because there was so much dang help. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second to that. Your environment plays an important role when growing up. If you’re not in a place that you can learn in, you’ll lose the feeling of trying to learn in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this imo. I'm at a university and even in the classes that we all have chosen to take because we WANT to learn the material, a lot of us end up cutting corners to meet homework deadlines. For example with language assignments many of us would learn more if we had time to sit down and engage with the material, but we have to use Google translate and other resources to speed it up, not actually remembering the new words. Because even if we really learned it, the grade won't reflect that if we don't complete the assignments.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They don’t see it as an opportunity to practice, they see it as something they have to do in order to avoid trouble,</p>

<p>Because for many, it’s not practice. Once you’ve done a handful of any kind of math equation, you can do that equation again pretty easily. Just repeatedly doing the same thing is tedious and doesn’t improve your understanding at all. And that’s what a lot of homework amounts to, just busywork.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Andrew Dotson makes that point <a href="https://youtu.be/6tc_MgbDLtA" target="_blank">here</a> on how he got better at math.  </p>
<p>I teach math in HS; my HW assignments are usually only like 8-12 questions, usually once per section and each section usually has 2-4 aspects, so I usually only throw 1-2 easy questions per aspect and 1-2 difficult questions per aspect; no need to assign 30 damn problems from the book.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But you have to do that handful to begin with, which is classically done via homework. And some less talented student need a lot more of that &quot;handful&quot; than other too. So yea, its tedious when you're good at the subject, when you're not, what then? Lets keep in mind that kids dont get individual personalized curriculum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, you typically learn how to do it in class, then “practice” at home. </p>

<p>Very simple, don’t make it required. If you need more practice, do it. If you don’t need to practice because you understand the material, you shouldn’t be punished.</p></div>		</li>
