			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good description of &quot;expertise&quot; in general. It is also extendable to nearly everything the brain does. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Language: you don't think about pronouncing each word as you say it, but a foreigner does</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Math: someone who does a lot of math - especially advanced math - will find that the operations and concepts become totally intuitive - this is why most of us consider math as a type of language</p>
</li>
<li>Engineering - as someone who does electrical engineering a lot, I don't even see the individual parts on circuit diagrams anymore. I just see a concept being implemented using a few &quot;blocks&quot; that are chained together.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touch typing - I'm not thinking about what keys I want to press, I'm just thinking the words and my brain/hands are translating them.</li>
<li>Card shuffling - eventually you get to the point where you can divide a deck, riffle, combine, and repeat for a deck of basically any size without looking and while having a conversation.</li>
<li>Computer gamers - they don't think &quot;I need to move the mouse 1.3 inches left to aim&quot;, they just move it.</li>
<li>And for me, Microsoft Excel. For me, that one's so coded that once I get the vague concept of what I want a function to do, I don't really have to think about it. I just put my fingers on the keyboard and wait for them to stop moving (some of my formulas, I've actually finished, then immediately gone &quot;right, so what does this actually do?&quot;, and on two occasions, I've built spreadsheets entirely in my sleep).</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes well just today I have been working on something that relates to this - tryingt o look at the chunks as specifically as possible to understand what is actually going on.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In my case It is in terms of math. Simple divison. Diving 18 by 6. Diving 18 by 3. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Dividing 19.8 by 3.   (=6.6) </p>
<p>Okay so.. dividing 19.8 by 6.6. Wait what the hell is goi.g on here?</p>
<p>I am having this revelation of how kind of dumb I am in this way without having known it. Had just found some way to think around this without addressing it probably from like grade 3. I am 31 though so its unsettling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's me with tying my shoes</p>
<p>my hands know what to do, so when I put on my shoes there's this wierd &quot;okay hands, do you thing&quot; moment, and voila, nicely tied shoes</p>
<p>If I stop and try to think what the individual steps for tying my shoes are, I draw a blank</p>
<p>it is slightly unsettling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why it's harder to be a teacher than people realize. In many cases, you have to be able to break down something you know super well into the tiniest possible chunks so beginners can learn it from you. It can be difficult at times</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same way. I've tried to slow down the algorithms so that a friend can copy me, but I can't do it slowly enough for them to still make out the individual moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many times I had difficulties with door codes. I put them in without using my head at all, it's a blind typing on number keyboard thing. And when someone else asks me, instead of remembering the numbers I have to imagine myself pressing the sequence again and then reconstruct the number based on where my fingers seem to go, top left, bottom right, very center, etc.. sometimes similar with pin codes.. and it is exactly that with screen locks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this:</p>
<p>The brain works like an automatic process. We continually add information based on success and failure. Our &quot;auto-pilot&quot; takes over for simple things as to not waste the resource of our consciousness. By overthinking something you inadvertently create conflict between the sub-conscious and conscious processes leading to error.</p></div>		</li>
