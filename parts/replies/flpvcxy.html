			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I always said “oh things must just taste more bitter to me than to most” and so I went through life eating like a picky middle schooler. But then I decided I was going to make a change and so I just started trying things I thought I didn’t like every time it was an option. Some things I discovered I actually did like right away, and other things took more tries to get used to it. But now I like almost all foods and my life is significantly better because of it. You just have to have an open mind and a desire to expand your palette</p></div>		</li>
