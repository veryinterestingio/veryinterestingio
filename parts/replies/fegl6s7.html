			<div class="markdown"><p>As a bird owner, I can say that pepper seeds don't pass through birds whole. You just get semi-homogenous spicy poops.</p>
<p>However, birds (especially hookbills) are some of the messiest eaters you'll ever see. A bird will take a pepper, fly away with it, eat it, and maybe 50% of the pepper will end up as seeds and chunks of pepper flesh in a pile on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But they do have a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizzard?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">gizzard</a>, so I don't know if I buy that as the reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do all have gizzards, but depending on their diet, the gizzard may not be filled with gizzard stones that destroy all seeds.</p>
<p>It is definitely true that not all seeds will be in tact and able to germinate after passing through a bird, but only a small percentage need to in order for a species to survive. Plants that aim to get eaten and have their seeds spread have specific mechanisms for their survival through a bird gizzard or whatever animal eats them. </p>
<p>While maybe not the best example, I just know off the top of my head about sunflowers. If only 1% of the seeds of a sunflower make it to being successfully germinated, you've probably got 10-20 new sunflowers from the previous one plant (sunflowers often produce 1000-2000 seeds per flower).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a theory iirc that capsaicin production may confer some measure of resistance to certain fungal infections in tropical climates — helping to prevent peppers from rotting off the plant before the seeds get a chance to spread.</p>
<p><a href="https://microbialmenagerie.com/2018/01/07/theres-a-fungus-among-us-and-its-making-peppers-spicy/" target="_blank">This post</a> goes into some detail about it. </p>
<p>ELI5: Evolution is a series of random events. Not every plant family ended up evolving capsaicin production, and among those peppers that did, whether or not they keep it and how much they make is based on the tradeoff between how much it helps them verses how much energy it takes that could be better used some other way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of plants have toxins that prevent mammals from eating them. Off the top of my head pokeweed, deadly nightshade, holly, and winterberry. They are all essentially inedible for humans, but birds will eat them.</p>
<p>Peppers are different because their poison isn't toxic to humans and it's not totally inedible. It's not that they don't have toxic compounds. Chocolate is probably another example, deadly to dogs and I'd assume most mammals, but not humans. Nicotine and cocaine come from plants and are deadly to humans if we tried to eat the whole plant in a salad, but we like the effects of the poison in low doses.</p></div>		</li>
