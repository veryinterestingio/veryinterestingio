			<div class="markdown"><p>What? The cancer risk comes from hydrocarbons created when fat drips onto your flame, and the resulting smoke. Not from the charcoal itself. You may as well stop grilling entirely if you're scared of getting cancer from charcoal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Idk why but I'm annoyed that the top answers don't acknowledge OP's false assumption here. Yeah I know chimney starters are a thing, but for most people in most situations, charcoal is not &quot;used to make fire starting easier&quot; as OP states. I have no idea where OP got that notion. I won't go too far down this tangent but as someone who browses this subreddit regularly, I say with confidence that a hefty portion of posts include a false assumption in them.</p></div>		</li>
