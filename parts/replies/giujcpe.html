			<div class="markdown"><p>The ratio of ^(14)C/^(12)C in the atmosphere remains constant, since there are always ^(14)C atoms decaying and being taken into living organism at the same time as other ^(14)C atoms are being produced from ^(14)N being bumped at by neutrons from space.</p>
<p>I don't think carbon dating would be used for dating anything other than former living organisms, but if there happens to be a closed jar full of air from ancient time, kept far from any neutron source, I think, yes, maybe we can test it? I'm not sure though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, the 14/12 ratio in the atmosphere is not constant (hence the need for calibration discussed in various other comments in this thread), but this is because of changes in the rates of production of ^(14)C, mostly driven by changes in magnetic field strength which in turn change the flux of cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere. </p>
<p>The general premise here though is correct, i.e. the 14/12 ratio of the atmosphere reflects an equilibrium between the rates of ^(14)C production and decay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does. But is replenished at high altitudes when N14 captures a neutron and turns into C14 through the emission of a proton. The C14 then decays back into N14, so they're at equilibrium. To be clear, the amount of C14 isn't constant <em>through time</em> (our job as archaeologists would be a lot easier if it were) but at any given time, all organisms that absorb carbon from the atmosphere have roughly equal initial C14-values. </p>

<p>You could probably date air that was sealed off somehow from the rest of the atmosphere. If you tested <strong>current</strong> air...I'm not sure what would happen...<br />
It's possible you would get a negative age because our current atmosphere is &quot;enriched&quot; with C14 due to atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the 50s and 60s and the standard atmosphere to which you date samples is from the 1950s, so before the major &quot;bomb pulse&quot;. But that's going a bit beyond my expertise, you'd probably have to ask a geochemist or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so for a sealed off cave (such as the one below one of the very flat state that found a bio of blind and uncolored animal and plant living off of the heat of the ground) the animals and plant life in there would not have been breathing much of the C14 and even would test the same as when the whole system was closed off several hundred of thousands of years ago?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Radioactive decay is not linear, it is (negatively) exponential. To understand why radioctive materials have a constant rate of exponential decay requires a foray into the realms of quantum/nuclear physics to fully appreciate. Suffice to say despite decay being a truly random process (ie. each nucleus has no past memory of itself or other nuclei, so we cannot predict which one will decay when because they don‚Äôt even have any information about that themselves), and despite the fact that it follows we must model average decay times with probability functions.... we <em>can</em> predict the half-life of specific radioactive materials from theory ‚Äî which gives us a clear indication that rates are constant. </p>
<p>Specifically, <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Nuclear/alpdec.html" target="_blank">Gamow's alpha-tunneling model</a> is quite successful for strong decays. It relates the lifetime of an alpha emitter to the energy released in the decay using the approximately-valid assumption that nuclear density is constant and that the nucleus has a relatively sharp edge.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay" target="_blank">beta decays</a> there is quantity ùëìùë° which convolves the half-life of the decay with the electrical interaction between the emitted electron and the positively-charged daughter nucleus. The ùëìùë° values are related in a relatively simple way to the matrix element for the decay, and for a given class of decay (&quot;allowed&quot;, &quot;superallowed&quot;, &quot;first forbidden&quot;, etc., which are determined by the quantum numbers of the parent and daughter nucleus) the ùëìùë° values for most nuclei fall into a pretty narrow range.</p>
<p>Having said that, there is a very slight dependence on the rate of electron capture on pressure, and at extreme temperatures where nuclei become thermally excited there could be a dependence of decay rate on temperature. Such temperatures, however, will only occur in the interior of stars. </p>

<p>There are corrective calibration curves to account for this, so that we end up not with a guess or an incorrect result, but with a scientifically sound figure which may have slightly larger error bars in certain cases. This is good science - it is being aware of the uncertainties involved and reliably factoring them in to the result. Geochronologists and other people who date things know the limitations and assumptions inherent in their work; I appreciate the very valid points you raise, but I think it‚Äôs a bit dismissive to just call it all a best guess. Given that Earth has not been inside a star since its formation and that corrective calibrations give a result which still results in certainty that something formed (or died) between point 1 and point 2 in time, statements like ‚ÄúSummary, it's a best guess and hard to know for sure‚Äù can be quite misleading to many people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not familiar with that example, but it's possible. Weird things happen through the food chain and inside an organism. But dating bones with carbon dating is kinda arse anyway, tbh. Although, to be fair, a few centuries is within the standard uncertainty anyway.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>We have no reason to assume it's not, at least on the timescales we care about. Radioactive decay ultimately depends on the weak interaction, which is one of the fundamental physical forces. It is <em>possible</em> that physical constants and thus forces vary over cosmological timescales of billions of years, but that's a really a question for a theoretical physicist, which I'm not...</p>
<blockquote>

<p>They were, which makes carbon-dating a bit tricky. But we have calibration curves for that purpose, as I've mentioned in my original comment.</p></div>		</li>
