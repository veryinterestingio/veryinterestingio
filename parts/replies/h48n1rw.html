			<div class="markdown"><p>I really like the Scientific Explorer My First Mind Blowing Science Experiment Kit. I gave it to my niece and she loved it! </p>
<p>I would also recommend my bestseller, The Big Book of Experiments (shameless plug, sorry!). I used to do outreach shows for kids every week for years, and parents always asked me for some DIY experiments. It started as a pdf that I emailed to parents, and over the years, I converted into a book with step-by-step instructions/pictures, a messiness factor, and of course, kid-safe explosions!</p>
