<p>For most of human life starvation has been a danger so the times we have plenty of food available our bodies have adapted to eat a little extra.</p>
<p>Or am I wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could have been the other way around - there is no evolutionary advantage in fine-tuning the process of sending info about 'fullness' to the brain so it was never improved. Overeating a bit was not a problem of humanity for 99% of its existence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this, even though overeating shortens your lifespan, unless overeating is causing a large number of people to have problems reproducing, there isn't any selection pressure for it to change. Dying in your 50s from heart disease doesn't stop you from having kids in your 20s, the same way Huntington's doesn't stop you from having kids. So it isn't selected against.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily delayed. The hormone leptin which is used to signal fullness by inhibiting hunger takes a while for the body to respond. Hormonal reactions(endocrine) take longer for your body to respond because it travels through the blood stream and then to the target tissues and then the chemical process allow the change to occur. A faster reaction such as a reflex reaction (nervous) happens nearly immediately going from the nerve cell then to the muscle or gland which triggers a muscular contraction/secretion. Think snatching you hand away from a hot surface as one of those reactions. This is also why thirst is cancelled very quickly, because it's a nervous reaction with oral nerves when liquid is passed. But because liquid does have a volume, it'll still have an effect of stretching the stomach and having a leptin reaction depending on the current volume of the stomach.  We need fast reactions for certain situations to aid self preservation and the stomach isn't one of those reactions. </p>
<p>As far as eating extra. We are very uneducated on how to manipulate the release of leptin to make us feel full. </p>
<p>We are drawn to highly palatable foods (high in sodium, fats, carbs) that hold low nutritional value and and for the most part not filling. As an example. It's easy to down bags of chips and half a gallon of ice cream. Very calorie dense and easily exceeds 1000+ calories in one sitting. And very easy to eat past fullness. If we convert the amount of carbs and fats equally in the chip and ice cream feast into carb source with more fiber and fats from avocado, nuts, seeds etc. You'll have a HUGELY vast volume of food with equal caloric value. But one is more filling than the other and will likely feel full far before finishing that 1000+ calories and because of the length of time it takes to eat, fullness will be detected sooner.</p>
<p>Aside from past human behavior like how we use to hunt or survive and look at how each macronutrient works from a functional perspective. </p>
<p>Fats (~9 calories per gram) are calorie dense making them excellent to low volume high calorie dense (high energy) food. Fats line our organs, aid in hormone function and a list of other benefits and though dietary fats you get (fat soluble) vitamins.
-Vitamin A (carrots and sweet potatoes).
--Great for vision and immunity function.</p>
<p>-Vitamin D (fatty fish, eggs, mushrooms)
--Bone health and immunity</p>
<p>-Vitamin E (leafy greens and avocado)
--Antioxidant, immunity, and prevents blood clots</p>
<p>-Vitamin K (leafy greens and asparagus)
--Heart health and bone health</p>
<p>Carbohydrates (~4 calories per gram)
Come in the form of sugars, starches, and fiber. Primary food source for your brain is carbs stored in your liver in the form of glycogen. The large majority of glycogen is stored in skeletal muscle and is used as an immediate energy source for movement when the body demands it. With help from insulin excess carbs are turned into fatty acids and then stored as fat. </p>
<p>Protein (~4 calories per gram)
Tissue repair and tissue building, helps with pH and fluid balancing but also the most filling out of the 3 macronutrients. </p>
<p>We have a hard time balancing these 3 in moderation and that moderation level is different for everyone. But eating foods that are high in protein and high in fiber with an adequate amount of fat will cause the stomach to feel fuller sooner with a lower caloric intake. But this isn't as exciting or tasty compared to cookies and captain crunch. </p>
<p>An example of balanced food groupings come from areas of the world where people live the longest. Some of these regions are located in in Japan, Costa rica, and Italy (these areas are called blue zones coined by Dan Buettner). These individuals for the most part eat intuitively and eat mostly from plant sources, seafoods, and whatever is native to their region and move a lot (walk, farm, work) often which balances heart health. Main thing to draw from these places is that they eat high protein, high fiber diets and are active through their lifetime leading to longer lives. These are diets in the sense that is meant for the long term. Not some diet that is so restrictive that it eliminates a whole macronutrient and not sustainable for the long term. Looking at diet through a purposeful basis allows you to know what your own goals are, enjoy the 3 macronutrients in a moderated manner, yeah have your cake, we can enjoy life and what it has to offer as long as it's in moderation, that's your choice. Find what's sustainable for yourself and what's good for you (and your mental health). </p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>We are too dumb to intuitively eat like we did in the past because of the wildly widely available sources of nutritionally empty foods, so we need to make conscious decisions on our intake to balance fullness and starvation. We are also far less active and much more sedentary. The combination of these things make it incredibly easy to overeat.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a really complicated (albeit accurate way) of just saying carbohydrates block leptin because they release insulin. Insulin blocks leptin. If you eat fats and proteins your leptin signal won’t be blocked and your brain will know you’re full. Hence why we can over eat breads, chips, crackers, cookies, ice cream but rarely cheese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of an off topic question but in regards to hormones and their receptors I’ve often seen it described as that they target certain parts of the body. Are they aimed so to say or is it just that they travel through the blood to every part of the body but only certain tissues/organs are equipped to receive them. In other words is it like sending a text to a specific person or sending a message in a group chat that few/one know how to respond to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong but insofar as evolution is concerned , isn't the &quot;watering hole&quot; one of the most dangerous places? You can travel with fruit or a haunch of meat but water isn't portable; so getting your fill of water quickly decreases your chance of being ambushed by a predator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But were humans as dependent on watering holes as animals are? I saw a documentary with the Hadza tribe where they had developed tools to find water underground anywhere on the plains, a trick that animals obviously cant apply, giving them a flexible advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>This is a much more complicated process that takes longer, which leads to a lag between actually being full, and the feeling of fullness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this have anything to do with our remote ancestors foraging slowly throughout the day? I mean, my understanding is that they didn't actually graze, but it was more like grazing than structured meals. Interspersed with gorging if they managed to kill something big or happened across some other abundant source of calories.</p></div>		</li>
