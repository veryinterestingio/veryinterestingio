			<div class="markdown"><p>Just thermal noise, the random motion of electrons inside the circuits creates a small random current (i.e. noise), which is usually inaudible because it's various orders of magnitude smaller than the signal, but when there is no signal it gets amplified until it's the only thing being heard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also the exact same thing as static on an analog/tube television screen, but in audible form.</p>
<p>Edit: added “analog/tube”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cosmic and earth background radiation, and other things that have and/or use electrical current. Even from the radio itself.
If you have 2 wires next to each other, and run power through 1 of the them, then there will be power in the other one too. Only a little though, but it's still there, so old radios that was not properly shielded/grounded would pick up and amplify its own noise.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an example of this!</p>
<p>The old video game console called the Vectrex had its audio subsystem placed right next to the XY Deflector subsystem.  One could actually <em>hear</em> what was being displayed on the screen.  <a href="https://youtu.be/9wkEL3RcW8s?t=494" target="_blank">Here's just one example in an Ashens video.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More. Digital broadcasting doesn't have static, because random data isn't a valid compressed audio encoding whereas it is valid uncompressed analog audio.</p>
<p>The amplifiers are still often analog.</p></div>		</li>
