			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of my co-workers do and it looks absolutely disgusting.  Add 5 or 6 of those little creamers also.  This one woman would do 10 sugars and she literally died in the 2 years I've been here (she also smoked a ton and was very overweight, so I'm not implying it was directly the sugar but I'm sure it didn't help)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt that it is normal to have that much.. That said, I was once in line at a fast food restaurant and someone came through the drive through and ordered a large coffee (internet search says they are 20oz at this restaurant) with 25 sugars and milks in it. The employees didn't blink an eye, so I guess it may be more common than I thought. Just hearing it made me feel a little queasy, though.</p></div>		</li>
