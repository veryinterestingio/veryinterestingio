			<div class="markdown"><p>Going from 3 dimensions of space to more is a leap, but not nearly as big as going from one dimension of time to multiple. Not impossible. People have worked on it. But hard to interpret what the other time dimensions mean. For space, since we already have multiple dimensions, increasing that number does not cause as much of an upheaval to our understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems to me there is at least one way to view an extra time dimension. There's an idea of a &quot;block universe&quot; in which time is a big stack of all the events past and future like a big flipbook. A 4D being could view the entire block at once and examine any part of it. That being then lives in a time dimension orthogonal to ours in the block.</p></div>		</li>
