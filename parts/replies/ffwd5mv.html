<p>2: the expanding cloud of combustion gasses will go faster</p>
<p>3: high energy photons (UV and up) released by the explosion will go free instead of adding energy to the atmosphere (not really significant for conventional explosives, but nuclear explosives release most of their energy as x-rays)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in space a nuke would most likely fry something with xrays rather than damaging it with the &quot;expanding cloud of gases&quot;?</p>
<p>what would the gasses be anyway in this case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the answer. On a related note, will the heat at such a distance be more severe or less compared to Earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably less. You won't get heated by hot gas flying at you, but you can get heated directly from the light &amp; radiation of the explosion. For something like a nuclear bomb, this could easily be lethal. The atmosphere may absorb a little of this radiation, but the lack of a shockwave of hot gas is probably the bigger difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, any shrapnel resulting from the explosion would be far more deadly in space, as there is no atmosphere (or gravity) to slow it down.</p>
<p>While any energy resulting from the explosion is weakened with the square of distance from it (somebody correct me if I'm wrong here), shrapnel would retain its kinetic energy and would be equally deadly at any distance distance from it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I disagree on this. Take an idealized bomb that just creates a sphere of hot high pressure gas. In an atmosphere, that does work moving air, thus concussion.</p>
<p>In space, shouldn't much more of the energy remain heat in the gas? Some will go into accelerating the gas.</p>
<p>In theory, at any given distance, you should get the same J/m^2 , just in space most of it will be heat, either blackbody radiation or hot gas. But, since even heating is probably about the least energy efficient way to hurt someone, I agree with your conclusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will disagree with the top answer a little bit...I think gas heat will diffuse quickly in the vaccuum of space, but shrapnel may be hotter as it is insulated from colder materials. So, a thousand miles from the explosion, a tiny piece of metal may be hotter (and faster) than it would be on an earthbound explosion.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of balance of physical conditions goes into making a nuclear bomb go off. I suspect it would not work as well in space without modification.</p></div>		</li>
