			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you clarify or give a source for this information? What do you mean by breaking down fascia? As far as I was aware muscle knots are caused by hypercontracted muscle tissue. Any breaking down of fascia to me sounds like a dangerous way to damage your muscles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Note this doesn't <em>necessarily</em> mean that it doesn't work, but it does mean that there aren't peer-reviewed sources demonstrating that it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In their defense there is no good evidence for ice/heat but people still do it everyday. Just because there is no actual evidence (statistically significant evidence) to support it doesn’t mean it doesn’t make the patient feel better which is really the goal of any treatment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how the whole industry works. In order to diagnose something you have to be able to define it. We don't know what &quot;knots&quot; are or what causes them. In order to treat something you need to be able to diagnose it reliably, which we can't do, because we can't define them. If we don't know what it is then we can't reliably treat it or know if our treatment is effective beyond symptomatology. Yet the whole MFR industry is basically saying &quot;We can't definitively say what it is or reliably diagnose it but we have a treatment that can give symptomatic relief to some patients at levels slightly higher than placebo expectancy. Today's visit is 50% off and I'll have the front desk book you in for 6 more appointments over the next 6 weeks&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong my good sir. Mfr came about in the 80s and we are just now getting into the nitty gritty of the studies for it...so few [high quality] studies are done on the various modalities of massage you really cant conclude much from them. All we truly have to go on on a lot of cases IS anecdotal, because funding these studies is difficult, as well as public knowledge of the specific modalities. What is being found is that massage is incredibly useful in pain relief and we should be seeing some really good studies soon (im sure there are some now, but I am on my phone in bed so...). I have been practicing myofascial release for 2 years with incredible results - complete resolution of sciatic pain after 6 sessions that multiple rounds of physical therapy and injections could not touch being one of them. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun thing to try....</p>
<p>Bend at the waist. Try to touch your toes without bending your knees. Try to stick your fingers <em>under</em> your foot. </p>
<p>Now, roll your foot over a tennis or lacrosse ball for, oh, 30 seconds or so.</p>
<p>Now, go back and try to stick your fingers under your feet again.</p>
<p>Can anyone explain why this is possible? Why does breaking up the plantar fascia make you more flexible in the legs?</p></div>		</li>
