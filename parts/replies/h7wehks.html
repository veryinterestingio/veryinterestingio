			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. I was a competitive swimmer for many years and this had never clicked. It makes perfect sense. I always thought it was so that we were anxious to get moving and warm up, and because heating an Olympic + short course yard combo pool even by a few degrees must be expensive af.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one is really answering this question so:</p>
<p>ELI5:
Yes, the pool will be heated. However the water may be shared with the 50m pool so the two pools are the same temperature. They can’t heat the diving pool because the 50m pool needs to be kept cold.</p>
<p>Also to answer your original question, chlorine makes your skin very itchy especially as your skin dries while you’re waiting for your next dive, so washing it off feels much nicer.</p>
<p>More info:
All the comments talking about it being better to swim in a cool pool are correct. Swimming uses most muscles in your body, which produces a lot of heat. In cool water this is fine as the water will keep you cool (I think Olympic pools will be around 25-28C), but if the water is too hot your body can overheat which can make you faint. Obviously, losing consciousness face down in the water can be fatal, so they keep competition pools pretty cold as most people using that pool will be exerting themselves and generating lots of body heat.</p>
<p>Pools mostly used by children can be warmer (maybe 30-32C) as children lose heat so fast, and general use pools have to kinda balance somewhere in the middle (maybe 28-29C).</p>
<p>So why they don’t just make the diving pool a bit warmer? The pool water passes through a heat exchanger (water or maybe oil is heated then surrounds the pipework containing the pool water, which transfers the heat to the pool water as it passes through). It’s possible that the water for the two pools is shared, and passes through the same filters and heating and chemical dosing system. This saves having to have two separate systems, which saves a lot of money. Therefore they can’t heat the diving pool separately to the 50m pool, and the 50m pool has to be kept cold.</p>
<p>It’s possible that they do have separate filtration and heating for both pools, so they <em>could</em> heat the diving pool to be warmer than the 50m pool. However, heating that amount of water takes a <strong>LONG</strong> time, and costs <em>A LOT</em> of money.</p>
<p>Think how much energy it takes to heat your kettle, or a pan of water. Now think how long it takes - a couple of minutes to get from tap temperature to boiling, not so bad right? That’s only maybe 1-2 litres (half a gallon or so). Now imagine heating an olympic sized swimming pool. Google is telling me a 50m x 25m x 2m pool is roughly 2,500,000 litres of water (660,000 gallons). The amount of energy and time to heat that much water up even just one degree is insane. The water also loses that heat pretty quickly to the air, so it costs a lot even to just <em>maintain</em> the current temperature, let alone increase it. I’m not sure on the volume of the diving pool as I dont know the dimensions, but I imagine it’s similar if not more due to how deep it is.</p>
<p>So keeping the pool cool simply comes down to: the divers are used to cool pools, and they have showers to warm up so let’s just keep it cooler to save money.</p>
<p>Also - chlorine becomes less effective at killing bacteria the warmer it gets, so you can use less chlorine in a cooler pool. Again it comes down to money.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>case in point: triathlons in tokyo2020 practically passing out when they get to the finish line</p>
<p>they swam in 30ish degree soup and then did the rest of their events in massive heat and humidity. not being able to sweat properly destroyed them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The energy to heat up a whole Olympic size swimming (not diving) pool, 2.5 million litres, BY ONE DEGREE CELSIUS, is equivalent to the energy to fully charge 38 Tesla Model 3's (the 75 kWh version).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note - Olympic pools are way deeper than 2m. I worked at one in college and we drained the pool one year to fill some leaks in the underwater windows (where they put the cameramen before waterproof remote cameras were a thing) and do drain work.</p>
<p>This pool was easily 10-15 feet deep in the center of the drain. We had 6 foot tall bulkheads for short track setups and I could walk beneath it without bending over. The sides were 6 or 8 feet deep, but that lasted less than a lane's width on each side</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well a warm pool means a warm pool area. A warm enough pool would be 1) expensive and 2) would make the whole area ungodly warm and humid.</p>
<p>A warm shower is an easy fix. Some big college pools have a hot tub and showers for divers .</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same when I was snowboarding, if I stop I can totally freeze, the clothing was super light to allow me to cool when I’m using all muscles at 100%. Same in all sports. Unfortunately they won’t warm an entire pool just for the dives, and cool it back after it. So the unfortunate divers have to deal with it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The energy it would require to do that in the first place would be enormous. You'd have to dump a whole lot of energy into the water, and then find a way to get it out again. I guess a heat pump could do it, but it wouldn't be fast or cheap</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons.</p>
<p>One, it’s hella expensive to heat a shit ton of water (takes a lot of energy, plus you have to build the heating equipment)</p>
<p>Two, warmer water is worse for athletes, you body generates heat, and athletes muscles generate even more when in use, and if you don’t have a way to dump that heat you get overheating problems. The warmer the water, the harder it is to dump excess heat out of your body.</p></div>		</li>
