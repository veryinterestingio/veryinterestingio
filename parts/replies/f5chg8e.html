<p>So people who smoke pot to “make my back stop hurting” should be ingesting it in a different way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I didn't mean to suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect was responsible for the positive results in treating seizures. I don't know if that's the case unfortunately and I honestly don't know if there is enough research yet to say it is one way or the other. </p>
<p>Like I said, the research is still catching up and I'm not sure if the &quot;how&quot; is fully realized yet. Rather, it's the fact that it's been shown to have a positive effect at all. </p>
<p>I don't work in this field, so I only know what I've read and what I've learned from people who do work in this field, but there are different receptors in the endocannabinoid system. The CB2 receptor is the one that deals with inflammation and the immune system. There's also a CB1 receptor that is expressed in the brain, and that may be the one more relevant when discussing things like seizures, anxiety and insomnia. So if these canabinoids help to regulate these systems that have fallen out of wack, that might be the essence of why we're seeing positive effects with CBD and the plethora of other compounds found in marijuana. </p>
<p>And smoking is still a good way to metabolize it, but the act of smoking is in itself provably harmful. So if your goal is purely medicinal, you might be better off with a different method. With that being said, I still don't think I've heard of someone getting lung cancer from just smoking weed, but I've been wrong plenty of times before! </p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/" target="_blank">here</a> is pretty much the only decent scientific paper I could find, but I think it should give you some solid insight, but also probably a lot more questions.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. CB1 is expressed on pre-synaptic neurons. It is part of a feedback loop that regulates excitation/inhibition. When the CB1 receptor is activated, it inhibits the release of glutamate and GABA.</p>
<p>CBD is an antagonist of CB1, so it blocks the receptor. This leads to <em>more</em> release of GABA. This is known as <em>dis</em>inhibition. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, so it reduces the probability that the post-synaptic neuron will depolarize, and therefore reduces the electrical activity in the brain.</p>
<p>This is how CBD prevents seizures, through GABA disinhibition. It's not entirely different from benzodiazepines, which prevents seizures by directly activating GABA-receptors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, it works on a very rare form of epilepsy. It does not stop or even help 99% of seizures nor is it likely to be added to the standard of care for most forms of epilepsy. For kids with Dravet Syndrome? Sure, has decent evidence behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The unfortunate thing for people in states that don't have legalisation is....</p>
<p>Preliminary research has sudgested that you need a tiny bit of THC to make the CBD work properly.</p>
<p>I live in a legal state so the &quot;non psychoactive (won't get you high);CBD oil extraction has 1-2% THC in it.</p>
<p>Compare that with some purple Humboldt that is 20-30% THC.</p>
<p>That stuff would be more for chronic pain, to help reduce the amount of opiates needed.  </p>
<p>CBD will not get you high, also CBD needs a tiny % of THC to become active.</p>
<p>It's really sad that nobody has been able to study this for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But the essence of what we do know now is that our bodies have an entire network called the endocannabinoid system. </p>

<p>That's not a useful statement even remotely. That's just another way of saying &quot;the drug works&quot;. All drugs have &quot;systems&quot;, because if they didn't they wouldn't work in the first place. </p>
<p>How CBD works to treat certain disorders is mostly unknown. It's been identified as active at several sites like the serotonin 1A receptor as an agonist, and at the CB1 and CB2 receptors as an antagonist. What this means is more or less unknown at this point in terms of its medical potential. </p>
<p>A lot of drugs that we take every day have unknown mechanisms of action or unknown cause and effect between the mechanisms of action and how that improves disorders. Psychoactive drugs are plagued by this issue because we know so little about the brain. Nobody knows how antidepressants treat depression for example. Because we don't even know what depression is.</p>
<p>Drug regulatory agencies do not require proof of how a drug works to treat a medical issue. Only proof that is able to treat them.</p></div>		</li>
