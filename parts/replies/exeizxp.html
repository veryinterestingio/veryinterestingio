<p>It’s also been shown that some nuclides in their ground states have nonzero octupole moments. These nuclides are “pear-shaped”, and this is a big deal because electric octupole moments break parity and time-reversal symmetries.</p>

<p>This part got me, can you elaborate on this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easier to see with parity. If parity is a good symmetry, then eigenstates of the Hamiltonian can be chosen to have good parity. If you want to calculate the expectation value of some electromagnetic multipole moment O(<strong>r</strong>), you integrate |Ψ(<strong>r</strong>)|^(2)O(<strong>r</strong>) d^(3)r over all space.</p>
<p>If Ψ has good parity, then |Ψ|^(2) is always an even function. Then if O(<strong>r</strong>) is odd, this integral exactly vanishes.</p>
<p>So all odd-parity multipole moments (magnetic monopole, electric dipole, magnetic quadrupole, electric octupole, etc.) all have to be zero if parity is a good symmetry. If you measure any nonzero value of any one of them, it shows that parity is not truly a good symmetry of the Hamiltonian. And the same turns out to be true of time reversal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the details, I have just finished reading a paper which essentially proved that the expected octupole moment is 0 when assuming parity or time-reversal symmetry.</p>
<p>This is really interesting, do you know to which extend this has affected the development of field theories lately?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol I saw this post and started reading it and your comment to my fiancé who is currently getting a PhD in physics and works in nuclear structure to see what he’d say. He says he just measured a quadrupole moment. He also thought your explanation was good! Love such a relevant post.</p></div>		</li>
