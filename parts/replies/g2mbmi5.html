			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah. I think people are actually more sensitive towards distortion in audio than on video. some videogames use on-screen &quot;glitches&quot; as a mechanic or visual effect and still remain playable, but any pause or skip in the sound &amp; it's a torture</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Human sense of sound is underappreciated.</p>
<p>Your sense of sound travels faster than your sense of sight.  In other words, an auditory signal reaches your brain faster than visual. (Yes, light is faster than sound but at close distances, the constraint is how fast the signal gets to your brain which is surprisingly slow)</p>
<p>Makes sense because until we figured out fire, you had to rely on your sense of sound to keep you alive given our terrible night vision.  Your sense of sound can wake you from sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes literally stop taking in new information while they move so you don’t get dizzy all day from your eyes rapidly moving everywhere. Your brain is constantly guessing and filling in blank “frames” and low detail areas of your vision to trick you into thinking you have super eyesight. Tricking the eyes is easy because they trick themselves all the time.</p>
<p>On the other side your ears are pretty much constantly running and the brain just post-processes out anything it doesn’t need.</p>
<p>A few thousand wrong pixels dotted across a screen is unnoticeable in almost all cases, but if a musical note is slightly off we pick up on it almost immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would explain why those speed reading apps work well, where there place the 'point of attention' for each word in the same point on the screen and cycle through them since your eyes dont need to move to read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's also why auditory hallucinations are way more disturbing than visual ones while you're tripping.</p>
<p>You see colour and pattern and it's all a bit bizarre are wonderful, but normal in a way. Then some audio warps, and you feel like you've been plunged into some dark psychotic sea for a moment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the question is &quot;why can't we do it?&quot;  A quick google search shows that <a href="https://kuleshov.github.io/audio-super-res/" target="_blank">we already are doing it.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.insightdatascience.com/using-deep-learning-to-reconstruct-high-resolution-audio-29deee8b7ccd" target="_blank">Here's another similar project.</a></p>
<p>Granted, the results are shaky at best for now, but I think that's expected.</p></div>		</li>
