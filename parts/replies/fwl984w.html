<p>considering how albino animals get picked off by predators because of how their coloration highlights their presence, i wonder if the ostracization helps protect the group from having their location advertised to hungry carnivores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If genes in the albino animals encouraged this out of altruism that would be a group selectionist argument that would not work, unless you invoke kin selection or something.</p>
<p>But if genes in the other animals caused displacement of the poorly camouflaged member out of selfish interest e.g. by harassment, that could be favoured by selection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's what I was thinking. If the most vulnerable are ostracized then predators are most likely to go after them and then those with the better camouflage will have a lower risk and expend less energy on evading predators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m no biologist, but the problem I see with that idea is it doesn’t make sense in terms of evolution. It wouldn’t seem to help the albino rat live longer and produce more offspring. Evolution doesn’t have a consciousness, so it’s not like the albino rat has a sense that it needs to leave to protect the group.</p>
<p>Unless the idea is that the other rats have a higher survival rate if they chase off albino kin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even plants can be albino. Typically only see examples in plants that share root systems with established member of their species or as chimeras since an albino leaf cant do photosynthesis. There is the worlds tallest chimera redwood tree in the county i live in. Really not as cool as it sounds though. It looks sick and stunted supporting its albino portion which is less white and more yellowish. They recently moved the tree actually cause they wanted to build train tracks near it. They were originally going to just cut it down but they got a lot of pushback and decided to relocate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t transplanting it, give that plant a death sentence?  Only because albino plants need their root system to be intermixed with other plants, so moving it would separate all root contacts, at least the good contacts to even suppose a huge red wood?  How many years ago was this? And is the tree still alive?  Just curious, since you live there.</p></div>		</li>
