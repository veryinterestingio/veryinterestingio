			<div class="markdown"><p>I quit April 2009. I finally decided that if I didn't quit I would die. I was up to a case of beer and a half a fifth ov vodka a day. I had to drink in the middle of the night just to go back to sleep. I was drinking all day just to hide the shakes. I was in hospital for 4 days under supervised detox. I don't remember any of it. Later found out my liver was at 10%.</p>
<p>If you think you drink too much, then try lowering amount slowly. I tried, but as soon as I had a few there was no stopping. Moderation went out the window. If you can't moderate, get help. If you have more questions, feel free to ask. Hope it works out for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother and I are alcoholics.  We're sober now.  We'd drink 6-9 5.5% abv Budweiser every night and a couple beers throughout the day to combat the shakes.  My brother had some busy and very stressful games he had to work and he never had break time to go to the car a chug a beer so he went a couple days with very little alcohol.  </p>
<p>On the car ride home he had a seizure.  Fortunately he wasn't driving so he's fine.  It's one of the latest big events that led us to sobriety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's crazy. Glad you guys are sober. I drank 15-20 beers per night for about 15 years. Quit cold turkey. Was cranky for a few days. You never know how it'll affect you.</p>
<p>Edit: don't do what I did. I was lucky. I was cranky for a few days but I'm still a miserable fuck. I should probably see a shrink. Been about 6 years now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes either taper down slowly or, if it needs to be faster, medial detox under doctor supervision so they can inject you with a benzo in case you start seizing.</p>
<p>Your GABA receptors can heal in time, but quitting anything GABA-related cold turkey is a bad idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If under medical care, a severe alcoholic is given meds that produce the GABA they're not getting from alcohol so they don't seizure.  Some alcoholics will decide with their doctor to try without meds, but in that case meds will most certainly be handy in case things get worse than they expected.  </p>
<p>If someone under medical care is attempting to quit drinking and shows signs of seizure, the best thing to do is to just give them alcohol for the time being until they can be treated.  Someone could hypothetically avoid seizures by slowly cutting down, but that is nearly impossible for an addict at an alcoholic level to do in any sort of responsible way.</p>
<p>That stage of withdrawal usually only lasts a few days.  After that it is generally safe to just not drink, but a lot of meds that help with things like cravings, anxiety, sleep issues, etc. are often prescribed for longer periods of time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Previously I stopped drinking for 4 years after I kept vomiting blood.  My friends told me to have a beer with them, I told them it wouldn't be just one with me but they kept pestering me..I had a drink to make them shut up... Guess I showed them /s</p></div>		</li>
