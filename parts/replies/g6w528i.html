			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably the same mentality that makes people say, &quot;oh, I'm so sleepy. It's all the tryptophan in the turkey we just ate.&quot;</p>
<p>No, Susan. It was the fact that you two heaping platefuls of Thanksgiving turkey,  stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, and sweet  potatoes, plus the pumpkin pie, and three glasses of wine while watching the parade. </p>
<p>But, sure, blame it on the tryptophan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's basically the same amount of tryptophan in most meat, and lesser amounts in plenty of other foods. But people don't regularly gorge themselves to the level they do at Thanksgiving, so it gets pinned on the amino acid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny, my husband said he was allergic to MSG, but he ate all other foods just fine. It wasn't until I started making &quot;no added MSG&quot; chinese food at home that we realized what gave him all of the horrible symptoms: Sesame oil. Turns out he has a bad reaction to it regardless of what food contains it. Now I can add MSG to cooking no problem!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of the same as me when i was younger. I had a reaction and my boomer racist mother swore it was that evil chinese food poisining me with its from-satan MSG.</p>
<p>Maaaaany years later when I was an adult and exploring food not limited by my mothers racism growing up, I discovered it was sesame oil and not MSG at all. And that Mediteranian food is genuinely the best shit ever made ever.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They told me whenever someone asked for no MSG, they just said “sure thing” and added it anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glutamate (glutamic acid) is a basic amino acid necessary for the construction of proteins in the human body. If you don’t consume it, the body makes it itself.  If he’s allergic to it, he doesn’t have long to live.
I used to get upset that people don’t have a basic understanding of their bodies and nutrition.  Now I just laugh.</p></div>		</li>
