			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, this will vary dramatically by language! </p>
<p>In English we have sentence-level intonation that can carry pragmatic meanings that aren't included in any given word in the sentence. For example think about how you raise the pitch of the end of a sentence upward when you ask a question, and how basically the same formation has a different meaning altogether when spoken aloud because of this (&quot;Going to the park.&quot;/&quot;Going to the park?&quot;). Mandarin, on the other hand, has word-level intonation; the way you pronounce a word can completely change the definition of the word itself. </p>
<p>So in English you can code a fair bit of meaning into just saying someone's name with a tone in context, basically creating a full sentence out of just the name. If you encounter someone you think you know and say, &quot;James?&quot;  the entailed meaning is basically, &quot;Are you the person I think you are?&quot; On the other hand, a full name uttered quietly with a descending tone from a parent to a child- &quot;James Bartholomew Gordon...&quot;- might mean &quot;you have done something wrong and ought to be ashamed.&quot; </p>
<p>So you're right on that it depends on many different conditions- including the language being spoken! In languages that use tones at the word level, these pragmatic constructions might not be possible by just saying a name, or might invite other potential confusion.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had thought about this same exact question many many times as my actual name is Fabian but my nickname is Bacon. My family and coworkers call me by my actual name but all my friends and even some teachers etc. call me Bacon. It is really really weird having an actual word being associated with your 'name'. I once was in a burger restaurant and it was 'bacon weekend' and if someone on the other side of the restaurant ordered a double bacon burger i would instinctively turn my head. i got a headache that day...</p>
<p>I'm just thinking about how many reactions a simple name can trigger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. There's an explanation in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/31fhbo/eli5_do_dogs_recognize_that_their_name_is_their/cq190g7/" target="_blank">that post</a> itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not so much that they don't care, but that they don't have anywhere near the same capacity for social expression and comprehension that dogs do. Dogs evolved as pack animals driven by complex social signals, and so they've evolved the capacity to communicate via body language. Cats on the other hand, were more solitary animals, meeting only to mate. Feral cats for example tend to not form packs, but rather establish separate territories.</p>
<p>Because of this difference in evolution, dog's ability to read more refined communication between each other (i.e food, enemy, we go this way, etc) allows them to more easily communicate with humans. Despite the fact we have different bodies they can still usually manage to understand hand gestures and the differences in intention between subtle vocalizations. If you intently direct your vision at something while clearly speaking to them, many dogs will correctly interpret that as you directing them to pay attention to what your looking at or go there.</p>
<p>Cats on the other hand are similarly intelligent, but they do not anywhere near the same ability to interpret social communication, nor do they have the inclination to obey a dominant figure. While they may respect you as being in charge, the concept of you making decisions as the leader is simply not one they understand. The extent of their understanding is that they respect your ownership of the territory (the house). The only way to get a cat to do what you want is to get it to come to it to get the idea on it's own, as it won't be able to understand your directions.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> When a cat does not react to a command, it's not disregarding you because it doesn't care, it simply has no idea what you're trying to tell it. Cats only naturally communicate their emotional state (i.e anger, fear, pleasure, relaxation, desire etc) , and so have no way of directly coordinating socially.</p>

Sometimes just being in the same room means they like being around you.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true though.  I have six outside cats, each will come to their name.  But when they don't care to come you can always tell they recognize their name by their body language.  Oddly enough, my dog comes no matter who's name I call.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a study done that said that cats can tell when their owners say their name as opposed to strangers.  However, they dont care that it is their owners saying it as opposed to a stranger saying it, and usually ignore them.  The publishers believed this may be the case because humans domesticated dogs for a purpose (guarding, hunting etc).  Whereas cats just lived where humans were and ate mice that thrived in gardens humans had.  Basically, cats just grew up along side humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Real answer, cats aren't really domesticated.  Dogs have largely been domesticated to be used in various functions and as a companion.  Obeying owners has slowly been bred into the breeds.  The fact they're natural pack animals makes this fairly easy.</p>
<p>Last I checked most scientists think cats largely domesticated themselves which means basically they moved up close to humans and slowly lost their feralness.  But unlike dogs they weren't normally used as utility animals since they more or less did exactly what early humans wanted from them by existing (keep rodent populations low.). That with cats being a bit more solitary means they don't exactly see you as an owner and thus feel free to pay exactly as much attention to you as they want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats also were domesticated solely for pest control. It wouldn't have been wise to breed out their insatiable prey drive and solitary nature in favor of obedience. Cats are one of the few animals besides humans who will kill just for fun/practice, when they aren't even hungry. That's important if you want a creature that will hunt down pests without any sort of human interaction or other incentive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We &quot;have&quot; an outdoor rescue cat that only comes home for food. Usually he takes his time and will wash himself in the house after dinner. However if you say his name or make any movement that could be construed as attempted interaction, he will avoid eye contact and immediately leave the house. </p>
<p>My boyfriend has an expensive purebred Siberian cat that wags his tail and looks at you if you say his name. If you keep saying it often he will come and purr. It is clear that this cat breed is way more domesticated lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With cats it seems based on a mix of priority and intelligence. My cat will understand her name and react if i call her, and will occasionally wander over to me if she feels like it. My girlfriend's cat won't even react beyond an ear twitch and even then it seems that he's more just responding to the noise. </p>
<p>However my girlfriend's cat is a lot friendlier and a lot sillier than my cat. He's never once bit, scratched or hissed at anyone in the last ten years. My cat does it frequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a cat in my neighbourhood, I don't actually know where he comes from because the backs of our houses come from all different directions so I don't really know some people, if that makes sense. But I last saw this cat about 4 years ago and then last weekend he turned up outside randomly. I have a name that I used to call him, since I don't know the name his owners call him, let's say it's &quot;Broseph&quot;. So I go outside and say &quot;Broseph?&quot; and he kind of looks startled and half runs away. Then he stops and does a half turn. I say &quot;Broseph! where've you been for 4 years dude?&quot;. Another half turn. &quot;Broseph&quot;. And it looked like he was thinking &quot;Yes. Yes, I am Broseph&quot;. And he came over to me and we were immediate buddies again. Now I don't know if he was recognising my voice or &quot;Broseph&quot; more but he's been coming every day and every time I say &quot;hey Broseph&quot; he looks and comes running over. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol we had this outdoor cat in our neighborhood that would sit at our sliding glass door in the backyard. He would sit inches away just staring inside and our cats would sit on the other side starting right back at him. I knew he was a he bc he had some massive balls. We called him Backyard Cat or BC for short hahaha I haven't seen him in a while.. pretty sure he belonged to someone because a neighborhood kid referred to him as Andy. Anyway he was super skittish and would never let me near him no matter how much food I offered him. Totally not a Broseph. </p></div>		</li>
