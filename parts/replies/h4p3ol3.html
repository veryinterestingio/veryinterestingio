			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I never got to experience ranger school but I was on my way toward it. Was med discharged for epilepsy. Anyway, second weekend I spent at rasp (I was a nasty girl), they smoked our asses all day. Idk how I drove home but I slept for an easy 10 hours right when I got home haha.</p></div>		</li>
