<p>Edit: To clarify, I’m saying that it is not possible for presbyopia specifically to be reversed or slowed. Not saying eyesight in general cannot be improved. It depends what caused vision to decrease in first place of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying I am wasting my time if I spend 10 hours a day focusing my eyes on far distance objects in an attempt to correct my worsening farsightedness.</p>
<p>I thought part of worsening eye conditions from reading a book too close was the constant strain of looking at close objects for too long thus slowly forcing your eyes to adapt to looking at close objects instead of far ones. Hence the idea of sitting away from any TV or monitor.</p>
<p>Can you address this area since its so common instead of it being a yes or no question?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what exactly cause it to worsen. Cataracts for example is one of the most common causes of age related blindness/blurry vision and can be easily cured by replacing the clouded lense of your eye. Over 3 million of these surgeries are performed a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earlier this year, I found my eyesight deteriorating rapidly.  I was out on the sailboat and couldn't see channel markers any more.  My distance vision was in the toilet - less than a year after my last prescription change.  I've worn glasses since fourth grade, and I have always been extremely nearsighted.  I could read without glasses and could do incredibly small electrical repairs without them as well, but I couldn't see crap across the room without them.</p>
<p>Turns out I had a problem with cataracts.  I made the appointment and had them taken care of - each eye done three weeks apart.  I paid extra and had my slight astigmatism corrected with a laser at the same time and bought the best multifocal replacement lenses available.</p>
<p>I now have 20/20 vision - for the first time since I was nine.  I don't wear glasses at all, and I've tossed my contacts into the trash.  Everything that was wrong with my eyes has been corrected and I'm thrilled (yes, it cost me $10K) with the outcome.  My ophthalmologist says that my vision is stable and shouldn't change much.  I do have cheap reading glasses that I need to use for those tiny electrical repair jobs, but I can still read without them.</p>
<p>So, when you get old enough, depending on your lifetime UV exposure and genetics, you can have your aging lenses replaced with implants that can bring you near-perfect vision.  There's some hope for us old four-eyed folks after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly drying out. The fluid in the lens begins to stiffen and crystallize, which makes it worse at focusing as you said. Kind of like honey crystallizing, except you can't just apply heat.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Genetics</p>

<p>Diet  (Omege-3s, Zinc, Lutein, and various vitamins are important in avoiding things like macular degeneration and cataracts)</p>
