Call it the Burger20, made up of the stocks of the 20 biggest fast food restaurants. If people find it useful and worth tracking, then you will see it become a household name like the Dow or S&amp;P. And you can add/subtract companies as you see fit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The S&amp;P500 is decided by a committee at the company Standard &amp; Poor's. It's not quite the 500 largest company either. </p>
<p>The company chosen must also have a net positive earnings in the last 4 quarters combined as well as the current quarter. This is why Tesla wasn't considered for SP500 until the last quarter. The amount that each company represents in the index is not equal either. Amazon, FB, Google, Microsoft and Apple makes up about a quarter(?) of the index.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also one thing to add that often gets overlooked a “large company” does not necessarily mean a high priced stock. A company can create as many (not actually but they do have leeway) shares as they want through various mean. </p>
<p>Apple, who’s stock was around 500 last I checked, is more valuable than amazon, who’s stock was around 3000 last I checked. That’s why these indexes have values that at first glance wouldn’t make sense (and if I’m not mistaken actually change how they are determined frequently)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you're closely tracking its value, you're better off with how much % change it's undergone in a given time period.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P500 is a representative unitless number that closely tracks the value of the top 500 companies in the US. So if last year the number was 3,000 points and this year it's 3,300, it means that in the past year the average value of the 500 companies has increased by 10%.</p>
<p>So you'd have to be familiar with how the number is doing within a given time frame. Let's say that it's once again 3,000 points. If today or tomorrow or day after tomorrow the index moved by 25 points (less then 1%), that's puny. But if in just one day it moves by 300 points (10%), then people think it's newsworthy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to google this question because I have been SO curious about it myself:</p>
<p>Basically, one point = 1 dollar, but that doesn’t tell you much unless you know the value of that stock. </p>
<p>For example, an increase in 10 points might be nothing for a stock that is already valued at $5000 per share, while that same increase of 10 points is huge for a stock that was previously selling at $15 per share. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example today (2020-08-24), the S&amp;P 500 finished at +34.12 (1.00%) - what does that &quot;34.12&quot; actually mean?  On average, each company stock price increased 0.34%?</p></div>		</li>
