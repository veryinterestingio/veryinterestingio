			<div class="markdown"><p>While true in modern society, wasn't there a tendency towards fat women in medieval society? They were considered to be &quot;more healthy, more fertile, ect?&quot; I wonder if that could play a part in the passing of specific genes or if it was really just a socio-economic thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was indeed a socio-economic thing, looking at the “higher league women” of now compared to those of renaissance times the main difference was the body shape. What was favored back then was child bearing characteristics such as large hips/thighs and large breasts whereas now most prefer a slimmer look in their mate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind as well so will starvation and malnutrition, and that was the situation a lot of people were suffering with (orders of magnitude more than who would have diminished fertility due to obesity.)  At that time being somewhat overweight showed you had good access to food and likely had better fertility rates than most starving people.  Today with food shipping across nations and the world, trivial access to food for most, food preservation, refrigeration, etc... Not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But being too thin ( having too low a body fat percentage) can make you infertile as well. Pretty much every model and most Instagram stars are too thin to be able to reproduce without help. That's why so many famous people use surrogates.</p></div>		</li>
