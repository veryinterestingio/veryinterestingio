			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;People have called black and grizzly bear hibernation torpor, winter sleep, dormancy, and carnivorean lethargy. The leading physiologists now simply call it hibernation. &quot;<br />
That was a quote from the North American Bear Center page.</p></div>		</li>

<p>During winter it's really hard to say, as they're hibernating and burrowed.</p>

<p>But, there is at least one other \~24 hour cycle other than light/dark; tides.  It is especially relevant to sea creatures, particularly those in the intertidal zone, but others as well.  Tides roll in and out either once per day, diurnal, or twice per day, semidiurnal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are places where the M2 component of tides (with 12hr26min period) is essentially zero. For example, this component is really weak in the Gulf of Mexico, and some places along the coast there have zero M2 component.  These places usually have roughly one high and low tide per day instead (on 24 hr 53 min cycle instead).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tides are driven by the Moon, and its orbit is around 5 degrees off the ecliptic. So as I understand around each solstice there would be a period with very little tides on the poles. Do we know if that affects the marine life around the North Pole?</p></div>		</li>
