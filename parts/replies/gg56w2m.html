			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not a simple question and there is not a simple answer!  Yes, batteries are heavy and kerosene (jet fuel) is very efficient.  Using batteries only for power storage is only being considered right now for small, short range aircraft.  For instance, you might be able to design a safer &quot;urban rescue helicopter&quot; by having propulsion driven by multiple electric motors rather than one main engine shaft.  </p>
<p>For larger aircraft, the solution has to be more than just batteries.  We already generate electricity from the turbine shaft on aircraft.  People have looked at whether all the turbine power could be converted to electricity and then distributed throughout the aircraft.</p>
<p>In the near term, some hybrid combination of turbine shaft power and distributed electric power can provide new propulsion-airframe integration opportunities that we hope will make aircraft more efficient and lay the ground work for future all-electric aircraft. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>An empty Boeing 737 weighs  <strong>41,145 kg (90,710 lb)</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A Boeing 737 has a fuel capacity of  <strong>16,009 L (4,299 gal)</strong> </p>
<p>Jet fuel weighs  <strong>0.82 kg per Liter (6.8 lb per gallon)</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Weight of fuel = <strong>0.82 kg</strong> <em>x</em> <strong>16009 L</strong> =  <strong>13,127 kg (28,940 lb)</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So fully fueled Boeing 737, with no passengers and cargo; weighs:</p>
<p><strong>41,145 kg</strong> <em>+</em> <strong>13,127 kg</strong> <strong><em>=</em></strong> <strong>54,272 kg (119,649 lb)</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The issue is with energy density...</p>
<p>Jet fuel has an gravimetric energy density of   48 MJ/kg</p>
<p>high end Lithium-ion batteries have an gravimetric energy density of   1.1 MJ/kg</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>That means for every kilogram of fuel, we would have to use OVER FORTY TIMES (40x) as much battery; to match the same energy profile.</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If we were to replace all the fuel with high end Lithium-Ion batteries (Think Tesla),</p>
<p>Our plane goes from weighing: <strong>54,272 kg (119,649 lb)</strong></p>
<p>To then weighing:  <strong>566,225 kg (1,248,312 lb)</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Finally, a Boeing 737 has a maximum take off weight of:</p>
<p><strong>88,314 kg (194,700 lb)</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/11/2/392/htm" target="_blank">According to an article published in 2018</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first glance, electrically-based aviation could be an option; however, the energy storage capacity for direct electrical energy in battery packs is severely limited. An alternative option for aviation might be based on the utilization of so-called electrofuels </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So my bet is on electrofuels</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your math here is pretty wrong because it doesn't account for the conversion efficiency. Batteries certainly aren't close enough to hydrocarbons to replace them but they're also not as far away as you're saying here. The energy you extract from hydrocarbons, you extract using a heat engine with an efficiency on the order of 30 to 40%. The energy you extract from batteries, you extract using an electric motor with an efficiency on the order of 90 to 100%. that takes you from a factor of 40 in favor of hydrocarbons down to a factor of 15 or so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The thermal efficiency of a jet engine maxes out at around 83%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this taking engine efficiency into account? Electric motors are usually upwards of 80-90% efficient while gasoline engines are generally less than 40% efficient.</p>
<p>This wouldn't change the end result of your statement, only the scale by a factor of about 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a good observation. I was only looking at energy densities and capacity/weight limits. Im sure we could find efficiencies in other areas, but I believe the fuel/engine system gives the largest return.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I would like to point out that we are looking at jet engines, not gasoline engines.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine#Energy_efficiency_relating_to_aircraft_jet_engines" target="_blank">According to our favorite encyclopedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The combustion efficiency of most aircraft gas turbine engines at sea level takeoff conditions is almost 100%. It decreases nonlinearly to 98% at altitude cruise conditions.</p>
