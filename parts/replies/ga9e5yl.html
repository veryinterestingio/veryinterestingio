			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to present the problem to others in a less disasterous light, there is a scifi concept called &quot;civilization in a can&quot;. If we send a slow spaceship to colonize a distant planet, we can prepare all the life forms as data, and have robots manufacture and mature eggs on site.  They also came up with the rock bottom limit of 500, and ask folks to make a list of 1000 humans they would like to see cloned. One story example is &quot;The Princess and the Silver Shoes&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, and while you are bringing your civilization up from the bottleneck you will want to use the image called &quot;Cousin_Explainer&quot; to arrange breeding pairs safely. It is based on traditional practices. There was also a Scientific American article experimenting on quail in the late 1970's that declared 3rd cousins to be safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very much, the lowest numbers require the greatest starting genetic diversity. If you were to grab say a family of 50 you'd be doomed. It's why the number is most often in the hundreds.</p></div>		</li>
