			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s about probabilty really. For example imagine a closed box with two gases in it. Theoretically the two gases could be separated, gas a on the one side, gas b on the other. Purely by chance I mean, not due to any property of them. But what’s the chance for that?</p>
<p>Basically very low right? I mean there are only two sides for the gases to be in such a example but trillions of various states of the gas molecules intermixed.
Even if you started with that distribution, the gases would quickly intermix with each other. </p>
<p>That’s entropy in a nutshell. The most likely random state for a given energy level.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correlation isn’t causation as I’m sure you’re aware. The whole “why” question is prob the hardest to answer</p>
<p>Asking it implies an intelligent interest behind the creation of the universe.</p></div>		</li>
