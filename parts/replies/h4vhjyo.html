			<div class="markdown"><p>We jogged our way up. Our jog speed is faster than animal trot speed so animals have to dash and rest while we keep running. Hunters still can run down an animal till they fall over from exhaustion and kill them when they are defenseless. For 8 hrs.</p>
<p>But. They still take days of rest in between such hunts.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I would like to give credit to /u/Fellainis_Elbows who pointed out that this may actually be a hypothesis. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Must be frightening being an animal hunted  by a human. You sprint as far away as you can and 30 minutes later this weird creature on two legs is staring at you with piercing white eyes so you take off again only to see it emerge from the bushes again and again until you can no longer keep running, and its always there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Most wild animals can sprint faster than us, but we can move at a slower pace for longer. An ancient method of hunting was to simply track an animal until it tired out. This could sometimes take days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The worst is when its completely needless too.</p>
<p>I had a retail job where you would get 1-2 customers per hour. But you had to remain standing at all times.</p>
<p>A chair or stool behind the counter wasn't allowed because it &quot;looked unprofessional&quot;.</p>
<p>Like someone is going to drive to the store, walk in and see you sitting instead of standing, and then decide woah nah fuck this I'm out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shockingly I'm on my feet all day at work.  But I think the way I avoid pain is that I make sure to walk around fetching items and tools.  I'm just glad they don't care that I keep my toolbox away from where I work.  But mostly because I work all over the shop and not at a single machine.</p></div>		</li>
