			<div class="markdown"><p>Also irrelevant, but I wonder whether the bees know they are communicating with one another by doing the waggle dance, or if instead they're just acting out their biological programming. Do they know that they're putting thoughts into other bees mind, or is it just something they know to do... It really makes you rethink what the word &quot;intelligence&quot; means. Fascinating stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking if bees have consciousness, no one really knows for sure. I will say that it's remarkable how capable those little bees are especially considering that their brains are roughly six orders of magnitude smaller than human brains in terms of the total number of neurons (less than 1 million neurons vs roughly 90 billion neurons in the human brain).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine who keeps bees says it’s more accurate to think of the whole hive as a single organism. One hive can even have a different “personality” than another. And when a swarm decides on a new place to build, it’s more like the bees are brain cells reaching a decision rather than one bee persuading the other bees.</p>
<p>Each bee, from the queen to the workers to the drones, exists solely to protect and propagate the hive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can say the same thing about humans. It's not like we're ever 100% conscious and deliberate about every single word we say, never mind emotional tonality and body language. </p>
<p>And sure, during a quick conversation with a coworker we know what's going on. But 24 hours later, that conversation isn't a verbatim transcript in your head. It's just bits of critical information and maybe some vague feelings.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a lot of really great replies to my comment. This point was one I was initially thinking about. Bees demonstrate that low level, innate behaviors can lead to the emergence of higher level patterns of &quot;thinking&quot;. It's as if the hive itself is conscious even though the isolated parts are not.</p>
<p>So the question is, when groups of humans interpret one another's &quot;unconscious&quot; communications, does similar emergent phenomena arise? One might think of the progression of mass hysteria as an example (or perhaps even the current pandemic). </p>
<p>Does that wave of ideas itself behave like its own entity, even though we are too zoomed in to see it? </p>
<p>I'm writing this in way after the thread has died, but if anyone reads this maybe it'll provoke some thought :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anthropomorphizing aside, I think bees must at least understand that the act of dancemunicating is information coming from another bee. There was an experiment where researchers put nectar on a boat in the middle of a lake and brought a bee to it. Bee grabbed nectar and went home to tell its buds about the sweet stash. They didn't believe that the nectar could possibly exist there so they ignored the waggles and didn't even bother looking for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fascinating. I wonder if a bee is capable of lying? I imagine a single bee isn't complex enough to want to lie but I wonder if the dance behavior is able to be falsified, or does it rely on something like memory, making it hard or impossible to falsify.</p>
<p>Because if the lake bee HAD nectar and bees aren't able to lie then why wouldn't the other bees believe the information? Can bees go crazy? Can the dance be misinterpreted?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and it’s called the Waggle Dance! Because they waggle their little booties to communicate. Adorable.</p>
<p>Also, did you know that bees brush against flowers to check if they’re full of nectar or not? The flowers actually vibrate at different frequencies to tell the bees if they’re full or not.</p>
<p>Also, bees can get drunk! If they drink fermented nectar, they show visible signs of drunkenness like crashing into things and flying erratically. Hives actually have bouncer bees that toss out the drunks until they sober up.</p>

<p>I have family in Greece that are beekeepers so I was always a little interested. The village actually has a honey and souma (the local firewater) festival every year that thousands of people attend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Find out more about bees in general? I’m not sure. There was a good documentary that partly talked about waggle dance called More Than Honey. I always recommend it to people interested in bee trivia.</p>
<p>What village? I’ve always wanted to visit Greece and I feel like I should check out this festival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this! And what a lot of people should know (especially gardeners) is that we should avoid using pesticides with neonicotinoids. They are made of a chemical that is a derivative of nicotine - and can really mess with a bee's brain. It can cause them misdirection in flight, and can inhibit effective foraging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Bees by Laline Paull is a novel from the perspective of a bee. It’s obviously fiction, but incredibly well researched and it gives you an easier time understanding their processes and she does a really good job of describing what is essentially like an alien world to us. Really interesting hive mind aspect to it!</p></div>		</li>
