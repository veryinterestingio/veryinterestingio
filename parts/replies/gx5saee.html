			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're confusing kettle lakes with annular lakes, which I'm asking about. Annular lakes are caused by meteor impacts, whereas kettle lakes are caused by glaciers.</p>
<p>Edit:. Now that I am seeing more responses and doing more research. I am seeing you are right. I just missed some context. Apologies!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are probably many buried or otherwise eroded craters roughly evenly distributed throughout the world. The likely reason more of them are visible as lakes in the far north is the same reason there are so many lakes there in general. The massive ice sheets carved away the former drainage systems, digging out sediment that accumulated in hollows more easily than the surrounding bedrock, and dumping lots of it in ways that blocked the former river channels. Impact structures in other parts of the world just usually aren't as easily visible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s the same answer though. The craters are not filled in because of glacial action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only reason I now know about kettle lakes is that I searched this sub for annular lakes before posting my own question...and the only question that popped up had a conversation in the comments about both annular and kettle lakes. Otherwise I know next to nothing.</p>
<p>I got to all of this while looking at Google Maps and noticing how perfectly round Lake Manicougan in Quebec is. Which took me down a Wikipedia white rabbit hole.</p></div>		</li>
