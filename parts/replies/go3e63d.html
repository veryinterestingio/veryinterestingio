			<div class="markdown"><p>It means you're looking for lots of loans, and people who are looking for lots of new credit are riskier than people who aren't. </p>
<p>Yes, it's a bit of a contradiction- you can only get loans if you don't need them- but that's the way the risk calculations work. But to expand on what /u/Some_Kind_of_Fan said about home loans: they don't penalize you for shopping around for a mortgage or car loan. If you request auto loan quotes from 6 different banks in a two week period, it gets treated the same as getting one quote when they calculate your credit score because the models assume you're only buying one car. Your score isn't going to be significantly lower at the sixth bank. The banks only really get worried if it looks like you're trying to take out a bunch of loans at once, like if you apply for an auto loan, a personal loan, and three new credit cards in quick succession.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, if you have four checks in a couple of days for a car loan, that's no big deal. If you have four checks now and then four more in a few months and then four more a few months later, that indicates a risk or someone who is prone to risk. These are all based on patterns of behavior. They set up an algorithm (really, many algorithms) that is meant to detect the type of behavior associated with someone who makes risky financial decisions. Seeking multiple types of credit or credit of the same type several times in a year is an indicator that this person might make risky decisions and might not be a great choice for a loan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I had thought, but when I bought a car August 2019, I applied at 5 loan places in 2 days. All the checks are on my credit score, and listed as different types of loan checks. Should I dispute the ones I didn't go with?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just look at it this way. You have a friend who asks you for money let's say $100. But you heard from multiple other friends that he asked them too to borrow money. You now have to question why does he ask so many people for money? Am I getting that money back when he asked so many people? The same question is asked by banks. He went to wells fargo, bank of america and local bank XY aleready?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has never made sense to me. They can see how many lines of credit you have, as well as your score and income. Why does it matter if you looked into other loans, but decided against them?</p></div>		</li>
