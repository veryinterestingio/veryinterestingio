			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question about a very difficult situation. Research shows that the likelihood of changing someone’s mind about vaccine acceptance is very hard- and there are a lot of psychological theories about why. For people in the vaccine denier (anti-vaxxer) category the probability has been found to be very low to zero when it comes to trying to change their minds. So the target audience for most physicians (and others interested in protecting public health) is the “general audience.”</p>
<p>We want to respond to social media posts and high-profile anti-vaxxer claims so that we keep the credible sources in the public discussion and keep science at the forefront. This has the effect of potentially changing the minds of people who are in the “hesitant” or vaccine “refuser” categories-- as the World Health Organization (WHO) stresses… by keeping our voices in the dialogue it makes the general public more resilient against anti-vaccine propaganda.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had some minor success with phrasing the information in a questioning way limits the combative attitude. Such as:
&quot;Vaccines have mercury in them&quot;
&quot;Oh? I read that they haven't contained thimerosal since 2012 (or whatever the date is), let me try to find some articles &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vaccines cause autism!&quot;
&quot;I heard the guy who made that study got in a lot of trouble for making up the results of that study. And luckily more studies have shown that it's not related&quot;</p>
<p>If there is a better way,  I'd love to know.</p></div>		</li>
