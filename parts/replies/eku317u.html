			<div class="markdown"><p>You are claiming as low a population as 2 million natives in North America as of what year? Before or after the waves of European disease swept through? It was likely way higher in 1491. </p>
<p>The more interesting question might be why so many more natives in what is now Mexico seem to have survived exposure to European diseases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Notice that only the 2 million figure is from a peer reviewed source, although it is also the oldest research. I haven't read any of the 3 myself, although I'm intrigued now. Even if 18 million were true, it's still less than half of the Latin America number. If it were that high there would have been empires approaching the size of the Aztec, but without major population centers, system of writing, and other expected evidence. Personally, I don't see 5-6 million Cherokee very probable unless, as you say, there was some huge difference in their susceptibility to disease, or other qualitative difference that made it so much of the population disappeared without war. To me, that just doesn't add up. Although I acknowledge a slim possibility, I prefer the figure of 2-7 million.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Animal husbandry is the answer to your question. I am being serious the domesticated turkey which was introduced to Europe via the Spanish from modern Mexico was the reason for the better survival rate. Societies that practice animal husbandry have better disease resistance due to exposure to animal diseases.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're on the right track as far as the connection between animal husbandry and the incidence of (and subsequent resistance to) plagues, but your immunology is off, and thus your argument is wrong.</p>
<p>You don't get a general resistance to plagues from animal husbandry. You get a resistance to an individual plague after a person, (or, eventually, a population) survives it. (Otherwise the more you got the common cold the less likely you'd be to get sick from anything in the future.) If the Aztec had done the same animal husbandry practices in large population centers that the Europeans had, the outcome would not have been better immune systems; the outcome would have been an American plague that would have infected and decimated the Europeans. There was none.</p>
<p>This video from CGP Grey does a good job of explaining it.</p>

<p>They neglected events such as the genocide at Huronia in 1649 by assorted Iroquois killing roughly 25-30000 which shifted perception as the few survivors sought the protection of the French and do not think on why different groups had such different reactions to disease. The answer is animal husbandry by the by those that practiced it had better resistance hence more survivors. To be blunt If their theory was correct the Mississippian culture would not have collapsed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read up on Huronia (1649), population shifts due to the fur trade, the Mississippian culture which contradicts their assumptions and the differences between cultures with animal husbandry and those that do not and you'll see this answer is wanting.</p></div>		</li>
