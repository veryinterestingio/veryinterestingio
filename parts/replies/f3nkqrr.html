			<div class="markdown"><p>People weighed coins in transactions all the time, and it was often common to cut precious coins into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>Coins were circular in ancient times, long before they replaced weighing completely. Not to mention it's not particularly harder to shave a circular coin than a non circular one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't cut the edges, you cut the length. </p>
<p>You can't just take a bit out a circle without it showing as a straight line on the edge, if you trim off a little bit of each side of a square it is still a square</p></div>		</li>
