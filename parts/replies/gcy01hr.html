Lots of tricks have been played in the quest to stuff more and more data into smaller and smaller spaces and that makes for lots of failure modes that happen long before the mechanicals on your drive (like the bearings) die.</p>
<p>For instance, data is stored as little charges on the magnetic surface and they've been smashed so closely together that the read/write head can only USUALLY tell the difference between a charge existing or not.  Extra, redundant, data is stored on the disk so the computer in your HDD can figure out what the data must have been.  Each hard disk is calibrated at the factory to figure out how close the data can be squished together on that particular HDD.  Unfortunately, the ability of the magnetic surface degrades over time, so your disk will get more and more errors over time.</p>
<p>Another place where your HDD dies over time is in optimizing the height of the read/write head over the disk surface (which is about the size of 3 oxygen molecules, BTW).  The head height is maintained, partially, by riding on a cushion of air.  Since air pressure changes with altitude, the disk has to alter the head height when altitude changes (if you take your laptop up in an airplane, for example).  It does this by reading a track of data that was written at the factory (at a known altitude) and comparing the strength of the data read to the calibrated read from the factory.  Again, the data degrades over time so the HDD's confidence in the data read from this track gets mushier and mushier over time until it becomes unreliable.  This happens after about 5 years.</p>

<p>I once saw it being compared with &quot;a needle stabbing through some self-sealing material (like rubber)&quot; - after ever so many stabs, it's just not going to be able to self-seal properly anymore, leading to leakage you described.</p></div>		</li>
