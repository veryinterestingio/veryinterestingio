			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty good explanation, but I would just touch on the actual <em>why</em>. The short answer is: genetics. </p>
<p>Typically when we think about genes, we tend to associate them with physical traits that we can see, such as scale pattern or beak length. However, behaviors can be heritable &amp; associated with genes as well. </p>
<p>Many behaviors are learned from parents, siblings, peers, and the environment. However others, such as the <em>instinct</em> to pester mom for some milk, can be passed down directly from ancestors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because behavior is just as physical as anything else really. When you get down to it, life is just applied chemistry.</p>
<p>Body chemistry creates urges like avoid the light or go to the light while rewarding desirable behaviour and punishing undesirable behaviour.</p>
<p>Selection for instinctive behaviour is no different than selection for physical traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I knew that some behavior has genetic reasons, but I never thought how it actually works. That means that the presense or absence of some proteins can direct our behavior, right? I cannot comprehend that. How does it pass that kind of information? Or is it determined in the neural connections formation and trimming?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Learned behaviors can also be passed on. Changes in behavior often are caused by environmental stresses, which can can turn genes on and off, and those genes then are passed onto offspring. That's why we think life-long athletes tend to have very physically active children, because their parent's environment has been very physically demanding to the point certain genes are turned on or off.</p>
<p>It's not that clear. Pestering mom for milk is a genetic behavior, but i think op was trying to explain how the reason you're likely to pester mom for milk is because your ancestral tree all pestered their moms for milk too. The infants that didnt pester their mom for milk had a higher probability of malnutrition and either didnt make it to adulthood or didn't have offspring nearly as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this epigenetics?</p>
<p>How are these genes turned on/off? And why does it also affect genes in egg/sperm cells and their child-cells? Is more than DNA replicated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it from a different perspective.  It isn't the sea they are attracted to per se rather that they are genetically predisposed to go that way.</p>
<p>It may be that their body chemistry reacts to a smell, a temperature or a sound that pulls them in that direction and the sea generates that thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of sea turtles, theyâ€™re drawn to light. For millennia, at the beaches on which they hatched the land side was completely dark (no human habitation, no artificial lighting), but the sea side had starlight.</p>
<p>Once humans came along and started adding artificial lights, they started interfering with that instinct. Seaside communities have finally started instituting laws to limits artificial light during turtle hatching season.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not as literal as preferring the sea. If you touch a hot pot, your nerves will send a signal to your brain that you are incurring damage. Your brain presents that signal to you as pain. Pain is experienced as unpleasant and as a result you will do just about anything to avoid pain.</p>
<p>Your brain can't force you to understand abstract concepts like &quot;damaging your body is bad&quot; or &quot;reproduction is really important&quot;. But it can alter your perception, for instance by making you feel something unpleasant like pain or fear or something good like pleasure or contentment. </p>
<p>Along the same lines, you can't genetically encode the idea that the ocean is safe. But you can certainly genetically encode a strong preference for certain sensory cues. In the case of turtles, in the period after hatching they move towards the brightest thing they can see. Since they're flat against the ground, the ocean horizon will always be brighter than the dunes behind them.</p>
<p>And it's important to remember that evolution doesn't set a goal first. It's just that the turtles that were attracted strongly to something that increased their odds of survival were the ones that reproduced.</p>
<p>A lot of behaviours have very simple solutions. A buried seed will sprout against gravity to find the surface and grow into the sun. A roach seeks darkness because it's safer than light and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understood it, sea turtles instinct is to head towards the light.  The bright moon at the time of hatching happens to be over the ocean where they belong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most do hatch at night.  At least they do in my part of the country.  The turtles hatch and wait for the cooling of the sand.  I've watched nests make a break for it no earlier than 10pm and no later than 7am.  The only daytime hatchlings I've experienced are from human interaction (digging) or stragglers.  Also to add if you put a flashlight on the ground even as close but opposite of the water the turtles crawl to it turning away from the water.  Full moon nights  have the greatest activity for both nesting and hatching.</p></div>		</li>
