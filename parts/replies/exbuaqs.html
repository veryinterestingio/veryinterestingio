			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly a movie trope except in very specific circumstances.</p>
<p>I have seen comatose patients recover when their coma was due to profoundly low blood sugar. That's a problem that causes brain cells to stop working (no fuel). It can develop very quickly, and if corrected quickly enough, then most of the brain cells don't spend enough time starving to actually die. So the person can &quot;come back&quot; without losing brain function. This happens in a matter of minutes to hours, though - not really the story told in fictional media.</p>
<p>When a coma is due to traumatic injury, sometimes the problem stopping the ARAS or the cortex (or both) from working is just pressure from the swelling. Again, if that pressure is severe and prolonged enough, brain cells will just die and never recover. But if the pressure and the amount of permanent damage isn't too severe, then once the swelling goes down, a person's brain function may improve enough to allow them to wake up again. Typically this comes with lasting neurologic deficits affecting anything from speech, language, motor function, sensation, memory, and/or cognitive ability. If it's going to happen, it'll happen in the first 2-6 weeks - after then you'd expect the swelling to have resolved, and whatever brain injury remains is the more-or-less permanent state of things.</p>
<p>There are very rare cases of people waking up after over a month or two - more like the Hollywood stories. These are cases where a person had severe permanent injury, but the brain was able to recover very slowly by mechanisms we don't yet understand. Some theories include the regeneration of dead neurons, generation of new neurons, or rewiring of existing living neurons to serve the functions of the dead ones. It's extremely rare, and the patients in these cases don't wake up to anywhere near their previous level of functioning - they have multiple very severe neurologic deficits, not to mention severe muscle wasting and loss of stamina due to their complete inactivity. Also typically happens within the first 6 months if it is going to happen. Outside of maybe a handful of people in the history of the world, stories of people waking up after over a year are purely fictional.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could some of them have been inspired by people with locked-in syndrome rather than true comas? It's only recently that we've been able to distinguish the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically the brain has enough plasticity to recover from almost anything but you would need a very detailed map of brain activations for specific tasks for every person and even medical imaging isn't advanced enough to make these (for example the time it takes for an MRI scanner to record the entirety of a brain is ~3 seconds so good luck getting something as quick as recognizing a face) you would also have to &quot;train&quot; the brain to work around the permanent damage which is impossible because you would need a theoretical model and computer simulations of an entire brain to map out the &quot;alternative routes&quot; but I'd say with the advances in theoretical/computational neuroscience (example: blue brain) it'll eventually become possible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It happens, but not often.  Neurons always try to regrow, but there are molecules in the brain that stop them, especially one discovered at Yale called nogo, by Stephen Stritmatter.  One in a million neurons can find a way to make it back to the place in the brain where they need to be in order to function.  If that happens ten times after your reticular neurons have been damaged, you're set. It may be easier to win the lottery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very informative, thank you. If a coma is caused by the ARAS not working or the cerebral cortex being damaged, how does a medically-induced coma work? Is it us filling the ARAS with a suppressant of some kind?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion, &quot;medically induced coma&quot; is a kind of misleading and confusing term, since &quot;coma&quot; is technically a specific word for a specific disease state. I prefer to use &quot;deep sedation&quot; for the practice of keeping someone unconscious with medications.</p>
<p>But - yes - the drugs used to accomplish this type of sedation, in the amounts used, inhibit the ARAS and the cortex. You could think of them as holding down the off switch and (temporarily) gumming up the machinery. As soon as you remove the drugs from the system, the brain can gradually get back to running at its full capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! That make sense regarding the term we use. Shouldn’t we know an approximation of when a patient will wake up from that deep sedation given we have a general idea of when the drugs wear off? I’ve always heard (from tv shows mainly) that we don’t know when a patient will wake up from a “medically-Induced coma”. Is this just an example of how we really don’t know much about the brain so we don’t know when the brain will “turn itself back on”?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read several accounts of the experience of a medically induced coma from many different people who have undergone the experience. It can be very unsettling to hear what it's like. One particular dude said he lived out many years of an entirely different life while under, and it was unbelievably detailed and life like. He was shattered when he was brought out of it as he was living a very peaceful and serene existence while under. It took him long time to come to grips with his new reality. </p>
<p>Many have also said it can take a while just to relearn how to talk and comprehend langauge again among other things. What a trip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn’t make any sense to me... needing sleep to live, why? Do we work our cells that hard that they need 8 hours of rest to repair and recuperate? Why do we need to sleep?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't entirely follow logic for me, because in theory without modern medicine, one needs consciousness in order to live too, yet comas are still a thing that happen. The necessity of something functioning for continuing life doesn't mean that it can't stop functioning due to trauma or illness. Non-functional body systems that cause death do happen. Sorry for the long explanation of my logic, I'm finding my thoughts somewhat hard to explain clearly. </p>
<p>It's definitely interesting that it seems like the on/off switch can only be damaged into staying in one particular direction.</p></div>		</li>
