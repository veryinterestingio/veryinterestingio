			<div class="markdown"><p>While true, the ob gene that causes leptin deficiency is not a primary cause of obesity. In animal trials with the ob mutation, leptin injection causes the animals to lose weight. Leptin injections do not however work as treatments for obesity in humans. Leptin resistance is the main thing.</p></div>		</li>
