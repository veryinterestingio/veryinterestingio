<p>I go to the gym 5 days a week and I’m very set in my ways once I’m there. I do my cardio, so my work out, then do the sauna, hot tub, salt water pool, steam room, regular pool. </p>
<p>Some days, the sauna and steam room and hot tub seem much hotter to me and other days Im very comfortable in it. I’m fairly certain the staff isn’t in there randomly and without any rhyme or reason fluctuating the controls every other day.</p></div>		</li>
