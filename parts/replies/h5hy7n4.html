			<div class="markdown"><p>no, because if you get there slowly, your baseline had more time to burn more calories.</p>
<p>edit: you guys are right...baseline doesn't matter for the weight-loss. I was thinking of it as a mathematical problem as in calories per distance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but it would have done that even if you never went for the walk. The reason people ask about questions like this is to figure out how much extra energy running and walking respectively burns.</p>
<p>It's like saying eating a big Mac is less energy if you eat it slower, because your base metabolism will simultaneously be burning energy. It's not a relavant way to compare stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Baseline: 100</p>
</li>
<li>Waking: 200</li>
</ul>
<p>You run one mile:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Baseline: 100</p>
</li>
<li>Running: 400</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you get there twice as fast running, your Baseline keeps consuming the same amount throughout the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really a matter of definition, and what definition we should use depends on the purpose of our calculation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If we're trying to figure out a way to burn calories, i.e. to lose weight, we're only interested in the energy consumption on top of Base Metabolic Rate, that is how effective our workout was as a means to lose weight. The effectiveness of our workout clearly wouldn't increase if we stopped, laid on the ground for 2 hours then resumed the workout. </p>
</li>
<li>If we're stocking supplies to travel, we'd look at total energy required to get from point A to B, and BMR would of course have to be accounted for. If a course takes us 2 weeks running or 4 weeks walking, of course we'll need more food if we walk. </li>
</ul>
<p>Since the first scenario is more likely to be the reason for OP's question (especially given the &quot;1 mile&quot; assumption), I suggest we ignore BMR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100-200 would make that 1200-2400kcal. Take into consideration that the BMR of a normal male person can be 2000-2500 kcal a day it doesn't sound unreasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on body size, and you’d be hard pressed to find someone who stands stationary for 12 hours (that would literally be torture). As a person below stated the range was 100-200 so the calories burned would be between 1,200 and 2,400.  Which sounds about right (assuming the person at the 200 end was a large person like 6’3 225lbs or bigger). </p>
<p>Just being alive requires calories which we all know. If you were in a coma and didn’t move, you’d still need nutrition because your body needs that to perform the basic functions of breathing, flowing blood, ect... </p>
<p>So the whole 2,000 calorie a day thing is based on the average person burns 2,000 calories a day from just existing. It’s pretty crazy to think about honestly, and that’s why your diet is so important when it comes to having a healthy BMI. You can run for an hour and burn around 400-700 calories depending on how hard you exercise which isn’t very much considering how much you burn by just doing day to day stuff. It’s much easier to avoid that dessert than to “work it off”. </p>
<p>I used to be really into body building. When it was “cutting season” and I was restricting my calories I always used that mentality. “So I’m only eating 3,000 calories per day (I’m a big dude). I can enjoy that ice cream but it will push me over my 3,000 calories and fuck up my metrics. I can eat that ice cream, but to not derail my progress I’ll have to spend an hour tomorrow doing cardio to burn it off... it’s 100% not worth it” and I’d skip the dessert. During bulking season I ate extra deserts lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if anyone else is a little confused like me-- multiple people responded to you with 100-200 per hour = 1200 -2400. But my interpretation of your question was: &quot;Someone standing stationary for 12 hours a day as part of their job requires up to 2400 kcal <strong>per day</strong> to maintain their weight?&quot;-- wouldn't the range be more like 100-200 per hour = (100 * 24 = 2400) - (200 * 24= 4800)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that figure is way too high, more like 50-85 kcal/hour is typical for most people's BMR (1200-2000 kcal per day).</p>
<p>Obviously there will be outliers.</p></div>		</li>
