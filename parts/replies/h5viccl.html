			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't believe this is so far down in the comments, lol. Everyone's popping off about borrowing against stock and whatnot, but Occam's Razor here is that if you own a buncha shit, you get a buncha dividends, and that's not the same as salary, lmao. </p>
<p>And if you own a buncha shit (and run your books) through offshore entities, it's easier to avoid paying taxes on those dividends and whatnot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure about US income tax, but here in the UK high earners are taxed 50%
Company dividends are taxed at 20%
Hence why company directors are paid £10k pa but get Millions in dividends</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably a stupid question for you but, do dividends play as big of a role in investments, if the shares someone owns in a dividend-paying company are low? I know dividends play a huge part in larger investments but what about small?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, especially if you reinvest the dividends, your portfolio starts to compound and you get more dividends in return as you continue to grow your small account. If you could get enough in a small account you could allow the dividends to be paid out to you and have a cash flow as you would working at a job. The higher your account the more in dividends you gain (to either use or reinvest)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dividends are essentially a forced stock sale. When dividends are paid out, the stock price drops by the equivalent amount. So it's usually irrelevant except for tax purposes, where generally it's bad since you will have to pay taxes on those dividends whether you reinvest them or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a core part of FIRE and of compounding interest.</p>
<p>Even 10,000 gives 600 bucks a year at 6% interest. Its money you are ensuring againts inflation and earning returns. You could (in theory) liquidate it in 2 weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no application of Occam's Razor here. There is plenty written about high networth individuals, their money managers, and the strategies they concoct to spend money without affecting their businesses/assets, while lowering their tax burden, and preserving/growing generational wealth. Borrowing against appreciating assets is a classic strategy here and considerably more favorable than anything you specified from both tax and wealth accumulation perspectives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've known a couple CEOs of smaller companies (still multi millionaires) and I did some accounting for them. </p>
<p>You'd be surprised how much stuff gets paid for by the company and written off as an expense. Both owners I knew had &quot;company cars&quot; and had to minimally drive anywhere for work. Also almost all meals were ordered out and written off as business meeting expenses. </p>
<p>Obviously it's not paying the rent or anything but if your car, gas, food is all being paid for by the company, it sure does leave a lot of extra spending money from their salaries on the table.</p>
<p>Also the guy &quot;ran&quot; his company out of Texas and claimed residency there, so no state income tax. It was really his vacation home and he resided in a state that definitely had a bunch of state taxes.</p></div>		</li>
