			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is a great post but i wanted to clarify one thing. Part of the reason cellulose fibers will link up like tangled hair is because they interact through hydrogen bonds that form between the surface of fibers. Water can infiltrate the paper through capillary action through the hollow space within the fibers like you said, but what actually cripples the structural integrity of the paper is the water disrupting the hydrogen bonds between fibers.</p>
<p>So it‚Äôs not necessarily that water forces the fibers apart, but more that it eliminates the forces holding them together.</p>
<p>I hate being particular but I‚Äôm currently writing my dissertation on cellulose solutions and nanomaterials so I felt I should interject. Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the cellulose nanomaterials I‚Äôve worked with are treated to have a surface charge (this is part of the process for making them). In this case, the water infiltrates the cellulose through hydrogen bonding but activates the charged groups in the process, which DOES force the cellulose apart since the charges will repel fibers away from each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I did research studying the TEMPO Oxidation process to create indivudualized suspensions of nanofibrillated cellulose. At this point it‚Äôs the most elementary structure present in wood, 2-3 nm diameters and lengths of hundreds of nms.</p>
<p>After that I worked on cellulose solutions in ionic liquids, and then created self-reinforcing all-cellulose nanocomposites by combining them together. The cellulose regenerated from ionic liquid solutions is amorphous and doesn‚Äôt absorb water, so it can act as a waterproofing agent for the nanofibers in the composite and prevent them from weakening when exposed to water.</p></div>		</li>
