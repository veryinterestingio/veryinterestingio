			<div class="markdown"><p>All of these points, plus have something a bit fatty/greasy to eat before you finally go to bed.</p>
<p>Obviously this depends on how trashed you are. Don't force yourself to eat if you know you're just going to throw up.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;a bit fatty/greasy&quot; doesn't mean &quot;eat a pile of lard&quot;, just have something with some oils or fats in it, and don't be afraid of a little salt.</p>
<p>Water is still way more important though, if nothing else, drink a ton of water. Bring a big bottle to the bedroom and put it on your night table. Do this before you even drink, and your drunk self will bless St. SoberYou when the 3 AM sandpaper mouth strikes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, maybe just drink less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find drinking over the day a large amount can be totally fine. Slow and steady and long before you go to bed your body has already processed two thirds of it, and doesn't get overloaded. </p>
<p>Timing to not ruin sleep, pacing, and water make all the difference.</p></div>		</li>
