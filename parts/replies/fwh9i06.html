			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically if you had 100% efficient solar panels coupled with superconductor materials, you could technically coat the earth in solar panels and transform all the solar energy hitting the earth into electrical energy instead of heat. But it is just not practical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could use the solar panels to power lasers or just lights that shine into space carrying the energy away.  Not exactly practical though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you would still just be trapping the energy here. you would need a way to store it or transport it out of the atmosphere. there are ways to do that, but it's more efficient to harness it before it gets here. You would need much less material to get that energy at the L1 Lagrange point even considering launch costs, considering 50% of the solar panels on the surface would be completely worthless 100% of the time.</p></div>		</li>
