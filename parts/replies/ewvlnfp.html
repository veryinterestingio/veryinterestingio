			<div class="markdown"><p>Whether you're talking about a recession or a stock market crash, you need to have some indicators and data people are looking at as well, not just predictors. </p>
<p>Let's say people are buying fewer expensive cars. Car makers in Germany see sales decrease, and so they reduce investments and earnings. This expands to other industries causing knock-on effects. Pretty soon the entire German economy is contracting just a little bit.</p>
<p>That's data that people notice. Now two things happen: analysts see this and say there will be a recession and people sell off stocks. Stock market dives yes, because people said there would be a recession, but also because of the data.</p>
<p>Also, and much more importantly, based on that data companies around the world that are planning how many things to make and people to hire decide to hire nobody and make fewer things. This makes the recession worse.</p>
<p>So in a real sense the perception that a recession is coming does make a recession happen faster, and the perception of growth fuels hiring and growth. </p>
<p>But there are also fundamentals at work. Why are all those people buying fewer expensive cars in the first place? Maybe everybody was buying on credit and now they've run out of credit. That's very bad. Maybe there was a surge in growth two years ago and people bought cara then, don't need one now. Maybe taxes are going up, or tariffs are driving up prices, or a plant just closed down and people are worried about their jobs. Each recession is different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in essence. A recession is a traffic jam on the highway, caused by to many people breaking hard because they saw someone ahead breaking, causing those in back to break harder.<br />
Until you have a mile back, traffic at a stand still and trickling at a quarter speed because the lanes of traffic must now expand for everyone to get back into the flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and the economy/market/stock  is basically  a traffic jam spiral going in waves up and down</p>
<p>Since most  want to overtake the one in front who are slower, and the one that goes fast eventually slow down for one reason or another</p>
<p>Any small event, wind, clouding, birds etc can cause a driver to slow down suddenly making a cascade effect back creating the traffic jam, same for market, ppl what to sell at high and buy back at low, and when they start to sell the high other see them selling and they also start to sell causing a cascade of crash in pricing of those auctions/bonds etc </p>
<p>Some &quot;cars&quot; simply crash others slow down, others go in pause zone, but the flow goes on, unless something massive happens, but then eventually it get back again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but another important part is how low the market dips. When people are selling, there's always someone else buying. They are buying at a price that they believe is a good value. Just because there's an initial sell off, doesn't mean that it will form into an avalanche.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but it can dip 500 pts and come right back. If it's a consistent drop off over a week, then I'll worry. One or two days is nothing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>True, but one side is a limit order, meaning &quot;I will buy/sell at X dollars and won't take a worse deal than that&quot; and the other is a market order meaning &quot;I will buy/sell at whatever the going rate is.&quot;  Market orders fill limit orders, most favorable first.</p>
<p>When somebody says &quot;Everybody is selling&quot; they're talking about market orders.  This will crash the price because all that will be left are the less favorable (meaning lower priced) buy orders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s self-equlizing though. If “people” panic sell and there are still enough buyers on the market to sustain it, then other buyers just pick up the shares and the market ownership just shifts around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. I can see how a prediction triggers a sell-off, but if that prediction doesn't have anything behind it, that sell-off isn't going to turn into a recession. I would have to say that it <em>can't</em> start a recession alone. It probably can't even start a correction on its own. But sell-off? Absolutely.</p></div>		</li>
