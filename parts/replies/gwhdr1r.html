			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with HD radio (I think) and anything played of your phone (Spotify/Pandora) that isn't already downloaded. Basically if what you're listening to hard cuts in and out, it's probably digital and very likely to be buffering. If there's a period of extreme static as it transitions in and out it's probably analog and not buffered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a spot where I drive sometimes where there is always a dropout for Sirius XM, I've always wondered if the actual dropout was before that or actually there. It is weird, it is very consistent. I don't have that issue at that spot for FM or cellular phone. It is open to the sky, though partially blocked to the south by a concrete wall. But the wall goes for about a mile, but the dropout for only a few hundred yards.  I'm thinking someone has a strong broadcast on the other side of the wall, but I don't really know. It is residential houses on the other side of the wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s usually only blocked by a wall/roof made of concrete and metal. I drive under a highway overpass pretty regularly, it’s only about 25 feet, but the traffic is usually moving slowly enough that it almost always drops out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is like 200 yards (maybe more but less that 400 yards) past a short tunnel. Going full speed, that would be 6-10 second after clearing the tunnel. Now that I think about it, there dropout send like it is roughly the same amount of time as going through the tunnel, even though it is delayed.</p>
<p>There's too much traffic there (freeway to freeway exit) or I'd try going slower through the tunnel and seeing if that changed where I got the dropout, and the duration of it. I don't think I could slow down enough to notice the difference without getting rear ended. But I bet that tunnel is the cause of the drop out, it just isn't obvious due to the buffering the radio does. I'd probably immediately get the connection between the tunnel and the drop out if the tunnel were 2-3 times longer than it is.</p></div>		</li>
