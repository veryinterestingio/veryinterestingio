			<div class="markdown"><p>Psychology. Doubling the price, would likely lead to people using even less again, as they feel the need to &quot;make it last&quot; due to the cost. Making it cheaper but getting them to use twice as much, means they think about the cost less than how fast it gets used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May not be your case, but check your water hardness. Soap binds to calcium or magnesium carbonate first to form soap scum, less available to wash your clothes.</p>
<p>If you have very &quot;soft&quot; water, you will need very little soap and it will often feel slimy in the shower like you can't rinse the soap out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if you have average city / well water, water softeners often make the water feel worse, and are just another thing to maintain.  But try living with a well that produces slimy-feeling, stinking water that basically instantly turns any soap into scum, and you'll understand why people install huge, expensive filtration systems in their basement.  Super-hard water is way worse than super soft water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like powdered detergent and I pitch the monster scoops they pack with them. You know those little medicine cups that come with a bottle of cough syrup? Yeah I scoop out two of those full of detergent. Works a treat. More than that is just a waste!</p></div>		</li>
