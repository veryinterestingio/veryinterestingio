			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally important is that they are designed to keep intact while penetrating through large amounts of concrete without breaking apart with the delay being set based on what distance they are expected to require traveling through. A bomb for use against surface targets would have a fuse to either detonate at a very shallow penetration or once it reached a certain distance from the ground to prevent over penning their target or digging themselves into the dirt if used against surface targets.</p>
<p>Their design, however costs them significantly in terms of explosive payload in terms of both size and weight compared to thinner walled bombs.</p>
<p>In general, its is greatly preferable to not have explosives that can be easily detonated by shock or impact and all bombs in military use will rely on a fuse device. There are a few fuseless designs, but only for projectiles too small to fit a proper fuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid chunks of tungsten and depleted uranium stay pretty intact. Bunker busting bombs are primarily kinetic weapons with only a small amount (relative to conventional bombs) of explosive, because once you're in the bunker there isnt anywhere for the explosion to go so it's really good at breaking all the stuff inside the bunker when the small bomb goes off. Also you make the bomb long and skinny so it doesn't have to move as much material out of the way before it explodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose my confusion comes from picturing an &quot;active&quot; trigger like an electronic signal transmitting along a wire and setting the fuse, which seems like it would potentially break upon the initial impact before the signal is sent. </p>
<p>Do these utilize a more passive mechanical method like two metals being smashed together in a controlled manner in order to trigger the reaction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this the electronics have to be encased in epoxy and the IC chips broken up into their individual components that are then placed through different layers of the circuit board where a robot connects them back together with tiny thin gold wire. Essentially, all the chips you'd normally see on a circuit board had to be placed WITHIN the curcuit board to make sure they didn't shear off. That board then has to be encased in epoxy so it doesn't stop when the bomb keeps going. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know what materials they use to facilitate this? The impact forces have to be absolutely incredible, and any survival of electronics seems like it would have to be insanely durable. Past that, I feel like they'd need to be really reliable, as we wouldn't want technology like that dropped into enemy fortifications just so it can survive for research. I have so many questions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its designed to pierce the earth with thick wall casings and the required electronics for after initial impact are minimal. As for fuses, there is already a long line of choices to choose from as APHE projectiles have been around for a long time with often similar considerations.</p>
<p>A fuse for instance that would require no exterior elements would be an inertia fused that arms based on the felt impact and slow down of a projectile. This fuse can be entirely mechanical, as can the delay mechanism.</p></div>		</li>
