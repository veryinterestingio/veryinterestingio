<p>I dont really know how true it is that we store years worth of B12, but it can easily be true that our bodies store B12 and nitrous oxide causes deficiencies. It doesnt matter how much B12 you have in your body, if the enzymes that process it are all inhibited, you will not get any B12 where you need it, and you will have all of the symptoms of vitamin deficiency.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true.</p>
<p>What you're probably not accounting for is that b12 deficiencies - or at least levels that are pretty close to deficient - are actually surprisingly common, and can get <em>very</em> common in certain geographic areas. So if you have a lot of people who are <em>borderline</em> deficient, and then you add another factor that inclines them towards deficiency... You'll end up with a lot of deficient people.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its true. The liver stores 3-4 years worth of B12. Many people may not get enough in their diet though because it mostly comes from animal products, which if combined with another risk factor like taking nitrous, can cause a deficiency. </p></div>		</li>
