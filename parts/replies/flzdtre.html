			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a cool fact, certain steps in animal evolutionary history could have been attributed to infections of benign or beneficial organisms. Take bacteria for example, for all we know certain kinds of bacteria that grow and reproduce in our gut heavily altered how humans evolved or survive over the millennia. </p>
<p>Our gut has trillions of bacteria and the majority of these play an essential role in digestion, without them we could have a hard time staying nutritionally healthy. There was a study that showed the growth of baby chickens who were sterilized of most of their gut microbiology along
with being fed sterile food. While the chicks did not die and continued to develop the study showed that they had, to a degree, stunted growth and weakness. </p>
<p>Bacteria are their own organisms that live their lives like the trillions of other animals on this planet. Yet they share our bodies and reproduce within our gut. It's like we are a huge vessel that operates by the combined efforts if countless amounts of organisms within a sack of flesh. Research the term holobiont for further info.</p>
<p>EDIT: removed a part describing bacteria as animals.</p></div>		</li>

It’s basically like another organ made of other organisms. We’ve barely scratched the surface of how it impacts human health and development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you think about it, it makes a lot of evolutionary sense to give your host little to no symptoms. A slightly runny nose, an occasional sneeze - no one would really notice that. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein–Barr_virus" target="_blank">EBV</a> Can be like this in many people. It wouldn’t kill the host. This gives said virus plenty of opportunity to spread. Combine that with the fact that few scientists are looking for viruses that do virtually nothing (when they could be studying high impact viruses, or viruses that can be repurposed), it’s probably very highly likely there are tons of viruses that can exist like this. </p>
<p>Sure, the immune system exists, but the immune system isn’t <em>perfect</em>.</p></div>		</li>

And viruses can't multiply on their own, they have to infect a living cell.<br />
The body tries to notice that sort of thing.  </p>
<p>Bacteria can do it, we have assimilated plenty of those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't remember where I read it but I recall someone saying that the ultimate end goal of all viruses/diseases is to evolve into a form that co-exists with its host.  The analogy I use is imagining if the Earth was the body, and humans were the virus.  If humans could learn not to destroy their own body, they'd live longer and be able to pass on/exchange their genetic material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no goal. The ones that end up existing are the ones that are most suited to... continue existing. A very contagious virus that doesn’t hurt the host would probably spread really well so it will persist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite what they were asking about. They were asking about viruses that directly attack (i.e. parasitise) other viruses, while malaria treating syphilis is because of the body's reaction to the malaria. For the record, malarial plasmodium isn't even a virus, it's a... well, it's plasmodium. Doesn't really have an overarching name, but it's eukaryotic, so pretty far removed from viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  They are called virophages. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virophage" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virophage</a></p>
<p>They can only reproduce if they infect a cell infected by another specific virus.  Then they co-opt the virus factory that virus has made to make more of themselves.</p>
<p>There probably isn't one for covid though, they are only known for a few large viruses.</p></div>		</li>
