			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It's not at all intuitive but <del>general</del>special relativity comes into play here. Assuming that I did the math right for the Lorentz Transformation, the following should be true.</p>
<p>From the perspective of one of the spaceships, it is moving away from the earth at 0.51c. The other spaceship is moving away at (0.51c + 0.51c) / (1 + 0.51<strong>^(2)</strong>) = 0.809c.</p>
<p>If the other spaceship was moving away from the earth at 0.99c, it would look like 0.997c from perspective of the first spaceship moving away from the earth at 0.51c in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The speed of light <em>always</em> is the same regardless of the reference frame and it is an asymptotic speed limit.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also helpful to note that the Lorentz transformation can be applied to more mundane speeds like 1 m/s. You'll note, however, that at such low speeds, the modification from the equation becomes insignificant (the denominator is super close to 1c) and you're back to Newtonian relativity.</p>
<p>Let's say that you're driving away at 3 m/s from a friend who's driving at 3 m/s. That's roughly 10^-8 c so the equation becomes</p>
<p>[(10^-8 c) + (10^-8 c)]/[1 + (10^-8 )^2 ] </p>
<p>But 1+ (10^-8 )^2 is just 1.0000000000000001 which might as well just be 1 at that point so you end up with:</p>
<p>[(10^-8 c) + (10^-8 c)]/[1]</p>
<p>So you're back to just adding up the speeds like you would normally think. Relative to each other you are traveling at 6 m/s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is hard to explain though. OP just kinda did a hand wavy thing by applying the Lorentz Transformation without explaining what that really is. I’m not saying OP is wrong, just that most people reading that won’t really understand, except they’ll know there’s something called a Lorentz Transformation which is like a magic wand.</p>
<p>*For those who are curious, here's a cool <a href="https://youtu.be/Rh0pYtQG5wI" target="_blank">minutephysics video</a> that will give you some degree of intuition - though it is a 12 minute long minute physics video, so you know it's not going to be super simple, but it is cool!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While what you have calculated is true; you did special relativity; not general relativity.</p>
<p>Special relativity: Clocks are slowed down and meter sticks are shortened if something is moving with respect to you.</p>
<p>General relativity: You can't separate acceleration from gravity; hence gravity also affects light and stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is: no, you can't naively add velocities that big.</p>
<p>You need a bit more fancy formula: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula</a></p>
<p>This was known since around 1895 (and since 1851 for light), but in 1905 the famous Einstein put everything in place and explained how cometh so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're running really fast, and someone is running by your side at exactly same velocity, it seems like you both arr not moving at all, relatively to each other. For exemple, you and the passenger by your side, in an airplane.</p>
<p>There's an exception. For some reason, if the passenger by your side is actually a beam of light, it doesn't matter how fast you move: if you try to measure the speed of light, light will always, always have the exact same velocity. Always.</p>
<p>If you keep studying the consequences of this non intuitive fact, lots of weird things happens. Those weird things are called relativistic effects (and the relativity in this context, is the Einstein's one).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time mixes together with space into something called “spacetime”. It doesn't mix in a familiar way, though: time mixes in in a sort of “inverted” way. When you're going really fast, you're sort of “leaning into” the time dimension, and away from space dimensions.</p>
<p>For space, that makes other objects contract—they literally get shorter in the direction of travel.</p>
<p>For time, this is where its “inverted” relation comes in. You get <em>less</em> time when you “lean towards time”. In intuitive geometry, equal distances from a point form a sphere. In Lorentzian geometry (i.e. the geometry of spacetime), equal <em>spacetime</em> distances form a shape called a “hyperboloid”, which looks like two infinitely long cones which almost touch at their tips, except the tips are rounded off.</p>
<p>The observer is at the point where the rounded-off cones <em>would</em> meet. One cone stretches into the future, the other into the past.</p>
<p>I don't think this is coming across in words. You can find some great videos on YouTube that give a better geometric intuition for Special Relativity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If two cars drive towards each other each of them with a speed a little bit above the speed of light, does that mean one has superluminal velocity with respect to the other one?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah I thought I was smart and had no idea.  The universe should is fucking crazy.  I still maintain our human brains are just simply incapable of understanding it at an intuitive level.  Same as how a garden snake doesn't know how Javascript works. </p>
<p>However, it just may be possible that through mathematics and science we can build a reasonable approximation of something like a unified theory that allows us to come as close we possibly to an understanding of the nature of the universe.  I kind of doubt it though. I fear we are much more like the garden snake than we want to admit when it comes to such topics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it's not that hard. When we are born, we don't realize that the object still exists and can reappear after being hidden. We don't understand that if dad puts a toy in a box, we can look into the box and find the toy there.</p>
<p>We learn all of what is &quot;common sense&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; within few years of our lives. We get used that putting something in a box means the object is in the box. And just as well we can get used to special relativity. Within a year.</p></div>		</li>
