			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  What his explanation is missing is that you need to clean out the byproducts of reactions in the brain (from consuming energy, for instance).  The brain doesnt just eat glucose whole.  It breaks it down and eats some and creates waste with the rest.  That waste needs to be cleaned out (during sleep, mostly).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it isn't so simple. 10 billion individual neurons each need varying amounts of that glucose. Our blood is well suited to this task, but there are limits to how quickly it can be delivered. Nothing so crude or macroscopic as a steel needle full of nutrient solution can really assist this process, unless the patient in question has low blood sugar to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So induce the worst to achieve the best with a 2 part solution of first insulin followed by glucose. I know its far more complicated that anything said so far but at times I'm willing to try anything no matter the risk so long as it relieves the pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a diabetic, I can tell you it's unfortunately not helpful. Too much glucose can also have a detrimental effect on your brain function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, it is safe to assume that (absent any disease) your body is as efficient as it is going to get. Of course there are gains to be had from losing weight and improving fitness, but in terms of messing with your blood composition it's probably the case that evolution has already tried having more or less sugar available in the blood and it turns out that this did not confer an any overall advantage.</p>
<p>You are extremely fine tuned by evolution and your body puts loads of effort into maintaining all sorts of things like the pH of your blood, water, salt, sugar and oxygen levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, evolution's goal is to keep doing whatever works, not what we find ideal. Since being smarter or stronger is only selected for when it outweighs the costs vs their benefits, I wonder what we'd be like if we historically had way more food available. Though I suppose this would apply to every animal, and it'd probably just cancel out!</p></div>		</li>
