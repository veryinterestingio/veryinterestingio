You don't have to wait for the bolt to go back and then forward again, because while the bolt on one barrel is going back another is going forward already in a different barrel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. As each barrel reaches say top dead center they fire. But while that one up top is firing, the one after it is dropping out a cartridge, and the one before it is just finishing up securing the bolt in place, while the one before *that is just getting a new round in place, so on so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah and since the mechanisms for each barrel aren't using springs like conventional weapons but are being moved back and forth forcefully by the system itself since it's motorized, it helps achieve that insane fire rate, that's a pretty important tidbit.</p></div>		</li>
