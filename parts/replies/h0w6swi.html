			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually alcohol is one of the very few things that can be absorbed directly in the stomach. Its chemical structure lets it get passively absorbed through the stomach lining. Most of it does get absorbed in the intestines however, and your basic idea is right in both the stomach and the intestines. More stuff in the way means less contact with the stomach lining and slower movement to the intestines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep alcohol actually starts being absorbed while it's in your mouth.  It passes readily through most tissues in the body.  The stomach puts up quite a defense (constant mucous secretion pushing the alcohol away) so it's probably a bit slower than other tissues though.</p></div>		</li>
