<p>My area will get NBN (our fibre network) mid 2018...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep it sucks that most places are getting FTTN or even hybrid. I just hope if I get FTTN that our existing copper cables are not damaged as they are 13 years old compared to old suburbs. (I still know fibre to copper has a decrease in speed anyway).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah you're right. I looked it up and, as of 2015, USA ranked 14th in the world in average connection speed. Still, not a bad ranking at all but you'd definitely expect better.</p>
<p>Australia was ranked 31st, though. Even Thailand was 29th</p></div>		</li>
