			<div class="markdown"><p>The barycentre is just the name given to the centre of mass of a system. It's not some third (or Nth+1) object that controls the motion of the things in the system. The star and planets <em>create</em> the barycentre by having mass, and the barycentre sits closest to the centre of mass of the most massive single object in the system just by virtue of how averages work.</p>
<p>It's like balancing a baseball bat on your finger: The balancing point is the point at which the two ends will balance, but it is not like there's some special thing that lives at that point that determines that that is where the balance is achieved.  That point is going to lie closer to the head of the bat simply by virtue of there being <em>more bat</em> there. And if the head of the bat is <em>exceptionally</em> heavy, the balancing point can actually be right near the very end.</p>
<p>The barycentre is, quite literally, the balancing point of an orbiting system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I see. You pinpointed what I misunderstood about it. I thought it was a force or a location in and of itself that had an effect on other massive objects. So it’s a result really, rather than a force? Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>It is, to repeat myself, quite literally the balancing point of the system. The center of mass. So, to apply it to your later question: If you remove the star from the system, you remove a <em>huge</em> chunk of the mass. <em>A</em> barycentre will still exist after that, just like there will still be <em>a</em> balancing point on the baseball bat if you were to saw the head off, but it wouldn't be the same barycentre. There would be a huge rebalancing of the system, and the new balance point would be the barycentre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, everything orbits around the barycenter, but if the star is by far the most massive thing in the solar system, then the barycenter is approximately at the center of the star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the barycenter remain even if a star is gone? So will that solar system remain if the largest body of mass is gone? I know this is hypothetical but what I am asking is in relation to the original question, is the reason that the star has no effect on planets because the star is not actually what they are rotating around? If that is the case, would the planets continue to rotate around that center if there was no massive object in the center?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Every collection of mass has a barycenter.</p>

<p>The star has a major effect on all of the planets. It's the dominant piece of mass in the system. If the star were not present in the system, the dynamics would be very different. But you can have a collection of objects of similar masses (so a bunch of planets, or multiple stars with no planets) orbiting around their barycenter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you would magically remove the Sun then all the planets would fly away in random directions (based on their velocity at the time you remove the Sun). There is nothing that would exert enough gravitational force on them to keep them together.</p>
<p>If you magically remove the Sun <em>and</em> change the velocity of the planets you can create a new system where Jupiter and Saturn orbit each other and everything else orbits Jupiter, orbits Saturn, orbits the combined Jupiter/Saturn system, flies away, crashes into Jupiter or Saturn, or has a chaotic orbit that eventually ends up in one of the previous cases.</p>
<p>By total mass excluding the Sun, Jupiter has ~3/4, Saturn has ~1/4, everything else has a small mass in comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if it's a binary system then that point might be in space if the two bodies are of close enough mass. If one is significantly larger than the other then the barycentre will be within the larger body.</p></div>		</li>
