			<div class="markdown"><p>There are examples from English that work well to illustrate this. “bat” (meaning a large stick for hitting a ball) and “bat” (meaning a small, winged animal) aren’t even distinguished by tone, but if you say something like “I swung a bat at the burglar”, nobody even considers that you might have swung a small, winged animal at the burglar. It doesn’t matter that the words sound identical because only one meaning is at all plausible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And thus, phrases like “<em>bat</em> bat” were born. Because sometimes you are talking about swinging a small winged animal at a burglar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I speak Vietnamese which is also a tonal language with 6 tones and at least 3 distinct dialects. How you identify the correct bat in &quot;I swung a bat at the burglar&quot; is exactly how we'd do it: context. We also appreciate the difficulties of tonality in melodies, which leads way to a lot of wordplay in our music. For dialects however, it's to the point we'd sometimes need captions to understand dialect differences. </p>
<p>I'd say the bat sentence is tougher as, even in melodies, the tonal language singer might try to 'steer' their pronunciation of the word towards the right pitch while still adhering to the melody, whereas both &quot;bat&quot;s sound the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bat sentence gives you literally nothing but context, but there are also fewer opportunities for ambiguity in English than there are in tonal languages. The only other word in the English sentence that could be misinterpreted in speech is “I” (for “eye”). Meanwhile, you can construct sentences in tonal languages where every word could be transformed into at least one other word by changing its tone. (In Mandarin, changing the tone of the syllable <em>ma</em> produces words meaning “mother”, “horse”, “hemp”, and “scold”; you can probably think of similar examples for Vietnamese.)</p>
<p>We can imagine a similar situation in English if we suppose that “burglar” can also mean “pizza” or “park” and “swung” can also mean “broke” or “potato”. Some interpretations are nonsensical (“I potato a bat at the pizza”), but “I broke a bat at the park” is a reasonable interpretation with no context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people have provided explanations based on how the word &quot;buffalo&quot; is used each time, but I find it easier to start further away and work towards the final sentence.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Cowboys trick farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, that's easy enough. There are cowboys, and they are tricking farmers. But what kinds of farmers are being tricked, and what kind of cowboys are tricking them?</p>
<ul>
<li>Texan cowboys trick Nebraskan farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so what kinds of cowboys are these Texan cowboys? Let's say that they are Texan cowboys that are, in turn, swindled by Oklahoman ranchers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Texan cowboys that Oklahoman ranchers swindle trick Nebraskan farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay. Almost there. The word &quot;that&quot; in that sentence can be omitted and the sentence is still grammatically correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Texan cowboys Oklahoman ranchers swindle trick Nebraskan farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, now we'll go one by one. The cowboys are no longer from Texas, they're from the city of Buffalo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffalo cowboys Oklahoman ranchers swindle trick Nebraskan farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Now they're no longer cowboys, they're buffalo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffalo buffalo Oklahoman ranchers swindle trick Nebraskan farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the ranchers aren't from Oklahoma, they're also from Buffalo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffalo buffalo Buffalo ranchers swindle trick Nebraskan farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Now they're not ranchers, but also buffalo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo swindle trick Nebraskan farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Buffalo is also a synonym for &quot;swindle&quot;, so let's replace &quot;swindle&quot; with &quot;buffalo&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo trick Nebraskan farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, buffalo is also synonymous with &quot;trick&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Nebraskan farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, the farmers are also from Buffalo, not Nebraska</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>And, last step, they're not farmers, they're buffalo</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

<p>In short:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sentence employs three distinct meanings of the word buffalo:</p>
<ul>
<li>as a proper noun to refer to a specific place named Buffalo, the city of Buffalo, New York, being the most notable;</li>
<li>as a verb (uncommon in regular usage) to buffalo, meaning &quot;to bully, harass, or intimidate&quot; or &quot;to baffle&quot;; and</li>
<li>as a noun to refer to the animal, bison (often called buffalo in North America). The plural is also buffalo.</li>
</ul>
<p>An expanded form of the sentence which preserves the original word order is: &quot;Buffalo bison, that other Buffalo bison bully, also bully Buffalo bison.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chinese is said &quot;tonal language&quot;, but in fact it's the pitch that changes. And more precisely, how the pitch changes within each syllabe (words being syllabes)</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if the word is in F or C# or D.</p>
<p>What matter is: if your word keep the same pitch it's what they call the first tone. If your word starts in C and end in D, then it's what they call the second tone  because D is higher note/pitch than C, but you can also do a F to F# and it'd work.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>When you sing you need to successively say words with the right notes (pitch) like: D -&gt; C -&gt;  F</p>
<p>Chinese have no problem with that, they only need to alterate a little bit the sounds.</p>
<p>Instead of: D -&gt; C -&gt;  F if they need to use 3 times a second tone (ascending pitch)</p>
<p>They can say:  D to D# -&gt; C to C# - F to F#</p>
<p>That add a different style to the music, and if it doesn't work musically they can chose words that would fit the song (like we do, we have syllabe constraints with rythme that Chinese don't have for exemple).</p></div>		</li>
