<p>Yes, it was probably just a generic “we can use the interview (and beyond) footage for our news program (and beyond).”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but media release forms are very open to interpretation. You are not releasing for the interview or interviewer, you are releasing for the media company. Sasha Baron Cohen just had to make up a fake media company for the release and the interviewer would communicate it as an interview and the release for the media company would be forwarded to him. It would all look legit from him and his lawyers eyes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So yes, that is a very real assumption.</p></div>		</li>
