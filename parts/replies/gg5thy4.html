			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true, and I don't know why you'd say that.</p>
<p>if things had just had slightly different starting conditions, we'd have very different creatures, there would of course be convergent evolution, but life is insanely varied and there's no reason to believe things couldn't be incredibly different. If alien life exists I doubt it is anything like earth-life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor...but this absolutely stands to reason - it would be evolutionarily 'expensive' to put long nerves to important organs like sight, taste, olfactory, and hearing if those sense organs weren't placed close to the processing...and putting those sense organs near the torso wouldn't be super useful either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a super inefficient nerve, but it makes sense how it happened.</p>
<p>We had that nerve back when our ancestors were fish like creatures and moving the nerve through the aorta wasn't a problem because the brain spine and heart were pretty close together. </p>
<p>We have that same nerve. And while our necks aren't as long as a giraffes it's still useless that the nerve curves around out heart to go back up to our jaw.</p>
<p>But evolution slowly moves terrestrial creatures heads away from their torso and an ever increasingly loopy nerve never had any selection pressure around fixing it. </p>
<p>The end result is dumb but the process is easily understood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much about the speed, it's about the cost of the material. The specific nerves for sight and smell are more specialized than &quot;simple&quot; touch sensory nerves, so they require more to make and protect. From a survival perspective, damage to an eye nerve will reduce your chance of survival more than damage to the nerves in your toes, so we don't want them to be too exposed or too long (more chance to be severed). We need to protect them. The most important organ to protect is the brain, so putting these all in the same area kills two birds with one stone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one here is an expert and theyre pulling it out of their ass. It’s fun to talk about but when it’s gets into the nitty-gritty like this it’s best to go to experts to actually learn. People on this site tend to speak with such certainty on things even scientist don’t fully understand. Just my two cents.</p></div>		</li>
