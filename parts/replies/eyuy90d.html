			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best/most complete answer so far. Pulling the power plug out of the wall while a device is running will wear the plug and the outlet. Some switches allow for a softer shutdown needed for device's proper operation. All switches insure longest life possible for the device. </p>
<p>By the way, it's worth noting that some professional use electronics MUST be properly shut down and pulling power can cause physical damage. One such example are computer servers - pulling power without proper shutdown can damage hard drives because the reading arm would just get dropped onto the hard drive platter spinning at 20 000 RPM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think systems that can be physically damaged by power loss should be on a UPS, able to power it for at least long enough to shut down safely. I think the hard drive thing is relatively rare these days, it should park the heads automatically when the power is lost, though if a hard drive is dropped or something while the platters are moving too slow to generate an air cushion, it can still be damaged. Data loss is still an issue.</p>
<p>Also 20k RPM drives should really all be replaced with SSDs by now. Server grade SSDs usually have a capacitor big enough to finish the current write, so you don't get a partial write on power outage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're not wrong, there are still situations where power may fall off essentially instantly.  Battery damage comes immediately to mind--while there are some battery technologies that aren't flammable, any technology designed to handle storing hundred-killowatt-hour amounts of power can and will react violently if something goes wrong.  Missing batteries are another one--many units will beep incessantly if there is no power going in, but some don't signal the lack of a battery.</p>
<p>And let's not forget the common problem of 'the monitoring system got ignored', which can happen for dozens of reasons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is kinda outdated in a number of ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard disks are still quite popular, since they're a lot cheaper to store mass amounts of data.</p>
<p>SSDs actually have the same problem -- they have a complicated internal structure, and interrupting things in the middle can cause corruption, or even the whole drive becoming non-functional.</p>
<p>Granted, none of this is new, and an enterprise grade drive should be able to deal with it (HDDs can use the energy from the spindown to finish the current sector write and park the head; SSDs should have reserve capacitors), but people do put cheap crappy hardware into servers, backup capacitors can rarely fail, so why risk it needlessly?</p>
<p>And even if all that works right, filesystems aren't transactional. That the drive finished writing whatever it was doesn't necessarily mean the data on the disk is consistent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever notice a black smudge on the face of the outlet afterwards? That's vaporized metal from the contacts.</p>
<p>Thinking back, I think about 9/10 of the worn out power outlets I've seen were in hotel rooms, I wonder if that's because they get vacuumed so frequently and plugs getting pulled out of sockets, or if it's just people plugging and unplugging so many chargers all the time.</p>
<p>If it feels like the outlet isn't grabbing on to plugs anymore, it's time to replace it. It's actually relatively cheap and easy to do it yourself, though obviously turn the breaker off before starting, verify the power is off before opening it, and test it with one of those three light testers when you're done. (plenty of videos and guides on the process).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a video about switches and what makes them click.. literally.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMiqEkSk48" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMiqEkSk48" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrMiqEkSk48</a></a> It explains also why we need the kind of switches that are used for cutting of mains, there is a reason why light switches etc have that click and if it doesn't have it... replace it.</p></div>		</li>
