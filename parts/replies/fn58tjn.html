<p>Personally, I love it. You’re supposed to turn the movie up to a volume that you can hear <em>all</em> of the dialogue and sound effects. When it gets loud, it’s supposed to be loud. </p>
<p>I had an old Kenwood receiver with Night Mode that would smooth out the volume so these spikes wouldn’t occur if someone was sleeping in the house. I think most still have this feature in some shape or form.</p></div>		</li>
