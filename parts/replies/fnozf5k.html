			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading your question, I had to find out for myself. So I did some quick googling and my conclusion would be because we stand upright our core and abdominal area are built differently to sustain our posture.</p>
<p>These links don't spell it out exactly, but they did give me some better understanding about belly buttons.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard of a cosmetic navel removal surgery, but many surgeons won't perform it without some kind of good reason. I believe an allowable reason, like with gender dysphoria, is with the permission of a psychiatrist. It may be allowed if the patient has had long-standing maternal issues.</p></div>		</li>
