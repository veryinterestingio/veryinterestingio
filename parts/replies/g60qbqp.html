			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes more sense than the top response referring to the cause of “negative mood”. For instance, I finally decided to start dating again after 4 years because raising a child is hard. I signed up for a dating app, set up my profile and even “liked” and messaged a few people. It’s been a week and a half and I have been procrastinating on checking back in. It’s not because I don’t want to, I just get anxious thinking about dating again and my brain is like, “Doesn’t cleaning the bathroom sound more appealing? Yes, let’s do that.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So referencing the top posts &quot;negative mood&quot;, as your brain running away from stress hormones.</p>
<p>You avoided checking your inbox. Why? Because it made you anxious. Why? From your comment it seems like you either had a bad experience or dating in general is a stress inducing experience for you. (apologies if my assumptions are way off!)</p>
<p>Not knowing the future your mind relates your possible neurochemical future to its best knowledge, your past experience: something about this drives up anxiety (&quot;negative mood&quot;). </p>
<p>Maybe its fear of conflict. Maybe its fear of going outside. It could be one of a million different combinations of things but your brains largest corellation in this instance is: Dating instigates stress hormones, avoid it.</p>
<p>And yes. Any other task that does not evoke stress hormones will appear (relatively) cathartic and achievable in comparison.</p>
<p>I have recently realised that almost all of my personal procrastination is due to my fear of (relative) uncertainty and conflict. Things I am not sure I can do and think people will judge me for? I avoid.</p>
<p>I've read a few good studies and books such as &quot;Eat the frog.&quot; which advise to always run towards what you have been procrastinating. Why? Because largely procrastination is conflict between logic (I know I must do this, or I choose to do this because I know it will pay off in the long run) and emotion (I don't like doing this now). So any procrastination for short term relief (favouring emotion) will always lead to long term pain. </p>
<p>Other commentators have also referenced that our emotions are vestigial remnants of our primal instincts which are very largely rooted in the now while logic allows us to build an interconnected set of cause and effect: if I do A then B will happen then C will happen. Its not perfect but it lets us project a bit further than only our emotions (instincts) allow.</p>
<p>One of the problems we have from a psychological point of view is that humans subconsciously think of our future selves as distinctly different entities from our current self. This prevents us from accurately gauging the cause our current actions will have on our future selves. Hence, even though we know not doing this thing now will lead to future discomfort, &quot;Let that future me take the pain rather than the now me!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought it was just me, lol. But that's a great observation. I can imagine myself doing the task and enjoying it in the near future, but only if I'm unable to do it at the moment. As soon as I decide that now is the time, the discomfort and restlessness is unbearable. At present my best strategy is to find something I want to do even less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This begs the questions - what even is &quot;laziness&quot;? Aren't we all just motivated by certain things and when we are forced to do stuff that's not interesting we are percieved as lazy?</p></div>		</li>
