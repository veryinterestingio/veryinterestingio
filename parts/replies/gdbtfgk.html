<li>FAST can't put a radar transmitter on their platform because of weight limitations. (A radar transmitter system is heavy!) Theoretically FAST could receive echoes from some other dish (with a transmitter), but that would be less sensitive than Arecibo, since any existing dish that might transmit is much smaller than Arecibo. The next-most-powerful planetary radar system after Arecibo is NASA's Goldstone DSS-14 in California. Their maximum transmitter power (about 500 kW) is half that of Arecibo, and they don't have an easy way to increase their transmitter power. DSS-14 gains a little by working at a higher frequency than Arecibo, but their dish is smaller (70 meter diameter). So they are about 15x less sensitive than Arecibo overall.</li>
<li>There's no easy solution, but public support and public pressure help a lot. We scientists try to make sure that the public knows about our work, so they can see how some of their tax dollars are being used. Thank you for caring!<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll just add to Sean's point #2 that like with cars or homes or most things in life, it is almost always much cheaper to maintain existing telescopes than building (or doing major repairs to) old ones. So I completely agree there's an important point here that investing more in maintenance up front saves money overall.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So are you saying that we got to this point with Arecibo because not enough money or care was put into maintenance?  Whose failure was this, primarily?</p></div>		</li>
