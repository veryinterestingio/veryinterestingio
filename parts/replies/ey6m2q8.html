<p>One also needs to take into account if the trading is out of the norm for that person.  As an executive, with information about the company, I would never be able to sell stock, because I always know non-public information.  I always sell on the first day (not pre-programmed, but manually sold) that I can sell, so that my activity looks like it's normal...always.  Which means it can't be seen as insider trading.  Now, if I decide to sell (or buy) outside of that normal activity, then it can be construed as insider trading.  This is akin to the pre-programmed model that you've described, but it's based on activity, and not just setting up a regular trade.  My window for trading changes every quarter, depending on when earnings comes out, so that we can't sell before bad earnings, for instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most correct answer. If an insider has a pre-scheduled, documented sales timeline, it normally will not be considered insider trading. </p>
<p>For the sake of argument, if the said insider had a agreement for their broker to liquidate a net of 200k shares at a rate of 10k shares a week based on 1% of the volume weighted average price(VWAP) then they’ll simply sell a small portion in 2-5 trades per day. There could be a price to it as well, such as don’t sell if it’s below $45. </p>
<p>These plans are well documented for obvious reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be considered insider trading if the day before a company’s quarterly financials were made public - in which a large settlement a company reached with the government is made public - an executive sold upwards of half mil in stock? They filled out a Form 4 with the SEC for this sale so I’m assuming it’s legit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, though I'm surprised the SEC allowed it since there are usually blackout periods before quarterly announcements like that.</p>
<p>Also a half mil isn't much for an executive. They will typically hold tens of millions in stock</p></div>		</li>
