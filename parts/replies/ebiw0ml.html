			<div class="markdown"><p>I've rubbed the dead one on the orphan to get ewes and mares to accept a new baby.  The worst one was where the mare had been spooked in a storm, and stepped on her foal ... We got her to take an orphan quite easily, but the poor bub was not allowed to lie down for two minutes without her panicking that he'd died as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was just terrible. A tree had come down on one end of the barn, and obviously it had scared everyone. The mare was utterly devastated, there were rake marks where she'd been nudging the foal with a hoof trying to get her up. The mare was so depressed, and it was about 18 hours before the call came round about looking for a foster mare to take a 3 hour baby . He arrived and she was nuzzling him all over, and he fed really well. But as soon as he folded himself down to sleep, she was nearly hysterical. We ended up building a creep, using a show jumping pole, so he could be in a separate area of the box to sleep. The mare would stand against the pole, nose to his, listening to him breathing. You do believe in an animal's comprehension after living through that..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the <del>mares</del> <em>ewes</em> have some sort of instinct for what the <del>ewe</del> <em>lamb</em> is supposed to smell like, at birth, or do they just get the first sniff and remember it? What would happen if you sprayed all the <del>ewes</del> <em>lamb</em> with something really smelly right as they popped out? Could you have a communal family sheep farm?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a mix of smell and the chuckling noise they make to their lambs. A mother ewe will take on dogs to defend their lambs, they are fiercely protective. I used to get roped into helping with lambing, I've got little hands so can help out a stuck lamb. But it's a kind of magic, watching a soggy cylinder suddenly lurch into life and turn into a bouncy lambkin.</p></div>		</li>
