<p>Douching with strong vinegars or alcohols</p>

<p>I believe there's a scene in the film Pretty Baby (might be wrong about this) where one of the prostitutes douches with Coca Cola afterwards.  </p>
<p>Just googled &quot;coca cola douche&quot; and apparently it <em>was</em> used as a form of birth control prior to the 1950s...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even today, there are copper IUDs that are spermicidal. So far I've heard they work amazing, especially since woman don't have to worry about the side effects that the hormone ones can give you.</p>
<p>Edit: As some of the comments pointed out, some of the side effects outweigh the benefits of the copper that I was unaware of. It's interesting to see how different contraceptive works for different people because of the few cases I had heard, they were pretty well-liked.</p></div>		</li>
