			<div class="markdown"><p>The separate pants were often laced together, so they were attached.</p>
<p>Alternately, there were separate pieces of clothing for the groin area, such as a loincloth or codpiece.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My head must have this all wrong, i assumed they did a measurement around the waist, (maybe a couple more lower down the leg/ankle) measured the inseam and out, and then made the two pieces as in front and back basically.  Then those were the 2 pieces sewed together from waist to ankle and down the inseams.  Maybe just make shorts and the legs seperate and sew the legs on for the colder periods and take the stiching out when it got warmer again?  I know nothing about the historical technolgies of pants apparently.  Interesting to think about.</p></div>		</li>
