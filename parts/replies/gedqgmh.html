			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be added that the laser may point the center of the sample area, but the size of the sample area changes as you move the thermometer towards/away from the item in question. Higher quality units will have a graphic on the side that shows the dispersion rate, and fluke had/has a unit with multiple lasers that encircle the sample area.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a TG165, and it does exactly that.  It's also <em>extremely</em> clever -- outlining a spot size when you can't put your lasers coming out of the middle is tricky.</p>
<p>What it does, is have the lasers horizontally to the sides of the aperture, and aim upwards and downwards.  Thus, they sweep out <a href="http://makingmathvisible.com/Hyperboloid/hyperboloid-standing.jpg" target="_blank">two lines on opposite sides of a hyperboloid</a>.  Very close to the device it's more or less straight, a bit larger than the diameter of the pyrometer aperture.  Further away from the device it spreads out and start approximating a cone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this:</p>
<p>There is a small difference between your blacksmith and a (simple/cheap) infrared thermometer. The blacksmith looks at the spectrum of the light emitted (read: the colour) to determine the temperature, whereas the infrared thermometer is not a spectrometer. It just looks at the intensity at one wavelength, and uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law" target="_blank">Stefan-Boltzmann law</a> to relate it to the temperature.</p>
<p>This is less accurate because now the reading is influenced by the emissivity of the surface you're measuring: objects that are bright (in the IR range used) emit less radiation than dark objects, so an IR thermometer will give a too low temperature reading. Typically IR thermometers are calibrated for an emissivity of 0.95 or so, which is close enough for many materials including water and human skin. But there are materials which have a very low emissivity (read: are very reflective in the IR range) such as metals for which the reading will be completely off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, absolutely. Slightly different in terms of how they're measuring each object's emission, but still the core is blackbody radiation.</p>
<p>I wasn't super satisfied with the answers that tried to throw around words like blackbody radiation which I don't think most people are super familiar with, so I tried to bring it to something that I think most people can grasp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would they be more accurate if they looked at two or more frequencies, and so were able to do a better fitting of the SB law? This seems fairly cheap to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly before the invention and popularity of the digital infrared thermometer there was an optical infrared thermometer. The operator would look through a red filter in front of a filament and adjust the current running though the filament till it appeared to disappear as it was the same temperature as the object being measured.</p></div>		</li>
