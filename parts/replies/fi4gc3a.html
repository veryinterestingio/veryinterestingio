<p>Localized delivery like inhalers reduce local inflammation in the lungs. Note that asthma is not “wheezing” but is technically “chronic bronchial inflammation.”</p>
<p>I’m not super familiar with gout, but it seems like flare ups are also inflammatory responses. I’m not sure if this would be treated with a local injection or oral meds, but in either case corticosteroids would reduce inflammation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jumping on to clarify about gout. When Uric acid crystalizes in joint spaces they form sharp needle like  shapes that trigger an intense inflammatory response mediated by neutrophils. Our first like treatment for gout is actually NSAIDs like indomethacin but steroids can be used in severe cases to tone down the neutrophilic response. Steroids in generally are very powerful anti-inflammatory drugs because they inhibit the production of cytokines that trigger the immune response.</p></div>		</li>
