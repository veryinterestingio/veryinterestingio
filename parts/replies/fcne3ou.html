			<div class="markdown"><p>And the fancier your armor the less likely you were to be killed because it meant you had more money to pay ransom.</p>
<p>There were stories of knights grabbing an underling's armor and wearing it. Then the opposing army ordered all nobles below a certain rank executed and they were executed by accident under the belief they were not high nobility because of their crappy armor.</p>
<p>However it should also be mentioned that the age of chilvary ended before suits of armor became obsolete. So while there was a time period where fully armored knights wouldn't kill each other there were also time periods where they would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Battle of Agincourt played a big role in the decline of chivalry. The idea that French noble knights could be slaughtered on the battlefield by peasant archers was a shock to the medieval military thinking. By the late 15th century gunpowder was making its way onto battlefields which was dishonorable in its very nature. The thought that a soldier could be killed by another soldier at random without squaring them up face to face on the field went against the ideals of chivalry. As someone else mentioned the use of knights was dying out and being replaced by professional soldiers. There were less and less opportunities for knights to show off how &quot;chivalric&quot; they were. Don Quixote was almost the nail in the coffin for the chivalry because how much the novel satirized the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe what mostly ended chivalry was armies turning towards professional soldiers rather than nobles to fight battles.</p>
<p>But chivalry was a bit fragile even when it existed. At Agincourt, King Henry panicked and executed most of his French prisoners (some of the nobles included) for fear that the prisoners (who were very vast in number) would rise up and join their fellows who were attempting to counter attack.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I always thought it strangely continued and morphed even into the world wars, the restrictions on war crimes are an example of this, as well as acts of surrender in which one general might give his gun or sword to their enemy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chivalry returned during WWI between pilots. However, as a widespread concept it morphed into the Geneva convention which is more about reducing suffering and the dignity of all people than the chivalric code (for example Geneva convention protects non combatants while chivalry didn't much help peasants who were captured.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it was Eric Idle from Monty Python who hosted a historical show that did entire segments each dedicated to exploring a particular role in medieval life.  I found the ones concerning monks and knights to be my favorites because they were the most eye opening.  I think the full series in up on YouTube but I can't post a link right now.  </p>
<p>Edit:  It was Terry Jones not Eric Idle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surprised I had to scroll down this much to find the right answer before having to post it myself.</p>
<p>The term &quot;blackmail&quot;, after all, comes from taking a defeated knights armor and selling it back to them.  Someone of high enough status to afford a full suit of armor was worth more alive than dead.</p>
<p>It was rare for knights to actually be killed for most of their history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK your statement about the origins of the word &quot;blackmail&quot; are incorrect. &quot;mail&quot; or &quot;male&quot; comes from Middle English and means &quot;rents&quot; or &quot;tariffs&quot;.</p>
<p>Example from Wikipedia:</p>
<p>The word blackmail is variously derived from the word for tribute (in modern terms, protection racket) paid by English and Scottish border dwellers to Border Reivers in return for immunity from raids and other harassment. The &quot;mail&quot; part of blackmail derives from Middle English male, &quot;rent, tribute&quot;.</p>
<p>EDIT: work -&gt; word</p></div>		</li>
