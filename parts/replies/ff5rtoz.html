<p>You know the guitar string is in there somewhere, but to find out exactly where you're going to have to stick your finger there and prevent its next move.</p>
<p>Except the guitar string IS really in physical places moving. While the electron ... isn't</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's quantom physics. its why its 'its own' physics. When you get to the really small, it doesn't work like things in 'normal physics' do.</p>
<p>Why its so fun. Look at the double split experiment as an example of this confusion, and to help explain how an electron is just a 'cloud'/Wobbly guitar string.... until you 'touch' it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term &quot;random&quot; may lead some to believe that a randomly generated &quot;result&quot; already exists and then you measure it. It's like the difference between creating a list of randomly generated numbers and a dice which can yield random numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Random” is fine to describe the result of a measurement.  The probability, however, is certain. If you are rolling a single die, the outcome is random, but you know you won’t get an 8.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heres the thing - these analogies help us understand models but fundamentally they cannot describe what is going on because we have no actual concept of the quantum at our macro scale. On some scales the idea of ping pong balls makes sense as an analogy, but on quantum scales we have to contend with wavefunctions. The math is correct and logical, but at the end of the day trying to describe it without the math is going to be at some level incorrect.</p></div>		</li>
