			<div class="markdown"><p>Great Britain is the island that England, Wales and Scotland are on.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth is a bunch of nations including Canada, India and Australia, as well as the UK, that used to be part of the British Empire. EDIT: Apparently anyone can, in theory, join the Commonwealth. <a href="https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us/joining-the-commonwealth" target="_blank"><a href="https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us/joining-the-commonwealth" target="_blank">https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us/joining-the-commonwealth</a></a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that the Commonwealth of Nations, to which any country can apply for membership, is different than the Commonwealth realm (which recognize Elizabeth II as their monarch). All states in the Commonwealth realm are in the Commonwealth of Nations, but not all members of the Commonwealth of Nations are states in the Commonwealth realm. Is that correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great Britain is the island in which England, Scotland and Wales sit. That's why the full name of the UK is &quot;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Nations is an organisation that loosely ties former territories of the British Empire together. The Queen is the head of the Commonwealth. It's more like a club than anything - there are no laws or guidelines passed down by the Commonwealth in the same way as, for example, the EU or UN. </p>
<p>King's Landing is the capital of Westeros, located on the east coast overlooking Blackwater Bay :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's pretty simple; it's because Ireland is part of the British Isles. Same reason that people from the Isle of Man are British citizens despite not being from Great Britain.</p>
<p>Many people from Ireland have an issue with the term 'British Isles' (and rightfully so) but as far as the UK government is concerned, people from NI are British.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but British citizenship is just the term to describe citizenship of the UK. Northern Ireland is in the UK.</p></div>		</li>
