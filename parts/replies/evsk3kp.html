			<div class="markdown"><p>First piece of advice -- keep up your passion for changing the world. Second, pursue studies in science and engineering, and think about engaging actively in research (ask professors what research opportunities are available). As to your questions about applications, we believe that live cell therapies (the ability to take cells out of a patient, engineer them and put them back to be “living medicine”) hold great promise for all the areas you mention. For these cells to be safe, effective and robust, they need to be &quot;smart,&quot; which means they need to be able to detect their local environment and react to it. We need to program them to do so. This is where LOCKR (and other synthetic proteins) and synthetic biology in general can help! And btw, these therapeutic cells could also be programmed to shut themselves off once their job is done, so this is not engineering the genetic code of a human, but rather giving them the equivalent of smarter &quot;pills&quot;! --HES</p></div>		</li>
