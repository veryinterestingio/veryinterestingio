			<div class="markdown"><p>Parlov used lots of thing, but he actually never used a bell. He for example had metronomes with certain bpms that the dogs recognized. So they knew that if it was for example 90 bpm, no food, but 100 bpm, the food is coming. That's even more impressive than a bell I think</p></div>		</li>

<p>He also died when he was fairly young so we don't even know the extent of his fears, do we?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure, I studied it a long time ago and just in passing and the wiki page said more than I learned from uni about it. According to wiki no one knows for sure who he really was. That also means that the longer answer to this question is that it's not certain if you actually can teach something like this to a child and be sure that it sticks. If you would want to do that for some reason. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! I'll look into it more. In my psychology class, we were told he died when he was around 7ish. (give or take - been a while). But we were definitely told he died. And something about they didn't have medical records for him after he left the experiment. Therefore, no one knows how he was up until he died - but if he's not dead - well, I guess that doesn't change a hell of a lot because we still don't know anything.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people &quot;looked into&quot; it but there was no record. There's two or three very strong candidates, including the son of one of the nurses at the hospital. But each possibility also has reasons it might not be them. </p></div>		</li>
