<p>Even asymptomatic patients have stress to their lungs similar to those with symptoms.  This may not even be noticable because they have so much lung reserve but who knows how it will impact people years from now.</p>
<p>It's kinda like chicken pox was considered &quot;harmless&quot; to get as a kid and then they learned you can get shingles an adult.  While covid is not lying dormant (as far as we can tell), it does cause damage that is not fully understood and we really don't know how long term the problems will be until the time has passed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Challenge studies are not really performed in virology research anymore. Even if you give someone a vaccine first, if you give them a dose of real virus, then they could suffer actual disease / damage.</p>
<p>Everything is a bit wonky given the emergency threat of contacting covid in everyday interactions, but physicians and scientists still have to follow the ethical principles of medical research. This means that clinical trials still have to be designed so that there is very little anticipated risk (and some reward) to the trial participants, and giving a participant the real virus doesnâ€™t meet that threshold of safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an ethical question, to which the answer has been thus far a resounding &quot;no&quot;. I'm not sure I agree, but I've never taken a Hippocratic oath and I'm also not the one who would be responsible for deliberately infecting people who may very well die from it.</p>
<p>There is, however, an upcoming <a href="https://www.news.com.au/world/coronavirus/health/worlds-first-human-challenge-covid-trials-will-see-2500-brits-deliberately-catch-virus/news-story/8ffa27d8dcf03ddbd1c2bfd69e27aa3e" target="_blank">vaccine challenge trial in the UK</a>, apparently the first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people had suggested using common-cold coronaviruses as an improvised &quot;live/attenuated&quot; vaccine. May be just a coincidence, but the incidence of these viruses in China at least were more or less the reverse in the age pattern of one another. Children all having antibodies of more or less recent common-cold Covs, whereas older adults lacking them the most, and vice-versa for SARS-cov-2.</p>
<p>But maybe this cross-immunity isn't that much significant, besides, some common-cold viruses can kill older people anyway, once even triggering a false-alarm of SARS-1 in Canada, due to it testing falsely-positive for SARS-1 on the antibody tests they had.</p>
<p>It's perhaps also complicated to mass-produce such viruses, it seems they're cultivated on monkey kidneys or something.</p></div>		</li>
