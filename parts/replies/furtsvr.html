<p>Functional MRIs show that your brain has task centers that light up as soon as you are given an assignment. They stay lit until you finish that task. From a subjective point of view, that feels like anxiety about completing the task, repetitive and intrusive thoughts about the assignment, and an inability to fully concentrate on other topics. Once the task is finished, the brain’s task centers switch off and go dark. Subjectively, you feel relieved. </p>
<p>Once you start trying to recall a song but can’t remember all the lyrics, it becomes an incomplete task that your brain is going to noodle over again and again. You can’t get the song out of your head until you remember the whole thing. </p>
<p>I’ve tested the theory on some really bad ear worms. I looked up the lyrics and practiced until I could sing the whole thing without interruption. Poof, no more worm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t believe this is always the case. Sometimes I get a song stuck in my head and I KNOW what comes after the part on loop but I can’t bring my brain to play it back, it like hardplays the part stuck in my head.</p></div>		</li>
