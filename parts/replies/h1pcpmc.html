			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. If that growth system is well understood in fruit flys, can geneticists change key genes to disable the &quot;stop growth&quot; trigger and produce (relatively) giant fruit flies (that may or may not be able to survive)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not really. Insect sizes are limited by their ability to breathe. Most insects breathe through structures called trachaea. When size increase, surface of tracheae scale to the power of two, whereas weight scale to the power of three. This imposes a limit on the size of viable life given a certain body architecture. If, say, a fly were to be 5 times bigger, it would need a different architecture that allowed for more trachaea.</p>
<p>But they have learned to control the body architecture of flys, so they grow legs where they should grow eyes, or wings. Or have heads in both ends or hindbody in both ends. Nightmare fuel, really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sort of know this but would be satisfying to just get an answer off the back of this. In the distant past, insects were actually giants compared to now. I take it the architecture was the same but it had more to do with air composition?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone else mentioned to you this is based upon breathing. </p>
<p>In the past there was giant bugs. Because there was more oxygen in the air. </p>
<p>There has been lab experiments where they have made some jumbo sized grasshoppers and things by producing a more oxygen rich environment for them to grow in. </p>
<p>So if oxygen ever increases overall by any appreciable amount again in the atmosphere. Bugs will also increase in size again from what I know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Perfect analogy for my brain to understand</p>
<p>The body won't do things unless the code tells it to.</p>
<p>Would mutations like gigantism be linked to like, bad code?</p></div>		</li>

<p>yeah. The most common cause is from pituitary tumors. That would be qualify as &quot;bad code&quot;. But non-pathological gigantism is hard to explain from a genetic perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a body part grows, it's because cells are dividing. Basically, there are genetic programs that tell cells when to divide. many of those programs are &quot;safety checks&quot; that have to happen before a cell can divide.  Because if cells start dividing when they shouldn't, that can lead to tumors or cancer or gigantism.<br />
So a cell usually requires an external signal like a growth hormone. Sometimes several hormones are required. and that means the cell has to have receptors that can detect the hormone.<br />
The cell usually has to be in the correct location in the body (touching other cells of the correct type). The cell checks for mutations or missing chromosomes, or extra chromosomes. every time the cell copies DNA, it literally holds the two copies up side by side and checks for errors. it's not 100% perfect, but it works most of the time.<br />
Dwarfism, on the other hand, is usually a mutation in the growth hormone receptor gene. the cells can't detect the hormone, so they don't grow. That's why you can't treat dwarfism with growth hormone injections. they already have plenty of growth hormone, it just doesn't do anything because the bones can't detect it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, could it be conceivable to &quot;code&quot; your bones to, like, learn again?</p>
<p>Someone else compared to coding and it sorta started to make sense.  Could we like tell the parts that aren't listening, like build an interpreter/API between the code that makes bones grow, and the threshold or whatever it &quot;should be&quot;</p>
<p>Like we know that we must end with an answer of 1, but we know we can't do it just by..uhh..our own DNA?...could we then instruct the body to finish, repair?</p></div>		</li>
