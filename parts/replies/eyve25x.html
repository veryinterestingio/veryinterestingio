			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, here goes. Keep in mind this was in the early 1990's so details may have faded or taken on a life of their own in the intervening decades...</p>
<p>The whole process started with the creation of a digital black and white master. If we were lucky, there were multiple good quality prints to work from, and they would remove scratches, dust, and other flaws, balance contrast and brightness, plus do a pull-up from whatever the original frame rate was to 30FPS for broadcast video. No matter what we did with the color conversion process, the first thing that was produced was the best B&amp;W version possible. </p>
<p>Once that was available, one of the two art teams would take it in to preproduction. They'd break the entire movie into three parts (one for each shift - we ran around the clock because we had expensive hardware for the time) and then break those sections down into a map of all the individual cuts. The art director researched whatever was available as a color reference. If we were very fortunate there were color production stills, but that was rare, and as people have mentioned, many movies shot in B&amp;W used unusual color choices for sets and costumes to work better in monochrome. War movies were easy, because uniform colors and vehicle paint schemes were available to reference. </p>
<p>Unless we were really going all-out, every movie we did only had a range of 12 hues (we called them &quot;regions&quot;) that were the same for every cut throughout. Flesh was always one of them, and there was always an off-white region for teeth and the whites of the eyes in closeups, so in reality it was more like 10 total. For some special projects like Casablanca, different parts of the film got a different set of regions so the overall color choices for the entire movie were broader, but that was the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Our company, unlike our competitors, didn't try to make the color versions of our films look like modern color - our goal was to make them have a consistent look with color films of the same era from that studio, if at all possible. As a result, the effect was subtle and muted, and at least in my opinion, we did the best job with our work for the time. </p>
<p>Ok, so the movie is remastered, the art team has chosen regions, and the film has been divided between shifts. The next step was critical - choosing keyframes for each cut. Every cut in the film needed one frame as a color reference for production, and if it was a long cut with a ton of camera motion, sometimes even 4-6 keyframes were necessary. The idea was to pick a frame that had as much of the visual content as possible for that cut in it, so it might be at the beginning, somewhere in the middle, or at the end. The art team would create keyframe region templates for every single cut (and there were hundreds for every film, sometimes more than a thousand) and basic notes for each cut. That got handed off to the production art supervision team, and things got real. </p>
<p>When I started, I was a graveyard shift production artist. I had my 486 PC running our proprietary software (one of the founders of the company was a legit brain surgeon and had developed some breakthroughs in medical imaging) and at the start of the shift, I would get handed my assignment for the night on Bernoulli discs. These were (I think - I'd have to look it up) 20mb capacity removable hard disc cartridges the size of a half-ream of paper. Each one had 60 B&amp;W frames loaded on it, and one would have the keyframe. </p>
<p>You could tell how effed you were by your stack of Bernoullis. If the shift supervisor gave you 10 of them, you knew you had a static cut and you would be mostly loading and saving. If you got one (a whopping 2 seconds of film), you knew you were screwed. </p>
<p>The production process was basically just loading your frame, loading your color keyframe overlay, then moving forward/backward to the next frame and adjusting each region by hand. We had a few automated tools, like a threshold light/dark brush, but it was very labor intensive. God help you if you got a scene like I did once, where you had a courtyard full of kids who turn around to face the camera, complete with a US flag flapping in the background...</p>
<p>After a couple of months on the production line, I got moved up to &quot;scene consultant&quot; which was a kind of low level supervisor position. In preproduction, I went through all of my shift's cuts one by one, looked at the keyframes from the art director, and then made notes about anything that wasn't in the keyframe or might be tricky (&quot;man enters from left frame at MM:SS:FF, suit coat in region 4, hair in region 10, pants in region 6&quot;) based on the rest of the scene. In production, I went from one production artist to another answering questions, checking for consistency, and listening to stories about the times they dropped acid (which ranged from the guy who claimed to have done it 'hundreds of times' who's most memorable experience just involved letters dancing on the page of a textbook, to the guy who only did it once but said, &quot;I was expecting pretty colors but got Yaweh instead...&quot;) Oddly enough, the pool of people with artistic ability who were willing to work graveyard tended to skew heavily towards those who had experience with psychedelic drugs...</p>
<p>As cuts got completed, they went to QC, and if they didn't need any significant rework, they were rendered and pieced together into the final color cut. It was a shitload of work, and a typical 90 minute feature would take 2 weeks for 150 or so production artists working 3 shifts to complete.</p>
<p>So that's how we did it back in the day. If anyone has questions, I'm happy to try to remember more details, but that covers the basic process.</p></div>		</li>
