			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, eventually the variation in where you would expect to find the particle or could hope to measure its velocity would be far greater then the change in the model's predicted velocity.</p>
<p>Also from within a frame of reference I think you can continue to accelerate forever because from that frame of reference you would still always calculate the speed of light leaving as C? But I'm really talking out of my depth here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but exponential growth in velocity is rarely a good model for anything except on very small time scales, since the velocity gets large so quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any random decay process can in theory take arbitrarily long- the half-life is just the mean time taken for half of the thing in question to decay, and there isn't an upper limit on how long it can take. The radioactivity of a sample is modelled as decaying exponentially because that is its average behaviour- if you run the same experiment on more and more samples, the average number of undecayed particles would follow the curve. At large time t, your number of undecayed particles would average to near 0, but in any given experiment it could be 0, or 1, or 1000, or whatever you like (just with extremely low probability).  </p>
<p>Of course, exponential decay in velocity is also not something that can last forever because you can't ever just create a situation where only the force you're modelling is acting, and there will always be external forces influencing the motion. That said, it can last far longer than exponential growth, which gets too big too fast in general,</p></div>		</li>
