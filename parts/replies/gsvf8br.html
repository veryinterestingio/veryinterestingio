			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago, I read an interesting study about rats, cheese and mazes. The take away was that language influences understanding and perception. </p>
<p>For example, when giving someone directions - let’s say to exit a maze - we use words like left and right for direction. If we are guiding someone with no knowledge/understanding of these words and their meaning, it would be extremely difficult to guide them.   </p>
<p>In this way, human capacity for advanced language is inextricably tied to our status as most intelligent life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun, mostly unrelated fact: There are some languages that don't use left and right, but instead describe everything in terms of cardinal directions - north, south, east and west.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun, even less related fact: Theres also a language that refers to the past as in front of you and the future as behind you, directly opposite all other languages I'm aware of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More fun fact. left/right, north/south/east/west - they both require a reference point. Left/right often uses the speaker as a reference point unless some other point is determined, and cardinal directions often use what the masses agreed is the &quot;top&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, and &quot;left&quot; of Earth. If you look at Earth from far out in space, the only way to know which is &quot;north&quot; and which is &quot;south&quot;, is to know north would be the pole nearest to you <em>if</em> the earth is going counter-clockwise around the sun. If it appears to be going clockwise - that's south. But this is only true because humans agreed that those two points would be called north/south respectively.  </p>
<p>Point being you need a reference point for both left/right, and cardinal directions, because both of them were determined to convey some form of directional information and you can't convey directional info without some reference point (even if I say &quot;turn until you see the largest building on the horizon&quot; or something - that building becomes the reference point for the direction you need to go).  </p>
<p>So ultimately, the human capacity to understand things outside of themselves (such as using something is a reference point) is a key to our perceived higher intelligence....whether that comes across in language, gestures, pictures, whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact directly related to that fun fact: people that grow up speaking those languages have excellent senses of direction. Studies have also shown that people who speak languages that have more names for colors can actually distinguish more different colors than those that speak languages with less color words. There’s a whole branch of linguistics about it, but basically there’s lots of evidence that language actually shapes our perceptions of the world around us, which I think is pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a side note the fact that language influences understanding is exactly where Descartes failed when postulating his Meditations. </p>
<p>His goal was to doubt until nothing more could be doubted, but he failed to recognize that language itself can be doubted, and that influences the way we perceive the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just starting to read what kind of creatures are we? by chomsky and yeah he really touches on the ability for humans to form and understand sentences based on a conceptual basis rather than a word to word or letter to letter linear pattern. very interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty interesting if you compare us to computers trying to parse language, because they're still pretty bad at it. For example, GPT-3 (a deep-learning algorithm that essentially takes a text prompt and keeps adding to it) can put together sentences that are grammatically correct, and even makes sense most of the time.  </p>
<p>The model is trained on a huge library of texts, and it's very good at making connections between various words and concepts (for example, if you give it a prompt about a pilot, an airplane is very likely to come up.)  </p>
<p>But the thing is, GPT-3 doesn't have a clue what any of what it writes actually <em>means</em>. It just looks at the words in a text, then using its understanding of grammar, a very deep and complex web of word associations, and a dash of randomness, it strings together entirely new sentences that (usually) make sense.  </p>
<p>If you're curious to play with it, you can check out AI dungeon (<a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home" target="_blank">https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home</a>), which uses their own version of GPT-3.  </p>
<p>Just don't be too surprised if it loses the thread of the story, or forgets/changes some details. It doesn't really know what it's saying, after all. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Universal grammar is an unscientific idea invented half a century ago to explain how pretty much every person can learn language, and why languages share certain characteristics. </p>
<p>You’re never going to get an absolute consensus, especially in a field as variably scientific as linguistics, but the predominant models of language learning among the more scientific crowd are statistical at this point.</p></div>		</li>
