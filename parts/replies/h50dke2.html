			<div class="markdown"><p>It took me several years of this happening to realize it was happening to me almost every night. By the time I’d wake up I’d be so out of it I’d forget it happened the next morning. The best cure for me is to get to bed early and avoid staying up late.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to get it more often when I’m slightly sleep deprived. I start falling asleep too quick and get that sudden jolt like I’m about to fall out of bed. Then it happens multiple times in my first hour of sleep and all that adrenaline leaves me trying to fall asleep with one eye open. Like just a really light, kinda self aware sleep. </p>
<p>There’s ways to not be sleep deprived without a normal sleep schedule. I know everyone’s different though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good thick curtains that block light and noise, dimmer switches or low lumen bulbs in the bedroom and if possible the room you spend most your time in before going to bed (for me this is the living room, I turn off the lights and switch to lamps about an hour before going to bed), try not to let watching the TV be the last thing you do, have a routine before going to bed and do it every night (I check the door locks, close the windows, pack the dishwasher, straighten up the living room such as restacking the cushions and folding the blanket, have a small glass of water, brush my teeth and wash my face), turn the brightness down on your phone as the evening gets later, if you are in bed and find you can't stop thinking there are lots of great youtube and spotify creators that do guided meditations for sleep.<br />
Edit: Also wash your bed linen at least once a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal, but this was the case with me. I had crippling generalized anxiety for years. It was always just there beneath the surface and would manifest with little to no rhyme or reason. I couldn't tell you why I would suddenly become an anxious mess and fly into a fit of panic resembling a manic episode. </p>
<p>After years of therapy I learned that I had a whole slew of triggers that stemmed from trauma from my very abusive father. Just a few events I experienced as a child were causing me to be this constant bundle of nerves and I was completely unaware of them, if that makes sense. Only through therapy was I able to trace them back to a point of origin and heal them. As a result, I haven't had an episode in years and may never again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It starts there for sure, but doesn’t need to remain there. The key is bringing it out of your subconscious to your conscious to be able to identify it for what it is, triggers &amp; methods to reduce/cope. I will likely always have subconscious anxiety but I work hard to keep most of it at the conscious level so I can deal with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right? I get periods of insomnia because of anxiety. I will finally be relaxed enough to sleep, drifting off, when my subconscious tells the rest of my body “guys watch this- dumb bitch thinks she’s finally relaxed enough to drift off nice &amp; peacefully”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I learned in uni is that these &quot;jolts&quot; are a signal that the brain would send to the limbs all the time, except they are supressed by another part of the brain while you are awake. But as you are drifting off, the supression is relaxed and the brain sends the &quot;twitch&quot; signal.</p></div>		</li>
