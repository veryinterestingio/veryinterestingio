<p>Not sure how to interpret what Israel does.</p>
<p>Vaccination campaigns will need to stay around for a while after the last reported case, sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If IPV does not prevent WT virus from replicating in the gut, and IPV is main method of vaccination, vaccinations can never be stopped because people will continue to be infected and will produce virus without showing symptoms. There will always be replicating WT. And considering OPV's problem of vaccine associated paralysis, the only way to totally eliminate polio the way of smallpox is a new vaccine. GATES foundation has a candidate. But it has its own potential problems. See: <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/04/417241/designer-virus-first-new-polio-vaccine-50-years" target="_blank">https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/04/417241/designer-virus-first-new-polio-vaccine-50-years</a></p>
<p>I was a small part of the creation of that vaccine.</p>

<li>Also to clarify, testing sewage for PV is not a thing countries have on their todo list. When you have a case of paralysis in a developed country, last thing you think of is PV, maybe go for another enterovirus. Point is there is no system in place for the screening of circulating WT PV. And WHO's whole plan with the global vaccination and eradication is to phase out vaccines. And that strategy is in serious jeopardy. At great financial expense.</li>
