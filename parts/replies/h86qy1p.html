			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  There's not any right translation.  He's not a &quot;chieftain&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, &quot;emperor&quot;, &quot;pope&quot;, &quot;messiah&quot;, or &quot;god&quot;; he's a &quot;天皇&quot;, which is different from all of those things.  But we had to pick something, and &quot;emperor&quot; seemed closest at least in the Chinese case.</p>
<p>(Similarly, Shinto is not really a &quot;religion&quot;, &quot;tradition&quot;, or &quot;political system&quot;; it's a &quot;道&quot;, which is different from all of those things.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends on the definition of religion. In Chinese at least, 道 is synonymous with religion. However, the definition of religion historically is very different from our modern Western idea of religion.</p>
<p>For example, historically, Confucianism is considered one of the three major religions (along with Buddhism and Taoism) in China, but no one today would consider Confucianism as a religion.</p>
<p>The definition changes with the culture, and time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>天皇 and 皇帝 aren't translations of each other. 天皇 comes from 皇帝 and 天子, two separate Chinese titles that the Japanese borrowed and eventually combined. In Japanese foreign emperors are referred to as 皇帝 and 天皇 is reserved for the Japanese Emperor only, while Chinese has no such dichotomy.</p>
<p>The literal and most descriptive translation would be something like &quot;Heavenly/Celestial and Most August one&quot; for 天皇, and &quot;Most August one and Sage-King&quot; for 皇帝. Like I said before, the 天 is in reference to 天子, Son of Heaven, which the Japanese Emperors directly lifted from China, mythology and all. 皇 and 帝 are the two types of title given to China's mythological pre-history rulers, god-kings (皇) and sages (帝) who taught the ancient Chinese tribes various skills like fire and agriculture. 皇帝 was coined when 始皇帝 conquered what he thought was the extent of ancient China post-warring states period, because it symbolizes him reuniting the different tribes/countries that originated from those culture heroes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Jesus this is some bullshit. Why do people talk about things when they clearly don't actually know the topic. China and Japan aren't the same when it comes to this</p>
<p>The whole 'emperor is god' thing haven't been accepted in China even in BC era. Chinese imperial legitimacy comes from the the mandate of heaven, which sounds like some sort of association with the divine, but is in fact the exact opposite. The philosophy legitimize literal peasants into becoming emperor. </p>
<p>The mandate is given to a worthy individual or dynasty, and they have that mandate so long as they are worthy. But once they have become unworthy (I.e. Inability of a vast empire like china's to deal with natural disasters is a sign of ineffectual management and corruption, and therefore justifies revoking the mandate) the mandate is revoked and given to someone else/new dynasty (justifies uprisings and legitimize new dynasties). </p>
<p>You can't claim actual true divinity under such a system. This is a philosophy that directly works against the narrative of emperial divinity. Meanwhile, Japanese  imperial legitimacy comes from them being direct descendents of the sun goddesses l</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it's just an issue with translation. Chinese has distinctions between kings and emperors, even tho the actual definition differs from European standards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. The Emporer is not a god, he is the chosen one by god.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the hierarchy of king(王) vs Emporer (皇) is encoded in the letters themselves. 皇(Emporer) contains 王(king) but the king word (王) is below 白, which taken as a whole, has the representative meaning that 皇(emporer) is above 王(king). In ancient China when it was mostly fuedal, the fuedal king is 王 and when Emporer Qin (秦始皇), the first Emporer of China, unified all of the fuedal kings under his rule, that was when the Emporer, 皇, title came into being.</p>
<p>In Japan's case, you could say that in their history, a similar thread of events happened where they were mostly fuedal with regional 'kings' (although they didn't call them that) that eventually got unified under a single ruler which they named 天皇. Although, while the nature of the events were similar, it's like a mini version of what happened in China though, and Japan was very keen in adopting Chinese culture and systems to elevate their importance.</p>
<p>I would argue that the translation of Japan's monarch as Emporer is more a result of WW2 when Japan kind of did rule over a large swath of countries, and it is part of Japan's propaganda to project an image of divinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, Japan took the words son of heaven china, then utilized it literally in a way the Chinese never did. </p>
<p>You can't change dynasties/imperial families if your imperial line are literal sons of the sun goddess, that's why the Japanese emperor was always kept as a figurehead by people actually in power and the throne never taken from them. You can, however, change dynasties and imperial families if each's rule is justified by a temporary mandate that can be revoked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a fair criticism; I definitely blurred the two more than I should have in my comment.  The Chinese monarch's claim to be &quot;heaven's ruler&quot; was plausibly more similar to European monarchs' claim to &quot;divine right&quot; than to the Japanese monarch's claim to be a god walking the Earth.</p>
<p>I should have said &quot;The most direct translation of the Japanese monarch's title '天皇' would probably be 'Lord God', but that was unacceptable because ... .  So instead we decided to treat it as equivalent to the Chinese monarch's similar title '皇帝', which we'd previously decided to treat as equivalent to 'Emperor' because ... .&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mandate of heaven is not the same as divine right of kings. <strong>They are almost literal opposites.</strong></p>
<p>In divine right of kings, your lineage trumps all, no earthly authority gets to question the king one of of royal lineage must always rule. It is a philosophy through which the ruling royals ensure they powers cannot be taken away</p>
<p>In the mandate of heaven, your lineage is secondary to the mandate, which can be revoked from you or your family if you fuck up. It's a philosophy built with an innate clause to allow new dynasties and emperors to replace weaker, more ineffectual, older dynasties . It's a philosophy through which others can legitimize taking power away from the current ruling royals. </p>
<p>Japanese monarchy's claim of divine birthright serves the exact same purpose as divine right of kings. The mandate of heaven is the odd one out. Superficially, the mandate of heaven and divine right of kings are both 'chosen', but that's irrelevant because for all practical purpose, if your lineage is chose and never unchosen, then you're no different from someone claiming to be divine.</p>
<p>Under both divine right of kings and Japanese imperial propaganda, only the royal lineage can rule. Under the mandate of heaven, any smuck can rule. That's why you've had emperors from China that started out as literal pig farmers. While in japan you always need an emperor from that 1 family and in Europe you need someone with some kind of royal bloodline</p>

<p>It comes from combining 皇with 天子, both Chinese terms, the latter which literally translate to mean Son of heaven, but Chinese interpretation of the phrase is closer to he who rules all under heaven (as opposed to any sort of divinity) </p>
<p>The Japanese took 天子 from China, then proceeded to made it literal. Later they combined terms and started using 天皇. </p>
<p>Even going by the Japanese interpretation of 天皇 I honestly have no clue where you got the translation 'lord God' from. It's simply not accurate. The term. Is just a combination of emperor and a literal interpretation of the term son of heaven. </p>
<p>I will say this again, you very obviously don't know enough about this topic.</p></div>		</li>
