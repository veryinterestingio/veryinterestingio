			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to add that strength as a blanket statement of mechanical performance can be hard to quantify as well. You have all sorts of  mechanical characteristics in a metal such as tensile, compressive and shear strength, hardness, toughness, fatigue limit, ductility, elasticity, etc. Many times when you enhance one quality of a metal it makes other qualities worse.</p>
<p>The perfect metal would be almost a contradiction of different characteristics. You'd want a metal that is strong, but flexible and hard but not brittle. To get around these seeming contradictions, many metals are surface treated through different techniques such as case hardening/carbuerization or quenching so that the internal core of the metal and a thin outer layer of it actually have different mechanical properties.</p>
<p>Also steel itself is essentially a composite. Most steel contains at least two separate types of material(called phases) organized in some fashion. Two different materials common in most if not all carbon steels is pure Ferrite which is nothing more than pure iron and is soft and flexible suspending a ceramic like material called iron carbide or Cementite which is extremely hard.</p>
<p>Depending on the ratio of iron to carbon and how its heat treated these two phases of materials can form different crystal structures which can have widely varying mechanic properties. One gold standard, prized for its excellent mechanic properties, is Eutectoid Steel or Pearlite. Pearlite has a unique structure of layers of alternating Ferrite and Cementite which give it excellent mechanical properties. It is however very tricky to produce and requires very specific metallurgy and heat treating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And existence of other alloying metals, but yes, pretty much. And it's not amount of heating/cooling as much as the way you cool it (See: &quot;Heat treatment for steels&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By amount I mean how hot you get the metal and how rapidly the metal is cooled. Heat will shape the crystalline structure size and cooling speed affects the crystalline structure. At least that what I recall from my welding/blacksmithing class</p></div>		</li>
