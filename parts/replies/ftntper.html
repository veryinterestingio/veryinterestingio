			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, the trick is on me.  The definition was changed to match common usage. </p>
<p>It is sad that we humans are too dumb to follow simple ideas such as &quot;when you combine two words, the definition of the new word is the combination of both base word's definition&quot;.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to create a dishwasher that also washes clothing.  Instead of using a more appropriate word for this device, I'm just going to steal the original word so that, eventually, many people know that a dishwasher can also wash clothing...and Webster then will update their dictionary.  It's really stupid.</p></div>		</li>
