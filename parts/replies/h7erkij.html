			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm just a bit too far down the rabbit hole thinking about it, but it seems likely to me that the minute effects of the gravitational pulls of the other stars and everything outside the solar system would have a butterfly effect on the primordial solar system. There were billions of various asteroids, planetoids, etc. and if they hadn't collided *just so* in the exact order and at the exact time, the planets might not be in the same place or even exist today. Especially when you consider you've got, what, a hundred million or so years of the early solar system to account for? Tiny gravitational changes can have major effects down the road.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make a good point, But I think you are too far down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>This is the difference between &quot;Could it have happened exactly as it did happen?&quot; or &quot;Could it have happened at all?&quot;</p>
<p>The answer to the first question, as you point out, could easily be no. But there's no reason it would have to be no for the second question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also remember gravity is an inverse square relationship so the mass required to have an impact has to be immense and even then it wouldn't do much of anything.</p>
<p>But what you also might be thinking of is the expansion of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not a rabbit hole that's a fundamental point of Hawking's history of the universe or something and I think about the whole everything on the universe is gravitationally dependent on everything else on the universe but right now the universe is still expanding and the structure of our solar system is held inert in that force maybe? Until it's not as everything starts to contract again...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible that one or more of Earth's great extinctions of the past was caused by a gamma ray burst. That would be an external influence of significance, at least on Earth. Certainly wouldn't have affected the actual planets much.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the article you linked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fingerprint of such an event might be revealed by gathering more information about the geographical pattern of the Ordovician extinctions, the researchers conclude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, it’s shaping up to look like it really was a gamma ray burst wot dunnit for the Late Ordovician mass extinction, but not from geographical patterns as far as I know. It’s been hypothesised for a long time that a GRB was responsible, because it appears to be rapid, and the astrophysics modellers said that statistically it has probably occurred once during the Phanerozoic when it’s been aimed straight at us. </p>
<p>What I’ve seen recent research though are theee further aspects which are fairly convincing when taken together (don’t remember too much detail but I’ll mention them anyway):</p>
<p>(1) physical modelling of what would happen produces a convincing kill mechanism through extreme degradation of the atmosphere (particularly the ozone layer) and subsequent harmful radiation coming through for tens of thousands of years afterwards.</p>
<p>(2) there is fossil evidence from plant spores in at least one Devonian-Carboniferous boundary section, showing how their spores are deformed in a manner consistent with high levels of UV radiation. </p>
<p>(3) the presence of certain short lived radioisotopes of elements produced in r-process nucleosynthesis in and end Devonian section.</p></div>		</li>
