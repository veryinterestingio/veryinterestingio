			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re already dying of dehydration, the urine in your body right now probably isn’t going to do you much good. If you saved urine (like in a jar or something) from a time when you were fully hydrated, that might be more helpful. It’s just not that plausible for your body to produce fully-hydrated urine in your bladder, and then you start to die of hydration before the next time you urinate.</p></div>		</li>
