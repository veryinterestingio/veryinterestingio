			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry Tarheel, I mean <em>starting</em> forward and <em>starting</em> backward.</p>
<p>The reason is to warn railroad crew who may be moving about the tracks that a locomotive and train is about to start moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok...there's an obstruction on the track, maybe a vehicle crossing too slow, a kid or drunk walking the tracks, maybe even a deer*.</p>
<p>The engineer starts with a series of short toots and they get longer as long as the obstruction remains...then when collision is imminent,  [s]he just opens up the horn. </p>

<li>I've been passagenger on trains several times that hit white tail deer. Twice the poor things were tossed to rags underneath and their little hooves cut the air brake lines. If you don't know, train brakes are held open [off] with air pressure; brakes closed is the default state. In other words, loss of air pressure defaults to a hard stop...which still takes a mile with a passenger train at speed.</li>
