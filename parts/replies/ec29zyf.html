			<div class="markdown"><p>This. As a photographer, I can confirm. The biggest thing is wide angle.
I’d add to this that colors are also distorted... a camera translates light detected via a sensor into a picture. Our eyes basically do the same thing except they are muuuch more sophisticated. Anything you look at is going to be a more appealing and dynamic image. </p></div>		</li>
