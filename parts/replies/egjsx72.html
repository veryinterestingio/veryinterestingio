			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best response. A Cartel is an agreement between organizations, legal or illegal. Whereas La Cosa Nostra (mafia) is an economic model of pure capitalism - a pyramid scheme where the workers hustle illegally and kick wealth up the pyramid to the Captains, who kick it to the bosses. Everyone gets a cut, everyone has a quota, and the bosses get rich. Fun fact: fucking with the model gets you dead. </p></div>		</li>
