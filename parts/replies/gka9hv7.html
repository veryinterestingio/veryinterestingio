			<div class="markdown"><p>No. At the moment the prize is also how new bitcoin are 'minted' so to speak. There is a point where the new coins will stop being created though.</p>
<p>To ensure that there's a prize when that happens, it's designed so that any transaction can have an optional fee applied that goes to the prize for the person that solved its puzzle. That way people can incentivize miners to choose their transactions and miners can focus on transactions that offer prizes (which in turn encourages them to offer the prize).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sorry if I misunderstand but doesn't that mean that the cost of transactions will continue to go up infinitely? Won't that lead to the point where making a transaction is either not worth making due to the high cost or the reward for mining isn't worth solving the puzzle for?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do puzzles indefinitely to &quot;record facts&quot;, in particular the fact that A publicly gave up ownership of X bitcoins to B. </p>
<p>What eventually slows and ends is the finding of &quot;new&quot; Bitcoins by their very first owner. </p>
<p>How does one find new bitcoin? It happens whenever a certain part of the puzzle solution happens to look &quot;pretty&quot; in an agreed-upon way, like any number that ends in a series of unbroken zeros. The first person to randomly stumble across one is automatically the owner of the Bitcoin corresponding to that number.</p>
<p>As the finite supply of &quot;free for the finding&quot; bitcoins dry up, people will switch from trying to find buried treasure to taking a percentage cut of the transactions they digitally stamp.</p></div>		</li>
