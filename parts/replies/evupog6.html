			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is true there’s also other reasons too! There are only 20 teeth in the primary dentition as opposed to 32 in the permanent dentition. Baby teeth are also smaller in all dimensions than the adult teeth are.</p>
<p>Edit because it seems like people can’t understand this concept: yes, when I say there are 32 teeth in the adult dentition, I mean the average adult dentition (shoutout to all the awesome replies about having a weird amount of wisdom teeth). One person suggested that adults have 28 teeth and the wisdom teeth aren’t considered part of the adult dentition because they get taken out. False. It’s generally a North American practice to remove wisdom teeth that are non-problematic. Wisdom teeth are 100% considered permanent teeth. </p>
<p>I don’t understand how people have interpreted what I said to mean crowding causes crowding. There are a myriad of factors that can influence crowding (genetics, developmental factors, habits, etc) but crowding rarely happens if these factors are not at play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to wonder where genetics comes into play.  No one in my family has crooked teeth... to the best of my knowledge, none have ever needed braces or anything like that.</p>
<p>Is it because we all have big mouths? :D</p>
<p>My wisdom teeth came in perfectly straight with no issues.  I kept them for 20 years before they went bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a source out there (mobile+lazy) where an anthropologist went to visit hundreds of indigenous people and found the rate of crooked teeth was dramatically lower than people of his time and place (early/mid 1900s America). They also had much shorter teeth. He hypothesized both were due to having to chew really tough, raw foods. </p>
<p>Theory was never proven, that's a lot of anecdotal evidence tho so <em>food</em> for thought</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! a dentist. Dr Weston Price who wrote Nutrition and Physical Degeneration.</p>
<p>Indigenous people - or, people who had a completely natural unprocessed diet grew ‘correctly’ ie: adult teeth fitted into a full and well developed set of jaws.</p>
<p>The reason we see crooked teeth so much often comes down to a variety of issues two of which are: poor nutrition and mouth breathing.</p>
<p>I work in dentistry and see these issues every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I never knew that mouth breathing had an effect on teeth. I feel like this could be a part of the reason why I feel like my jaw is crooked and teeth aren't fitted well. Do you think it's possible to eventually outgrow this problem by stopping mouth breathing and eating &quot;tough, raw, foods&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They took pictures. There's hundreds of old black and white photos of these tribal villagers with perfect teeth. The raw food might not have been proven but there was definitely something about what they did that led to better tooth structure results that we have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think part of it is that we use bottles and sippy cups as babies now, instead of going from boob to cup like they used to. You use your mouth muscles differently when drinking from a bottle, so they develop diferently than breastfed babies and push on the teeth differently. I hat seeing an older kiddo (&gt;1yo) with a bottle or cup with a spout, they're just messing up their teeth!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw some stuff saying that the body relys on you to chew tough foods to widen your palet and leave room for the bigger teeth, otherwise baby teeth would fill out your mouth fine your whole life sort of.  Ill admit that last part was me but i think that was the point.  Chimps raised on soft food diets had smaler palets (im pretty sure) and more crowding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't find the paper atm but I know what you're talking about. </p>
<p>I read that a study concluded that people who eat food using only thier hands and teeth have stronger and more perfect teeth than people who use a forks and knives since teeth are facing less resistance and have no reason to develop. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found a guy named Dr. Mew , and he says braces are actually not necessary, and that if we chew hard foods and place our tongues in the right place- we would naturally align all our teeth and have better facial proportion due to the jaw development that occurs due to chewing hard food.</p></div>		</li>
