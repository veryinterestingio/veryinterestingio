			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. So I guess this is the perfect set up for something I've been wondering-- a solitary proton with no electrons or neutrons is just... nothing? It a non-element that only interacts with the world in terms of having a charge (or in some instances, gaining electrons, neutrons, and other protons to then gain elemental properties). Is that a correct assessment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, except there is no such thing as “like instantly,” so the IUPAC used “sooner than 10^-14” seconds as an official definition of “like instantly.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just electrons. Electrons, protons, neutrons, radioactive particles, etc. </p>
<p>Atoms with high atomic mass are not stable and undergo radioactive decay incredibly quickly into more stable elements through processes known as alpha, beta, and gamma decay. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know what happens to any orbiting electrons when nuclear decay leads to a different charge on the nucleus? A change in nuclear charge should change the wave functions of any electrons in orbitals, but those electrons already have a certain energy, so every orbital should become unstable at once...do you have any idea what would happen here, how the electrons in orbitals adjust? Both for a positive and negative change in nuclear charge?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They really don't. They exist in a superposition in all points of the cloud simultaneously, moreso in some areas than others.</p>
<p>But if you were to naively apply classical mechanics at an atomic scale, then yes they move that fast. It's just that classical mechanics is an approximation which only accurately predicts reality with minimal error when dealing with things that are 1) large, and 2) slow.</p>
<p>Electrons around an atom are neither large nor slow, so classical mechanics is the wrong approximation/model to use for them.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics describes the behaviors much more accurately in that regime (tiny and fast).</p>
<p>Relativity does a pretty good job describing systems where things are large and fast.</p>
<p>Also, when you take physical chemistry, don't worry about this for your coursework. If they use classical mechanics to describe collisions between gas molecules (temperature)...just roll with it and don't argue. They're using the models which work best for that course. </p>
<p>Instead, if you love this shit, get a master's or phD in physical chemistry or meta materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fun really begins when you have atoms where special relativity starts to be required. Relativistic quantum effects are <em>weird</em>. For example, they're apparently why mercury is a liquid - without relativistic correction, mercury's predicted melting point is 82 °C, not its actual melting point of -39 °C. Something about the sheer amount of energy in the inner electrons (because of the mass and charge of the nucleus) making them heavy enough to appreciably shrink the atomic radius and have effects on the outer orbitals such that they are less involved in attracting other mercury atoms. And then there's copernicium, which is now predicted to only barely be a liquid at room temperature, but more interestingly, to have chemical interactions more like a <em>noble gas</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll probably learn about how this all works in some good introductory detail in physical chemistry, but it really doesn't <em>move</em> around the nucleus. It'd be more accurate to say that it can be measured at various positions in the vicinity of the nucleus at different times, seemingly at random, according to a probability density function.</p></div>		</li>
