			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that the popularity of the DJIA as a leading market indicator is basically due to its popularity among the financial press.  The tradition you refer to is that is has the longest recorded history, by far, of any current index.  Also, being based on the price of the stocks, rather than the market-cap of the companies (which, for the 5-year-olds, is the true value of the company based on its stock price times the number of shares), it's volatile and moves around even when nothing's really happening in the market.  So it's dramatic, and that's why the financial press likes it.</p>
<p>Anyone reading this: you should be profoundly skeptical when someone suggests that the whole market is moving this way or that based on the DJIA.  Furthermore you should be profoundly skeptical when they suggest that DJIA movement is due to this or that financial report or political maneuver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Appreciate the sarcasm, but Vanguard is one of the three big funds out there that count most (I think 80%) publicly traded stocks as part of their portfolio. Itâ€™s like being surprised that Coke or Pepsi is the authority on something cola-related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best index is the S&amp;P 500 if you're looking at just US indexes because it's what everyone stares at and what has the most liquidity. Also it has the most derivatives tied to it.</p></div>		</li>
