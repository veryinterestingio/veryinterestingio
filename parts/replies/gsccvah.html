			<div class="markdown"><p>I have frequent muscle spasms in my lower back, which often leads to several days of severe pain and limited mobility. I have tried SO many times to fall asleep on my back (because rolling onto and remaining on my side causes a ton of pain), and it just never happens. I often wake up laying flat on my back though, go figure...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually had a muscle pulled in my back or something, was really sore for a few days, and wanted to lay on my back to sleep.  But I couldn't, I almost get dizzy when I try to force myself to lay that way instead of on my stomach.  But if I'm just laying there relaxing playing on my Switch or something I can doze off on my back no problem.</p></div>		</li>
