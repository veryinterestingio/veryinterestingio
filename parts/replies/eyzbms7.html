<p>TL;DR: Kevlar is stronger than spider silk, but not as tough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m not sure what you mean by “novel extrusion practices” though..are we squeezing spiders?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The proteins are spider silk proteins, expressed in different bacterial hosts, and then the secreted solubilized proteins are &quot;extruded&quot; (frankly not even sure if that's the right word) into the polymers by some fancy process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we can easily produce spider web at this point with genetic modification (usually bacteria, but <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5554/472?_ga=2.184358118.1514354480.1567639212-1877288868.1567639212" target="_blank">we've tried goats as well</a>), and apparently its toughness and other physical attributes were comparable to those of natural spider silk, so from a certain perspective the answer is &quot;so close we've already reached it&quot;. The barrier at this point isn't when we'll be able to do it, but when we'll be able to do it cheaply enough for it to be worthwhile outside of the lab.</p></div>		</li>
