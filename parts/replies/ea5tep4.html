			<div class="markdown"><p>Solar minimum generally means that we will see fewer larger displays stretching out of the aurora zone, i.e. further south if you're talking northern lights.  The aurora zone is broadly speaking the region between around 65 and 75 degrees latitude, and if the weather is clear then they should still see aurora there.  The wilder, more active displays are less likely.  But there is an element of randomness to it, so occasionally there will still be big storms, just fewer than we would expect at maximum.  There has been some nice activity recently.  Check out Live Aurora Network.</p></div>		</li>
