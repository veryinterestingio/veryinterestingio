			<div class="markdown"><p>Pandiculation is Merriam-Webster’s Word of the Day today. This is what the entry said under its Did You Know? section: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cat and dog owners who witness daily their pets' methodical body stretching upon awakening might wonder if there is a word to describe their routine—and there is: pandiculation. Pandiculation (which applies to humans too) is the medical term for the stretching and stiffening of the trunk and extremities, often accompanied by yawning, to arouse the body when fatigued or drowsy. The word comes from Latin pandiculatus, the past participle of pandiculari (&quot;to stretch oneself&quot;), and is ultimately derived from pandere, meaning &quot;to spread.&quot;</p>
