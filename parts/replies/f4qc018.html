			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely a trend, but $15.8 Billion is peanuts compared to the value of real estate from Maine to Mississippi. Scratch that, not peanuts, it's the scrapings off the inside of the shell of a peanut.</p>
<p>Homes in the NYC metro area alone are worth <em>$2.6 Trillion</em> and the total US value is about $32 Trillion. Figure $10 Trillion of that is the East Coast states  (conservatively) and we're looking at a 1/1000th of a percent decrease in home property value.</p>
<p>Now obviously most of the homes affected are coastal homes and that's a very small percentage of the homes in most areas outside of a place like maybe Florida or the Carolinas where entire cities and communities are built within two miles of the ocean or on islands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any drop is still pretty significant given a) rates of climate change denial and b) the lengthy time before sea level changes really affect even beachfront property. Most people presently in the position to buy property near the sea will be long dead before sea level rise meaningfully enough to threaten their property.</p>
<p>I wouldn't expect property values to drop too much until hurricane seasons become substantially more predictably destructive along that whole coast, at which point the specific sea level will be less important than how often that sea is subject to a powerful storm.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are (reasonably, off the immediate beachfront) expecting that the state will provide solutions that keep the sea at bay well into the future, like sea walls. Presently, federal payouts also keep the effect of growing risk of flooding from scaring people off those properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah everyone’s house might make like Tony Starks and tumble into the sea one day but it won’t be soon. Some day down the road, 50-150 years from now (not getting into it), it will just be too costly to insure on the immediate coast if some places start getting 2-3 Cat 3+ Hurricanes every year. Once a place is in a state of never-ending repair people will start to leave.</p>
<p>You’re going to see some absolutely massive public works projects in some places. For other places with unfriendly geography, and porous geology, there won’t be any choice but to let some areas go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to point out the documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Living_Dangerously" target="_blank">Yeas of Living Dangerously</a> which got some Hollywood stars to investigate this question in episode 2 and Jack Black went to Miami. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0P6WfN_MPU" target="_blank">Here's a trailer</a> and the whole episode is both hilarious and sad.</p></div>		</li>
