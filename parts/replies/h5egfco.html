			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure the ones that paralyze your body. During REM sleep you dream and to prevent your body from moving your brain sends commands to all of your muscles to stay completely still, it's a self-defense mechanism actually to prevent eventual involuntary hurting that may happen if you dream and move yourself.</p></div>		</li>
