			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty important thing to note, yeah. The original left was pretty much conservative monarchists vs liberal republicans, but what was considered to be &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;leftist&quot; kept changing. Over the course of the revolution and far beyond still.</p>
<p>In the 20th century and onwards, the left has been socialists (or at least social democrats) and the right has been liberal capitalists, who ironically were basically the original &quot;left&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course, given that America lacks a true left wing, the terminology is a bit odd there.</p></div>		</li>
