			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be more accurate to say that the temperature at which hydrogen turns liquid, assuming standard pressure, is the coldest for any gas except helium. −252.87 °C for hydrogen, -268.95 for helium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's totally possible to cool it down more, if you wanted to. What's happening is that it doesn't want to go ABOVE that temperature if left to its own devices.</p>
<p>Think about liquid water. It will boil at 100 degrees C at sea level until it's all gone. Same goes for liquid hydrogen and helium - but the difference is the boiling point is much, much lower.</p>
<p>All the heat energy flowing into it goes into boiling it, not raising the temperature.</p></div>		</li>
