			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t have the same division requirements. For example, a single city in the US might be in a single county, but the congressional districts might have some sections that are in the city limits snd some that aren’t, and they might cross multiple city level designations like a council district, and those might be cut up further by state assembly districts, so a single county of 200,000 people could end up having to be cut up into 80+ individual voting precincts because of all the federal, city, state, and county representational areas crossing over each other. But they’re all on one ballot so it needs to get counted at the lower level and then disseminated up the chain to the correct vote counting authority.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for Europe, but in Canada we don't vote for everything at once. There are typically 3 election cycles:</p>
<p>Federal: 1 ballot, 1 vote. You only vote your local representative (the prime minister is the current leader of the party that won the most representatives). Must be at least once every 4 years, but can be called for sooner (e.g. if a budget bill fails that auto triggers an election)</p>
<p>Provincial: Same system as federal, just at the provincial level. (Instead of Prime Minister the leader is called the Premier). Typically every 4 years, but vary which year/ when from province to province.</p>
<p>Municipal: Can vary but most commonly 2-3 votes: Mayor, ward representative, and often school board trustee. Mostly every 4 years, with some exceptions in the Territories. In most provinces they're either on opposite rotation of the provincial election or the same year, but at a different time than the provincial election</p>
<p>Additionally it's rare to have any extra measures voted on, I can only remember 1 time and it was over 10 year ago</p>
<p>tl;dr In Canada there are different election cycles for the different jurisdictions, at different times, and they're much simpler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really done all at once, for instance I'm in Italy</p>
<p>We had the national legislative election (both full houses) last year. A couple regions also voted for their regional councils but not all of them.</p>
<p>In 2019 we'll have European elections (across a week all over the EU) and in my home town we'll likely elect the city council</p>
<p>Some time after that, don't really know when, we'll elect our regional council</p>
<p>And we have referendums, but they are mostly organised on their own, maybe bundled together.</p>
<p>We also don't vote for judges or any other law enforcement officers or administrator or civil servants</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Catalan &quot;referendum&quot; is a really bad example. That wasn't an official election, it was a regional government trying to hold an illegal vote without any legal value. It was a political stunt by the secessionist, not an official vote. Afaik every official election went down smoothly in Spain since 1978.</p></div>		</li>
