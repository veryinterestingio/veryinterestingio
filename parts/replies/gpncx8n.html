<p>Meaning they do indeed have to be stacked. I'd accept a pyramid-shaped pile, which puts it back at just 4, though.</p>
<p>But then if you're really building pyramids with them, is it really &quot;haphazardly&quot; placed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the physical structure should play some roll.</p>
<p>Because if I took one cup of sand and spread it evenly across the floor, it's nlt a heap.</p>
<p>If I take 1 cup of sand and pour it into a pile, it is a heap. </p>
<p>So maybe a heap is a more of a shape than an amount.</p></div>		</li>
