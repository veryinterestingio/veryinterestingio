			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it accurate to say then that at some point in time the observable universe was the size of an atom, or the size of a grapefruit as I often hear, even though the universe in totality might be infinite in size at those times?</p>
<p>And if that is true does that mean you could conclude the statement &quot;it was infinitely dense infinitely everywhere&quot; ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes to the first.</p>
<p>As to the second, &quot;infinitely dense&quot; is a little problematic, in that our laws of physics surely break down before you get to that point.  Without physical laws, we're just handwaving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading a physics book that postulates that in the earliest, smallest measurements of time post big bang, that the 4 forces: Gravity, Electromagnetic, and the weak/strong Nuclear forces were all one unified &quot;force&quot;, within certain increments of time that force broke up into Gravity, Electromagnetic, and Nuclear. Before finally we get the 4 forces we have now.</p>
<p>Basically, the handwaving as wild as it is, can help figure out why certain things &quot;can't&quot; work like that now, because the &quot;rules&quot; were different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing I can't wrap my head around is that a denser universe would warp space time to a larger degree and so as the universe expands it becomes less dense and warps space time less and therefore things &quot;seem&quot; closer right??? Would it not be equally accurate to say that time is slowing down if?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a uniformly more-dense early universe does not have more curved space;  if space is not curved now (aka &quot;flat&quot;), it's not curved then.  </p>
<p>You're thinking of things like black holes, etc, which are non-homogenous distributions of matter;  when we're talking about the universe as a whole, we're looking at a homogeneous (or close enough to that) distribution of matter.   You can think of it as that near a black hole you feel the pull in one direction, while in the early universe the &quot;pull&quot; from nearby mass would be in all directions, so things cancel out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jeez, at last I get it. I always thought &quot;the universe was smaller&quot; meant the entire thing was the size of a pinprick at some point in time. </p>
<p>It seemed to me to be illogical to say &quot;it is expanding&quot; because if it is entirely of itself, there is nothing to expand into. </p>
<p>So the &quot;observable universe&quot; is expanding because its density is decreasing as the emptiness increases. And at some point long ago it was a hyper-dense point of energy-stuff, relative to something which is hyper-empty and infinite in all directions.</p>
<p>I think I need to lie down for a bit.</p></div>		</li>
