			<div class="markdown"><p>Saltwater from the ocean contains water, but it doesn't contain enough water.</p>
<p>Seawater is about three times as salty as urine can get, so for every glass you drink, you need three glasses worth of water to dilute it.  Since you are only getting one glass worth of water with your salt, that's a net loss of two glasses of water worth of dehydration.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That sentence just seems so wrong. It would probably be better suited if you phrase it that it contains too much salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be, if it's the correct ratio of salt to water. There's some survivalist tip for making your water last longer, especially if you're lost at sea, where you can mix a small amount of salt water into your fresh water in order to extend it. However, normal ocean water has enough salt that it takes more water to process the salt in whatever you drank than the actual water you drank.</p></div>		</li>
