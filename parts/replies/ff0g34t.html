<p>Couldn't it be useful to us, as it is for the insects? Somehow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could. But we may already have bacteria that are better at helping humans. The bacteria in insects would have evolved to help digest insect diet (like cellulose in wood) whereas our bacteria have evolved to help us digest what we eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, useful bacteria help us digest things. If insect bacteria were useful to us, it would probably be because they also help us digest things. They would have to compete against well-established populations of bacteria that have evolved symbiotically with humans for millions of years, evolving to help us more and more over that period. While theoretically possible, they're at a severe disadvantage even after they survive stomach acid and a foreign immune system.</p>
<p>You also control your microbiome through diet. The populations of symbiotic bacteria are determined by diet and likely help to determine diet, in a nice feedback loop. So you'd probably also have to change your diet to accomodate a rapid population increase for the new bacteria. All in all their chances don't look good, but none of those things stopping them are absolute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now, when you say &quot;gut&quot; I assume you mean the intestines and the stomach. Is it possible to implant said bacteria into the human body to make it possible for humans to digest wood too? Or do we already at a lesser extent. Cellulose is in many things we eat daily..</p></div>		</li>
