<p>The magma is also very high in silica which makes it much less viscous (much thicker and harder to erupt).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quick nitpick: high silica content makes magma more viscous, not less. Remember, viscosity measures a fluid's rate of resistance to deformation. Less viscous magmas are your mafic magmas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for this comment because I always have to remember that high vs low viscosity is backwards of the way my brain wants it to be. Although the seeing the definition as &quot;measure's a fluid's rate of resistance to deformation&quot; helps.</p></div>		</li>
