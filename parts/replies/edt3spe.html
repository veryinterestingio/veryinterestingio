<p>And (some of, possibly all of) those cars with a charcoal canister run a &quot;purge&quot; cycle where they suck air through the filter into the engine to burn up the emissions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, I think it's called an Evap canister.  </p>
<p>Mine is strapped to the bottom of the trunk compartment.  There's a rubber hose leading up to the fuel filler neck area, and another running back near the bumper (Presumably for sucking clean air in to do the cycle you described).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You can get your charcoal canister saturated with liquid gasoline and cause the system to clog as the charcoal swells up. The charcoal is only meant to absorb gas vapor.</p>
<p>The most noticeable and annoying symptom is that the gas tank cannot vent vapor as you fill up, causing a build up of pressure. The result is the gasoline can back up and &quot;burp&quot; through the filler neck causing the fuel nozzle to click off even though your tank is nowhere near full.</p>
<p>I've had this happen on my car before and it is not fun spending 5+ minutes outside in the cold trying to slowly pump gas so it doesn't trip the shut-off every time I fill up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that explains my work van. I either have to pump at full speed for 1.7 gallons and then wait five seconds or pump super slow the whole time so it doesn't trip. Doesn't matter what angle or how far in/out I hold the thing. I haven't actually figured out which way is faster, I just know it takes forever to pump 25+ gallons.</p></div>		</li>
