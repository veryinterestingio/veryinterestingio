			<div class="markdown"><p>personally, I really like your question... it's something that one must ask about any career.   I figure that I'm still involved in 'environmental managment',  species interactions,  searches for new organisms in extreme locations,  and general human well being--  at the individual, community, and even planetary level.  By working on issues that are so far off,  I'm also exploring what it means to develop and use new technologies-- and consider potential benefits-- or impacts from them.    In many ways, it's like  other fields--  aviation,  health care,   energy production (fossil, solar, wind, nuclear)  autonomous driving cars,  AI,   telecommunications,  data handling etc etc....  all begin as dreams and early pilot projects...  and the horizon may be very distant  (in time or space)-- but it can hold promise for people   (or problems)-- and we should think outside the box... Big time!   </p>
<p>In addition,  while the long term goal is quite distant, there are plenty of short term payoffs-- personally, professionally-- and even for businesses on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but in particle physics we have the same long lead times. From design of a detector to first collisions it is often more than 10 years, and then some studies need years of data-taking.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to the overall goal, but there are also so many interesting steps in between. You find something that works on paper, then you test components for the first time, followed later by the first successful test of these components, you combine them to modules and test these, combine the modules to subdetectors and test these, and ultimately assemble the overall detector and test that. It takes time because there are so many things to do, and step by step you see progress towards the overall detector. Work doesn't stop once you have collisions, of course - you keep improving the system, fix things that break and so on, both on the hardware and software side.</p>
<p>You need to be interested in the smaller steps as well, otherwise it is not the right job.</p></div>		</li>
