			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it's because this happens, and then the pen won't write over the part of the paper where you've been fruitlessly scribbling, since the scribbling has made the paper glossy. The paper needs to be a little rough for the ink to stick to it, and scribbling makes it too smooth.</p></div>		</li>
