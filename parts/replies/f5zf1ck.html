			<div class="markdown"><p>Dawkins goes into a lot of detail in one of his books. I forget the name but there are a lot of details about how bats use sonar to sense their world. </p>
<p>The quick answer is, they cant. When the information comes back from another bats chirp, the data is garbled up, it doesn’t make sense from the flying bat. </p>
<p>Think of it like having sight with a lower framerate, when a bat is flying, it’ll chirp at a certain rate and get constant updates as to its and others positions. When another bat chirps, the first bat will “see” a frame that is out of place for itself and so gets filtered out. </p>
<p>He also goes into detail of how bats catch bugs. It’d be really hard to catch a flying insect at night with a low framerate. What they do is increase thier chirp rate and therefor framerate to catch them. </p>
<p>There was a lot more explained but I’d have to find the book to remember it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;. It's also interesting that they send out <em>hundreds of chirps</em> constantly. But, because of how sound drops in volume, especially when it reflects, they have to chirp <em>really</em> loud. Since their super sensitive ears are right next to their mouths, their ears open and close <em>even more rapidly</em>, so they can hear the reflected chirps, but not be deafened by the ones they themselves produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just going to guess and say no. They might hear the chirp but they didn't send out the signal so there's not really a reference as to what the sound waves are hitting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most organisms that generate a sound or electricity for orientation will adjust a little when the frequency is jammed, like from a friend. They wouldn't use the neighbor's signal for their own orientation, but may use it to find the neighbor.</p>
<p>This happens in weakly electric fish as well. They adjust their chirps a little when another chirp is too similar.</p></div>		</li>
