			<div class="markdown"><p>When aspirin gets old it actually breaks down into salicylic acid and acetic acid.  That’s why it’ll start smelling like vinegar.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And before aspirin was invented people used to use willow bark for its natural salicin, which is made into salicylic acid when it's metabolized in the body. So it was primitive aspirin!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same concept with dandruff shampoo. When I'm stressed I tend to get eczema on my scalp (parts of my body when it was real bad).</p>
<p>Dermatologist gave me some over the counter shampoo/soap that had salicylic acid in it. When it flares up I just wash my hair but leave the suds in while I wash my body as it takes about 5 minutes to do its job. All the dead excess skin sheds off and I just use moisturizer on the tender spots to keep them from drying out again. Works great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salicylic acid is controversially used in some lip balms as well. The balm makers claim it helps shed dead skin and encourages regrowth. Critics claim that it keeps lip skin thin and thus increases the need for lip balm.</p>
<p>I stopped using lip balm with salicylic acid and noticed that my lips don't get painfully chapped nearly as often as they used to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate the way that chapstick leaves my lips feeling sticky. It leaves me way more aware of my lips. If my lips were bothering me before, it just becomes even harder to ignore them. </p>
<p>Now I just use the same moisturizer I use on the rest of my face. It's not greasy and it absorbs right away so it doesn't leave my lips feeling weird.</p></div>		</li>
