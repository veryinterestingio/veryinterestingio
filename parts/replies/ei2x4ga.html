			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a big factor is, at least with central air, you are more likely to experience the &quot;conditioning air&quot; temperature rather than the average room temperature.  So if you're hot and turn on the AC, generally you feel the cooler air before/during mixing.  So frequently you are experiencing more-extreme temperatures when inside a house than you are actually experiencing the average setpoint of the thermostat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I was thinking.  When you turn it to 72, it isn't blowing 72-degree air, it's blowing max cold air until the ambient temp reaches 72.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of air conditioners blow only one temperature.</p>
<p>They use a sensor in the room and cut off when the room reaches the target temperature, but as for what the AC blows it makes no difference if you set it to 25° or 16°, the air coming out is the same temp.</p>
<p>Not all work this way, but most do.  It’s <em>far</em> easier to build them this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humidity is a big factor. If you go to Florida, the heat is really intense. The air is thick with moisture, you sweat and stick to things, and taking a breath feels like your drinking water out of the air, like breathing in steam from a boiling pot or shower. Your sweat will not evaporate as quickly, because too much water is already in the air.</p>
<p>That same temp in a dry <del>mid</del>west state will feel cooler, simply because the air is drier, it feels less sticky and wet, your sweat evaporates quicker and cools more efficiently, and it easier to handle even if the temp is exactly the same as Florida. </p>
<p>EDIT: perhaps further West, than midwest?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moved to CA from GA. One &quot;warm summer day&quot; I went outside while on the phone with my mom trying to explain how little humidity there is. I was like &quot;yeah, feels like mid 90s here, not too bad&quot; as she was complaining of upper 90s there. I decided to check a thermometer in the shade on the house. 117F. I promptly went inside.</p>
<p>It was also very fun trying to explain swamp coolers to her. It was also fun (/s obviously) trying to explain to a restaurant manager why the cooks are suffering heat stroke because of swamp coolers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grew up in CA and I can handle 110+ degrees with low humidity all day. Hell I'll go shovel dirt all day or hike a mountain in that weather. The first time I went to the East Coast though I felt like I was going to die. Looked at my phone and it said 90 degrees; sweet, no problems. Stepped outside to get something from the car and by the time I walked back in I was drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR: Heat temps with low humidity is easy to prepare for, just drink water constantly. High temps and high humidity is hell.</p></div>		</li>
