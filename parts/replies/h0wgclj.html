			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious if this is more about the muscles being slightly strained vs efforts. I have a basic hybrid bike so I'm not too bent over and I still feel the strain in my neck after an hour or two. The muscles may not be very flexible, so the angle may stretch them, as well as put ligaments and bones in an unusual angle. Plus it doesn't lead to delayed onset muscle soreness like weight lifting does (you get sore starting about 12-36 hours later instead of right after).</p></div>		</li>
