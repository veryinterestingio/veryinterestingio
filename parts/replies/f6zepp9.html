			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently not; we seem to all taste terrible.  </p>
<p>I would reckon babies would &quot;taste best,&quot; but again it would have a lot to do with where it gets its nutrition from. I've had both formula and people milk, and let me just say this: formula is <em>horrid.</em> Cold, warm, doesn't matter. People milk is surprisingly sweet, and supposedly an increase in garlic intake can make it sweeter (except colostrum, I can't see that being able to get sweeter. It's like sweetened, condensed milk.) Taking that into account, I could only deduce breastfed babies would be as close as one could get to the &quot;natural&quot; taste of folks.  </p>
<p>I bet people tasted way better throughout history, than a modern human with a modern diet, but that's purely conjecture on my part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you should only hotbox the most marbled of cows. So it'll be a new grade of Kobe beef, where the cow has been massaged and fed beer daily, only to be stoned out of its gourd before being dispatched and slaughtered for its highly sweet meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best explanation I’ve ever heard of “gaminess”. When my wife (who grew up never having wild game or even lamb) asked me to define the taste, I couldn’t narrow it down. It’s essentially any flavor that deviates from the standard grain-feed animals our palates have become accustomed to. That’s why I get so frustrated when someone says “this doesn’t taste gamey at all!” If I wanted to eat grain-fed beef, I’d eat grain-fed beef. I want complexity of flavors and textures of deer, sheep, and pheasant in my cooking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up eating a lot of lamb that grazes in pretty barren highlands. Lots of berry bramble, lichens and such in their diet. I live in a different country now and often get people complaining about gamey flavour when I just taste... flavour? I'm sure it's an acquired taste if you don't grow up with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't eaten much game but I've heard gaminess described as, imagine the taste of white meat chicken. Now imagine the taste of dark meat chicken. The difference between the two is gaminess, but a small amount compared to wild game. Is that an accurate analogy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That analogy is similar to what a Korean friend once used to describe a certain kind of meat.   </p>
<p>Out of the blue, he asked me one day: do you eat Dog? </p>
<p>Me: what did you say? I didn't understand.   </p>
<p>Him: <em>DOG</em>. Do you eat Dog??  </p>
<p>Me: No no. Noooo.    </p>
<p>Him: its good. Kind of like chicken, but like the difference between chicken and duck.     </p>
<p>I haven't eaten duck since.</p></div>		</li>
