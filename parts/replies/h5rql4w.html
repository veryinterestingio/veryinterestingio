<p>I've played regularly for 20+ years and can only barely do it. Let me tell you, from Chopin, to Rudess, to Scott Joplin, never once has playing any piece ever required me to play with my middle finger touching my palm. Any aspiring musicians who can't do this, don't spend a second trying, it's a pointless (literal) flex that won't improve your dexterity in the slightest. If you can do this, fantastic, if you ever have an unfortunate and very specific superglue incident before a gig then the show can go on!</p></div>		</li>
