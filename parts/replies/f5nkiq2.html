			<div class="markdown"><p>What you said is all true. But unfortunately the Japan aboriginals are a very small minority in modern day Japan. Thus Japan is very homogenous generically as a population. Not as homogenous as Korean, Iceland or Sri Lanka, but more so than say Italy and Spain etc.</p></div>		</li>
