			<div class="markdown"><p>Am Asian and can confirm. Sometimes me and my brother would ask our parents for earwax pulling during the night and they would take out a scoop (like a thin metal stick with a tiny curved ladle-like thing on the end) and flashlight before starting to look in our ears for visible pieces of earwax that they'll just lift out with the scoop while commenting on its size.</p>
<p>The feeling is somehow very soothing, slightly uncomfortable (you get small pops of pain if they scoop too deep or scoop the walls of your ear too hard) and anxiety-filling at the same time. You can manage to relax during the process yet tense up for fear of the sudden pop of pain so your body has no idea whether to relax or stay tensed.</p>
<p>You could say the experience is mindblowing too :D</p></div>		</li>
