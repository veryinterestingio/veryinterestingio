			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually <em>might</em> in some cases.</p>
<p>When YouTube just takes down a video, they're fully within their rights and you have no legal recourse. As a general rule, you'll never have legal recourse against YouTube itself... unless YouTube does something <em>mind-numbingly</em> stupid.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, Takedowns aren't the only thing that YouTube does. They also give Copyright Holders the ability to leave a video up and <em>intercept</em> the Ad Revenue (and sometimes just take a chunk of revenue out). Even if you win a Copyright Claim... they still get to keep your money.</p>
<p>If the Third Party <strong>does not</strong> have any actual rights to the material, then they're acquiring Ad Revenue that <em>should</em> belong to you through fraud. That means you've suffered actual harm as a result of malfeasance on their part.</p>
<p>Under YouTube's standard agreement with a content creator, you <em>probably</em> wouldn't be able to sue YouTube and get anywhere. Assuming that your suit doesn't die in a Motion to Dismiss, you're going straight into arbitration... where YouTube can bleed you with Arbitration Fees until you capitulate.</p>
<p><em>However</em>... that agreement doesn't cover the ass of the third party that lied about owning your video. You have no agreement with them, and you've not waived your right to sue <em>them</em>. That suit would be <em>a lot</em> more interesting, depending on what kind of video it is. For example: You'd almost certainly lose on a Music Video (provided that it's not your music), it'd be a toss-up for a Let's Play, and Reviews would almost certainly be a win.</p>
<p>Of course... actually suing over lost Ad Revenue probably isn't going to be a profitable endeavor <em>unless</em> you can spin up a Class Action Suit. The legal fees are almost <em>always</em> going to exceed the value of a single video, unless it's one of those Super-Viral videos. That would require a single company to be <em>very stupid</em> in making mass-claims on things that they don't actually have legal rights to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there a good chance YouTube's user agreement, like so many user agreements, wouldn't standup in the face of a reasonable person's assumption about their intellectual property? It's been ruled before that EULAs have no legal bearing and I can imagine this would apply even more to something as high stakes as foregoing thousands to millions of euro (yes, millions for the biggest YouTubers) of intellectual property.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This has never happened in any country that I can find. There are individual EULAs or, more commonly, individual provisions of EULAs that have been overturned, but EULAs themselves are generally binding.</p>
<p>In any case, YouTube uses Terms of Service, not a EULA. There's some overlap but there are differences between the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the Youtube system doesn't work like you describe anymore. As far as creators have talked about it, the ad revenue gets put in a holdings until the claim has been resolved and whoever wins the dispute gets the revenue share.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh. They finally implemented that? That explains why Nintendo stopped claiming everyone's videos and trying to do their own Creator's Program.</p>
<p>In that case... the only good cause for a suit doesn't exist anymore. Granted, you might still get something on a Takedown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn't YouTube change the rules so that all revenue earned while a claim is in dispute is put in holding until after the claim is settled? As a means of limiting people claiming new videos and siphoning 30 days of revenue while they didn't dispute their claim so it dropped off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn't know that. If YouTube has changed that, then they've cleaned up most of the problem.</p>
<p>It'd be a lot harder to handle a claim on a false takedown than revenue leeching. Mostly because it'd be hard to prove damages if you can't point to the paper trail.</p>
<p>Might still have a chance if the other dude wins the dispute. Assuming YouTube still does the bullshit where their default judgement defaults to the person claiming the infringement at the end of the month, and your only option after that is lawsuit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>YouTuber's don't have a case. YouTube reserves the right to take down any content they see fit, for any reason. YouTuber's however, don't have a right to have their stuff on there. So, technically it isn't &quot;theft&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Plus, when you create an account, you specifically agree to these terms. It is not theft, and there is no legal basis for a YouTuber to sue YouTube for removing his/her content, because it is explicitly stated that YouTube has the ability to do so. By agreeing to the terms and conditions, you acknowledge this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because you &quot;agree&quot; to terms does not mean they are necessarily legally binding. I could sign a contract stating I have to work for free 365 days a year 10 hours a day or a contract stating that I can only ever work at this one company for the rest of my life, that doesn't make it legally enforceable. In this case, however, you were right but I just thought it was worth mentioning this is not always the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true - a contract must abide by the law to be enforceable. You can't sign a contract with a cocaine dealer and then take him to court when you get ripped off, for example. However, it's safe the assume that YouTube would have made ensured that their terms are legally binding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The argument that the other side would make in this case is that the terms of the YouTube agreement did not require either party to violate the law whereas the hypothetical employment contract would require the employee to be scheduled outside of what employment law allows and is thus, illegal.</p>
<p>Youtube would further maintain that they are under no obligation to host the videos in question as you (the content producer) are not paying them to do so and, as stated in the YouTube agreement, they can terminate hosting for any stated reason or no reason with no recourse (or however it's actually worded). There's no requirement that the stated reason even be correct or truthful.</p>
<p>You might be able to make a case that YouTube cause your company financial harm but cutting off their source of income, but (assuming YouTube's covered their bases) this was waived in the YouTube agreement as well. And being that that's not a crime, only a civil liability issue, that's totally something that holds up in an agreement.</p>
<p>To explain just a bit different: A contract stating you would have to work for free is illegal because an employer cannot legally make you work for free. On the other hand, a contract stating you won't necessarily be compensated for content you create is totally legal (as you're not <em>required</em> to produce content in the first place).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. The person suing has to prove that YouTube isn't allowed to take down content as it sees fit. Copyright or no, YouTube almost certainly reserves the right to stop hosting anything at any time.</p></div>		</li>
