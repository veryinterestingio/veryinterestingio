			<div class="markdown"><p>There’re several promising developments happening in vaccinology. For example, keep an eye out for a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Results from a major RSV vaccine trial are expected very soon. RSV is the biggest cause of viral pneumonia across the world. For several decades, our efforts to develop a childhood vaccine against this virus have been frustrated for various reasons. Now a new strategy to protect babies by vaccinating mothers is being tried. The initial results look very promising. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for the imminent phase 3 trial results. There’re other areas where there’s a lot of activity but we are a little bit farther from a deployable vaccine. These include (but are not restricted to) malaria vaccines and a new vaccine against TB. </p>
<p>There are various challenges to developing a successful vaccine against some of the diseases. Often these challenges are disease/pathogen specific. For example, a new pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine would be very useful as not only an improvement in efficacy but also an increase in the longevity of response is badly needed. There have been several outbreaks of whooping cough associated with waning immunity of pertussis vaccine. There are many challenges to developing a new pertussis vaccine. The challenges include the fact that there’s no reasonable correlate of protection for pertussis i.e. a biomarker (e.g. antibody) level associated with protection against pertussis infection/disease. Similarly changing strains of flu make vaccine development against it challenging.</p></div>		</li>
