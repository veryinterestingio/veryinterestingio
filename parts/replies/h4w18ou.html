			<div class="markdown"><p>Key words there are if you're used to it. To anyone thinking about going from walking 10 minutes a day to 10 hours, don't. If you suddenly want to pursue a career in walking, build yourself up to it. Just like with anything, your body won't respond well to you suddenly doing something for a long period of time.</p>
<p>Having said all that though, walking is amazing and I highly recommend going for a walk a day, there are so many health benefits to it. As stupid as it sounds, it will also help with things like depression. But also don't feel bad if you only start walking 5 minutes a day to begin with, that's better than nothing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely agree. Recently started going for walks regularly in the past few months and already feeling less depressed. When I started, doing 2000m at a fast pace was exhausting but worked my way up and now walk 5000m no problem at a pretty decent pace the whole time. If I walk slower I can go further but I'm walking to get some light cardio as running will be too tough on my joints at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I‚Äôve heard second- and third-hand sources tell me walking is better for us than jogging, in terms of miles per day and the toll it takes on our body. Basically, walking X miles a day will have all the same benefits and far less negative repercussions as jogging the same distance in one day. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve heard it explained that we evolved for the first 100,000 years of our existence to be casually walking around a forest, gathering small quantities of high-calorie, high-fiber foods augmented with the occasional high-protein meal. Wild fruits and veggies, with the occasional small animal like a fish or bird. </p>
<p>So basically what Les Straud of Survivorman does in the Cook Island episode. Which he says, in the episode, was basically like camping and that he‚Äôd be willing to go an extra week or two because it was so easy and lovely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also your shoes come into play big time for walking. Ditch your lower body destroying heels, get a zero drop shoe and a wider toe box so your feet can do their job and protect the rest of your leg, so that your legs can protect your lower back.</p></div>		</li>
