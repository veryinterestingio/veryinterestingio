			<div class="markdown"><p>What if, say, you used a nail exactly 1 light year in length and it was made of the most dense material we know of. Would the density mean that pushing one end results in a faster reaction at the other? Or would it make no difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would make a difrerence because the speed of sound in the most dense material we know of will be pretty high.</p>
<p>But it's pretty high by speed-of-sound standards, and still nowhere near the ballpark of the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes the speed of sound so special?</p>
<p>Is this implying the speed of sound is the speed in which force traverses through a medium?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of sound is the speed with which an impulse travels through a medium. Sound is caused by a medium's molecules transferring vibrations to their neighboring molecules. Any vibration, a yell, a gunshot, or a push of a stick, travels through the medium because those molecules nearer the source transfer the impulse to those further out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you really want is the speed an impulse travels through something. Sound is such an impulse and it is a common reference point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is essentially what happens with electricity. The effect of electricity through a wire is closer to the speed of light than sound. But the elctrons themselves aren't moving at that rate through the wire</p></div>		</li>
