There are a few hypotheses proposed on the formation of Myofascial Trigger points or &quot;knots&quot; but most of the research in journals surrounding the formation and treatment of MFTs are considered low quality evidence i.e. The research is biased, has a small subject sample, have limited controls on external factors which may influence results, among other things. </p>
<p>The original theory of trigger point formation proposed by Travell and Simons (1996) use the Integrated theory, focusing around the excessive release of acetylcholine (neurotransmitter found in most motor end plates in skeletal muscle) causing contraction of muscle fibres.
During rhythmic contraction, muscles &quot;squeeze&quot; blood out of their local capillary systems, which cause local ischemia, but this is reversed once the muscle as relaxed.
In the case of a muscle spasm the small areas of a muscle can remain ischemic for a prolonged period, causing a build up of noxious and contractile biochemicals, further prolonging the contraction, with the noxious/nociceptive chemicals producing pain. </p>
<p>If we are to follow this theory into treatments for MFts:
Ischemic pressure used on trigger point by therapist &quot;squeezes&quot; out the noxious and contractile chemicals that have built up in the MFT in theory, releasing the contractions and removing potentially painful substances from local fibres.
Massage simulates muscle contraction, reintroducing blood flow, oxygen and glucose to the affected area and removing waste products. </p>
<p>This is the theory that I follow in my practice as a sports therapist/rehabilitator but I know the ideas surrounding this theory are shifting so that even MFT may no longer be an accurate name for these &quot;muscle knots&quot; </p>
<p>If anyone knows of any papers I should have a look at, I'm always open to suggestions! </p>
<p>ELI5:
Muscles knots are demons and massage is an exorcism</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^this. This is the correct answer. </p>
<p>All the other explanations provided, as plausible as they may sound, haven't been validated by research.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We know how to get them to let go, and likely what caused them (stress, working out, over worked etc) </p>
<p>But we don’t know at all WHY they medically happen.</p></div>		</li>
