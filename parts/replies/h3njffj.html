			<div class="markdown"><p>Grandmothers teach essential hunting techniques to their grandchildren, that will allow the pod to continue to prosper. Some pods have such specific hunting strategies that if the matriarch is lost before passing these on, it could be a serious detriment to the remaining Orcas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once read about a study based on church registers (births, weddings, deaths) in Northern Germany, Which showed a significant correlation between infant mortality and how much closer the family lived to the maternal vs paternal grandmother. The closer the family lived to the maternal vs the paternal grandmother, the lower the infant mortality was. The theory behind this is, that the paternal grandmother can never be sure whether or not the grandchild shares her DNA and therefore favors the children of her daughters. Another observation in this regard, which you can test for yourself, is that maternal grandparents are often referred to by their grandchildren as „grandma/grandpa first name“, where as paternal grandparents are often referred to as „grandma/grandpa from place where they live“.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't work in Denmark, what with our system of &quot;momdad, mommom, dadmom, daddad&quot; (though some areas prefer &quot;grandfather and grandmother&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read, many dolphins practice pod-parenting (alloparenting) where other members of the pod can act as co-parents, but there isn't necessarily a family connection between a young dolphin's parents and alloparents.</p>
<p>Orcas and their close relatives the pilot whales (which have a similar matrilineal pod structure) are the only mammals other than humans that exhibit menopause.</p></div>		</li>
