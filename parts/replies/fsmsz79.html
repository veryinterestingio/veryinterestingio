			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite is the light bulb. The intention was to push back the darkness, but now we know that there is a health linkage to light. Humans have a growth mode and a repair mode which is switched on and off by the type of light. Blue light puts us into growth mode. Electric lights (like blue LEDs and CF bulbs) have lots of blue in them. So, it ends up that we are slightly taller than our ancestors because of the lights.</p>
<p>I had no idea about light and how there was a health linkage, so this really blew my mind. I also did not know that reducing blue light was a serious thing. It is. We should have blue light in the day, and have redder light at night to live more healthily. </p>
<p>So that is my favorite. Who knew?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you control for nutrition and other factors when claiming that blue light is the reason we are taller than our ancestors?  Are there any studies that demonstrate a causal effect?  I've never heard of this before so it would be neat to do some reading on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we are under the light we are in growth mode, with that we grow taller.  This nugget came from an NIH scientist who I interviewed for my book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/alchemy-us" target="_blank"><em>The Alchemy of Us</em></a>.  I thought this was mindblowing, too.</p></div>		</li>
