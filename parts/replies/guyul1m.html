			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose this is somewhat relative. </p>
<p>Earths atmosphere is much denser than, say, Mars. But in a gas giant you get 10x, 100x, 1000x, etc more dense than earths as you go deeper into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Eventually you get enough pressure to force the gasses into a liquid state, even with the very high temperatures involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A thick atmosphere. Moving through it will become harder and harder. Think of moving through water but it is not liquid but gas. At some point it is as dense as you so you float in the atnosphere and can't fall any deeper.</p></div>		</li>
