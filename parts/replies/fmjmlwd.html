			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you essentially digest the organic material you swabbed, and then replicate any nucleic acids in your sample. From there it’s a matter of putting the puzzle pieces back together to see if it matches known viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait until you hear about how much of your DNA is viral DNA and the bacteria that resides on/in you! Anyways don't worry yourself too much about asymptomatic viruses residing in your body, your immune system does an amazing job of containing most pathogens you pick up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 92% is referring to finding at least one strain of virus, it isn't saying that those people had the same virus in their body (black bear vs polar bear) afaik. Anyways every virus is it's own protein, there is no species wide mutation, it would have to start from square one as CommonVirus-# and if it is that similar then many people's immune system would quickly recognize it after contact.</p></div>		</li>
