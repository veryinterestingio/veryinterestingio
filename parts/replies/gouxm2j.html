			<div class="markdown"><p>Raman scattering is actually a one-electron-two-photon-process. It is believed that the Raman active molecule absorbs all the energy of the first photon and releases some of them by <del>geberating</del> generating a new photon at the same time.
Photons are quantised. So their energy can't be partially released. It's all or nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flourescence happens in three steps: A molecule absorbs a photon and one electron gets excited. In the next step the electron changes its energy state and loses some energy without emitting visible light. It is still excited, though. This can happen by radiating infrared or by excite molecular vibration and a bunch of other stuff. The last step is emitting a new photon less energetic than the absorbed one. The electron returns to its original energy state.</p></div>		</li>
