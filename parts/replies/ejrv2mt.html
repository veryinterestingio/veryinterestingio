<p>My physics professor says that cloud cover can't be accounted for in any accurate way. I dont believe that is really true, there have to be ways smart people have devised to handle this lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically any modeling process introduces some degree of uncertainty. Modeling the weather 10 minutes from now? Really small uncertainty. Modeling the weather exactly 24 days from now? Pretty high uncertainty.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, clouds introduce more uncertainty than just about any other part of climate modeling. Of course, there's variation here too. We're pretty sure about how high level clouds work: they're big, they seem to be controlled relatively few factors, they shouldn't change too drastically with temperature changes, etc.</p>
<p>Low-level clouds---particularly in the ocean tropics---are another issue. They're often very small, they're controlled by a variety of factors (some of which aren't perfectly understood), and their behavior might change pretty drastically as temperature increases. Just about every paper on the subject begins by noting that low-level clouds introduce more variation into contemporary climate models than any thing else does. </p>
<p>So your physics professor isn't wrong per se: clouds are hard, contemporary models don't and can't really model all of them perfectly. Can they be accounted for <em>accurately</em>? That depends on the cutoff for accuracy. Is the accuracy high enough to know that we're in trouble if we don't do something about global warming? Yes. Is it high enough to be able to say whether it will be cloudier in (I don't know) London in 50 years than it is now? No.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you except for the last paragraph: there are certain issues where it would be interesting to know how a specific region's weather will change. My large city has endured a drought and heat wave in the last summer. Possibly this could happen on a regular basis, every other summer being really hard to bear for my special pets: plants. I plan gardens, and there are already candidates on the list which I will not use again in any garden that were the usual go-to solution before since they all died. I came to this thread to maybe find some way to get specific info, but you are probably right and we'll just have to experiment, which is time- (and plant-) consuming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clouds are modeled via radiation, micro physics, and convective parameterization schemes which are ‘separate’  coupled subroutines that run along the dynamical core. These parameterizations are used to replicate the physics within the modeling grid, as most climate models have grid resolution around 50 or so kilometers. These parameterizations are based on combinations of approximations, inference of radiative transfer concepts, and tuning the model to observation and they are a leading source of model uncertainty. Your prof is not wrong, but model developers do the best they can with the current resources and knowledge. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That is true and laudable, but also wildly missing the point.</p>
<p>&quot;Trying your best&quot; in the context of chaotic system is being honest and accurate about uncertainties. The point is that the &quot;scientific consensus&quot; narrative is dangerous, irresponsible and highly unscientific when by your own admission the system is unable to resolve thunderstorms.  That's a lot of uncertainty in a system like this. </p>
<p>The sorts of claims that &quot;trying our best&quot; is a rational basis for certainty or consensus on something like CAGW betray a shocking ignorance of chaos theory. I am aware that the claim is that the average of weather becomes a well-behaved, predictable system, but that is a falsifiable claim that has been falsified. Not even the IPCC makes that claim (they call climate a complex dynamical system as well).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are so many variables, known and unknown that it's a complete dice toss when you understand it.  Even down to the lack of control in how the data is collected.  I know you want to believe the science and all,. It there is a lot of junk science out there.  </p>
<p>Look how many times we've studied the egg and it's impact on health.  It's bad, it's good, it's bad again.  That's one thing.  </p>
<p>Now imagine a thousand things we know about and a few thousand we haven't discovered.  And try to build a program to tell us what's gonna happen in 50 years. </p></div>		</li>
