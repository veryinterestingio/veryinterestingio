			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, I've read that lighter skin allows more vitamin D production from the sun as a tradeoff.</p>
<p>Humans from near the equator (more sun year round) tend to have darker skin because they need more sun protection. Humans from farther away have lighter skin because they need to produce enough vitamin D from less sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the 'other biological molecules' in the skin are the ones responsible for vitamin D production. So the more melanin you have, the less UV reaches those molecules and the less vitamin D you produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh that makes total sense. So the amount of melanin is a balancing act.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mentioned melanin has two subtypes - eumelanin and pheomelanin. Our skin color is determined by the distribution of both. Light skin and especially redheads have primarily phenomelanin which is chemically weaker and more susceptible to UV damage. Dark skin types have mostly eumelanin which is comparable to a thick layer of sunscreen.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then why are birth marks more likely to become cancerous? Wouldn't they have more melanin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that they are not.</p>
<p>The long answer is it depends.  Some giant melanocytic nevi can be, but these are really big (covering an entire limb or more).  The presence of many nevi is a risk factor, but the most likely area where melanomas develop is still from normal skin and not an existing nevus.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cancers are caused by errors in the genetic code of the cell. Having more melanin might protect the cells from genetic code damage via UV light, but it doesn't mean they can't have errors through other sources. It could be that birth mark cells have an inherent tendency to naturally have genetic errors that lead to cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't birth marks basically the remnants of genetic errors? I remember learning something that moles are like pre cancerous skin cells that never became malignant.</p></div>		</li>
