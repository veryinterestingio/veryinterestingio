<p>I wanted to add, that there are a variety of things that can be represented as the &quot;tools and equipment they need for the job&quot; including other backpackers in the form of additional executables or maybe a dynamic library, art especially in video games, or configuration files that allow you to customize the behavior of the application. Having all these extra files separate from the application means that if any of those things need to be updated, you don't have to download a whole new version of the application, you can just download the files that changed.</p></div>		</li>
