<p>The moon has a very small effect on earth's rotation</p>

<p>That is not correct.</p>
<p><a href="https://sciencenorway.no/forskningno-norway-planets/what-would-we-do-without-the-moon/1433295" target="_blank">Perhaps the most important effect of the Moon is the way it stabilizes our rotation. When the Earth rotates it wobbles slightly back and forth on its axis. It’s like a top, which doesn’t simply spin in a vertical position on a table or the floor. But without the Moon we’d be wobbling much more.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars has two moons and while I assume neither is as big as ours they're still big enough to be &quot;moons&quot; and not some other kind of classification of satellite and also Mars itself is much smaller than Earth too so the difference is probably negligible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see no reason to suspect that this is true. Life exists everywhere on the planet that has carbon, water, and energy. There is tons of carbon, water, and energy on land. If tides had not been here to accelerate it, life would have moved on to land more slowly, but there is absolutely no doubt that it would have found ways to colonize land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It exists everywhere it does because conditions are as they are. </p>
<p>Considering the timescale of the evolution of life, there's no reason to think that sans tides life wouldnt still be confined to the oceans even if land based life is inevitable here given solar tides.</p></div>		</li>
