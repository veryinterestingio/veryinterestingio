<p>If space contains any kind of intrinsic energy, what does having more space mean for conservation of energy? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Energy is not conserved in cosmology. As space expands you have more dark energy because dark energy has a constant density.</p>

<p>When it is near matter, can it increase the mass/energy in and around galaxies, and help curve spacetime so they rotate faster?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, that's not how it works. Dark energy is already everywhere. If you are suggesting it has anything to do with dark matter then no. The numbers don't even work out for that (let alone dark energy not behaving gravitationally in that manner at all).</p></div>		</li>
