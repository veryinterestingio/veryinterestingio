			<div class="markdown"><p>Some hypothesis state that it’s not the same for all people. For example if your lineage is from high up in the northern hemisphere then your ancestors evolved when there were 16 hours of night time. That means you needed to spend a large chunk of night awake, and likely resulted in extended bifurcated sleep cycles rather than one long one— plus if its cold you gotta add more wood to the fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the book, if you do not feel rested when waking up, you have not had the necessary quality of sleep. You might have had the quantity, but not the quality. An example could be going to bed tipsy or drunk and sleeping 8 hours, but not having sufficient REM sleep and thus not feeling rested upon awakening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's normal to wake up in-between sleep phases, and your body handles falling back asleep just fine. Being woken in the middle of sleep phases, having them disrupted, is what would affect sleep quality in the way you're thinking of. </p>
<p>Your body also has a wake-up phase that takes 30+ minutes, and you want to complete that process after 7-8 hours of sleep if your intention is to be awake, alert, attentive. If your intention is to fall back asleep, go ahead and disrupt the wake-up phase. After 8 hours of sleep, we get diminishing returns at best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I hate to be the one to inject this into the discussion ... but unless you are doing something like drinking 96oz of water a few <em>hours</em> before bedtime ... this shouldn’t really happen.</p>
<p>I can hear it now from many reading this - “it’s not unusual at all!  I usually have to get up in the middle of the night to pee too!  Totally normal.”</p>
<p>And so here’s the deal - I do hope that is normal for you.  But it’s called nocturnia and it is frequently associated with sleep disorders.  In my case, sleep apnea (severe).</p>
<p>Getting up to pee in the middle of the night was just a normal part of my life for years ... at least a decade.  But once I got my sleep apnea diagnosis and put on CPAP, my times going to pee in the middle of the night over the course of a year ... I could count on one hand.</p>
<p>I seriously hope no one has sleep apnea.  It’s a horrible condition.  But my nighttime peeing literally stopped in less than a week once I was on CPAP.</p>
<p>Get yourself tested if you have any concerns.  There are simple single-use home sleep tests you can order from Amazon like the WatchPAT-1 which can give you a very good reading.</p></div>		</li>
