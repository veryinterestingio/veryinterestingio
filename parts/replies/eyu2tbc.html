			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Jumped off a cliff in Bermuda and didn't have arms in. Dislocated my left shoulder and had to swim with one arm to an exit cave. Arm was out for over an hour before it was able to be reset by a Dr. Torn labrum, hills sachs lesion, surgery</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask how your shoulder is doing now? Can you do pullups, weight lifting and not worry your shoulder will pop out? I've had mine pop out about 7 of 8 times over the last 20 years. Was told by the first doctor who put it back I had a 90% chance of it coming out again and after 3 times it comes out I should get surgery. Never done it because I was worried about the surgery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the guy you asked but I've had my shoulder pop 3 times over the last 5 years. Last time it happened I went to the doctor desperate cause I was big into weightlifting.
He told me surgery wasn't worth it cause it is very painful and the staple will lose its effect over the course of a few years.
Tears were shed and a deep depression was born that day. It fucking broke me.</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you dislocate your shoulder you're fucked for life, please take care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am 3 years post surgery on both shoulders, 12 months apart. My left arm feels stable but occasionally it feels like it's about to come out. I sometimes have stiffness and clicking. Surgeon said I will deal with arthritis later in life. My right shoulder was missing 1/3 of its socket from an injury and multiple dislocations over an 8 year period. I had a laterjet procedure (google it, pretty cool). After living with the constant threat of dislocation for so long my mind is retrained to know what my limits are. I can still throw balls and do pull ups but have to be careful. If you have insurance or can afford it, I recommend getting it fixed sooner rather than later, as the recovery is not a fun process</p></div>		</li>
