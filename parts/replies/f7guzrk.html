			<div class="markdown"><p>Copper sulfate is a decent herbicide. </p>
<p>I had a client with copper gutters. We tried harvest rain off the roof to use for irrigation and it took us a while to figure out why all the plants died. Turned out we were irrigating with copper sulfate. </p>
<p>Not sure if you want to drink it but interesting to hear about the penny in the tank. Cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait so how did the sulfates get there?</p>
<p>I understand the copper part, however I am curious as to how the rainwater created copper sulfate.</p>
<p>Was the rain contaminated with sulfur compounds? Or were you using sulfates to sterilize the water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We definitely did not add sulphates. I can only assume it was from the quality of the rainwater. This system was in Southern California so not the best air quality. The copper was the only different part of the system with the rest being pvc fittings into a poly tank. </p>
<p>I wonâ€™t claim to fully understand the chemistry but do know that when we changed out the copper gutters we stopped killing plants. Main takeaway was that copper gutters are nice aesthetically but poor for functionality if used for irrigation. Also crazy expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my undergrad years in university I did research in a Microbiology lab regarding silver and it's antimicrobial properties. In conjunction with the engineering department we developed a silver nanofoam that can be used to coat surfaces and essentially keep the surface sterile. When I first started I had to do tons of reading into silver and its past uses. The ancient Egyptians, Romans, Greeks and Phoenicians all have record of using silver as an antimicrobial. The most common practice was storing water in silver containers. In fact, Greek historian Herdotus chronicled that no Persian king would drink water that was not stored in a silver container. This practice was crucial in military operations where fresh water was not available up until WWII. It was such a fun and interesting project. The engineering department ended up patenting the silver nanofoam and used all my physical experimentation to demonstrate it works!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as silverware. It's likely Silver was used as well, especially in the Eastern part of the country, due to an abundance if silver-ore there.</p>
<p>The Royals and Dukes here have likely used silver mainly.</p>
<p>I thought I should add Brass handles on door-knobs serve much the same purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brass door knobs. Wow! Who would of figured. I mean, people would just look at it and say it's a door knob. Most wouldn't realize it has an underlying purpose.</p>
<p>Also, the silverware. If it was silver, it could also test for arsenic. I know that because growing up I always heard stories about how Pancho Villa would always eat his food with silver silverware just in case someone tried to poison his food. So maybe the Royals and Dukes had a second purpose for them?!</p></div>		</li>
