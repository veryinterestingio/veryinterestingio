			<div class="markdown"><p>I really doubt this is the explanation, because</p>
<ol>
<li>My memory of sounds that &quot;hurt my teeth&quot; don't involve <em>loud</em> sounds, which would cause stronger resonance.</li>
<li>I can listen to a sine sweep that covers every frequency in the audible range and none of them &quot;hurt my teeth&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>It's probably psychological.  For me, it's triggered by things that sound &quot;dry&quot; and &quot;woodlike&quot;.  Like a squeaky pencil sharpener.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I’ve determined that wood products rubbing against each other hurts my teeth both to hear or think about. Ex: wood spoon lightly scrapes against cardboard-like eco-friendly bowl. I also have to be really careful with popsicle sticks. If it rubs against my teeth it fucks me up psychologically and I don’t know why. Sometimes these sensations are so bad it makes me stutter and I can’t think and I get stuck in a loop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the thought of licking a dry popsicle stick or god forbid one of those <a href="https://i.redd.it/1dtzi6dg0li21.png" target="_blank">wooden spoons</a> that comes with those tiny ice-creams, makes my body pucker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is wild to me that people actually relate to this. I’ve always been called weird for it. One time I was doing a lab procedure and I needed to essentially rub two Kim wipes against each other repeatedly and it messed me up in my brain and I couldn’t stop stuttering so I only used one Kim wipe. It made the process slower than it normally would be but there was no way I was gonna get it done the normal way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think it probably has more to do with an unpleasant sound causing you to tense your jaw and that could negatively impact the nerves in some way. Similar to TMJ people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, all materials have resonance frequencies.  The sound waves causing pain are likely occurring at a resonance frequency of your tooth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound is wavey air, just like tidal waves are wavey water. Frequency is the time between the top/bottom of waves. Both effects only happen when you have many atoms and don't compare to the radioactive/magnetic
forces that normally cause atoms and electrons to vibrate so fast that they are impossible to follow (heisenberg uncertainty).</p>
<p>It's like asking if there are tidal waves in a cup of water, or even an eye dropper. Technically, there might be depending on your definition, but its insignificant for all practical purposes so we say there aren't.</p>
<p>Afaik anyway.</p></div>		</li>
