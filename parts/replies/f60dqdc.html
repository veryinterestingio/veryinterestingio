<p>When it just rolls smoother than cheap Chinese pen.</p>

<p>Funny you mention the Chinese.   Up until very recently ( last few years) the Chinese were unable to manufacture their own ball point pen components beyond the barrels and caps.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have made the balls for pen for decades now. They just utterly sucked, and guess what bad pen is not the end of the world for most people. Sometimes you can find a good one among the bad and use it till the last drip of ink.</p>
<p>In a related news, China actually imports most chopsticks and toothpicks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you genuinely believe this....? That they are unable to make a tungsten carbide ball. Think about this for a minute. Logically consider the plethora of items entirely manufactured in China. Does it seem likely that the PRC couldn't make a ball point pen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were unable to make a ball <em>with very tight tolerances with their own tooling</em>. Compared to most consumer (e.g., phones with imported chips and camera components) and industrial (e.g., steel where you can go full percentage points out of spec and it doesn't matter) manufacturing applications, it's a very very difficult task.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one ever said that they were unable to make it at all - they were just unable to make it cheaply enough that it was worth it to make it themselves vs importing.</p></div>		</li>
