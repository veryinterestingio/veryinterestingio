			<div class="markdown"><p>The air inside your house is much more contaminated than the air outside. So the little bit the plane does is actually overshadowed by the amount of fresh(er) air coming on from outside. The air in your home does not really circulate and is full of contaminated from yourself, pets, cleaning products, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this, especially when were talking about new furniture or just any kind of new stuff you put in your house, that &quot;new house/furniture/whatever&quot; smell is actually your new couch offgassing and releasing potentially not so good chemicals. The outside is almost always better than inside air unless maybe you live in a major city in China, then maybe dont open the windows.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the US at least, the majority of new homes are built with central HVAC, which does circulate air. My system even has an “air clean” function that circulates the air through the filters at X interval.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's still not much compared to wind circulation. That system cleans and reuses the air already present in your home, while the wind brings in new clean air while removing the old. That can have its own problems, but only when the problem is just as large-scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could that not depend on the state of your house and where you live? Like an inner city apartment with no pets, a heavy-duty air purifier, etc. I imagine would a lot less contaminated than the outside?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really doesn't, it's about dilution, the outside is mixed very well by wind, vertical currents and local geography, the inside of your house has very little volume of air that becomes toxic within hours.</p>
<p>The exception would be an air purifier in every room living immediately next to busy intercity street.</p>
<p>Ifyou don't believe me have a look at any of a huge number of air quality interactive maps like <a href="https://airly.eu" target="_blank"><a href="https://airly.eu" target="_blank">https://airly.eu</a></a></p>
<p>The worst polution you can think of from Diesel in the winter drops in dilution to the next street block exponentially, and the air fully cleans up to mountain forest levels within an hour of peek traffic. Same with huge industrial dumps of NO2 or air from beer fermentation.</p>
<p>So depending on where you live and how big the room is and what the map says about air quality outside you want to open the windows about twice a day in the morning before the traffic and in the evening before you go to sleep. For small home office either a purifier and a humidifier or open the windows more often.</p></div>		</li>
