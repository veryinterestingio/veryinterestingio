			<div class="markdown"><p>To further emphasise this point, sometimes a nap right after eating is common. The bacteria party gets even worse in that case, because you still have food hanging out in the crevices in your teeth. If you have something, really anything, that has sugars in it, you will wake up tasting Satanâ€™s bumhole because sugars happen to be very fun for your saliva to breakdown and the result is a very nasty tasting concoction. Generally, <em>never</em> fall asleep with recently eaten chocolate, sweets, or bread in your mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>with a nap, normally you sleep for ~2 hours, while sleeping for the night you sleep for closer to 8 hours. And if your breath smells fine, it's just because of &quot;nose blindness&quot; for sure, your breath will skin the back of your tongue all night so you'll be smelling it all night.</p>
<p>Brush 2-3 times a day with a soft bristle tooth brush and floss every time you brush (or whatever your dentist recommends)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, but what about times where I don't brush before a proper sleep cause I just crashed on the sofa?</p>
<p>Naps still leave that taste, but 8+ hour sleeps dont.</p></div>		</li>
