<p>I don't know what your problem is with new tabs but I'm going to continue opening new ones <em>constantly</em> while telling myself I'm definitely going to need it later, keeping them all open until eventually the browser is taking up all of my RAM and <em>everything</em> goes to hell.</p></div>		</li>

Could you like attach them with those sticky pads they use for medical tests? How much weight would be needed to effectively grow your facial muscles. </p>
