			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't watch TV or play games, they'll wake you up and likely engage you. Reading can be good, but try to do something that uses your brain less</p>
<p>Go get a glass of water without turning on the light, go sit in the dark and drink it, and just go back to bed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are supposed to only do something else for a limited time before trying to sleep again.   If you regularly have sleep issues, you should look into something called &quot;sleep hygiene&quot; and follow it closely, even so much as covering little LED lights.  It surprisingly works for most people, as someone who usually has to take sleeping medications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never used my bed for anything other than sex and sleeping, and still occasionally have trouble sleeping. Getting up and doing something else has always been my go-to. My wife tried telling me to just lay there and relax, but that usually just leads to me laying in the dark for several hours not sleeping, or doing anything else that might have been more entertaining or fun.</p></div>		</li>
