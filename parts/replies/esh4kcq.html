<p>We will be monitoring changes in the atmosphere and surface over Titan's day for \~60 Titan days to see how things change over time and from place to place.  This will help us understand the methane cycle.</p>
<p>We'll be measuring the composition of the sand dunes and other materials on the surface which will include the material produced in the atmosphere.</p>
