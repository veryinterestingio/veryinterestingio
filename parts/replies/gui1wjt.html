			<div class="markdown"><p>Not my field, but I'm guessing horizon refers to the boundary within which coprolites are found in that region (it implies that they're fairly localized). It's common in other disciplines to use horizon to refer to a boundary of some sort; e.g. in control theory and RL, the horizon is the number of time-steps you look ahead when making a decision, and in physics it's the boundary within which light is unable to escape a black hole. It sounds a bit... different... when used in the context of fossilized poo, but I think that's what it's referring to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horizon in this case is kind of like how the word &quot;lens&quot; is used to describe a large piece of jade boulder Rock. It's just an area with many of those certain types of fossils.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comparison doesn't help me to understand the concept of horizon in this context, because I don't understand how, when, or why a jade boulder would be called a &quot;lens&quot;.  Can you elaborate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horizons are specific layers of rock. They often mark deposition during an event, the first/last associated with some change, or are notably rich/poor in some component. In this case, it is a layer presumably rich in coprolites.</p></div>		</li>
