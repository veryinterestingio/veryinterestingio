			<div class="markdown"><p>The first scientific answer. I've seen this question before and the answer is the sameâ€” basically, &quot;you think you do, but you dont.&quot;</p>
<p>If presented with a bunch of pictures of sunsets and sunrises, you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The only exception is smog and pollution, which is more present at night than in the morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can confirm, I live in a place with as close to zero air pollution you really get in populated areas (low pop, constant high wind, coastal and all the other good stuff) and there's really very little difference.</p>
<p>Beyond instinctively knowing if it's morning or evening and sometimes a small difference in water vapour (and the obvious sun rising in the east thing), I definitely couldn't see a difference between the two in a picture. A few seconds of video probably gives enough away, but not a still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, they could, but likely that's an extra step that wouldn't be taken, and, depending on what else is in the frame, it might add other weirdness.</p>
<p>An example of extra steps not taken is night sky seen in films.  It's usually just a generic night sky with no regard given to location and time of year (another thing Tyson has griped about).</p>
<p>A classic one that has old roots is the &quot;eagle cry&quot; is westerns and similar movies.  It's not an eagle, it's the cry of a red-tailed hawk.  Bald eagles don't have impressive calls, but red-tailed hawks to, so they just use that instead and assume that no-one will pay attention to the fact that it's the wrong call.</p>
<p>That sort of casual approach to the environmental aspects of the setting of films is common.</p>
<p>One of my favorites is in <em>Troy</em>, where they have a bunch of llamas running out of the city... llamas being South American animals, and not known to anyone in the Old World at the time.</p></div>		</li>
