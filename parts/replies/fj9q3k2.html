			<div class="markdown"><p>So when the distance increases by a factor of 100, the field strength goes down by a factor of 10^(43), instead of 10^(4). At a distance of 10^(-18) meters (less than the size of a proton), the weak force is still effective, but when you get to 10^(-16) meters, it's practically gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't need to. Take, for example, the 2nd law of thermodynamics - what the 2nd law tells us is that it's extremely unlikely that events will occur in an isolated system on a large scale that decrease entropy - not that they can't. </p>
<p>Physicists like saying stuff is 0 when it's just <em>really</em> close to 0, and for good reason. It makes our lives easier when we don't bother accounting for factors that ultimately don't play a notable role in a result.</p></div>		</li>
