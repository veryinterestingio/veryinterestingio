			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, this is the first time I've heard about an antagonistic interaction between Vit C and B12. Can you point me to some reliable info about it?</p>
<p>A quick googling only turns up <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/357414" target="_blank">a paper from 1974</a>. But more recent research seems to provide evidence against the idea:</p>

<p>So yes. It seems like a waste of tablet space.
Unless you have a time-released multi vitamin  that separates the two. However i don't actually know which vitamins are separated in my time release tablet. And I also don't know how long it takes to digest the outer layer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not clear where Mayo Clinic is getting that information from. The Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State maintains a well-researched source about all things micronutrients, and they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Previous reports that megadoses of vitamin C destroy vitamin B12 have not been supported and may have been an artifact of the assay used to measure vitamin B12 levels.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and the Methylcobalamin form of B12 is even better than the most common Cyanocobalamin form. Look for ones that say sublingual or quick dissolve and put them under your tongue and let them dissolve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Nobody really needs to take vitamin supplements unless they're actually deficient in something and they can't get that nutrient by changing their diet. Even then it's better to take a supplement containing just the one thing you're deficient in. Nutrients from tablets aren't really bioavailable (in a form the body can use) so your body only takes in a small fraction of the vitamins and minerals in them. If you take a multivitamin loaded with a ton of things then you're going to get very little of the one nutrient you need. It's much better to eat foods containing whatever you need more of. It's much more bioavailable so you actually get a benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about minerals.  Iron, copper, manganese, zinc, molybdenum, chromium, selenium.  Some of these are pretty tough to get from diet. Ive also heard amino acid chelates are as bioavailable as food? It would be much more difficult to overdose minerals if  you didn't absorb much?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much every study ever done has shown multivitamins just get pissed out as they aren't very bio available. The more vitamins they have combined together in them the worse it gets as well. They're largely a marketing trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the get pissed out, they are by definition bioavailable. You can't get something from the intestine into the kidneys and bladder without passing through the bloodstream.</p>
<p>The problem isn't bioavailability but storage, because the water soluble vitamins can't really he stored in excess by the body. </p>
<p>So a high dose once will mostly get excreted through urine, because there's no place to store it, and you get neon yellow urine.</p>
<p>But that's not because of bioavailability. If you piss out everything it's by definition very well bioavailable.</p>
<p>The real problem in multivitamins is that they don't actually get absorbed at the same time, or require other things in food to be absorbed.</p>
<p>But those that you pias out aren't actually the problem. The ones that you shit out are the problem.</p>
<p>Not to mention that most people don't have a multivitamin deficiency, but are just lacking one vitamin if any at all.</p>
<p>And it's much more sensible to actually replenish the one you have proven through blood tests to be lacking with high dose of that single vitamin, rather than blindly taking a low dose multivitamin or at worst overdosing on them because you believe more helps more.</p>
<p>Any vitamin taken without a blood test, or atleast an indication like lack of sunlight is just wasted money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally useless is a strong way to phrase it, especially since there are plenty of other important vitamins and minerals in there that be used well in that form.</p>
<p>As far as B12 versus B complex the most important thing to keep in mind is that these are all VERY different compounds and they all play important roles. Adding to the complexity, some of the B vitamins, specifically B12, exist in multiple forms, which may or may not provide advantages over each other. Like I said in my first post in this thread, a dissolving sublingual B12 tablet is a great idea for anyone needing supplementation.</p></div>		</li>
