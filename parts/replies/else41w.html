			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the supernovae are throwing off a bunch of metal, but as individual molecules.  It ends up with a bunch of otherstuff gravitationally binding into a planet.   How do these iron molecules all come together as iron ore ( an actual 3 pound clump of iron for example) rather than being a bunch of iron atoms dispersed and floating in the magma or ocean?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the iron deposits we mine were formed leading up to the Great Oxidation event.</p>
<p>Oxygen created through photosynthesis bound to iron dissolved in the oceans creating massive banded formations. Also, some formations were created by anoxygenic iron-oxidizing bacteria. </p>
<p>The iron deposits we mine were either created by bacteria, or as a side effect of biological waste interacting with the environment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does this mean you wouldn't be able to mine any iron on other planets? Since no bacteria ever concentrated the iron into one place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iron gets separated from other elements through chemical and magnetic processes.</p>
<p>Iron is magnetic, so magnetic fields can nudge iron into areas that other elements might not drift into so readily.</p>
<p>Also, when items are mixed together with different densities, they'll form layers, with the more dense stuff tending to sink to the bottom.</p>
<p>Some elements like to bond with others more easily, drastically changing their density...  Water is much more dense than either hydrogen or oxygen alone.  Iron oxide is much less dense than pure iron...</p>
<p>Heat matters, too...  Since carbon and silicon will melt at lower temperatures than iron, a high speed collision between newly forming asteroids, meteoroids, or other small bodies will tend to blow these elements away, leaving large chunks of iron behind.</p>
<p>And, in planets like ours, this layering, churning, and clumping is more easily facilitated by repeated volcanic processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now, the question you replied to here received 2 answers of similar detail and precision, yours describing inorganic processes and the other describing organic processes.   It seems likely both were involved but the organic processes the other comment ID'd sound as though they would result in far greater concentrations, leading to the veins of ore miners find today.   </p>
<p>Anyone with a good foundation in these topics know which was more responsible for ore lodes?</p></div>		</li>
