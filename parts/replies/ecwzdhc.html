<p>Tracks are recorded and mixed to optimize the qualify on formats of the day like Vinyl or Tapes. Remastering a recording can help make it sound better in modern formats like Digital, CD's etc</p>

<p>A very simple example of how this can be different: you can't mix the bass too high on an album being released on vinyl. Too much bass will literally knock the needle out of the groove.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the biggest fixes is simply removing noise. The problem with multi track recording is that adding each track adds noise. But voice and various instruments only use certain frequencies, so for example you can filter out high and lows from vocal tracks, taking a lot noise with it. In this way you can clean up individual tracks and then mix them back together. Just that alone can hugely improve the quality of sound.</p></div>		</li>
