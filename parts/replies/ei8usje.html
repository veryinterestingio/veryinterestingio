			<div class="markdown"><p>But it should be. It was Einstein who said that if you can't explain it in simple terms, you don't understand it well enough.</p>
<p>I get that people want to give a very &quot;complete&quot; answer, so they keep adding detail. And, in my personal opinion, that's wrong.</p>
<p>A person can always go &amp; look up details once they understand the core concept. Or ask the correct questions if they're interested. But it's the core concept that's the important part, NOT the details. Providing too much detail risks losing sight of what's important.</p>
<p>There's an example on this thread where someone goes into some depth on how boards are structured, how they vote, etc. And that's interesting info. But it has fuck all to do with what a CEO actually does!</p></div>		</li>
