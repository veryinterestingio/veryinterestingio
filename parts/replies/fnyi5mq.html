			<div class="markdown"><p>The worst one IMO is this.  Somewhere near the Texas Oklahoma border they found a spring in the 1900s.  The spring was very interesting in that it was salt water from the salt underground.</p>
<p>They discovered completely unique species of crabs, fish, seaweed, barnacles, and other creatures.  Before researchers were able to truly study it, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built a dam around it and killed everything.</p>
<p>This is surely the only open surface saltwater spring that we will ever find.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, new word (for me).</p>
<p>&quot;A troglobite (or, formally, troglobiont) is an animal species, or population of a species, strictly bound to underground habitats, such as caves.&quot;</p>
<p>I like the ring of troglobiont. I wish I knew it when I was trying to get my gamer kids out of the basement.</p></div>		</li>
