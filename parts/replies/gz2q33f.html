			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of misinformation about Japan on Reddit is unbelievable. &quot;Japan is extremely overpopulated!!&quot; Is utter nonsense lol. The Tokyo metropolis, one of the most densely populated cites on Earth is very impressive with its efficiency of transportation, housing, recycling, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really the explanation. It's not overpopulated, other than a few major cities. But mainly just Tokyo.</p>
<p>The reason is because economic stagnation and opportunity. If you want to find work, you pretty much have to move to the city. Leaving abandoned houses, towns that used to be vibrant but are now just treading water and slowly drowning, etc. The population is aging, 30 years of economic stagnation leads to a declining tax base with rising expenses, minimal immigration, etc. While a declining population can lower real estate prices, people don't think about the smaller tax base, fewer people starting successful businesses, minimal innovation, and so forth.</p>
<p>As mentioned below, on Reddit and in general, there's so much misinformation and lack of understanding of Japan.</p></div>		</li>
