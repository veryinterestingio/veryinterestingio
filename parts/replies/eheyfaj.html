			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the key. Normally a phase change happens because the heat is going into or out of the thing and that causes a phase change. With salty ice, you force the phase change by another means and it has to pull in heat to complete it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>convection (heat transfer thru fluids like water and air) is usually much faster (better in the case of ice cream making) than conduction (heat transfer thru solids). having salty water/ice allows you to have colder liquid water (let's guess 20 degrees F). unsalted H2O at 20 degrees will be solid ice and is &quot;stuck&quot; using conduction, while salted H2O at 20 degrees will be liquid water and can take advantage of convection.</p></div>		</li>
