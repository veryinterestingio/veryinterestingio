			<div class="markdown"><p>They call them Lazarus taxons - species that vanished and then were found extant.</p>
<p>The coelacanth is the classic example, but there’s also the Laotian Rock Rat, the Nightcap Oak, and Bulmers Fruit Bat. All first described from fossils and then found extant later (in fact the rat and the oak were only found in the last 30 years).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The animals, especially ocean critters, I get... but it’s not like the tree went into hiding at night and was wary of humans. How does a tree species disappear and then come back? Where did it go?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wollemi pine is another example that comes to mind.  There are fossils of it dating from 200-2 million years ago but until 26 years ago was thought to be extinct. It was discovered growing in a remote canyon outside Sydney, only because one of the people exploring the canyon was a botanist and didn't recognize the species.  Interestingly the genetic variation among the existing trees is so low that there could at one point have only been one tree in existence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't so much disappear as we're never discovered until recently.  The original discovery would have been of a fossil, indicating that such a species of tree existed at some point in history.  At a later date living specimens would be identified and confirm that the species didn't become extinct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>another example of a tree lazarus taxon is the Dawn Redwood.  In that case, it was found in a relatively remote part of China during the 1940s, when the country was in the middle of a civil war.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didnt so much come up with renditions that look weird so much as create weird looking renditions to make the point that modern animals would look totally wrong without fat, soft tissue, or skin coverings. They were trying to show that depicting fossilized animals as all scales and sinew is likely a mistake. I dont think any researcher or artist &quot;mistakenly&quot; drew the modern animals incorrectly if thats what you mean by your comment.</p></div>		</li>
