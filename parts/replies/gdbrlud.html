<p>I can do both. Unfortunately, it's not really something I can share. Wiggling my eyes, in the other hand...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you yawn og gulp thetubes open a bit and equalizes the pressure. Babys and toddlers can't do that. So this is the reason they'll scream all the time. It's just the pain in their ears. To help them, hold its mouth shut and blow gently through the nose. You'll blow the little one up like a balloon a bit. That opens the Eustachian tube for a moment and equalizes the pressure. Give it a try. Works most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to still-in-progress development, the eustachian tube in babies' heads is also much more level (front-back) in babies, whereas in adults it's more of an incline (up-down, higher in the ears than the oral cavity).</p>
<p>This makes it much easier to get food/liquid/infections in the eustachian tube and into the ear, resulting in painful ear infections.</p></div>		</li>
