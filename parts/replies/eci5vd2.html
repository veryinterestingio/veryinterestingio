			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't watch the video but surely the noise happens because you have a giant sheet of flexible hard material. It's going to vibrate in lots of ways, similar to wobbling a thin sheet of metal. All sound travels at the same speed, unless it's traveling through something that isn't air</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in this case, the weird sound is caused by sound travelling faster through the ice than through the air. This makes the same distant sound arrive at you ears twice in rapid succession, meaning the sound may arrive out of phase with itself etc. </p>
<p>Low frequencies are more dampened with distance in ice than in air, hence you tend to hear the high frequencies first through te ice and then the low frequencies from the same origin through the air a split secobd later.</p>
<p>Or something like that.</p></div>		</li>
