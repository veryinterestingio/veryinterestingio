			<div class="markdown"><p>The most common example is a pumped laser medium.  To make a laser work, you take a collection of atoms that have an excited and a ground state, and arrange them so that <em>more</em> are in the excited state than in the ground state.  Systems like that have negative temperature, because if you add more energy (by exciting more atoms) you end up with <em>less</em> disorder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the first scenario, which accounts for pretty much everything you'd run into in your daily life, the two definitions are equivalent. You could prove mathematically that the disorder definition  gives that the temperature depends on the average speed / energy of the particles in the system. </p>
<p>However, the technical definition is from the change in entropy as you add and remove energy from the system, not from the average speed of particles. </p></div>		</li>
