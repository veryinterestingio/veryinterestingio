			<div class="markdown"><p>This gets into pattern recognition. </p>
<p>There was some study into painting patterns on diver's wet suits to make them resemble poisonous sea snakes. It seemed to work on sharks.</p>
<p>Opening day of dove hunting season, doves fly steady from their roosts to their feeding grounds, often a feed lot for cattle. They're easy to shoot on that first run. A few hours later, on their way back to their roosts, you can just point a finger at them and they take evasive action. They've learned to recognize a human pointing at them as dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: Nevermind, I'm assuming that the bear is &quot;used&quot; to lawnmowers and does not see them as a threat</p></div>		</li>
