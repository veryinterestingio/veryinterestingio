			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent point.  A large portion of the toys and illustrations of dinosaurs that children grow up with, even today, are created by non-paleontologists who simply make what they think the animals look like without finding any newer information.  Managing to change the public perception of dinosaurs is very difficult, as people are reluctant to give up the images they remember from childhood, and don't really have much motivation to take it seriously anyway.  Our dinosaur art is still living in the shadow of a film that was released almost 30 years ago, which at the time dragged the public eye out of the 20's.</p>
<p>I've seen some great new material for kids though that have pretty good dinosaurs.  Safari and Papo have been making toys that make me jealous of my 6 year old cousin, and last year I was able to buy him a children's book with beautiful feathered dinosaur illustrations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! Thank you very much for your insight. Do you know of any websites that have &quot;contemporary&quot; representations of what dinosaurs could've looked like? I'm really curious about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question if T. rex (or rather non-beaked theropods in general) has lips is a bit of a hotly discussed topic at the moment. I personally as an interested lay-person am on the lipped side, due to chemical analyses of the teeth as well as the fact that every single extant non-beaked non-marine tetrapod has lips.</p></div>		</li>
