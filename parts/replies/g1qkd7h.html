			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes because in some experiment a defining feature of the rats that were defective in it had their hair stand up like a hedge hog or something so the scientists named it that. Turns out it's super awkward because they didnt know how important it was and now doctors have to tell people there kids are dying because of a mutation on the sonic hedgehog gene.</p>
<p>Edit: it was in flies not rats that it was discovered.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Shh is a development gene- it’s used a few times in human development, it’s mainly studied to see how it helps the spinal cord grow (it’s used to tell which side of the spinal cord is the front/ ventral)</p>
<p>Shh was so named because basically: scientists in the 70/80s had a fun time cutting out all sorts of genes in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) now in fruit fly development there’s a phase where they make segments (<a href="https://steemitimages-com.cdn.ampproject.org/i/s/steemitimages.com/0x0/http://www.stephenandrewtaylor.net/images/sadava_19_19_FULL.jpg" target="_blank">https://steemitimages-com.cdn.ampproject.org/i/s/steemitimages.com/0x0/http://www.stephenandrewtaylor.net/images/sadava_19_19_FULL.jpg</a>)</p>
<p>Now in that bottom phase of development, just a few days earlier there was a time the segments went hairy/ no hairs / hairy/ no hairs etc etc. When researchers knocked out a specific gene, all the segments were hairy, the researchers then called this mutant a Hedgehog mutant, so the gene causing it was called Hedgehog</p>
<p>Over time researchers found homologues (copies of the gene in different species) of Hh, they called them Desert Hh, Indian Hh and Echidna. By the time the human one was discovered, Sonic was really popular, so a bunch of scientists called it that, and it stuck ever since!</p>
<p>Tl;dr scientists at the time named genes based on how mutants look- a fly with this mutation looked like a hedgehog, and sonic just so happened to be popular at the time!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you should count it because I added a simpler explanation where i said the true eli5 but as far as answering a very complex question I dont think I could have said it any simpler without giving an unsatisfying answer. Plus the only reason it really sounds complex is because you probably haven't heard some of those names before.</p></div>		</li>
