			<div class="markdown"><p>What it does is affect the heat sensing nerves by lowering the threshold of heat when they trigger, to the point where it's below skin temperature. Your very skin makes the nerves think the area is too hot so there must be a damaging environment like a fire according to your brain, but without any tissue damage. And this affect can occur elsewhere (pepper spray for instance, or getting the oil of a chili on your hands), though the effect is most prevalent on sensitive areas with more nerves, like mouth and sadly, anus, leading to a second experience 12 hours later. Water can temporarily lower skin temperature but it quickly rises again so something that can remove the chemical (milk) will have greater effect. </p>
<p>It's not actually about deterring mammals, that's just a happy side effect, because although mammals aren't as good at spreading seeds, they still are good at it. It's primarily about protecting immature fruit from microbial damage, in a way that doesn't deter birds and mammals. Humans end up liking the burn so we help the plants propagate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stupid question: In the Scooby Doo live action movie, Scoob eats a super hot chili or something and breathes fire, smoke comes out of his ears, he trashes the place, and then Shaggy squirts a whole bottle of ketchup onto his tongue. This does the trick. I saw this when I was a kid and thought I would try it. It seemed to work, but now I stick to milk and horchata. Does ketchup really have any ingredients which might help with this more than other foods or water would?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sugar. Ketchup real high in sugar.</p>
<p>Scolville scale is based on the amount of sugar needed for you to no longer taste the heat of a chilli.</p>
<p>If you cook something spicy and add too much spice you can add a bit of sugar to take the heat away.</p>
<p>Worked in a place that used the 2nd hottest chilli in the world for a sauce. Apple juice mixed with sugar syrups was my go to.</p>
<p>But scooby doo probably just thought ketchup was funny I doubt they'd base it on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well tomatoes supposedly have some soothing effect, but I think that's mainly fresh raw ones.</p>
<p>Most likely the ketchup was just a random gag or some reference to the Scooby branded ketchup they sold back in the day, he supposedly like ketchup a lot. Then again he like every kind of food so...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's my understanding that capsaicin binds to fat, which is why milk is a better choice than water when trying to extinguish the burn. I'd theorize that ketchup has even more readily available fats and oils to coat the tongue and carry away the heat, but that's just a guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a different nerve structure, but a slightly different channel.</p>
<p>Capsaicin binds to the TRPV1 Channel in nociceptor (pain-sensing) cells, which open up the channels. Long story short, this activates the cell which sends a signal that &quot;something is burning over here&quot; to the brain. Both acid, electrical stimuli, and temperatures above 43 degrees celsius can open the channel as well.</p>
<p>Birds and mammals have slightly different TRPV1 channels, however, and the bird version is just made in a way that capsaicin cannot open it. So while acid or heat could alert the bird to a burning sensation, capsaicin cannot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pepper heat is not the same thing as fire heat even though we call both of them &quot;hot&quot;. I'm not an expert at all, but capsaicin is described as a &quot;mammal irritant&quot; - so in other words, whatever it is that makes it hot, primarily affects mammals and not birds. So, in other words, I guess I would say it probably does mean birds react to hot peppers differently on a biological level. But fire is different, because fire is not peppers, fire is fire.</p></div>		</li>
