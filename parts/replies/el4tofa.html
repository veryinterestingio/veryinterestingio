			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of those wastes are trickier to use. The technology is not always ready yet.
There are plans to try to use them that are under way, but... It will take time.
Basically, with nuclear fission, if you reach a given mass of your fuel, it gets critical, which is the point where we use it, and if you get above that, then it goes to shit. With many of those other fuel, the critical points far less stable, and so it's not &quot;as easy&quot; as with uranium. But there are plans to use them in a safe way. For example accelerator driven systems, where rather than having a critical mass, you are sub-critical, and use a particle accelerator to keep the reaction up. But those system are still years from being able to produce energy, if ever. But they would be able to transform those long lived dangerous wastes into much shorter lived ones.</p>
<p>And as said above, many nuclear wastes aren't what you think. The majority of the mass of what is called nuclear waste come from things like the disposable gloves you wear when you have to manipulate things that have been exposed to ridiculously low level of radiation. You need tons of that to find anything radioactive on it, but you can find some, so it is nuclear waste. A lot of it isn't even produced by nuclear power plants. Particle accelerators are nuclear facilities, and generate this kind of nuclear wastes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not wrong, now getting a new twin PWR station built here and it is mysteriously £5billion more expensive than the one the same firm just completed in France and that was €3billion over budget, so guessing ours will come in at about £18-20billion once everything is deliberately run over. Also the consultation with the local community about how to mitigate any impact is still ongoing and we just received a letter from our M.P. saying that they have decided not use sea transportation and instead are going to compulsory purchase huge swathes, build new roads, new rail link and huge hostel for thousands of workers next to one of the most important bio diverse bird reserves in the country. Standard corporate listening exercise. Not anti nuclear, just anti corrupt lying bullshitters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not uneconomical, it's illegal. After Pakistan tested their nuke, every country with nuclear energy programs banned fuel reprocessing in order to prevent future proliferation. If reprocessing was allowed, then every reactor would be doing it, either by economic benefit or by law, as reprocessed waste only need storage for ~400 years, compared to the 300,000 years of non reprocessed waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I believe that was done by Carter in the late 70s (not good w history though). I'm not sure if we were labeling as 'waste' back then, but as far as I know we weren't using it to create more energy in our power plants either. </p>
<p>Now I dont know.... quick search says Regan lifted the ban in 1981.</p>
<p>As far as every plant would be doing it, that unfortunately, is not the case. Its like spending $10 on gas in an electric car vs classic. It is chump change and you would have to trade in the classic vs a whole tank of gas and how many miles. Before Carter our plants (not sure about the rest of the world, I believe more in Europe were designed originally to use spent fuel) weren't even built to reuse. Spending money to reprocess simply because it's more environmentally friendly... havent seen a lot of that in big companies myself, but maybe I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The solution for pollution is dilution.  This paradox was used in the 40s thru 60s for
years. The problem is that if everyone dilutes, then over time it’s not diluted and concentrations
build for time and created significant health risks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case I guess OP is asking &quot;well it came out of the ground, so can we not spread it back out and bury it in the mines we got it from?&quot;.  </p>
<p>But from the above explanation the issue is the fact the waste is not the same as the raw ore, it contains other compounds which cannot exist safely in the same environment.</p></div>		</li>

Why don’t people understand why the sea life is seeing high concentrations of
