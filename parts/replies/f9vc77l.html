			<div class="markdown"><p>Just figuring I’d piggyback here, shotguns are balls of lead. In general the smaller the shotgun gauge number the larger the actual barrel diameter. Unless you’re talking a .410 shotgun, which is a large pistol caliber for small game hunting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to this, effectively gauge means each ball weighs 1/X of a pound. 12 gauge weighs 1/12 lb. per ball. 20 gauge would be 1/20 per ball. hypothetically 1 gauge would be 1/1 lb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;00 buckshot&quot; refers to the actual ammunition used, not the diameter of the bore. The actual pellets in a shotgun shell are much smaller than the hypothetical lead spheres used to measure the gauge of the barrel.</p>
<p>The numbering system for shotgun ammo is relatively arbitrary, but it's similar to the gauge system in that #4 shot is much smaller than #0000 shot. The amount of shot in a shell and the choke at the end of the barrel determine the spread/effective range of the shell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>00 is the shot size not the gauge. Shot size measure the diameter of the pellet that is being shot, while gauge is a measurement of the barrel's bore based on a hypothetical 1lb of lead. A 12 gauge shotgun will often be used to shoot 00 Buck. The amount of 00 Buck you shoot is dependant on the shotguns gauge, and the length of the shell. You might fit 10x 00 Buck in a 2.75in 12 Gauge shell, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not quite, a 1 gauge shotgun would have a barrel big enough that if you made a sphere of lead with the same diameter, it would weigh 1 pound</p></div>		</li>

The number of lead balls of the same diameter that would be sum to a pound as well as<br />
The diameter of a single lead ball equal to a pound?</p></div>		</li>
