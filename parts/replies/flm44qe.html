			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, if you shook their hand or touched a surface they touched, you could spread the virus until it died on your hand (it wouldn't survive in your body). How long it lives on your hand isn't really known.</p>
<p>However, the likelihood of you spreading the virus that way is much lower than for an actually sick person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a really good read in regards to your question,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/03/25/coronavirus-survives-on-metal-plastic-cardboard-common-objects/2866340001/" target="_blank">https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/03/25/coronavirus-survives-on-metal-plastic-cardboard-common-objects/2866340001/</a></p>
<p>Ultimately it looks like it <em>can</em> live up to 3 days on stainless steel and 1 day in cardboard, but that isn't 100% of the time, actually much lower. Interestingly enough they have found a viable virus in the air after 3 hours, so that's enough to be scared when people are sick around you. </p>
<p>It seems the virus generally has a shorter half-life and dries out and dies within a day. Even so, it just takes one virus to live for awhile to infect one person, and then have them spread it to 3 others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. If you're talking about surface transfer. You'd be no different than a cardboard box. The virus can land on your / your clothes, and if someone touches you and then touches their face etc etc. </p>
<p>It just means that you won't be producing new viruses. So as long as you keep yourself clean I don't think you'd be much of a threat. Relatively speaking.</p></div>		</li>
