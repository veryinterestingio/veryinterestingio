			<div class="markdown"><p>That's old information. Formula can be served in room temp water. Depends on what the kid tolerates.  The warming thing is mainly from when bottles etc were glass and needed to be sanitized. Admittedly some babies don't like room temp but if they like and tolerate room go for it.</p></div>		</li>
