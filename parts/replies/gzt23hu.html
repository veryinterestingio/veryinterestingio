			<div class="markdown"><p>Those white things are chalazae, and aren't the embryo. They are basically bungee cords that hold the yolk in place. The germinal disc is the embryo, and is a tiny spot resting on the egg yolk. If fertilized, it will look a bit like a tiny bullseye.</p>
<p>To answer the question, double yolk eggs that are fertilized and incubated almost never result in live chicks. There just isn't enough room to incubate two chicks inside the egg. They die. It's a very bad idea to incubate double yolkers on purpose. Cruel to see chicks die this way.</p></div>		</li>
