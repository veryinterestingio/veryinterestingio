</blockquote>
<p>With the engine forcing a yaw and the controls compensating for that yaw, the plane winds up  basically crabbing, or flying diagonally through the air, to some extent.  That means that one of the wings will be more &quot;swept back&quot; relative to the oncoming airstream than the other wing, which means unequal lift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was being trained by a Beechcraft Pilot Proficiency Program instructor in a Baron (twin with max gross weight 5300 lbs.), and he taped a length of yarn at the center of the windshield, taped at the top and directed downwards.  During a simulated engine failure, I was to keep the yarn in the middle, which to me meant that the aircraft was not crabbed into the wind.  I think a bit part of asymmetric lift during an engine failure comes from the loss of airflow over the wing on the side of the inoperative engine.  You really notice the contribution of this airflow if you chop the throttles in the flare with both engines operating - the aircraft settles rapidly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the centre of lift mainly determined by the aerodinamic surfaces? Unless the thrust vector of the engine is not perfectly horizontal, there shouldn't be any change. Not an expert, just wondering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, if you are flying asymmetrically on one engine, generally you won't be going full thrust.  You'll dial back the power so that your control surfaces are able to compensate and maintain control.</p>
<p>If one engine like this isn't enough to maintain flight, then the aircraft wasn't designed to fly single engine (or is overweight) and will have to land somewhere.</p></div>		</li>
