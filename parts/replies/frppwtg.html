			<div class="markdown"><p>You got the fight or flight response backwards. It triggers the F/F response which puts the body in &quot;stress&quot; mode which it increases energy consumption and decreases &quot;maintenance&quot; functions such as digesting, hunger, etc.</p>
<p>When someone tries to quit smoking, they often gain alot of weight due to 1. Food taste better and 2. metabolism decreases since the body isn't in stress mode as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When nicotine is taken in other forms other than smoking, such as vaping or patches, it still produces appetite suppression so I'm not sure if carbon monoxide has such a large effect on it. The fight or flight response part makes sense tho. Thanks for the answer!</p></div>		</li>
