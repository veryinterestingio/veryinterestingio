<p>Check for notifications (multiple requests by lots of apps). Includes lots of internet requests, you don't want most to be delayed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>at least on iOS, individual apps aren’t manually polling for notifications. a system service called APNS is handling that, and because it’s an OS service Apple can optimise how frequently it runs &amp; minimise the network requests it performs. for example, newer iOS versions use HTTP/2 for APNS communication.</p>
<p>also, another appleism — tilt detection/other motion handling is handled by a dedicated motion coprocessor which is extremely low power</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite right, keyword activation is done locally thanks to a dedicated chip inside the processor directly wired to the microphone and specifically made to be ultra-low power, for this reason some Android phones will tell you that ok Google needs the screen to be on to work, if it does than the chip is missing and keyword recognition is more expensive to run since it will use your cpu cores to run</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not really true. Voice recognition and voice to text uses quite a lot of power. Key phrase detection (like „hey Siri“) is a different kind of task. As mentioned in the top comment, it is usually handled by a specialized neural net to consume very low power.</p></div>		</li>
