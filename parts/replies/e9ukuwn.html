			<div class="markdown"><p>The 1918 pandemic virus is the ultimate parent of all the human influenza viruses circulating today (though they've also picked up segments from other flu subtypes in the past 100 years). </p>
<p>But even before 1918, influenza was a thing. There's evidence for influenza pandemics for at least 500 years; probably for millennia before that, but documentation becomes tricky. And of course we don't have molecular or serological evidence for the subtypes of influenza that infected humans before 1918.</p>
<p>Pandemics tend to drive previously-circulating subtypes of flu into extinction -- that happened in 1957 (H2N2 drove H1N1 extinct) and 1968 (H3N2 drove H2N2 extinct), and the assumption is that it happened in 1918 as well (H1N1 drove whatever strain(s) circulated then extinct).</p>

<p>It can't have though, we still have this. Is what we have now a different strain that simply uses the same name?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A virus has a cellular structure,  the mutation can come on the surface of the virus, with arrangement of the virion. Radical mutation means it can access its host differently than previous flu viruses. That means the host has no defense from immune memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why will our approach always miss a revolutionary mutation?</p>
<p>Do you mean that revolutionary mutations are ones that are either missed by our surveys, or do they happen after we've conducted our surveys and are therefore undetected?</p></div>		</li>
