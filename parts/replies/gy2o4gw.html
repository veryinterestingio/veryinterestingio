			<div class="markdown"><p>True. I went snorkeling in Bali last year and hit my leg onto a large coral reef. It gave me a hugeee wound but it didn’t start hurting until I left the sea. While I was in the sea, all it felt like was a slight itch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow! Sorry about your coral cut. Those can be bad. You have to pour something really acidic in the wound to kill any coral polyps. Those cuts can get super infected. Pour urine in it if you don’t have any vinegar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh. I didn’t know any of this back then. I just washed it with water and called it a day. Thankfully it recovered without an incident. I’ll keep this in mind in case something like this ever happens again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the principle of rubbing salt into wounds, to prevent infection. Since it stopped being used at some point, accounts of it were passed down without explanation, like on sailing ships, and it was assumed that it was done to further punish the person. So it became associated with making something bad even worse, when the reality was the opposite.</p></div>		</li>
