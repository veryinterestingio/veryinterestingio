<p>Vulcanologists please expand (sorry), or correct me, on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, totally possible. It is quite a low lying volcano and there is a caldera. If water weakens any fault planes or if they collapse from related earthquakes then a lot of water could be introduced. I would say that the most catastrophic steam explosions happen when an powerful eruption happens immediately underneath a body of water, which Taal doesn't quite fit into.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you mean an undersea volcano?  Because Taal has a caldera and is in a pretty big lake.</p></div>		</li>
