			<div class="markdown"><p>Although catecholamines do increase the work done by the heart, the rest of your answer is inaccurate and doesn't really answer the question by OP. Chest pain of cardiac origin is called angina, and is due to the heart not receiving enough oxygen. In a relatively healthy person without prior heart disease, the increase in catecholamines due to stress will not be  enough to affect oxygen supply to the heart. If that were the case, then even moderate exercise would cause chest pain in most people, since the increase in cardiac activity due to catecholamines is much greater in exercise than in most stressful situations.  The chest pain of anxiety is unrelated to cardiac causes. Although chronic excess of catecholamines can result in heart disease, situational stress from a &quot;broken heart&quot; will not. Takatsubo cardiomyopathy does not happen as a result of severe emotional trauma's effect on the heart. It is  disease that is often triggered by stressful situations. However, the stressor can be unrelated to emotional trauma, and the stressor itself does not directly cause heart disease. It also has nothing to really do with OP's question</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Angina is caused by low blood flow and therefore oxygen to the heart.  The coronary vessels feed the heart, if they are narrowed then this will cause pain.  Typically the narrowing is caused by a plaque, which is called coronary artery disease.  </p>
<p>Exercise does also release catecholamines, but in different proportion, and the downstream effect is dilation of vessels including the coronary arteries to improve blood flow to your muscles, including your heart. This is why exercise does not typically cause pain in healthy individuals with no history of coronary artery disease.</p>
<p>When people with severe coronary artery disease exercise their coronary artery that has the plaque cannot expand in that area to meet the new oxygen demand for the heart, and they feel that pain, which we define as angina.</p>
<p>However, severe stress (including emotional) can cause such severe release of catecholamines and other hormones that make them potent, which can lead to constriction of blood vessels.  When you constrict your blood vessels, you create additional strain on your heart, even if your heart is still getting enough blood flow so that no angina is felt.  But sometimes, there can be such intense stress (including emotional) that the hormones force even your coronary arteries to spasm and constrict, in these cases patients do feel that same anginal pain.  These can be young patients with no prior heart history or risk factors.  I’ve seen a case for example of a mid-30s woman who came in one week after the loss of her father.</p>
<p>Takatsubo cardiomyopathy has many names, and I’d agree with you that it’s most accurate and descriptive one is stress cardiomyopathy.  One of the classic echocardiogram findings is apical ballooning, which is a consequence of a heart struggling to beat against a large systemic resistance from vasoconstriction.  When the heart can’t move volume out of its chamber, it starts to balloon out, making it worse at contracting in the first place, leading to heart failure.  This can all happen as a consequence of emotional trauma.</p>
<p>I thought it was relevant to the OPs question because if we can damage our heart so much from feeling emotional stress, is it really hard to believe that when this process happens to you following less severe but still significant emotional trauma that our heart would ache?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I know what angina is, and what the causes are. My point is that angina is not the cause of the &quot;feeling in your chest&quot; that OP was talking about. I assume he was talking about pain or discomfort, but it could also be that &quot;hollow&quot; or &quot;pressure&quot; feeling that people describe. In any case, those feelings are not due to angina. I do agree that stress (including emotional) can lead to coronary vasospasm, even in people with no history. But that is not what is happening with most people</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What causes the burning feeling in your heart? I can understand that stuff about the heart speeding up or slowing down in response to stress, but heart break is a very specific feeling.</p></div>		</li>
