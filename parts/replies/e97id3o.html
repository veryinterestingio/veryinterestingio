			<div class="markdown"><p>Once the House and Senate pass their separate versions of a bill, it goes to what's called a conference committee, consisting of a few Senators and a few Representatives. They iron out the differences between the two bills and come up with a single version, called a conference report. That then goes back to each house, and if both pass it, it goes on to the president to either sign or veto it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can overrule a veto? TIL. I thought once the President vetoed something, it was gone, until somebody came up with a new version of the bill to start all over again or something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't get anything done unless something <em>needs</em> to be done and is agreed upon by a large percentage of people.</p>
<p>That's the point. It's designed so that in times like this where there are a split number of radical views about which direction the country should go, then the 'winning' party doesn't get to affect tyranny just because they managed to get 51% of the seats.</p>
<p>If in doubt, change nothing. That's the reason for the gridlock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current situation is pretty unusual in American politics. Usually both parties are able to work together enough to get legislation passed when Congress is split, even when one party is being intransigent (Even Newt Gingrich &amp; Bill Clinton were able to work together). The level of partisanship we’re seeing right now is the highest it’s been in decades, so that system is unfortunately falling apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct, unless they compromise on something which is unlikely.</p>
<p>Another possibility is Trump makes himself an elected monarch and just signs Executive Orders to carry out his agenda, which is what previous Presidents as of late have done.</p>

Once both houses pass the bill it goes to the president who can sign it into law, or veto the bill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further add on that, if say a bill passes the House and goes to the Senate, they may choose to change the bill, in that case it gets sent back to the House, which may change the bill again, and the process repeats (it's a semi-common occurrence, which is why there is stigma that Congress never gets any work done). Once a single bill gets approved for both House and Senate (both have agreed to it), then it gets sent to the President who may in turn choose to veto it, in which case it dies, or can be saved if there is enough members willing to overturn the veto (called a veto-proof majority).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that the House/Senate can override the President's veto and pass the bill anyway.</p>
<p>As well, the Supreme Court has the inferred power of judicial review, meaning that they can rule legislation at state and federal levels as unconstitutional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of a veto, it then goes back to Congress, and if the political will is there, they can override the veto with a supermajority vote in both houses (I can't remember the threshold, whether it's 60% or 2/3rds)</p>
<p>As you can imagine, that doesn't happen very often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly correct. Technically only the house can introduce a bill that increases revenue (i.e. raising taxes). But there are so many little loopholes to avoid this that it hardly seems relevant anymore.</p></div>		</li>
