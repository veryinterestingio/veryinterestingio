			<div class="markdown"><p>Both of these paragraphs don't address the kind of randomness the OP is talking about. Randomness in quantum theory doesn't mean equal probabilities and it doesn't mean &quot;undirected&quot; either. It means you have a set of possible outcomes, can calculate their probabilities and if you perform the same experiment many times you reproduce the calculated probability distribution but you cannot predict which outcome will occur a particular time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Thank you.</p>
<p>They are just another example in which a scientific field uses the term as a shorthand for something different.</p>
<p>The term &quot;random mutation&quot;, especially when describing evolution, is used to press home the idea that the driving force behind evolutionary change lies in environmental selective pressure, not the mutation events themselves.</p></div>		</li>
