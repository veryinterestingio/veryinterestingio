			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been inadvertently testing this theory for years now. From my observation moving the battery around does nothing. But if you take them out and drop them to the ground a couple of times they start working like new for a day or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The innards in these batteries are usually some solids and powders. I think what's happening is that you're slapping oxidized material out of the way a little bit to improve the connectivity <em>inside</em> the battery.</p>
<p>It's my weak hypothesis based on opening batteries in the past. It's also based on how overloading other types of batteries (with fluids inside) can cause bubbles to form inside them, which degrades the performance until they stop working. Lead-acid batteries have this problem, for example. In older cars you can have this problem when your alternator gives out and your car is firing the engine, fuel pump, and lights entirely from the battery. A way to diagnose is to see if your car works for a minute every ten minutes or so, (and before those ten minutes the car has little to no power).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This gets my vote. I feel like there is an electrolytic reaction coming on at the contact points that is blocking the electrical connection, a little tap (or turning the batteries) puts fresh metal in contact. </p>
<p>If you leave batteries in a product for a long time you can see a salty looking crust develop at the terminals  with alkaline batteries, that's what I reckon is doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protip: IKEA LADDA white rechargeable batteries are the same manufacturer as Eneloop (but their light brown batteries are not) and are a lot cheaper, like $7 for four AA batteries. Be sure it says MADE IN JAPAN on the batteries/packaging, as they've switched some to cheaper Chinese that don't retain charge as well.</p>
<p>Downside: you have to buy IKEA batteries in store, no shipping.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why I kept wondering why my headphone replacements eventually got choppy with the sound. I thought it was a break somewhere in the wire. It turned out that switching between the computer and the phone wore down the headphone jack on it. I could see the gold coating on the thing actually wearing down.</p>
<p>In other news, take the advice of another redditor and buy two sets of headphones. They'll last longer if you don't keep switching em out between gadgets.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't spray it into the port on your phone, it is conductive.</p></div>		</li>
