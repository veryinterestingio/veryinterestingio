			<div class="markdown"><p>Try pouring a tiny bit of very hot water on the bite to relieve itching, but don't scald yourself. Most likely it's that you react more to them than others do. I swell up like crazy when the person next to me barely notices them. Scratching it will make it look worse, and I end up scratching mine until they bleed sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

( you can get it at a bunch of places)</p>
<p>The idea is to try and actually suck out some of the venom that gets left in your skin. My GF uses it and says it makes the bites WAY more managable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it depends on what kind of mosquito bit me I found out. The European ones leave no or only tiny swellings that go away very quickly, but the south Asian ones(Like tiger mosquitos) leave big, coin sized swellings that last for a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can highly recommend mosquito heat pens. AA battery powered, heats a tiny ceramic button to a degree where it's perfectly numbing but not going to give you blisters or injuries.</p>
<p>It works great, you just heat that sucker, apply it 10 second, it stings a little, it also feels great in a twisted way... and you basically get rid of them for a good while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A daily antihistamine like Zyrtec (cetirizine) helped me a lot, I no longer take it daily because I find that my seasonal allergies aren't quite as severe as they used to be but I took it daily for a long time and when I was on it I hardly reacted to mosquito bites. Benadryl can give you short term relief if you are really itching.</p>
<p>The bad reaction is likely a combination of a more severe reaction to bites and also more scratching. It's a chicken/egg scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zyrtec did fantastic for my full-body (or nearly so) when I broke out in (non-allergenic) hives.  (My immune system got bored, and decided to start taking potshots at my thyroid, which apparently caused me to break out in hives.)  The dermatologist had me on massive anti-histamine doses (2x Zyrtec/day, 2x Zantac/day, and a large dose of super-Zyrtec (hydroxyzine, it metabolizes into zyrtec) at night).</p>
<p>We also had a mild winter, and our dogs picked up fleas.  However, since I had such a large anti-histamine load, the flea bites were no more than a nuisance to me, they didn't itch at all.  (Nor were mosquitos a problem for me that summer, either.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just imagined this in the style of a scene out of Osmosis Jones. Made me blow some air out of my nose. Thanks for that little laugh!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On that note, every medicine cabinet should have antihistamines. They're not cheap, but they're the one thing that actually works for relief from bug bites and poison ivy/oak and will prevent you from scratching and causing a serious issue. No one ever told me about that growing up and I just suffered using lotions and stuff that never worked until one time someone suggested it to me after getting my ankle ravaged by jiggers and I've used them ever since.</p>
<p>On a similar note of &quot;easy cures that actually work&quot;, gargle diluted hydrogen peroxide for mouth sores. It makes them go away in hours instead of days. Another thing I suffered with growing up and tried tons of &quot;home remedy solutions&quot; and products that did absolutely nothing until I figured out it was a solved problem. Just don't do it every day because it'll stain your teeth, but as a once a month thing it's amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience not scratching at all from the start makes the welts go away overnight. I've tested this with two bites I had and went at it on one and leaving the other. The one I left alone didn't itch anymore after one night and the other became 4x as big and stayed for a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s nuts! I think that when I scratch one bite, all my other bites get more swollen and itchier too. If I leave them totally alone right from the start, they do go away much more quickly, but a new bite will “reactivate” an older bite for me.</p></div>		</li>
