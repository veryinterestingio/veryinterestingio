			<div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned finding similar sequences, is it possible/common for you to find a match between cDNA and some other non-converted DNA? And is there any link between the two (e.g. common ancestors) or is it more likely that it's just convergent evolution?</p>
<p>(PS: Not in any field of biology so my question might be weird/dumb/common knowledge)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Convergent evolution occurs at the level of traits.  It is a result of selective pressure directing toward similar functionality.</p>
<p>In some cases, this will be seen at the sequence level, as in the case of key regulatory or catalytic sites on enzymes.  You may see the same residue change in disparate lineages because they both provide the same selective advantage.  I can't think of any good examples off hand, but this sort of thing isn't unheard of.</p>
<p>But otherwise, you wouldn't expect to see much convergence at the sequence level.  Whatever sequence gives you the desired trait is fine, so it's basically chance if they happen to be identical.  You can infer selection using non-synonymous substitution rates and so forth, but you won't really get matching sequence.</p>
<p>In nearly all cases, matching (or nearly matching) sequence implies shared ancestry.  There is very little by way of truly 'novel' sequence out there.  Everything is just copied, slightly altered, and perhaps recombined, to produce new sequence.</p>
<p>Put another way, <em>everything</em> you look at when searching for matches (of sufficient complexity) is related.  How distant that common ancestor is can vary wildly, all the back to the beginning of life on Earth, but the relationship is there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;non-converted&quot; DNA. As for the second part of the question, similar sequences may have gotten there by divergent or convergent evolution, depending on how similar we are talking. cDNA codes for proteins, and proteins typically fold into particular shapes to do their function. We now have identified among the hundreds of thousands of known genes that proteins only adopt a handful of folds, and we can typically determine the overall fold a protein will fold into by sequence similarity to other proteins of the same fold. So the link between sequence similarity for highly similar sequences (maybe &gt;30% similar) is probably due to divergent evolution, but less similar sequences may have evolved by convergent evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By non-converted I meant &quot;not RNA into DNA&quot;, as in, &quot;&quot;&quot;real&quot;&quot;&quot; DNA samples.</p>
<p>Thank you for the informative answer by the way!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In multicellular organisms (eukaroutes), the cDNA would typically span multiple exons for a gene stitched together.  The cDNA, is the sequence that corresponds directly to the protein that the gene will make. The cDNA typically spans most of the sequence corresponding to a sequence of exons, but not all - there are regions before and after the cDNA in the final multi-exon product that correspond to regulatory regions, that don't correspond to the actual part of the gene that gets turned into protein, but are responsible for determining when this happens, how much is made, etc.</p>
<p>In the context of this thread, it should be noted that these do not get stitched together as DNA, but only after being converted to RNA; but again, it helps to just think of every sequence as its DNA equivalent.</p></div>		</li>
