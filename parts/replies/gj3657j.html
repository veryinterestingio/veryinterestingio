			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: a lot of larger carnivores that take down big more-than-a-mouthful prey go for the digestive and inner systems first - intestines, stomach, organs, and so forth, partly for this reason.</p>
<p>Not only are those parts often softer and easy to access and eat quickly once you open the abdominal cavity, but they're usually the part of the prey animal that are richest in vitamins and minerals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely - not advocating it at all, but if you were to do the &quot;carnivore&quot; diet for humans you NEED to consume organ meats and shellfish to get all the right vitamins and minerals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another &quot;fun fact&quot; is that almost all <del>omnivores</del> herbivores are <del>operatunist</del> opportunistic. Meaning that when given the opportunity they will eat meat. Many omnivores will lick or gnaw on bones they find in the wild.</p>
<p>Cows and horses can hunt for smaller pray like birds, mouse, snakes etc.</p>
<p>Proof: <a href="https://youtu.be/t3NOhQlPGAU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/t3NOhQlPGAU</a> a cow eats a chicken.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/jP6dvgo25Z8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/jP6dvgo25Z8</a> horse eats chicken.</p>
<p>Even deer and <del>mooses</del> moose have been observed &quot;hunting&quot; small game. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQOQdBLHrLk" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/sQOQdBLHrLk</a> deer eats a bird</p>
<p>The little I've looked in to this, the conclusion was that omnivores eats meat and lick bones to gain different minerals and vitamins that they can't make them self.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm stupid and I mean of course herbivores and opportunistic, and sorry for changing your views of the gentle giants. They are still big and gentle, they just enjoy a little snack from time to time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some animals are also &quot;optimized&quot; in other ways; it's hard to compare this since we humans need a lot of calories mainly because of how much energy our big brain needs. For instance, gorillas eat mostly a diet of vegetation with occasional protein supplementation (coming mostly from insects), however they're many times stronger than us with much more muscular development. This is because their muscles need far less protein than ours do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently bacteria in their gut break down the plant matter they eat and give off amino acids which they can then use. Gorillas have a very different evolutionary strategy than humans. Humans traded raw strength for more balanced athletic abilities including long distance running and walking; this helped us be better foragers which is more important when living on a grassland. Because of predators like leopards and the fact that they spend a lot of their time on the ground gorillas have evolved strength as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>The split between humans and other apes is mostly because as Africa dried out we moved into the savannah while the other ape species stayed in the dense jungles. Food isn't as plentiful out on a savannah so humans became opportunistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes back to the original explanation that certain species synthesize certain nutrients therefore they don’t need to ingest them. I would suggest that gorillas synthesize protein far more effectively than we do, hence why they don’t need to consume as much.</p></div>		</li>
