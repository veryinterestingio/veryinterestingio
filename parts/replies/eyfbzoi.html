			<div class="markdown"><p>tinnitus is usually associated with permanent hearing loss, and can be loud, quiet, high pitched, low, or anything in between. It can also be a side-effect of medications, or even related to anxiety or depression. It is not as transient as the phenomenon OP asked about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have mild tinnitus and get this once or twice a week at least. Tinnitus is constant and has a particular pitch. (Or multiple pitches, I have some higher pitched ringing and a more mid toned white noise buzz.) It pretty much never changes, and for me at least doesnt have a noticable left/right direction.</p>
<p>This is a very noticeable single ear change, and it follows a specific progression every time. I usually get a sort of soft thunk feeling and then one side of my hearing goes completely dead. After about a second, I start to get a high pitched squealing tone on that side. It ramps up for about 5 seconds, stays at a constant volume for another 5 seconds-ish, and then slowly falls away over the next 10-20 seconds. As it falls away the sound from that side stays muffled at first, slowly progresses towards a sort of tinny muffled (like you're listening out of a shitty pocket radio speaker), and eventually fades back to regular hearing over the next minute or two.</p>
<p>Its one of those things that happens so often I never thought to ask anyone about it. I'm 31 and until this thread I've never mentioned it to anyone or heard anyone mention something similar. It's just always happened, even as a kid. It never causes an issue unless it happens when I'm really trying to listen for something quiet, and regardless its completely gone in less than 5 minutes any time that it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed - I always thought it was my ears version of when I start staring at something and then my vision goes blurry and I’m mentally zoned out... just assumed my ears were doing the same thing... at least I know I’m not alone now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I had to read the OP twice to realize what he was referring to, then I realize I’ve had it too everynow and then. I wonder how often it happens, it seems so frequent that we don’t think about it at all. Thanks also for explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. The temporary ringing also has a feeling of slight pressure/sudden quietness “around” the ringing for me as well, like I just got flashbanged or hit hard on the head, but much milder obviously</p></div>		</li>
