			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/02/150227-polio-pakistan-vaccination-taliban-osama-bin-laden/" target="_blank">It's how they caught Bin Laden</a>. A Hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan was co-opted by the CIA, leading to information on Bin Laden's whereabouts. The doctor running the program ended up in Pakistani jail, and the resulting backlash against vaccinations led to a major resurgence of polio along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying “that’s how they caught Bin Laden” is a little misleading. </p>
<p>The co-opting of the vaccination program was but one attempt at making a positive ID, which ultimately failed. While the doctor was able to identify Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed, also known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, and obtain his phone number, it was already known that Ahmed lived there. As a matter of fact, it was through the tracking of Ahmed’s cell phone that the CIA was able to locate Bin Laden’s home. What Nat Geo’s account conveniently leaves out is that Ahmed was first identified as Bin Laden’s most trusted courier by a Guantánamo Bay detainee who was interrogated using the CIA’s very controversial “enhanced interrogation techniques” some years earlier. It was this identification that led intelligence officers to make a concerted effort to track Ahmed which led to him being located near Abbottabad in 2010 where he was followed to Bin Laden’s compound. </p>
<p>Ultimately, Doctor Afridi’s involvement ended up being inconsequential in the effort to capture or kill Bin Laden. If anything, this fact just rubs more dirt in the wound as we gained nothing from the exploitation but cause a great deal of damage in the process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: Not being sarcastic. It's one of the dumbest things they ever did and has probably led to the creation of many more terrorists than they've actually beaten because of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The drugs inc type of shows cant be real.  Absolutely no successful large scale dope dealer is going on television and explaining their operation while being filmed. 30 kilo deal on television wearing a small bandana over his face, and the next scene the film crew is with the local D.E.A. I personally believe the &quot;drug dealers&quot; in those shows are just undercover cops who know the biz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what I'm talking about though, no SUCCESSFUL drug dealer would be that stupid. If they are busting a weed delivery guy, they are certainly busting a top level heroin dealer. Yet they seem to always have one on that show who doesn't mind showing the world how he commits these crimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was this police raid filmed during the recordings of Netflix's Dope on a couple of drugsdealers from the south of The Netherlands. </p>
<p>I only find Dutch sources, but I presume Google Translate will do its job: <a href="https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20180614_00064086/aanhouding-in-beek-tijdens-opname-netflix-serie-dope" target="_blank">https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20180614_00064086/aanhouding-in-beek-tijdens-opname-netflix-serie-dope</a>. The police had a tap on one of the criminals where they learned about the interview and its location. Some of the drugs were real, but there where also some sugar cubes in there.</p>
<p>The interview itself is also released: <a href="https://www.dumpert.nl/item/7721955_3c30c3e4" target="_blank">https://www.dumpert.nl/item/7721955_3c30c3e4</a> . Nearly everyone in the comments claims it to be a hoax (hence the relaxed police) , but some people also have good reasons this could be the real deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw that part, it was pretty ironic that they raided the dealers as they were saying &quot;the cops here are stupid&quot; then bam flash grenades immediately. That timing was so perfect almost as if written into a script...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it is a trade-off between better understanding of how/why criminals break the law and preventing harm caused by lawbreaking. For serious crimes, like murder, I am sure both journalists and police would cooperate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s interesting. I can definitely see some benefit in that, so long as Journalists and Researchers know where to draw the line.</p>
<p>Just curious though, is there any benefit to interviewing “current” criminals vs former criminals or inmates?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If unknown to the scientists, the police had been planning to raid the same event, I'm assuming they don't get a free pass.</p></div>		</li>
