			<div class="markdown"><p>Small, isolated communities may one day be able to function without a primary service provider. This would absolutely be great for places with low population densities and good renewable access. Such systems, however, would have absolutely no need for blockchain, which has very poor energy efficiency. You only need one trusted local server. Why can't the village office run a server? Blockchain is an unnecessarily complicated idea in search of a practical application.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually kinda laughed at this. I work with a site that does operate its own microgrid. We’ve got 30 buildings on a small hydro-electric generator to produce the power. We’re in the early stages of expanding to add a second generating station, and selling the power to a major industrial site next door who’s currently running their operation on diesel power.</p>
<p>The sale portion of it is pretty simple; we sign a Power Purchasing Agreement with the customer, and they agree to pay us $x/mo for power within the specified limits. We then have calibrated meters on the feed lines, ensuring that they’re complying with their contractual limits.</p>
<p>The whole blockchain thing is silly. You just have recording meters, and ensure that at the end of the month, things settle up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you're running a Blockchain for energy trading like this, you could easily do it on less than a Watt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, <em>mining</em> is inefficient. Except blockchain requires a sufficiently large network of computers to be constantly on line, and the only advantages it offers over a central server are robustness and trust. Neither of which will be an issue in the typical small community. One watt? I think you are neglecting the basic infrastructure requirements of the network when you offer that figure. You don't need a blockchain. You need a spreadsheet. </p>
<p>Still, I am in complete agreement with the main point here: Small independent localities could become independent of a power grid. All I'm saying is that simple accounting problems don't require complex solutions.</p></div>		</li>
