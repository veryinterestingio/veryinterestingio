There are a few locations where we know deep bottom water is made and sinks, that's near Iceland where water that was once part of the gulf stream (and is hot and salty) gets cold and salty and sinks. Then near Antarctica with sea ice exclusion (Google frozen salt fingers). Mid water is generally composed of common water.

<p>If you're of age, I recommend testing this all out with a black and tan. If not, then some cold and hot salt water dyed in different colors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends how often you think ocean waters mix to start with and what sort of waters you are talking about here. The top of the ocean is home to the mixed layer, which varies in depth with the intensity of different physical conditions, but has a maximum depth of about 150 m in certain regions. </p>
<p>Away from the mixed layer, flow in the oceans is actually still turbulent, so mixing can occur and is particularly pronounced at areas of ‘stirring’ by turbulent eddies. Mesoscale eddies play an important role in the redistribution of heat and salinity throughout the oceans. </p>
<p>If you are talking only about the water masses involved in thermohaline circulation, that’s slightly different, though they do still manage to mix more than you might think. For instance, when you say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a few locations where we know deep bottom water is made and sinks, that's near Iceland where water that was once part of the gulf stream (and is hot and salty) gets cold and salty and sinks. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not actually Gulf Stream water that immediately cools and becomes North Atlantic Deep Water, the major deep water mass in the northern hemisphere. The water from the Gulf Stream gets spread about in the Arctic waters for a good few years before any of it comes back down. The actual origins of NADW are quite complex and involve the mixing of several distinct water masses: from the Labrador current, the subpolar gyre in the Greenland Sea, some stuff from the Norwegian Sea, and overflow water masses from the Denmark-Greenland straight and Iceland-Scotland straight (themselves a mixture of a few different sources). NADW gets most of its mass from the areas surrounding Greenland as ice is formed, but you get the idea how complicated it is, especially when all of these sources have seasonal and longer term variations. </p>
<p>The mixing of water masses can be quantified with graphical methods on a temperature-salinity diagram - as an example, the mixing of water masses I, II and III to form water mass R is shown <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bLudSCQ.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>. This brings me to something else you said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists spend a lot of time tracking water masses using the ratio of different nutrients in them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don’t really use nutrients to track water masses, but conservative properties like temperature and salinity. Non-conservative tracers are used in conjunction with these, but not nutrients as biological activity will be too much of an influence. Non-conservative tracers used are typically CFCs or cosmogenic radionuclides like ¹⁴C and ³H. </p>
<p>Edit: the main thrust of what you wrote was spot on though, especially here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But basically, the larger the difference in density the less mixing that occurs. It largely happens when there are instabilities, or through geostrophy, internal tides, or ekman pumping.</p>

<p>I did enjoy reading your whole comment, please forgive my pedantry, I just love all the little complexities of physical oceanography. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I mean you'd need a graduate level course to relay all the complexities. ;-)</p>
<p>When I mentioned using nutrients, I was referring to using the redfield ratio, so the different nutrients will change but in general carbon: nitrate: phosphate stay the same even though the organic versus inorganic portions of those nutrients. Some of the physical oceanographers in my department used it. But yes, there are better tracers depending on the water mass, like isotopes or dyes.</p>
<p>And yes, timelines are very relative in oceanography.   We didn't even get into seasonal overturn.</p>
<p>-not a physical oceanographer but I (used to) work a lot with them. </p></div>		</li>
