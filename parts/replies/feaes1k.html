			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this:</p>
<p>I was researching reusable plastic bags vs single use bags for a proposal. The actual rate you have to use them is between 3-110 (iirc) according to LCAs done by the english, swedish and scottish governments. Reusable plastic bags were usually broke even at less than 10 reuses. Reusable bags made from cotton or other plant fibers had to be utilized more. It turns out the agricultural inputs consumed a lot of energy.</p>
<p>You have to remember that in general, reusable bags are way larger than traditional single use plastic bags, so a single instance of usage actually replaces multiple traditional bags. Any study that reports their results in a per bag basis, rather than a unit that considers volume will hugely over report the real impacts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>every time you melt down plastics,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not every plastic. There are plastics called Thermoplastics that can be heated &amp; reshaped and retain their chemical structure. This includes many of the most common plastics (PP, PE, PVC).</p>
<p>The biggest issue with recycling plastics is actually sorting them by their plastic type. We're all probably familiar with that number that comes with plastics - those are code for the type of plastic. Automating the sorting of these plastics is not easy (like it is for metal and glass), as a result, recycling plants need to spend a ton of money on labour if they want to recycle plastics properly. They often don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While thermoplastics can be melted and reprocessed, the high temperatures and shear forces used in recycling streams tend to degrade the polymer chains, reducing the molecular weight and negatively impacting the mechanical properties. Recycled PET (water/soda bottles) is often used for carpet, which doesn't need to be as strong or have good gas barrier properties</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is if you have to manually sort it vs using a machine to sort it.  In other materials you can take advantage of physical properties (density differences, magnetic differences, melting point differences, etc.) </p>
<p>If you have to manually sort it's time consuming and labor intensive.</p>
<p>Everything is already labeled, but you need to be able to read the label and send it down the right line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me clarify some things here:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no metal, no matter the alloy, that is not recyclable. It’s about the efficiency of recycling it.  The beat raw material to use is the exact same as what you are making.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example a brass mill making C26000 Brass (70% copper, 30% zinc) is most efficient by using scrap 260 brass as feedstock. In that way, all the metal is used without needing additional inputs to make the melt come out correctly.  They could use any configuration of zinc and copper scrap metal, but they would need to add other metal to make the output be chemistry correct (so if you used 70 pounds of copper scrap, you would need 30 pounds of zinc scrap to even it out). Now imagine this with all different ratios of copper and zinc, with differing purifies and surface contaminants, etc. even a weld will throw off ratios in small quantities.</p>
<p>So yeah, if economics is not at issue... it can be done.  Obviously brass is an easy example, but should be true for the exotics and rarer ones as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plastics are really complicated, as previous comment mentioned, 90% of the problem is in getting the different plastics separated and contaminant free, but there are still so many other factors: different additives, colors, irradiation, flame retardants, etc. all of them don’t play nice with each other necessarily.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also something called cross-linked
Plastics, which no matter how high you turn up the heat, will never be able to be reformed into new material.</p>
<p>Source; Am scrap metal dealer with some experience with plastics as well. </p>
<p>I am happy to answer any more questions if you have them.</p>
<p>Bonus: I would bet that 90% of “ zero landfill” companies are full of shit.  Their books may show it, but I can tell you that I am forced to take unrecyclable material at no cost to supplier, in order to take it off their books and help them claim they don’t landfill if (which I do) I of course have to make my money on the other items I get from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Among other things.  It is a logical choice because you would have to add less pure tin to the melt to make the proper ratios.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, you could use nickel plated copper too, but since most bronzes don’t have nickel in it, you would need enough of the correct metals to the melt to bring the nickel content down low enough to be within the specs... so not only is the nickel wasted, but you have to add more metal to “get rid” of the nickel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Penn and Teller the magicians used to have a show where they debunked &quot;faddish&quot; ideas and they had a field day with the recycling business.  The gist was that recycling gives Americans warm fuzzies and it was just vastly cheaper to landfill given the size of the vast spaces in the U.S.</p>
<p>But if you go to a country like Denmark, where the land sizes are miniscule compared to the U.S., and hydrocarbon resources are many times more costly, you can see what might be possible when an entire culture tunes in to getting maximum utility out of any given resource.  Entire neighborhoods focus on recycling, with enormous communal recycling bins where they separate green and white and brown bottles that all use similar shapes and are thickly made to last a long time.  They also heat entire neighborhoods with steam that heats by burning trash.  They also have enormous gasoline taxes that cause nearly everybody to use their very efficient public transport.  And automobiles have prohibitive purchase taxes so only the wealthiest use cars.</p>
<p>I kinda rambled here but watching the way Denmark THINKS about resources really awed me.</p></div>		</li>
