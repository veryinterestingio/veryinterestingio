			<div class="markdown"><p>Just biting most likely doesn't release the venom. Most snakes can control whether they release venom or not by compressing or not their gland. But if they were secreting venom while biting their tongue, they could die from hit. Note that it's not as likely for a cobra to bite their tongue as it is for you, given that they have two teeth, separate, and a thin tongue.</p>
<p>Edit : poison -&gt; venom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it follow that when a snake is about to bite that they would retract their tongue? I don't think I've seen any animal species go into a bite with their tongue hanging out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The times I've seen a male King Cobra kill a female (like in that video), the male kills by biting the female hard near the head or &quot;neck&quot;. I don't see why anyone would assume venom has anything to do with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it kills another member of the species, it should kill the same creature. The body probably isn't going to respond differently to the same venom because of where it came from, still the same batch of chemicals. </p></div>		</li>
