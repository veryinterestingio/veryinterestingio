			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, lets put this into 2 categories of echo chambers then - we have the logic based ones and the emotion based ones.</p>
<p>For the emotion based ones like anti-vaxers - is there any argument they would actually listen to?</p>
<p>For the logic based ones; they could make the argument that if we all have biases then why would 'your bubble' be any better than mine? The most widespread example of this I know of are people that take vitamin C for colds or general health. Linus Pauling, the double Nobel prize winning chemist believed vitamin C could extend his life and he was popular enough that you can now find vitamin C sold for nearly everything.  It's not very effective but since it also has next to no negative effects and only costs a few bucks; You would have a hard time convincing someone NOT to take vitamin C when they get sick on the small chance it actually does help.   Chances are if you told someone that, they would tell you Vitamin C probably does work and any ineffective studies are just propaganda from big phama.</p></div>		</li>
