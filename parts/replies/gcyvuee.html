			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I was told, dark rings are caused by blood pooling under the skin.  Applying a hot towel when you shower or during an evening will help move the blood along.  I don’t understand the exact science because I am not a scientist or the human body.  However, I saw it work first hand on my sister who always had dark rings under her eyes until she went on a cruise where she had a massage.  The therapist applied the hot towel and my sister asked what for?  My sister doesn’t have the rings under her eyes any more.</p></div>		</li>
