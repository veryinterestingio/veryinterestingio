			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only valid when you are dealing with solids which have small atoms or molecules. This doesn't apply on macromolecules such as Polypropylene or any crosslinked rubber. In those cases knife will actually cut through the chemical bonds via a process called mechanical chain scission as molecule chains are simply too big to get out of the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there anything that can accomplish this in the real world? Like, are there molecules and cutting/separating instruments that make the more likely? And shouldn't that mean matter that is more atomically/molecularly rigid, like colorful diamonds for example, be easier to cold weld?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that metal surfaces oxidize immediately, at least to some degree. The oxidized surface layer resists cold welding.   </p>
<p>I've read cold welding can be more of a problem in space.</p></div>		</li>
