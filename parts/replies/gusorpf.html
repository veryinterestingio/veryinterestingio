<p>That sort of assumes that you can go 800 years without anyone ever having incest with an overlapping family line. That seems unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Gene' here is being used in two different senses. The &quot;99% similar&quot; usage is in the sense that you have a gene for (say) blue color vision and so do I, but we may have different variants of that gene. When talking about inheritance, we're talking about <em>variants</em> of a gene (or more technically, <em>alleles</em>), which isn't the same thing.</p></div>		</li>
