<p>A gamer in their 20s died a couple years back after doing an overnight stream or something, when they stood a blood clot went to their heart. It made headlines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you're seated for 10 hours, your ankles swell.  No control of that, it just is.  With tanker boots, your ankles stay loose and the toe box stays tight.  You don't get any of the pinching in your ankle that you'd get from regular combat boots.</p>
<p>Also, if you're lazy, you can just leave them on the longest part of the two straps and just use them like slip-on shoes.  You can drive just fine in them because the heel cup and toe box keep everything snug.  No ankle pressure.</p>
<p>They're my favorite boots for long drives.  They are all leather, so you do have to take care of them and they are *not* hiking boots.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the mindset at the time was more along the lines of death trap. Break down - septic tank. Out of ammo - septic tank.
Currently there is far less likelihood that a tank unit would be without nearby ground and air support so ...break down - pillbox works. But the perception seems to have lasted through the years. </p></div>		</li>
