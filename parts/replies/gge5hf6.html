			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's too bad. I've certainly accidentally swallowed my fair share of sea water while swimming throughout my life. Not more than two-three gulps on the same day though. Never once had stomach problems, but also wouldn't go swimming when there are a lot of cyano bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The salt concentration in blood plasma is ~0.9%. Thus, &quot;normal&quot; saline solution used for IV fluids administration is also 0.9%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For comparison, here is a map of <a href="https://balticseaweed.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/allfucus_map.jpg" target="_blank">the salinity of the Baltic sea</a>. It starts out around 0.9% around Denmark, and gradually declines to less than 0.3% in the innermost parts, which is low enough to serve as low-quality drinking water. The colors along the shoreline shows the distribution of three types of seaweed which prefer different salinity levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t quite accurate. Human kidneys can concentrate upto 1200mOsm/l IIRC. As long as what you consume is less concentrated than that, you can gain free water. </p>
<p>Feline kidneys for example can concentrate upto 3000 mOsm/L, and they can actually get hydrated from seawater despite their serum osmolarity not being very different from human serum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Your kidneys can concentrate very efficiently. 0.9% NaCl is 308 mOsm/L. Sea water is about 3.5%, or almost exactly 1200mOsm/L. This is right on the border of the kidney’s ability to concentrate, and it could lead to kidney damage, as well as if your kidneys aren’t up to snuff to begin with, you’ll start building up salt. I think the general recommendation is 50/50 sea-fresh water mixture if you’re really trying to stretch it out (assuming you cans sanitize it appropriately). </p>
