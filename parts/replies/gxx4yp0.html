			<div class="markdown"><p>All of this, also, you can do a sort of brewed over ice method, which can lock in some of the roasted flavors while having an iced beverage. Really is great if you prefer &quot;fresh hot coffee&quot;, but cold.</p>
<p>I used to be annoyed at people who drank 50% sugar in low grade coffee, but its a personal beverage. At least they aren't buying the good stuff and destroying it via the same additives.</p>
<p>Instant and canned coffees exist and they have their places too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>absolutely. there's something about a milky, sugary dark roast that still satisfies me in its own way (even if it makes me feel sick half the time). but, to me, that's a different category of drink. it'd be like if i ordered a beer at a bar and was given a glass of wine. like, ok, i like wine, but this is not beer. &quot;but they're both cold alcoholic beverages!&quot; well yeah, but....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can put whatever you like in your coffee, but high grade coffee is limited. Its grown by small farms and is much more expensive. The flavor is extremely delicate. If you want to add things to it, go for it, but you're wasting a lot of money. Its like buying a premium cut of meat, and then pouring ketchup on it. You can do it, but I think its valid to see it as potentially wasteful. </p>
<p>However, I dont let it bother me anymore, but I do see it as an indication of where someone is at. Maybe they are rich, dont know better, or really enjoy it, we're all somewhere on our journey. I no longer come from a place of judgement, but observation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised that a self described long time specialty barista doesn't understand that the &quot;for whatever reason&quot; that cold brew tastes less bitter than cooled coffee is because you don't lose aromatic oils to evaporation when cold brewing and that these oils combat bitterness.</p>
<p>Likewise, just saying that good coffee is more like tea because it's lightly roasted and better quality than mainstream coffee beans is a massive generalization that doesn't help answer the question here.</p>
<p>Sure, a high quality bean is probably going to taste better after an hour cooling in fresh air than a Dunkin coffee, but because of the science of evaporation and oxidization they're both going to taste pretty bad, regardless of your beans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes so much sense. I don't drink coffee often because of a sensitivity, but get the good stuff when I do. I always thought I just had poor taste because I waited for the coffee to cool and preferred it near room temperature.</p>
<p>You might get a kick out of this: So a fresh light roast tastes fruity to me. I was talking about coffee flavor to a girl at university once and she didn't understand and thought I was crazy. Could not compute coffee being fruity. She was a Starbucks/Bigby coffee dessert drink type of person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>coffee is literally a fruit (the seed of a fruit but still) and many still carry fruity flavors. roasters will often dial in their roast specifically to develop those fruitier notes. while a lot of what you taste is going to be subjective (the flavor notes on the side of bags of coffee are pretty unreliable), there are some broad consistencies: generally African coffees tend to be juicier, especially Kenyans. Ethiopian coffees from the Sidamo (and/or Yrgacheffe) region(s) often have very noticeable blueberry flavors, sometimes strawberry. Grapefruit and other citruses are common, as well as hardier stone fruits like apricot and plum. so no it doesn't surprise me at all that you tasted fruit in your coffee!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light roasts can be as diverse in flavor as tea. Ive had some that were reminiscent of apples or blueberries. From earthy, to vanilla and caramel. </p>
<p>Coffee is personal, and not to belittle your friend, but a well prepared light roast and starbucks are not comparable. You cant put pour over in a paper cup and expect it to keep all its delicate flavors either. I think most people are just disinterested and inexperienced when it comes to coffee, and that's fine.</p></div>		</li>
