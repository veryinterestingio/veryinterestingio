			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why having someone rub/massage a hurt area can help relieve the pain - you aren't eliminating the pain signals, you're just overwhelming those signals with feel good signals from the massage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called gate-control theory. Sensory information is processed at the spine before it gets perceived. However, the spine can only process so much sensory info at any given moment. So if you introduce a new stimulus (such as a massage) while pain is being processed at the spine, the massage signals take up processing power, leaving less processing power for pain, closing the gate for pain.</p>
<p>Essentially, you’re distracting your central nervous system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stub my toe somewhat regularly on my dogs ramp. At first it was excruciatingly painful and felt like it lasted ten minutes . After I got used to it happening it was just a few deep breathes to suppress the pain and then nothing more. It's all mental</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once sprained my toe very badly (to the point that it was indistinguishable from a broken toe without an X-ray to confirm) while playing capture the flag.</p>
<p>Literally did not notice until after we'd finished playing, and it didn't get to &quot;oh god I can't walk&quot; levels until the next morning.</p></div>		</li>
