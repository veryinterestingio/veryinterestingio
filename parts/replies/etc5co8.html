			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes, it’s an electromagnet.</p>
<p>It shares many of the same characteristics: magnet wire wound around an iron core to turn electricity into magnetism. Just changing the part where you turn the magnetism back into electricity into using the magnetism to move air. More like a little motor, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Transformer&quot; is generally implied to mean a &quot;voltage transformer.&quot; It's a bit misleading to call a wound iron core with a different function a tranformer (hence the other commenter's confusion), but I appreciate your point about the similarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can have a coil without a core.<br />
The plain idea of a transformer is transfering high voltage low amp current into low voltage high amp for instance for house, the transformer will switch the extremely high current comming from the producer into usable current by transfering it between two coils without core and you change how many loop of coil there is between the two coils.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things determine how loud a speaker is: its surface area, and its excursion (how far in and out it travels). That’s it. </p>
<p>But excursion is a function of a lot of other variables: the moving mass of the speaker, the voltage applied (that’s your amplifier), and motor strength (the magnet + current through the voice coil). Excursion is also limited by the length of the coil in the magnetic gap, the suspension (which provides a restoring force to bring the diaphragm back to its rest position), and the clearance from the voice coil to the back plate. Also, motor strength is related not only to the magnet used, but also the geometry of its construction, and the total number of windings in the coil. Adding more windings increases strength, but it adds mass and impedance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>the moving mass of the speaker,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adds inertia to the assembly. More inertia needs more power from the amp to drive it. Making it less efficient the heavier the mass.  The efficiency also varies with the drive frequency relative to the self resonance of the mass/suspension parameters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can counter the added mass by adding magnet too, but yeah that’s all correct. I didn’t think getting into frequency response would be helpful for OPs understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An amp that's clipping, ie turned up past the point it can hit the peaks of each wave so they get chopped off, effectively sends DC through your speaker coil and turns it into a heater.  It can also shift higher powered low frequency energy (which would be fine through the bigger woofers) into higher frequency tweeters that shouldn't see that much energy.</p>
<p>I'd say demanding more volume from an underpowered amp (ie cranking up your car's factory head unit past the point of distortion) is a more common failure mode than legitimately overpowering it and tearing the speaker cone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah I wasn't talking about a DC offset (= shift the cone permanently off center) so much as that plateau being effectively a pulse of DC, holding the cone roughly in place while current dumps through the voice coil.  Increased clipping turning your sine wave into more of a PWM signal...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was not aware you could get clipping protection in stock consumer gear (assuming you mean some kind of soft clipping diodes?  I've only heard of those in reference to big industrial gear for concerts and stuff).  But I'm also probably a decade out of date on my car audio gear...</p></div>		</li>
