<p>Might it be from thousands of years of cavemen getting wet in the cold and having to shed whatever clothing they had in order to survive?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might just be your animal brain getting confused and stripping off these encumbrances - humans are one of the few animals that don't immediately try to get rid of things that are stuck on them, and IMO it's probably a learned response. You're probably too deluded at that point to remember that learning.</p>
<p>Edit: I may also be bullshitting. Wikipedia says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One explanation for the effect is a cold-induced malfunction of the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates body temperature. Another explanation is that the muscles contracting peripheral blood vessels become exhausted (known as a loss of vasomotor tone) and relax, leading to a sudden surge of blood (and heat) to the extremities, causing the person to feel overheated.[23][24] Another potential explanation is that in times of extreme thermal distress, an instinct kicks in to remove clothing that may restrict blood flow around the body, for example anything elasticated.[citation needed]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the paradoxical shedding thing. I think that's more to do specifically with the hypothermia, as there's a point I believe where you stay to feel very warm despite freezing to death, and so will shed clothes. It's not exactly common, but has been seen in hypothermia cases. The Dyatlov Pass incident is the most famous I can think of where this occured.</p></div>		</li>
