			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine it is easier to correct parts than having to transcribe it all. I did some transcribing for my thesis and it took forever (also because I could not slow it down etc bc of the media platform). I would have greatly preferred a rough draft of what was said and correct where necessary, rather than having to transcribe everything myself.</p></div>		</li>
