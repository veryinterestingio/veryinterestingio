			<div class="markdown"><p>There is (or at least was) a tiny metal strip in bills larger than $1 about 1/3 in from the left side, going across the width of the bill.</p>
<p>For a while, teenage me would take the strips out of $5s or $10s, tape them to a $1 bill, and try to get extra quarters from the change machine at the local arcade.  I think I only got it to work once or twice.</p>
<p>Edit: don't do this, kids. You don't want to risk prison time.</p></div>		</li>

Basically turning $11 into $20.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In elementary school there was a rumor that those strips were what gave the money the actual worth -- so the strip in a $20 bill was worth $20 by itself. If you could get the strip out without ruining the bill you would effectively have $40. Of course kids in the class claimed to have done this or had brothers or cousins who did it and we all believed them. I don't remember any specifics on how you would actually go about redeeming or selling the strip.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the computer matches it up with a portrait like a game of guess who and then identifies the bill that way. </p>

<p>You're talking about the new stuff.  The old stuff doesn't have the computing power to verify against a database.</p>
<p>Basically you insert a bill into a <a href="http://roweinternational.com/bc-series/bc-1200/" target="_blank">Rowe BA-50</a> and there's a magnetic head that reads the magnetic qualities of the bill then follows through the logic flowchart and dispenses X.</p>
<p>Each bill has magnetic qualities that discern what the value is.  Sometimes the quality isn't readable anymore which is why you see people straightening out the bill, rubbing it on a flat edge and so forth.  Sometimes the head is dirty because of nasty ass bills that should be burned once it gets to the bank.</p>
<p>Anyway, TLDR; bills have magnetic qualities that indicate what value they are.  I've never seen them spoofed or a bad bill that was accepted.  I'm sure it's possible but I've never seen it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. I think the ink has specific magnetic qualities that the mint uses. Like a magnetic identifier each bill has a crap ton of unique identifiers that differentiate them from other bills. Watermarks. Magnetic ink. Micro print. Holograms. Security tape. And so on. There is a level that he can't discuss with me proprietary stuff for each company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak specifically on the new stuff but I worked on the old stuff 20 years ago and I was pretty amazed how accurate it was.  I've seen strings and ribbons glued to bills but the bills were accepted and stored in the bill stacker.  If you have a slimy bill and worn belts, you could still try to get the bill accepted but even what I've seen, if it got accepted, the stacker grabbed it and held on to it where the ribbon couldn't pull it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify here for ATMs. That's not how ATMs know which denominations to dispense cash. Additionally, I have never seen any ATMs use the ink detection sort of method for accepting/verifying Cash deposits either. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, it's not that different from the Tech in a vending machine, at least in the newer ATM Cash Acceptors(Deposits). It basically knows which Bills are which and when they are passed through the note acceptor it scans for key similarities to verify the deposited amounts. This money is then dumped into a bin. When the Brinks guys come to refill the ATMs Cash Dispenser, they also remove that deposit bins money. Its then brought to that banks facility, counted and numbers are verified. </p>
<p>Some older models though dont have ANY scanning on deposits. If you use a Citizens Bank ATM(in New England) you could run into one of these(may be all phased out by now, but I doubt it). These ATMs literally dispense an envelope, you put your money in it, write down the date/deposit amount, enter that into the ATM terminal and the whole envelope is deposited into a Bin. These deposits are then manually counted and verified in the banks branch. </p>
<p>Dispensing on the other hand is largely done by inserting multiple 'cassettes', or basically large looking rectangular boxes, into slotted shelves in the bottom of the ATM. Each cassette can be programmed for a different denomination. When you request your Amount, the machine knows which cassette to pick from and counts via a sensor, how many bills to give you. </p>
<p>Dispensing of the bills is done with two main techniques - vaccuum or belts. Its basically how the money gets from the cassette to the receptacle you take the money from. </p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a bank. This knowledge is only for the periods 2005-2009 from when I worked there. Basically there is a bin for each currency used. The tellers fill the bins up with bills and when the customer presses $20 it'll go to the $20 bin and pull a bill. </p>
<p>If it has 10s and someone requests $30 it'll go to the 10 bin pull one then pull one from th 20 bin. It may have changed a little since then and there may be some identifiers I am not aware of but that's how it used to work. I can't imagine it's much different now. </p>
<p>It's easier to output than it is to take various inputs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Ink detection on an ATM cash deposit would be sweet but so far as I know that tech is not being used in the overwhelming majority of machines in use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have several ATM's.  This is correct. They are essentially a cash vending machine. You can set any denomination of bill you want in the OS and it will dispense on bill count, not any scanned dollar figure. So theoretically if you were to set the denomination to 1 dollar and request 20 dollars you would get 20 of whatever bill is in the cassette. </p></div>		</li>
