			<div class="markdown"><p>Pulsars are neutron stars that spin rapidly, emitting a beam that rotates as they spin - they're like lighthouses, with beams of radiation spinning around in different directions. They appear to be rapidly flashing on and off, because the beam might hit you for just a moment before it starts pointing in another direction.</p>
<p>Pulsars are very bright, and also have very consistent spin frequencies. So if you have enough space for one or more decent x-ray telescopes, you can detect multiple pulsars, compare these with a known &quot;map&quot; of pulsar spins and brightnesses, and figure out your position from there.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't change the fundamental problem of a universal coordinate system. This is just a practical method of determining your location within a coordinate system - it's still up to you to choose if you use the plane of the galaxy or the equator of the earth or whatever as your basis. The pulsars we observe are almost all within our own galaxy, so it would probably be most convenient to use a galactic coordinate system, but there's nothing stopping you from choosing something else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would red shift/blue shift affect how you’d perceive these pulses? As in how many pulses you’d see per second rather than the frequency of the light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I read somewhere that the earth could be destroyed if it got randomly hit by a pulsar. Is this the same kind of pulsar?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because pulsars are likely to be around for a while as well as being pretty distinct in the pulse part of the pulsar. </p>
<p>So if it pulses x times per y seconds then you can use it as a know point of reference. You have a few of those and suddenly you can navigate pretty well. Much like early sailors using the night sky. You navigate 3d space with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And modern day sailors - lighthouses and fog horns have different patterns of flash / sound. Before widespread gps, you could confirm which lighthouses you were triangulating on (coastal navigation, of course) by checking the pulses against a book. Of course you knew roughly where you were, I've only once had a surprise (crossed the channel twice at night without meaning to - but the patterns and position were too obvious to assume it was a mistake. We shouldn't have been able to go that speed in that wind)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say this though; our notions of up and down seem to be relative to the action of gravity. So long as there's a gravitational pull acting on an object, you might say that, relatively speaking, the direction of gravity is 'down' and the opposite 'up'. Altitude is further arbitrarily set as a distance from the surface of some body to which an object is attracted by gravity. So it's probably always possible for us to speak in terms of up and down, or to give some measure of altitude, though this would obviously always be relative to some object's gravity acting upon another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, although that would be a purely academic exercise. In space you’d be in freefall, which means you wouldn’t “feel” any notion of “up” or “down”. (Same on earth, really: If you’re inside a closed box falling towards the ground, you wouldn’t be able to point in the direction of your fall.)</p>
<p>If, however, you were in a rocket ship with thrusters on, you’d have a feeling of where “up” is, namely away from the thrusters. If you’ve seen or read “The Expanse”, that’s how their “artificial gravity” works.</p>
<p>The point is: Our sense of “up” is not related to <em>gravity</em> itself, but rather to a <em>force</em> on your body. In freefall, there is no force, therefore no “up”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity still accelerates you in freefall, there is a force. On the ISS as well, it's an accelerated motion.</p>
<p>I don't know if it would be biologically possible to sense gravity, but surely from a perspective of evolution that was never necessary. </p>
<p>But as it stands, what our bodies sense and don't sense is a bit more complicated than just force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could still have an approximation of “up” and “down” due to the way gravity influenced our evolution. Our body parts default to certain positions (heads face perpendicular to shoulders), providing reference points inherent to us; front and back, top and bottom, etc.</p></div>		</li>
