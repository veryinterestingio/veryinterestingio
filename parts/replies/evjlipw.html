			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a lecture on pain at my yoga studio, and the physical therapist that gave the talk told us about Lorimer and his work. I started watching his videos and felt like I finally understood some of my chronic pain better than I ever have.  Add in books like The Body Keeps the Score and When the Body Says No: The Stress Disease Connection and my world changed.</p></div>		</li>
