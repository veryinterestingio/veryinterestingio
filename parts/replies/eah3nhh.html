			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, as a local on the US side. Can get slippery, and the mist and wind is unpleasant in winter but it really is lovely.  Plus if you go at night the falls are lit up, parking is free (not to mention abundant) in the winter and you basically get the entire place to yourself. Just bundle up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha guess I'm not the typical Buffalo local. I hate cold, especially wet/windy cold (don't do tailgating either- maybe I'm just sane?). Snow is all right as long as the temp isn't too low or the wind too crazy. Lot of the best sights in Buffalo are on the water front, and the wind coming off lake Erie can seriously bite. Still worth the adventure for sure. </p>
<p>Never been to the Canadian side of the falls myself, they obviously have a lot more to offer lol. If you're not from around here that would probably be a better place to visit, it's just really easy for me to drive to the US side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and this an attempt to slow erosion of the falls. All waterfalls naturally erode back toward the direction the water is coming from.</p></div>		</li>
