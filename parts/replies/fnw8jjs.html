			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here man, played for 10 years this way and I always thought it's weird others learn the opposite way.</p>
<p>A dude here made a good point though that the right hand has a more demanding job later on when you're learning picking techniques and stuff, makes sense as to why I learned really fast then hit a standstill for years with my right hand being crap and immobile</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still think that is somewhat bullshit. I played mostly thrash and black metal as a teenager, my right hand got fast enough for Slayer and Emperor, but I couldn't play solos to save my life. One of my best friends can play Petrucci solos pretty fluently but struggles with Raining Blood. All comes down to what you focus on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See I only learned after I'd started listening to Lamb of God and when I got over initial struggle of sore fingers and chord pain I struggled with the right hand, it's different for everyone I guess but I do think I had to focus way more on bringing my right hand up to speed</p>
<p>Bottom line practice loads an you'll get good lol</p>
<p>Edit: I wrote something an sent it accidentally while watching TV lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah for me it was just that high school only had right handed guitars for us to use so I just learned that way because there was no other option. But same with baseball gloves, golfing, etc. Never had the option to do it lefthanded because of the available equipment. </p>
<p>Also felt that those insisting on playing left-handed guitar were just high maintenance people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know a left handed persons baseball glove goes on the right hand, so you can throw with your left. Do you mean you learned to throw right handed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aye same again, I learned on my brothers guitar and didn't even think about it, dominant hand or not the first time I saw someone play a G chord I was like how tf? Fingers look dislocated..</p>
<p>Yeah probably, I guess if you dont play and your kids left handed an wants to learn tho you'd get them a leftie</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but it absolutely felt weird fretting with your left hand too before you learned how to do it. It's all just muscle memory, and practice will make anything feel normal eventually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less weird, because Iâ€™m used to moving my fingers and hand around, and fretting is just that against a board. Compared to moving my right hand around that way from not doing anything with it</p></div>		</li>
