			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess you're right, but it's difficult to make a non-programming analogy to describe that distinction. Anything outside the domain of programming would end up describing an interface a person would use, and hence a user interface.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the distinction really matters though, I think the more important part is that it's a thing that allows you to interact with someone else's system through a simple interface (i.e., easier than building an alternative or operating their system yourself).  Besides, not every API has a UI equivalent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might also be worth pointing out that, with few exceptions, that GUI is telling the program what to do by using an API.</p>
<p>The thing you interact with is almost always a different “program” than the one that actually stores the data and does computational logic, especially in today’s world where everything is in the “cloud”.</p>
<p>There’s the server, which is the company’s actual “program”, and the client, which is the part that you interact with directly on your device. The two communicate using an API.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in the world of Web APIs and other server/client systems, mostly.  Other systems may just have an API for external use and handle their own stuff internally.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe I just don't know how to use <a href="https://Removeddit.com" target="_blank">Removeddit.com</a> and similar sites that show you deleted and removed comments, but they're not showing the comment there either.</p></div>		</li>
