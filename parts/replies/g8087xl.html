<p>&quot;All you need to do is go to the website and vote for your favourite song of the week.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Send in a text message about a time you were embarrassed for someone else.... keep the texts coming&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Shout out to Milly and Brooke who are driving to Mt Sommers for a Hike!</p>
<p>Shout out to Dean who's milking cows in his shed.</p>
<p>Shout out to Aaron who's doing the house cleaning&quot;</p>
<p>If you get enough of the info, and you organise it, and you perhaps buy some of that famous 'anonymous user data' you can start to glean that 1/3 of the listeners do so in the car, 1/3 listen while doing house work, 1/3 listen while at work&quot;. You can also do some pretty simple tricks with statiatics to gauge the size of a population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While these are all done purposefully, it’s not to gauge listener ship. </p>
<p>FB/social media plugs are meant to get you more involved with the brand to increase brand loyalty, and to keep top of mind when you’re not near a radio</p>
<p>Voting on website is the same, with the added traffic to the site to sell digits ads</p>
<p>Texting is also about engagement, brand loyalty, can no longer be for marketing</p>
<p>Shout outs are largely fake in 2020.  Since engagement is at an all time low in radio, jocks will make up names, places and activities to make it sound like there’s more regular engagement than you think.  A large amount of “listener” content is either save, and edited / re-used by jocks to fit their need for their show, or from a voice acting service for things like phone pranks, war of the roses, etc.   </p>
<p>Radio does get info on where people are listening based of surveys, nothing more.  </p>
<p>There’s a ton of research done by major market stations, and larger companies on a national level.  Good ole fashioned calls to people (call out) and focus groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The number of people that participate in radio call in contests is surprisingly few, and not at all useful for gauging actual station interest. In fact, most stations have policies about repeat winners, because it's often the same handful of people that regularly participate in radio contests and exploit that ease-of-winnability.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked late night way back in college.  I was the only person in a lab, and used to listen to the radio to drown out the silence.  I would win radio contests all the time. &quot;Be the 10th caller!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey your number 2, click&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;hey your number 5, click&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;hey your number 10, congrats.  Oh hey McGill.&quot;</p>
<p>I got a few cool things.  I got put on a list for winning too much too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in radio for 15 years, and was a Program Director (managed one or more stations at a time) for 8 of those.  I left the industry in 2019.</p>
<p>While stations do look at interaction numbers, it’s not to determine listenership, it’s to determine if their promo was very effective or not- and it’s just a loose indication. There’s far too many variables to make any major decisions based on interaction with contests.  </p>
<p>Contests are meant to do a couple things: give the appearance the station does good things for people in the community, to market their own brand (make noise), to sound relevant, and to incentivize TSL (time spent listening)- where they hope that the same people who will fill out a ratings diary/ wear a PPM will listen more due to prizes.</p></div>		</li>
