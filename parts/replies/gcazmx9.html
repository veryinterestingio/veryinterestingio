			<div class="markdown"><p>For those of us with scalp conditions -- dandruff or psoriasis -- would it be a good idea to wash our hair twice? Or wash twice, once with hair shampoo and once with scalp shampoo? What's the best way to make sure my medicated shampoo gets past my long, fine hair and actually works on my scalp?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually no. The more you screw with your skin, the worse it typically gets. I'm not as informed as my partner is, so I'll ask her to confirm, but my understanding is that over-cleansing is what can cause some skin to dry up and flake off. </p>
<p>For dandruff, lower-temperature showers, and LESS-frequent shampooing is likely the key. Instead of washing your hair daily, wash it with shampoo once every 2-3 days and only RINSE your hair in between. If you have excessively oily hair, finding a dry shampoo to use (if you can't find one, they're usually made with something like kaolin clay, arrowroot powder, and a very small amount of essential oil for fragrance. Very dusty but not impossible to make at home) will help cut down on the oily feel and texture of your hair. </p>
<p>As an added bonus, the reason hair can get over-oily is because your body is desperately trying to replenish the oil you keep stripping from your scalp with over-cleansing, but it's not very great at judging how much oil to produce so it can go overboard. Which leads to oily hair, which leads to over-cleansing, which leads to excessive oil production which leads to.... you see where this is going.</p>
<p>As for getting the shampoo to your scalp...uh...don't? If you have long hair and can wash it without shampoo contacting your scalp at all, do that. If you need to get medication to your scalp, part your hair as best you can and apply medication as direct to your scalp as possible.</p>
<p>Feel free to DM me if you need more. I don't want to end up turning this thread into an advertisement for my partner's business :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this! I actually suffer from a condition called psoriasis that is different than dandruff, although it can look quite similar. To put it super simply, it's an autoimmune disorder where the affected skin grows quickly, dies, and then either falls off or causes build up of dead skin cells that look like thick, patchy scales. For where I have it -- my scalp -- they tend to prescribe medicated shampoos or recommend powerful OTC ones. A lot of treatments actually recommend oil to help aid in removal. It does not work well in the scalp with thicker hair unsurprisingly.</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice -- I'll have to think about how my shampooing practices may be making my condition even worse.</p></div>		</li>
