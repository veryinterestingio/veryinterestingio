			<div class="markdown"><p>The confounding variable, and one that Western ethics aren't likely to overcome, is that leaving children unvaccinated can significantly reduce herd immunity if the vaccine is on the lower end of effectiveness (say, 50-60%).  So while individual risk is low for children, the risk to society from them being capable of infecting others is still substantive.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, it will come down to the risk versus benefit, and we'll likely measure that risk mostly on individual safety and outcomes when it comes to children.  So I agree - the safety profile will need to be very, very strong.  I'm hoping for exceptional effectiveness in the adult vaccination so this is less of an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, isn’t the idea to give the vaccine to everybody so we can achieve herd immunity and make the virus go away? Or are we just assuming it’s here to stay and going the yearly flu vaccine route?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Western societies measure risk and payoff on an individual level and not a societal one.</p>
<p>And the risk to any individual child due to covid is rather low. Potentially lower than the risk from a vaccine.</p>
<p>The second you measure risk and payoff for the whole society you just vaccinate everyone and their individual risk from covid be damned because herd immunity is more important.</p></div>		</li>
