			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people with testicles don't experience the 'floating balls' thing when on coasters or going over hills, and some people with vaginas do have a similar experience though some don't. It's all pretty individual, it seems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also had brain surgery, and feel in in my head.  I figured it was related, sounds like it possibly is.  Makes it kinda hard for me to enjoy coasters or drop towers ever since, and I love them, so that sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you are tensing your muscles in preparation for fight or flight, including the pc muscles. Your body does this because once a muscle is activated then it's very easy for your brain/nerves to continue activating it (long term potentiation). So you tense ALL muscles because your body doesn't know which muscles it may need to deal with the situation.</p></div>		</li>
