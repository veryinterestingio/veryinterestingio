			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to will though out and defined hardware threes very likely hardware based hardware based circuitry that can prevent software edge cases that happens from ram/rom faults. For example say if both lights were green that might trigger a fail state and disable or reboot the hardware. And maybe trigger the flashing red stop light instead. (Were talking sub second so you would not even see this kinda thing happening.) Until some one comes to check if there is an issue and manually restarts it.</p>

<p>When you don't have a large os  windows andorid OSx etc.. You can reboot in the matter of picoseconds if there is some hardware fault, and often the systems performance/state wont even be effected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair you can sort of cheese it and that's the situation in most complicated non-life-and-safety critical software like banks.</p>
<p>Just make sure that all operations are atomic, that's the formally verified part, then perform consistency checks before and after, if something went wrong, back out and retry.</p>
<p>Doesn't work for real-time applications but for critical but non-safety-related database stuff, it works well enough no on complains.</p>
<p>The only issue is if you get enough edge cases that the abort-retry loops cause unacceptable load.</p></div>		</li>
