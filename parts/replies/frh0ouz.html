			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your explanation!</p>
<p>I thought that if the diet changes because of the environment, the body and in this case the teeth would changes at the same pace. But apparently diet of animals can change faster then their body can evolve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black and brown bears are omnivourous and so were the ancestors of pandas. So they were supplementing their diets with bamboo even when they had other things to eat.</p>
<p>Their environment changed relatively quickly to cut off their access to prey but they already had a lot of what they needed to survive on a bamboo diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hippos aren't the only herbivores with fangs.  A great many primates, from gorillas to mandrills have them.  So do fanged deer.  Pig tusks are enlarged canine teeth too.  Fangs see widespread use for in-species fighting, especially between males, so their presence often has little to do with diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in zoos, are Pandas fed meat?  Would feeding meat (or something more nutritious then bamboo) be better for the panda?  It sounds to me like Pandas were sort of forced to eat bamboo instead of liking it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've been eating bamboo for millions of years already, they're perfectly content with that (although they are opportunistic carnivores and will eat meat to supplement for nutrients they need and aren't getting from bamboo).</p>
<p>Zoos feed them bamboo. The Zoo here in Atlanta seeks out people with unwanted bamboo on their property and takes samples. If the pandas like it, they come to harvest it periodically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>40kg of bamboo per day per animal! The Calgary Zoo is actually making arrangements to send their two pandas back to China 3 years early because they can no longer source enough bamboo for them due to the travel restrictions caused by the pandemic. The climate in Calgary doesn't allow bamboo to grow so they'd been bringing in large quantities of bamboo by air direct from China.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the problems pandas face is that there is a key gene needed to motivate carnivores to eat meat. It basically makes eating meat taste good and pleasurable. For whatever reason, pandas seem to be missing that gene. It dates back to when pandas switched to bamboo, leading to the obvious theory that maybe they switched to bamboo because meat didn't taste good any more, but bamboo still did. </p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108379/" target="_blank">Scientific Paper</a> on NCBI about it.</p></div>		</li>
