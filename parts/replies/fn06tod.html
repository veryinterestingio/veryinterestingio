			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn’t just that all computers can really only do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, it’s that ALL of us can really only do those four operations except in the simplest of cases. I know that the square root of 906.01 is 30.1 because I can multiply 30.1 by itself and get 906.01. But the square root of 907, not so much. </p>
<p>We didn’t just get Taylor series once we had computers and realized they could only do the four basic ops. We just got to use more terms in the series and not have to hire rooms full of people to do nothing but carry out computations.</p></div>		</li>

You can actually solve that pretty nicely mathematically if you recognize what 9, 6 and 1 have in common: it's a^2 + 2ab + b^2 where a = 3 and b = 1 :)

Multiply by 100: 9\*10^4 + 6\*10^2 + 1\*10^0 

Substitute x for 10^2: 9x^2 + 6x + 1

Factorize: (3x + 1)(3x + 1), 

Reverse Substitute: 301 * 301 = 90601

Divide both sides by 100: 30.1 * 30.1 = 906.01

			<div class="markdown"><p>You gave the impression that humans could perform more than those four calculations By mentioning that computers can only do those four, so humans came up with approximations for them to use.  This implies a higher number of calculations that can be performed by people.</p>
<p>Everything in math is just the four basics, stacked on top of each other under a trenchcoat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, a computer can't subtract either.</p>
<p>To subtract it needs to take the number you want to subtract, flip all the 0s to 1s and vice versa.
Then it needs to add 1.
Then it needs to add that value to the number you want to subtract from.</p>
<p>It also has the ability to accomplish multiplying and dividing by shifting the 1s and 0s to the left or right.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ehm, no. Unless you explain me how 3 * 1.5 works. Yeah, you'll instinctively say that it's 3 + a half of 3 (1.5), but this now opens the question of what a half of three is (3 / 2). And you can see how this will continue to be a problem until you accept that &quot;multiplication is addition in shorthand&quot; is just an introduction to the concept.</p>
<p>I reckon.</p></div>		</li>

In the nand2tetris.org course, you implement a computer that only has addition, inversion, and a few other logical primitives, and then you have to write the code to do multiplication and division with those building blocks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just took an intro instrumentation course this year and we learned about analog computers and built circuits to integrate and add and subtract and multiply by a constant... And circuits that railed to positive or negative voltages, that could act like 1s and 0s. </p>

<p>The fascinating and not at all obvious part is that the Turing Machine can perform any calculation that any more complicated computer can perform. Everything beyond that is just optimizations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of an arbitrary line when we say what computers can &quot;only&quot; do. You could just say computers can only do logic gates and leave it at that. Even addition and subtraction have to be composed together by building structures of those gates.</p>
<p>A sensible place to draw that line would be at whatever the CPU ISA has available, but modern ISAs such as x86 often include instructions for higher-level math calculations, such as sqrt, which muddies the waters when discussing numerical methods.</p>
<p>I'm fine with the set you chose, too, but it doesn't matter much. The overall point still stands -- there's a field of math devoted to the study of building up simplistic math operators into complex ones, and OP found a great example of that.</p></div>		</li>
