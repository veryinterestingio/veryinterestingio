You just have to groundpund the misaligned scuttlebug for 12 hours then hyperspeedwalk in a parallel universe until you find 6 triangles that allow you to redirect your speed out of bounds. It's not <em>that</em> hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The word for this concept is &quot;timbre&quot;. It's the musical notion of the quality of the sound itself. When a person (or an instrument) produces a single note, it's not a pure pitch, like, say, 800 Hz. It's a complex combination of pitches being made together. That's also how your daughter can recognize your voice. Her brain has learned the pattern you make. Regardless of what note you sing (or say), this pattern is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the interesting question. I think we all learned a lot. I'm gonna hijack your comment and add something I've learned from my music teacher. You've probably read answers regarding the ground note and that every instrument has its own overtones. If you want to just hear a ground note without overtones, apparently you have to listen to the tone from a telephone when you call somebody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely a better attempt at explaining the topic clearly for a 5 year old, but I don't think it actually answers the question completely. Anything that doesn't address different frequencies/sound wave shapes doesn't actually answer the question &quot;how can two sounds at the same pitch sound different?&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you. I thought the info already posted about harmonics and overtones was good and clear for those who wanted to dig into it,  but perhaps too much information for some. Maybe something like this would check both boxes: </p>
<p>Imagine having a palette of only red paints. They are all the same color (or note) but are different shades (or spectrums) of the red paint note. You can mix the lighter red shade with the darker red shade and you’ll still get a red. The color of red that a person can sing is based on their unique blending of red shades. They sing these shades based on how their body is built.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only reason I disagree with your analogy is because, as far as I know, timbre doesn't have a clearly defined linear spectrum. Your analogy, to me at least, seems much closer to describing how pitches function, or perhaps chords, since both color and pitch have a clearly defined spectrum that you can place any given color or pitch onto. What do you think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are specific values we can use to define notes, though, same as we can explicitly, scientifically describe colors. I.e. hex or RGB values.</p>
<p>Maybe it's splitting hairs but I would say color is like frequency. Tone, timbre or whatnot are more like other variables...intensity of your light source, temperature of your light source, an object that is opaque vs somewhat transparent, matte versus glossy, etc...the color is technically the same but we don't perceive it in the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it just makes it sound like the two singers aren't actually singing the same fundamental pitch and we recognize the difference in their voices from them being slightly off-pitch, whereas the question <em>stipulates</em> that the two singers are exactly on pitch.</p>
<p>It misses that when humans (or any other instrument other than maybe a synthesizer) sing a note, they don't sing a sine wave. They are singing many notes on top of each other, with the &quot;main&quot; note simply being the loudest and clearest one. Different overtones blending into the main note, or fundamental, produce different timbres. So, the voices (or instruments) have different sounds.</p></div>		</li>
