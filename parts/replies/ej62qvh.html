			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this a modem takes binary (1,0) and turns it into audio signals. It uses the full range of frequencies that can be sent over the telephone line to get the maximum data throughput. This is why dial-up has a fundamental limit of 56kps. 56kps is the most data you can push through a phone line without violating phone line specifications. So that sound you're hearing is the data being sent over the wire. The computer at the other end “hears” that sound and use its modem to translate it back into 1’s and 0s. In fact, very old modems actually did literally hear the sounds. Google acoustic coupler modem if you want your mind blown.
or just watch this shit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9dpXHnJXaE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9dpXHnJXaE</a></p>
<p>note that these things had a pathetic data transfer rate. less then 1kps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the phone LINES that are the limiting factor, but how the phone carriers sample the audio data when they convert it to a digital signal in their network (to bundle it together with many other lines). </p>
<p>So, a dial-up connection appears as regular audio data to the phone companies networking hardware. They sample it at 64 kbps and convert it to digital data that gets sent around their network before it gets converted it back into an analog signal near the destination and sent out on the wire.
A DSL link effectively turns that phone line into a really long (and therefore limited) network cable. It arrives at the phone companies switches as digital data and is routed around as such. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DSL connections require close proximity (~18000 feet) to a DSLAM. Pretty sure that's going to be big contributor to the difference. That and the fact that DSL is digital and transmitting data over a POTS is an analog affair. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If a 56k modem was so limited by the use of phone lines, why does DSL have such higher capabilities when its using the same lines?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phone lines used for voice guaranteed that everything in the line between users would carry a human voice reasonably well.  Every part of the system could guarantee that minimal capability.</p>
<p>The wires in many parts of the system were capable of carrying more-- but you had to have something set up to do that instead of just connecting the voice lines together end-to-end for that minimal guaranteed capability.   If you stuck a receiving modem closer to your house, and then used THAT to just talk to the internet for the longer distance... you'd essentially have DSL.  Instead of making the long-range connection analogue with about the bandwidth of a human voice and then modulating and demodulating at both ends, you used those shiny copper wires to make a much better connection to something closer, which itself was connected to an internet backbone to bridge the gap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to REALLY blow your mind, that 1kbps over the phone is roughly the same speed as NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is sending data back to Earth from over 4,109,538,270 miles away (from Dec 2018).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Analog phone systems used to use a tone of 2600 Hertz to tell the switching circuts to listen for a number. With a captain crunch whistle, you send that tone and call for free.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, this trick no longer works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what you've said, dial-up modems really did need to &quot;dial&quot; the right number and &quot;call&quot; AOL or whoever provided your service. Touch-tone phones and dial-up modems send those sounds through the telephone wire encoded as analog electrical signals. This simple encoding allowed basic circuits at the other end then interpret the dial sounds allowing them to route the call or internet traffic to the correct place. This conversion from sound to <em>analog</em> electrical signals is what allowed a technology like telephone communication to work long before even basic computers. When the internet was being constructed, it simply took advantage of the existing communications infrastructure. </p></div>		</li>
