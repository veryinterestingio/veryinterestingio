			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like a really good answer. I work with some machine learning models and what you describe about points become lines, lines become faces is very much how people have trained models to recognize images. Very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea this reminds me a bit of some of the neural network stuff I've seen where you train a computer to recognize faces by first training it to recognize the shapes that make up a face. A pixel becomes part of a curved line, which becomes part of an eyelid, etc.</p>
<p>I also am curious about if the reverse process holds true. I've seen some really neat results from inverting a NN classifier to get it to go from a classification to what it thinks a typical example of that class looks like (e.g. Google's deep dream). Makes me wonder about the creation of art and imagination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes, a lot of deep learning stuff, and non negative matrix factorisation got neuroscientists very excited because of how neuronal it looked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what am I missing, if I never saw &quot;a dream&quot;? What could be the cause? Not lying here. I didn't know such thing existed until I was 6 years old and people started asking me what I was &quot;dreaming&quot; about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. To this day, I never had a &quot;dream&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm fairly sure I &quot;dream&quot;, because research says all people have REM stage at where you dream, but I never saw any dreams. So I have no clue what it's like. People say they see images, but I can't get how can you see images with your eyes closed :D </p>
<p>I guess I just don't have what's called imagination all together, because I can't even &quot;see&quot; a stick with my eyes closed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask you a question first?  How realistic are your imaginings/mental images? If 0 was &quot;I have no idea what you mean about a mental image?&quot; And a 10 was &quot;if I imagine an apple I can see it as clearly as of it was in front of me&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>not who you are referring to, </p>
<p>I categorize myself with aphantasia. I would be a 0 on your scale. but it's hard to describe how 'visualizing' works for me. </p>
<p>If you ask me to describe and apple I could. I know what it looks like. But I dont see a specific apple. It is very factual, I know it or I don't. Very boolean logic. </p>
<p>Memories consist of knowing something. i know I skied this year. I  know where, what slopes, how the snow was(great) but I could not describe what it looks like. it looks like a ski slope. snow trees path.</p>
<p>Dreams function like weird memories. I know they're not real, but they kinda feel real. </p>
<p>Ask away if your interested in anything else.</p></div>		</li>
