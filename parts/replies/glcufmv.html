Maybe in a plane or ship engine rather than a car, but just to create a bit of redundancy in case something breaks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an engineer who works on diesel engines, and the short answer is no. </p>
<p>The first problem that comes to mind is balance. When the explosion pushes the piston down, some of that energy is used to push the other pistons back up so the engine can keep running. Which pistons you have moving up when others are moving down is really important, and are designed so that the pistons are balanced. </p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with engine layout, <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/OaD4rG26exJifKVlo_EeqtrB8xlzLUcyN5P3x_TkDqOwDTzBiXdvDLS_vYWtDgnqOWeHKltangNmhlcLursSaiSA2hbRdsHqGEyfObZuAnuXV6M7ZpkO_D9vn2e68HSZWPrcLdBJrFIXtgqWK0fBAbu_LPxgOaRRq-H7" target="_blank">this image</a> will work well for this explanation. Notice how the middle two pistons are lower than the outer two. The engine is not only balanced for force (2 pistons will move up while 2 move down) but also along the length of the crankshaft (inner 2, outer 2). </p>
<p>When unbalanced things rotate, they give off a lot of energy. Think of how strong your cell phone vibrates. The vibrator that shakes your phone is a tiny electric motor that can fit on the tip of your finger. Now think about how much bigger a car engine is than your finger tip. If you removed one of the 4 pistons from that image earlier, the gas engine turns into one giant vibrating motor. Doesn't matter whether it's a plane or boat or car, the vibrations will likely tear it apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent explanation. i might, however, say that the engines donâ€™t overheat from the explosions, they overheat from the friction (when they are run without oil and seize)</p></div>		</li>
