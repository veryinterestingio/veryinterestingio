			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking this comment to say, in the U.S., treatment for rabies will cost you about 35k with insurance. The immunoglobulin is, for some reason, incomprehensively expensive. </p>
<p>It’s a small price to pay for not dying the most excruciating death imaginable, but that’s not a fun figure to have dropped on you when you’re in the hospital concerned about if you have rabies or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why so much when most insurance plans have maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) limits? My current insurance plan has a $3k in-network and $10k out-of-network OOP max, which aren't too abnormal for U.S. plans. Did your insurance plan not have an out-of-pocket max?  Or do you mean the amount you and your insurance owed (presumably the insurance paid the amount that was in excess of your OOP max) was $48k?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your skin is 100% not broken by the bite, then you cannot have been infected. Rabies is only transmitted through saliva or infected nervous tissue (as in during handling of a carcass) entering a bite wound or mucous membranes.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns that you may have been exposed to rabies due to being bitten by a wild mammal, contact your public health department to ask for instructions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, this is because smaller mammals are really unlikely to survive a bite that would give them rabies, live with their wounds through the incubation period and then actually bite someone.</p></div>		</li>
