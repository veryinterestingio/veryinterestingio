			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a third reason depending on where you live. Temperature and temperature fluctuations can cause the early death of a battery, especially severe cold. If you live in a cold climate you know that the first very cold night of late fall/early winter will see a run on car batteries the next day. A car that doesn’t get driven a lot in cold climates will need a new battery every 2-3 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. All these comments about batteries lasting 5+ years and then this main comment about the only two times a battery dies is from alternator or killing it by not running the car and I’m just like “have you lived in Phoenix? My batteries last almost 2 years each time and then die, and it’s always a bad battery, not my alternator or leaving lights on”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I make a point to keep my car in the garage. Keeping it out of the elements like direct sunlight and snow really helps to extend the life of every component. If it's 110 outside, then it's likely much hotter under the hood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes a lot of CCA (cold cranking amps) to start a car.  The colder the engine the harder it is to crank, and the thicker the oil is.  Combine that with an older battery and that's why you see a large run on batteries.  </p>
<p>I worked in a shop and every fall once the first cold night came, you found out the next morning that your battery needed replacing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other component to this is that batteries produce less power as temperature goes down. So the engine requires more power to turn over because everything is nice and tight, and the battery is producing less power because of the cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. A car doesn't &quot;take cca to start&quot; an engine takes a certain cranking amp to start. Regardless of the temperature unless the engine is frozen solid. If the engine takes 300 amps to start, you think, ok I need a battery that puts out 300 cranking amps. If you don't live somewhere that gets below freezing, you have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Now if you go to the mountains for the weekend and try to start your car the next morning, it's below freezing. Your 300 CA battery only has 200 cold cranking amps. Batteries put out less amps when cold. So now you can't start your car. So if your car normally needs 300 amps to start, you buy a battery that provides 300CCA   it's normal above freezing amp output is around 400-500 cranking amps. More than you normally need but able to start the car in winter conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonus fact, car batteries can freeze, but only when they're completely discharged. I was shopping for a vehicle right after a super cold week, we were having tons of problems getting some of the brand new vehicles to start. They said after a cold snap it was common to have to replace 20 or 30 batteries in brand new vehicles if they've been sitting on the lot for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fully charged car battery can survive -30 celsius easily, while one that has just enough power to start your engine once, might freeze at -5. Once frozen, you will get no power out of it until it thaws. </p>
<p>And it could also malfunction permanently by having a cell short out, leaving you with less than the 12-13 volts it should deliver. Your car might start with one cell out of action, as 10 volts will be just barely enough to crank the engine, but it'll struggle every time even if you put it on a battery charger every night. It's happened to me.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to top off your car's battery in the fall, especially if you make a lot of short trips (15 minutes or less per engine start).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if the dealer could mitigate this by running the engines for 20-30 minutes to charge the batteries the day before the first really cold night.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My wife has a 2015 Peugeot 208 and it will turn off the radio/air con/lights etc if the engine isn't running and it detects a low battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're courtesy lights to help walk to your door or w.e. Most every late model, think 2010+ car has them and will automatically cut the lights after x-minutes/seconds.</p>
<p>If you see an older car, like 90's or before, they likely left their lights on and it may be nice to let the store know to make an announcement.</p></div>		</li>
