			<div class="markdown"><p>I once fell in some disgustingly stagnant water and had a bath in very strong Dettol antiseptic to make myself feel clean. When I got out of the bath, I was bright pink and the next day I shed a perfect layer of skin off just my bollocks. Like it came off all in one piece and I had a fragile replica of my scrote.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skin thickness and quality around your body isn't the same, so different parts of your body will react differently. Example: If you touch your eyelids, it's super soft and thin; If you touch the heel of your foot, it's very thick. My guess is that the concentration of acid in this foot mask is probably higher, so you wouldn't want it around delicate skin. What would happen? Your face won't fall off, but you might get a chemical burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glue is just a simplification because it's ELI5. What I've read is that AHAs/BHAs and other acids used in these foot masks disrupt desmosomes, which anchor cells to one another, leading to epithelial shedding.</p></div>		</li>
