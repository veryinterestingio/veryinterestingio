			<div class="markdown"><p>On a mildly related note, am I the only one who wakes up in a panic thinking I smell smoke, just to realize that it was only my brain messing with me?</p>
<p>Edit: Friends... concerned and well-meaning Reddit friends. Instead of waking up to smoke just now, I woke up from my nap to more comments than I can possibly read. I love all of you. My cognitive functioning is above average for my age. I do the stroke tests on a regular basis, usually when I have these dreams. The friends in my head assure me that I'm not mildly schizophrenic. I promise to update all of you if I develop further symptoms of something.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I've almost earned enough gold to afford a check-up in the American healthcare system!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this for years and my family thought I was crazy. Then I had my electric breaker box panel all replaced and they showed me all these scorch marks behind the sheetrock where there were tiny fires that started and put themselves out. The scorch marks were on the wood studs. I ran around the house yelling, &quot;I told y'all I smelled smoke all those times!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent a couple weeks thinking I was crazy, or having mini strokes, because I kept smelling toast all of the sudden while I was sitting on my couch in my living room. It would only last a couple minutes max. </p>
<p>Eventually I discovered that my Christmas lights (hung up indoors on the edges of the ceiling) were burning the paint on the walls. Threw those bitches out and never hung up more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a sensitivity to a lot of perfumes, they cause me almost instant sinus headaches. Not fun. As such, I’m keyed into the smell more than most and I can confirm that the smell of perfume is absolutely as persistent as the smell of rotting meat. And of the two, I prefer rotting meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent a few years as cellar master of a winery.  Like many wineries we had a no perfume policy for guests (messes with wine tasting, so wineries don’t like visitors wearing it).</p>
<p>When guests came into the tasting room wearing perfume I could often smell it through a closed door and in the wine cellar <em>over</em> the smells of the wine I was working with</p>
<p>People don’t realize how far aromas spread, nor how strong they can be.</p></div>		</li>

Their cologne was so strong that every single person in that room turned around to see what the smell was.</p></div>		</li>

It's really weird and I've never met anyone else with the same issue. But it sounds similar to yours! Just a different smell. (I like bath and body smells =))</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t seen a doctor about it, but I think sinus headaches. My sinuses swell a little and the pain is usually pressure behind the eyes. It’s not every perfume, but I’d say about 90% of them. Men’s colognes are far less likely to trigger me, so I suspect it’s the floral element I’m reacting to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a coworker who I could smell 10 min after she left a space because of so much perfume. I would have rather smelt funky sweat than perfume.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have yet to smell a perfume that actually smells good to me and doesn't make my nose and eyes itch.  They all seem to be sickeningly sweet/floral smells, which I guess a lot of people must like?  I tend to use all unscented stuff, but the scents I do like are things like eucalyptus, rosemary, citrus...I'm that weirdo who actually likes the smell of tea tree oil even though it is kind of medicinal.  They just smell &quot;clean&quot; to me.  I wonder if it's a genetic thing because my dad was super sensitive to smells too...I remember him ripping out a bunch of star jasmine from our yard because he couldn't stand the smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt there isn't a perfume you would like. The tastes vary wildly, but so do the different notes and scents and if you went through the process, I bet eventually you'd find one for yourself. Having a good subtle smell about you is mostly a win. Going hard and just dousing yourself... not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keying on the survival part of it - you can detect incredibly minute amounts of H2S gas because it takes such a very small amount of it to kill you. Most people can smell that rotten egg smell from H2S at something like 8 ppb (parts per billion) in the air, and it only takes about 30 ppb to start messing you up physiologically.</p></div>		</li>
