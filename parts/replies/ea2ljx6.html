<p>Jimi played the title track live 3 days after the album was released. Pretty huge compliment right there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was just writing an article about the Beach Boys' aborted <em>Smile</em> sessions, and the pressure Brian Wilson put himself under to compete with his contemporaries. There was a three-month span in 1967 that saw <em>Sgt. Pepper</em>, <em>Are You Experienced?</em>, <em>Velvet Underground and Nico,</em> and Jefferson Airplane's <em>Surrealistic Pillow</em>, among others. What an amazing time to be a music fan that must have been.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To anyone that’s made it this far down the thread, please take this opportunity to listen to some of the work that the Beach Boys released after Pet Sounds was made. One could go on forever about what various factors caused Brian Wilson to collapse internally while making the album SMiLE, but I think the coolest thing to discuss is seeing him sort of try to go on just experimenting after all of the self-imposed pressure to “go back-and-forth” with the Beatles went away.
Too often the Beach Boys versus Beatles debate is relegated to a “who won/who lost” exchange, but I think it really boiled down to a fragile man with an undiagnosed case of schizoaffective disorder that was exaggerated by taking hallucinogenic substances.</p>
<p>So if you like, I’d say do Brian a favor and give some of the later Beach Boys songs/albums a listen. Sort of like Pet Sounds, you don’t appreciate them as much on the first listen. They’re not inherently “Pop” oriented. They’re just “different”.</p>
<p>Some noteworthy tracks for the uninitiated going by album -</p>
<p><em>Off of the album Friends:</em></p>
<p>-“Meant For You”</p>
<p>-“Friends”</p>
<p>-“Wake the World”</p>
<p>-“Busy Doin’ Nothin’”</p>
<p><em>Off of the album 20/20:</em></p>
<p>-“Do It Again”</p>
<p><em>Off of the album Sunflower:</em></p>
<p>-“Add Some Music to Your Day”</p>
<p>-“All I Wanna Do” (fun fact - cited as being the first Chillwave song.)</p>
<p><em>Off of the album Surf’s Up:</em></p>
<p>-“A Day in the Life of a Tree” (truly depressing tune.)</p>
<p>-“‘Til I Die”</p>
<p><em>Off of the album 15 Big Ones:</em></p>
<p>-“Had to Phone Ya”</p>
<p>And finally, I'd recommend that <em>anyone</em> who wants more Pet Sounds-esque music just listen to “The SMiLE Sessions” all the way through. There are some musical lulls where vocal pieces hadn’t been recorded to accompany the music (As it was an unfinished album and the final order/arrangement of tracks was never decided), but it’s the closest we’ve got to it having been released as intended.</p>
<p>Noteworthy tracks are &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, &quot;Cabin essence&quot;, &quot;Wonderful&quot; (Beautiful harpsichord on this track), &quot;Surf's Up&quot; (Often regarded as the pinnacle of Brian's songwriting ambitions next to tracks like &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;), &quot;Vega-Tables&quot;, and finally &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (The SMiLE version is the best version!).</p>
<p>Sorry for the word wall, I wish you happy listening!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC it was actually only a couple of minutes of Sgt Pepper the song. Which is still admirable because it was only 3 days old. He did one verse with half remembered lyrics</p>
<p>&quot;Jimi opened, the curtains flew back and he came walking forward, playing 'Sgt. Pepper', and it had only been released on the Thursday so that was like the ultimate compliment. &quot; - Macca</p>
<p>Here he's referring to the name of the song not the album. source: Spencer/Lewis 100 Best Beatles Songs / Tess Press</p>
<p>There's a few live Hendrix CDs where you can hear Jimi play it. It's on The JH Experience Deluxe and Blue Eyed Angel from the 1970 Isle of Wight perfomance. The latter he only includes one verse and one chorus and lyrically he kind of mashed the words together like he supposedly did with the 3 day after performance.</p></div>		</li>

I remember being so moved I said to my friend, what will we do when the Beatles die, and she just looked at me like I was an idiot. Not everyone was equally passionate about music. But getting the Sgt Pepper album is one of those events I’ll always remember. </p>
<p>Rubber Soul and Abbey Road were pretty amazing, too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Day in the Life, to me, is the purest expression of the Lennon/McCartney song writing team. It perfectly combines Lennon's surrealism with McCartney's slightly more &quot;down to earth&quot; sensibilities. Granted, I know this is based on the stereotype that Lennon was the far out artist and Paul was the &quot;pop music&quot; guy, which was not always the case, but it strikes me as sort of a distillation of those ideas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd have to agree with you on this.  It's like they have two songs melded together, one by each performer.  Even the orchestral flow between reaches a crescendo before moving on to the other section and it's the only space where the orchestra is really at the fore of the song.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ButterballHotline" target="_blank">ButterballHotline</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Except it isn't Lennon and McCartney writing together at all. The reason they were a team is they used to actually collaborate when they first started to write songs (like basically just Please Please Me through  maybe sort of Hard Day's Night) Day in the Life is a Lennon song with a McCartney fragment.</p>
<p>They kind of were stuck together because they were attached legally for complicated and dumb reasons. Any song either of them wrote with the Beatles was credited to the pair, so goofy structures like Day in the Life happened. And sometimes late in their career they would be like &quot;this isn't a full song but we need an album so let's find a way to put it on a record.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tomorrow Never Knows still sounds like it should be coming out two weeks from now, not 52 years ago</p>
<p>Overall though, as a record, Sgt. Peppers was made as a record that could not be played in its entirety live. It is kind of nuts to think though that while the Beatles going into the recording were still the largest thing going, people were starting to question if they would fade. They weren't playing live anymore so there was pressure on them to release a few singles from the sessions that weren't going to be on the record. So they released Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane as a double A side (another being All You Need is Love). George Martin regretted this later as they should have been on the album in his mind. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that they released it just 9 months after Revolver , quickly followed by the Magical Mystery tour EP. </p>
<p>So in 15 months they put out Revolver, Sgt. Peppers, All You Need is Love, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, and I am the Walrus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They wrote songs like She Loves You and I Want to Hold Your Hand in 1963. A mere three years later they come out with Eleanor Rigby and Strawberry Fields. THREE YEARS. To say their songwriting matured considerably is an understatement. There's a reason they are considered one of the greatest bands of all time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tomorrow never knows, last song on Revolver, and a prelude.  It was a step forward.  And people noticed.  Check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLLL9DKpUa4" target="_blank">this scene from MadMen</a>, In the scene Draper asked his hip, younger wife why people liked the beatles, she bought him the album, and said to start somewhere in the middle, but he goes to the end, and...doesn't get it.  Because it was so radical.  But it stands apart from the rest of the album.  And was the genesis for sure of things to come.  I am not sure, but I do think some of Sgt. Peppers was recorded along side that track, but it was &quot;ready&quot; first, and John wanted to give the new sound a test run.</p></div>		</li>
