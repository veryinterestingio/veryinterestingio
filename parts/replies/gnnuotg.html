			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no Cobalt specific refining yet. The only permitted cobalt only refinery in North America is located in Cobalt, Ontario. Where, as the name of the town suggests, there are lots of junior Cobalt mining companies. There are other cobalt deposits in places like Idaho in the US. The issue will be refining. Securing a supply chain is key to ending the reliance on cobalt from Congo. The mines are nothing without a refinery.</p></div>		</li>
