			<div class="markdown"><p>Soaps work on the same principle which is why you can't wash greases or oils off your hands using water without soap. Oils and waters just don't mix, which makes the egg with the ability to let them mix and is edible so useful for cooking. </p>
<p>There are some really cool videos of people putting oil and water in the same container and shaking it up, and you can almost watch the 2 separate. My favorite is the mutli layer density containers like this one which has 9 different liquids all of which are not mixing with each other (though some could but the situation prevents it)

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bananas, apple sauce or 'flax egg' are just a few examples. Vegan baking is a high expertise field with lots of experts on egg replacements in different recipes. I for one, love bananas as a replacement in pancakes and use apple sause in cupcakes. For other recipes I prefer oil, baking soda and a bit of acid (like vinegar or lemon juice). Options are endless :)</p></div>		</li>
