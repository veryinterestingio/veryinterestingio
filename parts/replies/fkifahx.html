			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much that, but all the people who wanted the cats to look big got eaten.</p>
<p>The evolutionary pressure when breeding large natural predators goes two ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How did you come to that conclusion? The text above basically describes that humans used wolves to hunt due to their size and other favorable characteristics and therefore controlled more of the wolves' lifestyles including breeding to select for favorable genes more. Cats, in contrast, are small and don't provide the same hunting value (they are good for pest maintenance rather than acquiring food) and therefore their lifestyles and breeding weren't controlled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it more likely because dogs are domesticated wolves, which are big, therefore leaving a lot of room to 'breed down' into things like pugs, whereas the 'domestic house cat' is typically one of a few small species of cats... so a lot harder to 'breed up' and turn into a larger specimen? I mean if we had started with tigers we might have all kinds of weird cat breeds, but even still we do have quite a large variety of domestic cats... just all of them a bit more uniform as compared to dogs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  You could make a giant pug if you wanted to (and were feeling particularly cruel).  People just haven't been selectively breeding cats for very long.</p></div>		</li>
