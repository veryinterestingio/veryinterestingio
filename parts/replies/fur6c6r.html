			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this reply the best, but I think it’s worth adding to the OP’s point of loading “normally” is probably an illusion. Chances are it was interrupted while doing something. Assuming it didn’t close, the app would likely have been unstable at that point (meaning something it is dependent upon, like data pulled from a database, wasn’t actually obtained but the app expects it and crashes when it doesn’t find what it thought would be there), and would have crashed, or at least continued to act weird until you closed it and reopened it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To go into a little more detail, usually the main thread is responsible for interaction with the user. When you tell the program to close, it shuts down all of the lower level threads. Right before the main thread exits, but after the blocking thread(s) terminates, the application is responsive again.</p></div>		</li>
