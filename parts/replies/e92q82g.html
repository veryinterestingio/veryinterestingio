			<div class="markdown"><p>They glow and fade because of residual heat, unless it's a flourecent light, in which case the UV light emitted from mercury vapor due to the electrical discharge hits a phosphor (or similar) atom and raises it's electron into a higher state, this higher state has a half life, and when it &quot;decays&quot; back to its normal orbit it emits a photon that we can see.</p>
<p>After the phosphor stops being hit by UV, it halves in brightness each of its half life, leading to a slow decrease in brightness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair, but having worked in an elementary school for a few years, the other explanations are, at a rough minimum, an ELI9. Try saying retina and photo-bleaching to an actual five year old. They'll stare blankly into your eyes, shit themselves, and find something shiny to play with instead </p></div>		</li>
