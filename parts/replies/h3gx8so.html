			<div class="markdown"><p>oh you sound just like my professor! I swear I can send some data later today!... jokes aside, every week we run interesting experiments, sometimes exciting, sometimes disappointing, they all count! but sometimes (rarely) there is a breakthrough that opens a new door or solves a question you have been pondering for months (or years)...  I hope I can have a few more of those soon. But results by themselves do not make a publishable story... they need to be repeated, validated, and peer-reviewed. Also crafting all these results into a nice story that flows well and that your peers will read takes time. I am hoping I will be able to share my latest research in a year or two. We have found a really cool metabolic adaptation of CD8 T cells to intestinal environments that we believe can be leveraged to improve the anti-tumor response. (edit for typos)</p></div>		</li>
