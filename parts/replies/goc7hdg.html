			<div class="markdown"><p>Great description. Your point about the cold is very true.</p>
<p>There's an adage that you're not dead until you're warm and dead. People have been found cold and seemingly long-departed but, after warming them up, turn out to not just still be alive but make incredible or even full recoveries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeh I remember watching a documentary about that, was fascinating. There was a woman who had drowned in a frozen lake, and was successfully resuscitated 3 hours after she ‘died’. </p>
<p>And yeh it led to a lot of research and amazing medical inventions that are now routinely being used, such as the device that takes your blood out of your body, makes it very cold, and puts it back in. It means that surgical operations that would kill you before are now possible. They still kill you, but that’s not problem, the Dr’s simply kill you and keep you cold, do what they need to do, and then patch you back up and bring you back to life haha. It’s amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is, it never ceases to amaze me how good technology and medical science currently are, and how much better life is now because of them. </p>
<p>It's also why I tend to believe peer-reviewed science over conspiracies because the scientists and doctors are the ones making these amazing discoveries and devices!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually one of the treatments that we use in the ICU post cardiac arrest. It's called TTM, or targeted temperature management, and essentially it's a device that circulates water through adhesive gel pads ( we use artic sun) that cools the body down to about 90F and then we gradually increase the body's core temperature. This helps to decrease metabolic demand on the body and also helps to prevent reperfusion injuries.</p></div>		</li>
