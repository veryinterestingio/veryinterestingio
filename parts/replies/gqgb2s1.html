			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you please elaborate more on the effectiveness part of your reply? In one of my pharmaceutical related courses the professor always spoke of efficacy, but in another pharmacology course the professor always uses the term effectiveness and hasn't said efficacy once. </p>
<p>I had figured there was a subtle difference between the two of course, but that generally (at least in the context of my courses) they refer to the same\similar parameter of a drug so I can consider them interchangeable (in the generalized context only, <strong>not</strong> in regards to the topic of your comment and the original post), or at least when the professor says &quot;effectiveness&quot; in a sense they also mean efficacy... </p>
<p>Evidently further research is required on my part. Perhaps it can be said that effectiveness is a more broad term, that includes efficacy? Therefore, when the word efficacy is used, it is referring to a more specific parameter or measure of the drugs ability to achieve it's target effect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be confusing - particularly when talking about efficacy trials (normally controlled trials) and effectiveness trials (how it works in the real world)</p>
<p>In this specific case (vaccines) they tend to talk about efficacy being purely &quot;What percentage of exposed people didn't get the disease&quot;  and effectivness purrely on &quot;what are the outcomes&quot;.</p>
<p>Possibly influenza is an easier example - because the 2019-20 flu vaccine in the northern hemisphere  didn't contain all the common varients, efficacy was low (around 40%) - so far more people than hoped who had been vaccinated caught flu. That said, among vaccinated people,  the outcomes were far better than the unvaccinated people. DEspite catching flu, vaccinatedd people were less likely to be hospitalised, if they were the length of stays were less and overall there were fewer deaths.</p></div>		</li>
