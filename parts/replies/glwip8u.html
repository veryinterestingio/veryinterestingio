			<div class="markdown"><p>The adrenal glands produce the hormone coritsol, which regulates the sleep cycle in the opposite way that melatonin does. Cortisol is a stress hormone (part of the flight/fight response) that is stimulating, alerting and promotes wakefulness. We have high levels of cortisol in the morning to get us up, and melatonin kicks in in the evening to make us sleepy. Staying up late fights the natural cycles and natural balance of these hormones, and throws it all off. Our bodies produce more cortisol to allow us to stay up late and overcome sleepiness, but then that backfires when we finally try to go to sleep. </p>

<p>&quot;Studies have shown that insomnia and other forms of sleep deprivation cause your body to secrete more cortisol during the day, perhaps in an effort to stimulate alertness.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, is there any way to instantly reduce the effect of the cortisol release? </p>
<p>I have this sleep onset problem whenever I try to focus on doing some kind of work, or on a learning activity, after dinner and into the early evening, even if it’s a fun task. It’s almost like the effort required to focus might release cortisol. Exercising in the evening can cause the same problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct about working/thinking and exercising late, both of those activities can stimulate cortisol and make it harder to sleep. I don't know of any quick fixes to this. The key to a healthy sleep cycle is to maintain it daily and continuously, going to sleep the same time everyday including weekends. </p>
<p>From a different article: &quot;Research shows a complex two-way street between the HPA axis (which produces cortisol and regulates its levels) and sleep. Poor, insufficient, irregular sleep increases the activity of that system, leading to more stress, greater arousal [...]. And a more active HPA axis can interfere with the ability to maintain consistent sleep routines and to get enough sound, high-quality sleep. It can be a vicious cycle.&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT: Anyone remember an article about the sleepiest song in the world? It sounds like clickbait, but that shit is real. The song was developed with a team of sleep scientists with the intention of helping listeners to sleep. It has a wandering melody that your brain won't catch onto or anticipate; the rhythm is slow (50bpm if I remember correctly) to encourage your heart rate to slow down to match it; and it's 8minutes long, which gives enough time for all these things to have an effect on your mind/body. The song is &quot;Weightless&quot; by Marconi Union. I've used it for years and it works! I've even used it on long flights when I wasn't even tired but wanted to pass the time. It's been my #1 most listened-to song for at least 5 years, so relaxing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be that guy but <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8257923/" target="_blank">CBD is scientifically proven to reduce cortisol levels</a></p>
<p>Anecdotally, I train in Muay Thai and BJJ and after a week or two of hard training I start getting what I can only describe as the feeling of burnout, which just feels like high stress with no cause or outlet. </p>
<p>I take CBD after dinner on the first or second day when I feel this and it’s like an instant reset. </p>
<p>Long term effects wise I have no idea if it’s healthy to do this, but if you’re looking for a quick solution, here it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this adrenaline release elevated in someone who has an anxiety disorder? Cause I have GAD and when I’m sleep deprived and exhausted it can be a nightmare sometimes for me to fall asleep unless I’m already nodding off and that would explain a LOT</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So similar to this (but only slightly scientific and mostly anecdotal) I always wondered why I’d drift off for a second then be jolted awake but ‘feel’ different than a few minutes prior.  Something about entering REM sleep (this sounds wrong but it’s how I remember it) lowers your body temperature just enough that if you startle yourself awake you have a different ‘feeling’ than before you fell asleep. I fall asleep hard and fast sometimes, but sometimes slow enough that I can hear and feel my snoring mechanism kicking in the back of my throat. But there’s sometimes that “jolt” of adrenaline that wakes me back up and it’s so bizarre. So this tracks.</p></div>		</li>
