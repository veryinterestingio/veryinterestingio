			<div class="markdown"><p>Also curious about marine noise pollution! Since sonar is often important for the species, I would guess that the boats/instruments/etc. humans have in the ocean would be a concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Noise pollution is also a concern.  Some noises can scare whales or interfere with communication.  However, many whales are able to adapt - kind of like how you raise your voice to speak at a loud party.  We do not know the long-term consequences.  They might be spending more energy communicating, and that could affect fitness.</p></div>		</li>
