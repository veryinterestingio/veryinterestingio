			<div class="markdown"><p>and it's even crazier than the alternative of it 'knowing'. like that snake that has a spider on its tail to lure birds closer. it's insane that one day a snake accidentally mutated with a weird insect looking tail that eventually looked like a spider after how ever many years. crazy stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was no “sudden mutation” for things like that. Rather just some snake’s were born with slightly offcolor tailtips and over the large numbers of individuals and time some might have accidentally lured birds or other prey in. Eventually those with those tails would have a very minor advantage at finding prey than other snakes. This adds up over millions of generations until their tails look quite distinct.</p>
<p>Individual snakes that then moved the tails when near prey or when stressed/excited etc. would end up accidentally “actively” using that different shaped/colored tail as bait, and then they would have a very minor advantage over those that didnt which would add up over thousands and millions of generations.</p>
<p>Sorry for rambling, just it’s a common misconception that evolution happens in leaps rather than tiny incremental steps .</p></div>		</li>
