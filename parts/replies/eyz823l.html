			<div class="markdown"><p>Sinus discomfort can also be related to dry (possibly bloody) sinuses or thick mucous in the sinuses, it also stands to reason that saline (to reduce irritation) water (distilled or boiled only) provides additional relief.</p>
<p>My understanding is that one of the benefits of breathing through your nose is adding humidity to the ingress air, so i would imagine that it also helps you feel like you can breathe better in addition to clearing out congested nasal passages.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Remember with a cold, almost all the symptoms are caused by your body’s inflammatory reaction to the virus, not the virus itself.</p>

<p>This is something I've always wondered about. If my body is doing something beneficial to fight a virus (or any illness), am I hampering its ability to help me if I use countermeasures against whatever my body is doing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The research goes both ways regarding fever medications. Some research suggests that taking fever meds for a temperature below 102°F or 103°F prolongs illness. Some research suggests that it doesn't affect the length of illness.</p>
<p>Do your own research, Make your own choices. Regardless, if you have a high fever, 103°F+, it needs to be lowered.</p>
<p>Personally, I avoid taking fever meds if possible.</p>
<p>Not to be taken as medical advice, always see a medical professional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even this advice (lower any fever above 103F) is not based on any real science. The body of a normally functioning human will not raise its temperature above 106.5F to fight an infection, and although the higher your temperature the less comfortable you are, there is no medical danger from a body temperature less than 106.5F.</p>
<p>Sometimes, rapidly rising body temperature can cause a seizure (this is more common in infants and small children and I can confirm is terrifying for new parents), but these febrile seizures are not inherently dangerous. Again, they are correlated with how fast the temperature is rising, not with how high the temperature gets.</p>
<p>So in other words, the instinctual fear that people have about a high fever is that the higher it is, the more likely it is to cross some magical boundary above which brain damage or death can occur. But this doesn't happen. The body simply does not allow itself to cross that boundary.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS: Poisoning (like from household chemicals, not like from food-borne pathogens) and heat exposure (being outside when it's hot or spending too long in a sauna, for example) can all lead to temps above 106.5, and are obviously very dangerous.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, if you're sure the fever is due to an infection, you do not need to worry about the temperature.</p>
<p>There are valid reasons to want to lower a fever, however: to make it easier to sleep (sleep is important for healing and this could explain the mixed results from studies on the effects of artificially lowering fevers), to make it easier to drink and keep down fluids (dehydration is a real threat with some infections), and to simply take a break from feeling like shit and give your conscious mind a rest from the battle your body is fighting.</p>
<p>Edit: I should clarify that while a high fever does not pose a danger in and of itself (the temperature won't cause any damage), very high fevers can be a sign of dangerous infections that absolutely merit medical intervention such as bacterial meningitis. So if your fever is high, definitely see a doctor, but once you've ruled out the bad stuff, don't sweat it (see what I did there?) if you're running 105F as long as you're able to stay hydrated and get some sleep.</p></div>		</li>
