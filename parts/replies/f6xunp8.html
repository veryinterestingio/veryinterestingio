			<div class="markdown"><p>I was diagnosed with epilepsy as a kid, first seizure around 4 months.  I was on Dilantin, and later, phenobarbital.  EEG was abnormal per my neurologist, no identifiable cause.</p>
<p>After I came off my meds in my teens, I started having migraines.  Not frequent, and never lasted long.  As the Internet came into vogue, I discovered it's possible to have migraines as a child.</p>
<p>My working theory, then, is that i always had migraines, that just happened to be dampened by my meds.  The reason I think this is because I never had classic seizure symptoms.  Or, perhaps, it was like I was in petite mal for hours -- never woke up without meds, but no jerking or anything, with eyes open.  I also think this because, when I was 8, I had my last &quot;seizure.&quot;  When I think about how I felt, I see an almost exact correlation between those symptoms and my migraines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no probably about it, I can see a new neurologist making a good paper about that correlation.  Or even a not-so-new one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I worked at McDonald's, I used to blame the mcchickens for giving me visual migraines.</p>
<p>The migraines magically stopped when I stopped working at McDonald's. I now work at a 10/10 food place, so any meals I get are made with home made-quality ingredients instead of MSG chicken patties with who knows what else.</p>
<p>Haven't had a visual migraine almost exactly since I changed jobs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, not a myth.  Buy a lab, some chick-fil-a and my migraine medication and some cash for my pocket because I don't like getting migraines for nothing, and I'll literally show you.</p>
<p>Find any scientist / lab, and I'll be the guinea pig.  MSG, gives me a migraine.  Every. Single. Time. I'm not talking about glutamates in general, and the amount in Parmesan, tomatoes and mushrooms isn't that large.</p>
<p>Just for a point of reference... too much oxygen will kill you as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love these comments from people who don’t experience it.  Had horrible migraines for years. Started cataloging what I was eating then tried systematically removing things long before I knew msg was a trigger for some.  Now if I eat MSG on accident, I get a migraine...every time.  Yes it occurs naturally in some things like Parmesan that don’t trigger, but a bag of Doritos or KFC will 100% do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting reading your comments -- the last particularly nasty migraine I had was with a heap of free breakfast sausage at some hotel; I wondered if that had something to do with it. Still, I often eat MSG-heavy foods, top my homemade Italian dishes with a heavy dose of parmigiano... but I have not had a severe migraine in close enough proximity to eating anything like that for me to think a connection is plausible. I have had auras without pain, but not nearly as often as I used to suffer the whole ordeal - and without any remarkable contextual influences.</p>
<p>It would be nice to know more. Eh. Guess I will keep reading the literature periodically.</p></div>		</li>
