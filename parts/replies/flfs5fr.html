			<div class="markdown"><p>The money doesn't actually exist, they're just numbers on a spreadsheet. There's about $2T in US currency worldwide, but the economy is worth about $21.4T altogether. Our debt however, is $22.7T and climbing (we went about $1T deeper last year and the economy was doing great). That's why borrowing more, much like getting a credit card to pay off bills is risky.</p></div>		</li>
