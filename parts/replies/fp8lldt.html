			<div class="markdown"><p>I put that a little further down the thread, but I'll copy it here too. Basically, E. coli.</p>
<p>It's the raw flour that is probably the bigger issue with cookie dough. I don't remember when it was, but years ago one of the big cookie dough manufacturers (Pillsbury or Nestle) had to recall millions of packages of cookie dough because people were getting E. coli. It wasn't from eggs, it was from flour. In fact, two bags of flour I bought last year were recalled due to E. coli concerns. I think flour <em>can</em> be sterilized, but most flour mills assume you will actually cook the flour lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can sterilize the flour by baking spread out on a pan at 350 F for 5 minutes. It also gives it a liiittle different nutty flavor which i really like!</p>
<p>Please note you should ONLY DO THIS if you don't intend to cook the final result! Prebaking flour cam change the chemical comp enough that it could change the final baked/cooked product.</p>

<p>Edit: added Fahrenheit, info and source (Cause someone ran my karma credit??? Til)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flour is ground wheat.  Specifically, that's all it is.  If animals or birds are shitting on the wheat, and it's just getting ground and packaged then it could still have bacteria and would need to be &quot;cooked&quot; or baked to get rid of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not just a liability thing, it’s a scale thing.  You use one or two eggs in any given product, they use huge numbers per batch. The odds are much better in that case that the bacteria might be present. </p>
<p>That said, salmonella in eggs is much less common than it is in chicken meat, so it’s a pretty small risk regardless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did the math once based on the stats for what percentage of eggs are contaminated with salmonella in the us, and I think (going by memory, my numbers may be a bit off) it worked out to you could pull a Rocky and down 6 raw eggs every morning, and on average you'd only get sick from it every 8 years or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. If you have a one thousand to one chance of getting salmonella from an egg, than it is safe to eat a raw egg once in a while. But if you eat raw cookie dough from a batch that was made with one thousand eggs it is much less safe.</p></div>		</li>
