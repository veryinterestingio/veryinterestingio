			<div class="markdown"><p>The fun part about it is that because each chord is simply an on/off combination of characters, then you can transcribe stenotype into binary for introduction into a computer.</p>
<p>Each chord would make 3 8-bit characters, so the above example would be:</p>
<p>11 00 00 00 0C 04 00 40 C0 04 60 50 00 00 50</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes off that way, yes, but each of those lines is effectively one keystroke, called a chord. Think like playing a piano, where each key is set to a particular note, and multiple notes can play at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't pushing E then U then S. All three are pressed at the same time meaning that it's the same amount of time as typing a single letter on a regular keyboard. This can compound because in the &quot;is&quot; example, three keys made a single, two-letter word. Other letter combinations using three letters may create longer words or even entire phrases which is why stenographers can type so quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes very true! Also we have brief forms for words and phrases that are commonly used - so writing “did there come a time” for me is DRO*UT on the steno keyboard but it’s only one motion of pushing down of the keys. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, this is super interesting so thanks to everyone chiming in.</p>
<p>I get that they're pressing multiple keys at once, but how do they know it'll come out in the right order if they're pressing multiple keys at once? So in this example, if you press E and U and S at the same time, is it possible to accidently register as ESU, UES, etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More keys pressed at the same time. To someone who isn't
familiar with the logic behind this system it might seem
counterintuitive, but sometimes pressing 6 keys at once with
just one hand can actually be easier and quicker than some other
combinations which look easy on paper but require some unusual
finger positioning. Just like pressing Control+Shift on a normal
keyboard is quick and easy because they're right beside each
other, but pressing Control+Tab is already a bit awkward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandma worked with stenography in the 60s. She was an assistant at a big company in Sweden and would write down incoming messages from Switzerland that came in via telegraph. </p>
<p>About a year ago I was having coffee with her and she wrote my name in stenography (by hand, not the machine). She asked me if I could read what it said, and I had no idea until she explained. It's actually really cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's cool, but this is what I'm confused about with the whole topic. Is someone really typing 200-300wpm if you can't even understand your own name when they type it? It sounds like they're typing 0wpm except to 0.00001% of readers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, they're still writing it down, just with other letters. In my grandma's case, she would quickly write the incoming messages down to the exact words using stenography, then translate them into regular Latin letters. So the stenography worked as a way to get all the information correctly, then use that as a draft to get the message out to everyone else.</p></div>		</li>
