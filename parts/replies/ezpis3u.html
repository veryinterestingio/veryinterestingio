			<div class="markdown"><p>but the oxygen is produced in the leaves, so a large tree without leaves will not produce oxygen.</p>
<p>or, if there are two trees of the same size and same species, but one has a lot less leaves than the other, it will not be able to produce the same amount of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, and that tree with less leaves will grow less. As a general rule, a bigger tree will gain mass faster than a small sapling, but there are plenty of plants, such as bamboo, which break that rule (and iirc giant redwoods grow very slowly).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bamboo is also using higher amounts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_growth" target="_blank">acid growth</a> for its rapid growth which is different than growth through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Total growth is ultimately limited by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_area_index" target="_blank">leaf area index</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as growth rates are concerned you are a little backward. The older and more massive a tree becomes the slower the rate of growth. Young pine trees may grow at 10-12% in the early stages of pulpwood, slow to 6-8% as healthy pulpwood before its mature, and finally slowing to less than 3% for a mature tree. Anything beyond that and the growth will continue to slow to &gt;1% for an overly mature tree. There is a genetic limit inherent to each species as to how large it can grow but rate of growth always slows down as they age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. Plants do not use CO2 to create oxygen, they instead use CO2 as a carbon source. The actual production of oxygen doesn't involve CO2 at all, oxygen instead gets produced from water during the light-dependent phase of photsynthesis. Carbon Dioxide is consumed during the light-independent phase of photosynthesis, using energy captured during the light-dependent phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I said, the route is not direct, but the net result is CO2 to C + O2. Yes, in fact the C is stored as carbohydrates by consuming water. For example, C12H22O11 is sucrose, and that's 6 C + 11 H2O (again, this is not produced directly, but it is the net result).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It differs from species to species, but trees stop growing taller after a certain period of time due to difficulties with moving nutrients/water all the way from the roots to the top of the tree. The height limit depends on the species, but large forests of the same species of tree will have a general &quot;ceiling&quot; with just a few outliers.</p>
<p>Once a tree reaches its maximum height, it will continue to grow outward as the trunk and branches get thicker, but it will stop producing new branches unless it loses significant mass to injury. All trees eventually die from &quot;old age&quot;, but it's usually a variety of factors that ultimately kill most trees.</p>
<p>A tree may die from any combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human disturbance</li>
<li>Weather (lightning, drought, etc)</li>
<li>Parasites/diseases</li>
<li>Soil changes</li>
<li>&quot;Old age&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding &quot;old age&quot; - all trees undergo some form of damage throughout their lives, typically from parasites or disease if all other conditions are perfect. When they heal themselves, often the nutrient channels can become choked or slowed, leading to death or rot in various parts of the tree. This process weakens the tree dramatically, making it more susceptible to infections or damage from wind/fire/etc. A large tree might lose a significant limb to such a process and then slowly die as the existing limbs cannot keep up with the energy needs of the tree, or the trunk may simply fail under the weight of the tree if it becomes weak enough.</p>
<p>Certain species of tree can live for thousands of years if undisturbed. I've never seen any legitimate studies about this or anything, but I've noticed that many of the oldest known trees in the world are at higher elevations and in environments where many of the common diseases or parasites that are responsible for tree death are not able to thrive. This may be one cause of their longevity, since human disturbances are also less likely as the elevation increases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once observed in my garden a tree that got hit by lighting. The tree itself survived the strike but lost a major limb. Afterwards it started to slowly heel towards one side and if we didn't do anything about it, the tree would surely fall. </p>
<p>But this was velvet tree, a surprising hardy tree, the root system spread for a bit around the garden and because the main trunk was basically dying, suddenly all over the garden there came new offshoots.</p></div>		</li>
