<p>Obviously spaceships could be done when they are back on earth, but I'm thinking about the space station that is always up there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The windows in the cupola on the ISS are 4 panes of bulletproof glass. The innermost two actually maintain pressure (one is a backup), while the inner &amp; outer panes protect from scratches and space debris. You can replace the outer pane without compromising pressurization, but it's also designed to replace the whole assembly, in which case you would fit an external pressure cover over the outside of the window and replace it from the inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would expect they double pane the windows, one being the actual air tight layer, another being a protective layer that just clicks in to protect from micro meteorites. Idk but as an engineer thatâ€™s what I would do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They'd have a hole blown in them like they got shot. It has never happened yet and hopefully never will, that's one of the reasons space walks are so dangerous.</p>
<p>They do get hit by cosmic rays though all the time which causes cancer and makes them see flashes of light even with their eyes closed when they hit the optic nerve through their skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, if they were all standard size and they had one or two spares, they could go through out the ISS and swap them out and clean them. It might even be easier if they could depressurize the area so that an EVA wouldn't be needed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, departing and incoming shuttle thrusters give off enough particulate to dirty the windows over time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh, neat, I never heard about that. However, I did read that the Dragon capsules use an approach path specifically designed, so they never have to fire their thrusters towards the station. Does that mean this isn't an issue anymore since the Shuttles were retired?</p></div>		</li>
