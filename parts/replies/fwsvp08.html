			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting topic to be working on! You’re right that an ideal will be very good transparency of trials. Whether posting on a website like <a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a> will help people believe more in vaccines is hard to say. People tend to be heavily influenced by their prior beliefs. You may get someone very opposed to vaccination using the website to look for things that confirm their thinking. The majority of people vaccinate and do not think much of it, so they are unlikely to care if trials are posted. Media coverage of an issue like this could have a bigger impact – if a news outlet ran a story about the lack of transparency of clinical trials that could encourage suspicion and mistrust. There should be more pressure for the results to be posted to avoid such a situation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ah yes, would this be confirmation bias?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well confirmation bias is about “new information,” and the site is “lacking information.”</p>
<p>But it’s relatively the same yes. The lack of information is new to them since they just discovered the site, and the new evidence of lacking evidence reinforces their beliefs.</p></div>		</li>
