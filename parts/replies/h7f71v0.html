			<div class="markdown"><p>this should be the main answer to his question no? We seem to be using a lot of elements like Iron and ect to stay alive and those wouldn't be present on earth if our solar system was the first and only thing to form.</p>
<p>Our solar system would be the same, but yes, there would be a difference :</p>
<p>earth and everything else would be barren of life.  </p>
<p>correct me if I'm wrong but that does seem to me to be the one big difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>About one-half of Earth's core heating is caused through radioactive decay of elements created by colliding neutron stars before the start of the Solar System. Earth's core heating runs the engine of plate tectonics creating much of the Earth's atmosphere and creates the magnetic field which protects Earth's atmosphere from the solar wind. This atmosphere allows life on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiogenic heating (by uranium, thorium, potassium-40) is mainly in the mantle and crust, not the core. The core is generally thought to have very little of these radiogenic elements, which chemically favor incorporation into rock rather than metal. (There may be some contribution to core heat from radiogenic elements, but even then it would be a small component of the core's energy.) Most of the energy in Earth's core is leftover from its the formation (kinetic energy of accreting planetesimals, and friction from dense iron sinking to form the core). The gradual cooling of the molten core led to the formation and growth of the solid inner core ~0.5-1.5 billion years ago. Dense iron (and nickel) freezes to grow the inner core,  while buoyant lighter elements (e.g. sulfur, oxygen, silicon, hydrogen, etc.) also present in the outer core rise. This releases gravitational potential energy, which is converted to heat by friction. The freezing also releases latent heat. This energy and the rising and sinking due to compositional and temperature differences (i.e. convection) powers the dynamo for Earth's magnetic field.</p>
<p>Plate tectonics (which is important for life) is also a feature of the crust and mantle (for which radiogenic heating is important), and not a part of the convection in the outer core that drives the dynamo. However, they are interrelated. The core supplies some heat to the mantle, while the rate of mantle cooling (e.g. by plate tectonics, and mantle convection in general) constrains the rate the underlying core cools.</p>
<p>The degree of importance of an intrinsic magnetic field for protecting the atmosphere is complicated and has been increasingly called into question over the past few years. A magnetic field protects from direct erosion by solar wind, but drives some escape (polar wind) and does not affect thermal escape. Planets without their own dynamo develop a weak induced magnetosphere in response to the solar wind that provides some protection. In short, an internally generated magnetic field is neither necessary nor sufficient for maintaining a thick atmosphere (as demonstrated by Venus)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the question was is the solar system self-sufficient now.  Not whether it was created by magic.   </p>
<p>You are presumably self-sufficient now but of course you were not when you were younger!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No: the question explicitly says: if it <em>was</em> the only thing to form. “Was” - past, from the start. So the many posts pointing out where the heavier elements came from are on point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But is life as we know it and define it the only option?  Would the possibility of evolution occur with other possible elements or lack there of? Our definition of life is based on what we experience and see but aren't alternatives a possibility?  All the contrary articles I've looked at debunk silicon-based over carbon based life because carbon bonds with oxygen  and exchanges atoms so simply while silicon does not, but again why can't evolution find an alternative to oxygen?  Not saying that it is the wrong argument but rather posing the question is it possible? Life is the act of expelling and storing of energy through molecular exchange but plenty of elements react together without carbon and oxygen right? Just my arm-chair ponderings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To reply by quoting one of my favourate papers from this year:</p>
<p>&quot;Although these ideas may seem overly conservative, if we deviate too far from the constraints suggested by life on Earth, then life might be invoked ad hoc to explain any unexplained astronomical or planetary science data. The convection cells in the Sun might be the stirrings of giant high-temperature gaseous creatures that find it difficult to sit still. Gamma ray bursts are perhaps the energized flatulence of star-eating intelligent clouds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The principle of grounding hypotheses in known chemistry and biochemistry also militates against what we might refer to as “biochemical cherry-picking.” Biological entities are not isolated chemical reactions but complex concatenations of many integrated and interdependent biochemical pathways, all of which are required for an organism to be able to grow and reproduce. One cannot use evidence consistent with a single, isolated biochemical pathway as a plausible basis for invoking biological processes in an environment where many more fundamental biochemical pathways are blocked by unfavorable conditions.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be of interest to you: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDYazipjSI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDYazipjSI</a></p>
<p>It mentions the carbon vs. silicon comparison. And it isn't that carbon forms bonds with oxygen bonds while silicon doesn't. It's kind of the opposite. It is that when silicon bonds with oxygen it forms solid (quartz) that isn't readily soluble in water, or much else for that matter. Further, silicon bonds are weaker and aren't able to form complex molecules as easily, but they also have a wider range of stable temperatures than carbon bonds.</p>
<p>It also breaks the idea down in to &quot;life as we know it&quot; and &quot;life as we don't know it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
