			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a reason for this.  Investment is risky.  No one compensates you if you make an investment and lose all your money.  Capital gains taxes are lower to incentivize people to invest.  Those investments provide capital to companies and allows general economic growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that the government gives tax breaks for reinvesting. So Amazon uses its income to reinvest, which means that it shows very little income.  </p>
<p>This increases the worth of the company and thus the stock price, but it does not get taxed. Until they decide that they have grown enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlike people, if companies spend more than they earn they don't have to pay taxes at all (whereas people are forced to pay income taxes) Did your company make 100 million this year? Well you just bought a new warehouse, hired more people, and bought a bunch of equipment all of which are business expenses, you actually spent 101 million dollars and therefore don't need to pay taxes! </p>
<p>Your actual amount of total worth as a company still massively increased because you acquired physical goods which have worth and your income potential is higher, but according to the math, your company lost money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the general strategy was to have a parent company set up in a country that has a little to no corporate tax and then pay a licensing fee to that company for basically the amount of your profits so that your company technically didn't make any money this year but that other parent company did. Is that not really the case anymore? Like did they finally stop doing that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another typical strategy is to take out massive loans to pay for fun stuff. Loans can be (partially) deducted from your income. Loans need to be backed by something, and in the case of lots of ultra wealthy people, they use their stock to back them up. As such, they never officially sell the stock, just use them as collateral. So these people can live without paying any tax even on income as the loan will offset that income.</p>
<p>One could argue that as soon as stock is used as a collateral, it should be considered as cashed out and therefore capital gains should be paid. But nah, not in the country where business and businessmen are more important than citizens.</p></div>		</li>
