			<div class="markdown"><p>This! I used to get them when I did cross country for a season in high school. My coach told me that it was my diaphragm cramping, and I should take more exhales than inhales...so I tried exhaling:inhaling ratio at 3:1 breaths. Works for me!</p>
<p>(FYI a medical student now, I have NO idea if this is true anatomically but it worked, so wtv)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I was always getting side stitches when doing physical activities , got x rays, cat scans blah blah I was fine so I tried changing my breathing technique . I noticed I always used to breath into my chest , which is shallow breating and doesnâ€™t allow all the air to get to the diaphragm after changing my technique I noticed I barely got them anymore.</p></div>		</li>
