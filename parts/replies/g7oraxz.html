			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not really about the cholesterol you eat, it’s more that your body produces much more of it’s own cholesterol in response to a high fat, calorie surplus diet.  That excess cholesterol circulates in your blood and can form fatty plaques on the walls of your arteries, causing them to narrow and lose their flexibility over time.</p></div>		</li>
