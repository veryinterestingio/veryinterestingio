			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a dentist who examined pre-western contact skulls and modern xrays also made the hypothesis that the &quot;standard western diet&quot; screwed up many aboriginal society bone structures and genetics.  Things like birthing stress, width of jaws, sinus and nose clearances and breathing, and mental temperament were all negatively impacted by western diets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be wrong but I’m seeing this in Asia right now. The older generation who came from poverty and didn’t have blenders and stuff to make food soft tend to have stronger jaws and straighter teeth. Their own descendants, which of going by the argument that evolution causes us to have smaller jaws, may have more crooked teeth because of lack of proper jaw development. I myself grew up poor and my parents never had the time to cut our foods into tiny pieces - so we were given whole apples to bite into, for example. No one in my family (I’m of Chinese descent) have issues with our teeth, all our wisdom teeth grew out straight.</p></div>		</li>
