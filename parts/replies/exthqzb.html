			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so does this mean that all the Aspen in the western US are from germ lines greater than 10,000 years old? Like, every Aspen is either part of a 10,000+ year old network like Pando or could would be a newer twin of an Aspen that is greater than 10,000 years old?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mutation had already existed prior to the change in selective pressures. Now that selective pressures are changing again, the population ratio is returning to what it was before all that coal soot covered everything. The moth didn't mutate in a short time, the ratio between moths with the two mutations changed in a short time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s “natural selection”, although driven by man-man environmental changes.  The idea of evolution is that change happens (mutations) and the different critters produced have different survival rates (natural selection).  Darwin managed to build that argument without even knowing how genes and mutations worked.  Just that something inheritable could show seemingly random changes and affect the creature’s form and behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also called strain theory, which is a popular term in phycology (algal research). </p>
<p>Concept being that, among large populations, the genetic diversity that would enable survival in different conditions is already present. Inducing an environmental change kills or prevents the reproduction of nonviable &quot;strains&quot;. </p>
<p>The reproduction of those strains increases the proportion of the population that carry those traits; but if the successful strain contained enough individuals, the new population should still contain most of the preexisting genetic diversity, as each strain member also contained some variation of all the other traits, including variation allowing it to produce offspring that does not express the selected trait.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this always the case? Like when they say &quot;this creature evolved to be the apex in its habitat&quot;, they don't mean that the species mutated selectively to survive, but more like whatever random mutations took place, happened to be favourable in that environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the peppered moth did not <strong>mutate</strong> in a very short amount of time, the black color mutation was quickly <em>selected for</em> to the point of becoming the most common in a short amount of time. The set of mutations to code for the coloration presumably took a very long time to randomly and benignly arise. The selective pressures can be rapid, resulting in rapid population changes, the (novel) mutations are not rapid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To preface, not an expert and mostly guessing from what I can remember of Pando and my garden. </p>
<p>The answer is basically cloning. A lot of plants reproduce by budding off a small version of themselves, a LOT. Iirc aspen roots will occasionally send a new shoot upwards which eventually becomes a whole new tree, which in turn grows its own roots that will eventually do it all over again. I dont know about aspen in particular but with most plants that grow like this the 'new' plant is totally capable of surviving on its own despite initially sharing a root system.</p></div>		</li>
