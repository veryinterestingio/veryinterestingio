<p>I've always been taught that science is an iterative process where <em>anyone who does science is always building on what came before</em>. Science is not a solitary activity and even luminaries from Albert Einstein to Jane Goodall can do what they do because of what they've learned from those who came before.</p>
<p>In that vein, I believe scientific knowledge - as a subset of human culture - should come with <a href="https://freedomdefined.org/Definition" target="_blank">four basic freedoms</a> that let others: </p>
<ol>
<li>Use it</li>
<li>Study and apply it</li>
<li>Share it</li>
<li>Remix and build upon it</li>
</ol>
<p>Thomas Jefferson put it <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4276-he-who-receives-an-idea-from-me-receives-instruction-himself" target="_blank">another way</a> (he should probably replace &quot;he&quot; with &quot;they&quot;!): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of this is to say that I believe we should structure our institutions to flow with this natural property of knowledge rather than against it.</p>
<p>In the realm of academic publications, I do believe we should work much harder towards Open Access not just for papers, but also data, source code, protocols, and designs. This has additional practical benefits of ensuring responsible science and increasing reproducibility, all of which improves the wider public's trust in science. My tiny contribution to this effort is co-editing a <a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BES-Guide-Reproducible-Code-2019.pdf" target="_blank">Guide to Reproducible Code</a> for ecologists (also applies to scientists in general).</p>
<p>Thanks for your question!</p></div>		</li>
