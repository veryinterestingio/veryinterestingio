			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. While genome comparisons are the gold standard, the traditional way is to much more boring: Ask every patient where they've been, when they were there, what they did there. Was anybody there showing symptoms? Do you remember their name?</p>
<p>Did you travel? Who did you travel with? What was the date on that trip? What train did you take? Do you remember which car? Was anyone on the platform coughing?</p>
<p>Have you been to a farm? Were there pigs there? Did you near them?</p>
<p>How can we get in touch with you if we have more questions?</p>
<p>Also, please spit in this test tube and put the stopper in it for me.</p>
<p>Then start cross-referencing things. For example if everybody who's sick ate at a particular restaurant, you have a pretty easy starting point right there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genome sequencing just tells you what it is and what species it originated from before the jump, doesn't give any indication of who may be infected and where the bug is going, we still need good ol' field work for that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish this was at the top.</p>
<p>Because it takes a literal tonne of work by way of interviews and tracking of peoples path of contract to track this all down.</p>
<p>Those people put themselves at great risk to understand where these people were, who they interacted with and where they went and then who they interacted with and then work out from there.</p></div>		</li>
