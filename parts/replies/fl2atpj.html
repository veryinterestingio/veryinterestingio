			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Lactate is a fuel that's used by the heart, brain and even Type 1 muscle fibers both during rest and exercise. In fact, there's excellent evidence to suggest that the preferred pathway to burn glucose is through the lactate rather than the pyruvate pathway. Here's an excellent review.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short version is basically the body doesnt have enough oxygen (which assists in clearing out the hydrogen ions that build up during exercise) and the buildup of excess hydrogen ions is partially responsible for <em>the burn</em>. The formation of lactate actually requires the absorption of some of those excess hydrogen ions, which helps reduce that burn.</p>
<p>Basically, your body doesnt have enough oxygen to clear the excess hydrogen that has accumulated and this is part of what leads to <em>the burn</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean this in the most respectful, civil way possible, but do you have sources for this? Idk, I’m a chemist and I’m just not used to hearing of hydrogen ions, especially in the body. I may be wrong, but I just want to know if you have sources backing up your evidence (eg, I’ve done studies on this 20+ years, here’s an article in Nature, something like that). I’m not being sarcastic, I’m truly just trying to respectfully ask for knowledge. Thanks friend!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe in the same light but oversimplified, but H+ is produced equivalent with lactate in skeletal muscle. So increased lactate doesn’t directly cause/alleviate H+ but trends in the same direction. </p>
<p>Along with that, perhaps not the difference in oxygen itself, but a difference in maximal oxygen utilization (oxygen use) and blood flow (H+ clearing)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You already have different muscle types, the most basic being quick twitch and slow twitch. The slow twitch ones are rich in mitochondria, use aerobic respiration, are heavily innervated, fatigue resistant, and you would using these during say a very long run.</p>
<p>The fast twitch have barely any mitochondria, and mostly get their ATP from glycolysis (anaerobic) . These are used for sprinting and lifting heavy weights.</p></div>		</li>
