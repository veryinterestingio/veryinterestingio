			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren’t likely up selling so much as not being as conservative as another dentist. What I call cavity another dentist may monitor. What I say needs a crown another dentist might say a large filling. Same for root canals and others. There are justifications on both sides that isn’t based on unethical behavior. It sounds like you want a dentist with a more conservative approach which is fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Word of mouth. Talk to friends, coworkers, etc. </p>
<p>Try to find a place with somebody’s name on the door rather than a large, anonymous group. The corporate model of dentistry puts patient needs way second.  If somebody has their name on the office, they’re probably going to care about the services delivered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is good to hear, when I told my dentist I wanted gold for the crown material on my rear molars she gave me a look and asked why.  I stated that from what I had read and heard from others is that they never had to mess with their gold crowns and I myself was replacing a porcelain crown that had cracked, so I felt it was a better material and I wasn't worried about the visibility in the back of my mouth. She did agree with me but was just curious as not many people request that. Anyway, thanks for validating my thought that beyond appearance we haven't got anything far better yet.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years and I haven't had to touch those teeth and they've never given me discomfort.  Side note; it's interesting to me after drinking a sugary drink how the gold never feels gritty like my other teeth do.</p></div>		</li>
