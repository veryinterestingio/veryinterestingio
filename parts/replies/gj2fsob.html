			<div class="markdown"><p>Two other things:</p>
<p>Argon is WAAAAY cheaper. Xenon is too expensive to be feasible for something like DUNE. </p>
<p>While the radioactivity of LAr is an issue for dark matter detection it is a feature for neutrino detection. The radioactivity is approximately 1 Bq / kg^3. This means it is in the sweet spot where it isnâ€™t too high to be a show stopping background but it is regular enough it can be used as an in situ calibration source.</p>
<p>Edit: Units are hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc the threshold of argon is higher too, because the scintillation wavelength is too short to pass through PMT glass and hence some wavelength shifter and/or doping is needed, which comes with an efficiency hit. I think argon and xenon have different advantages and disadvantages and it's hard to really say either is fundamentally better, though right now (probably by historical circumstance) xenon projects are about one whole generation ahead. Also, if WIMPs are real, we probably want different target media too so that we can measure particle properties, so we'll need both.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, though, I'm a bit biased towards xenon (but I tried to be impartial here)</p>
<p>Edit: my mistake, the higher threshold is due to a different ER/NR discrimination mechanism. See reply by u/damprobot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion, Xenon is significantly better than Argon, and not just for historical reasons. You can probe the same cross sections with a much, much smaller detector, and will never have to isotopically purify the detector medium (like Ar experiments likely will have to soon). Additionally, you can probe lighter masses with Xe than you can with Ar.</p>
<p>I think you're slightly overestimating the difficulty of wavelength shifting, it's really essentially a solved problem at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a &quot;how long is a piece of string&quot; question, so rough guess is fine.</p>
<p>How long do you think it will be before we have sensitive enough detectors for wimps? And are there any other substances that would be better for the experiments?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct. Argon is a great detector medium in general, its just limited for traditional spin independent WIMP dark matter detection.</p></div>		</li>
