			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that a LIP like the Columbia Basalt Group in the western US would have severe repercussions for the entire world if it were to break apart because of the Yellowstone Supervolcano located right by it. The thing is though that would rely on divergent Continental Plates. Mountain ranges like the Rocky Mountains are the result of Convergent Plates. So i could see how the Columbia Basalt Group breaking apart would be bad and set Yellowstone, which is way overdue to erupt, and how that could produce a mass extinction event and a nuclear winter effect, but I don't think that specific scenario is possible if I'm correct about the convergent plate status of the Rocky Mountain range....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The closest thing to a LIP that has happened in the last few hundred years was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laki" target="_blank">eruption of Laki in 1783-1784</a></p>
<p>It's a drop in the bucket compared to a LIP.  Yet it still had widespread temperature effects and massive local consequences.  Such eruptions are still possible.  However an actual LIP is highly unlikely to occur anytime soon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In short, there was no bottleneck (it’s a misreading of evidence for massive <em>expansion</em> of the human population, not a reduction) and the over-all effects of the Toba eruption appear to have been pretty minimal anywhere outside of the relatively immediate area.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of.</p>
<p>It's a founder effect.  A small group (read low genetic diversity) moved into a new area and bred like mad as they filled it.</p>
<p>You see this same genetic signature in a lot of species.</p>
<p>It looks a lot like a bottleneck, but the key difference is that there is no drop in over-all population before the rebound and increase.</p>
<p>In the case of humans the supposed bottlenecks are isolated both in space and time, reflecting advances into new areas, but the &quot;bottlenecks&quot; only show up in portions of the over-all human population, not all across it, and none show up in Africa, which remains the most genetically diverse place for humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding volcanic winters, the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, the largest recorded eruption in human history, was largely responsible for the global cooling that resulted in 1816 being dubbed &quot;the year without summer&quot;. Temperatures were on average a half a degree cooler, resulting is failed crops and major food shortages, killing hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>It also meant Mary Shelley and friends were stuck indoors all summer, leading to a horror writing competition between them where she wrote &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, kickstarting science fiction horror and Lord Byron wrote &quot;a fragment&quot;, an unfinished prototype vampire story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Krakatoa did trigger cooling as well. But Tambora also coincided with a period of low solar activity and was a significantly larger eruption.</p>
<p>I also just wanted to point out that bit about Mary Shelley and Lord Byron's writing contest.</p></div>		</li>
