			<div class="markdown"><p>The canes go in every direction, intertwine, are covered in razor sharp thorns between 1/4&quot;-5/8&quot; long, I think they only bloom from old canes and canes only live for like 3 years. Every year each cane competes with each other and all the dead canes so the thicket gets taller and taller and so thick you have to cut your way through the thorny beast to get the ones on top and throughout the thicket. </p>
<p>I just cut down a massive portion of a thicket bordering my yard. It was tough work and previously I could only harvest from about three spots in the 500sqft I razed</p></div>		</li>
