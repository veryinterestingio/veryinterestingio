			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what a lathe is or what it does, but wouldn't they just make sure that the frequency of the strobe doesn't match the frequency of spoke displacement, whether that means changing out the lighting or changing the rotation rate of the lathe?</p>
<p>(After looking it up, apparently a lathe can be a variety of things.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah so lathes can spin at a variety of speeds. So the frequency of the strobe can still be an issue.</p></div>		</li>
