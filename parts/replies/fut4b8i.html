<p>They found that people with &quot;gluten intolerance&quot; have minor or no reaction to traditonal old-fashion made bread with fermentation in the process and when not using whiteflour.   </p>

<p>While bread dough rising (which is not the only leavening method) does rely on microorganisms, it's not generally considered a fermentation process. But plenty of commercial breads are yeast-leavened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He got it almost right.  The wild yeasted (sourdough breads that until recent history were the mainstream)  have much longer leavening times which allow for enzymatic processes to further break down the wheat. making it acceptable to more people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to be clear, are we talking about gluten intolerance such a celiac disease or “gluten sensitivity”?</p>
<p>I feel like there has been a lot of push back on people who claim “gluten sensitivity”.</p>
<p>Your claim is the people with celiac disease can eat traditional fermented bread?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>gluten sensitivity.  celiac is a real   problem that can be tested for with visible cellular damage.(not saying sensitivity is not real, just can't be truely tested for) gluten will cause the cells of the intestine to die and miss form. (I believe)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with &quot;gluten sensitivity&quot; is that it's not necessarily related to gluten itself, like celiac disease is. There are people out there who can't eat gluten AMONG OTHER THINGS, so they would say they're gluten intolerant, when in fact the problem is deeper. Intestine hyper-permeability, for instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tbf they arent even sure that the Gluten is the true responsible. Note that the symptoms of &quot;gluten intolerance&quot; have multiple different sources that may or may not be linked to Gluten. That is the reason i purposely type &quot;gluten intolerence&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And frickin' Rice Krispies, which have malt as an ingredient. And places you wouldn't necessarily expect wheat, like Red Vines.  Soup thickeners are a big danger area too.  Some pre-mixed spices (some store bought taco packets). Until I developed an autoimmune disease, I never had issues with any food except soy, which caused stomach pain and loose stools. But stopping gluten and dairy was  a big part of getting rid of the severe fatigue and constant joint pain and starting to feel closer to good health again.</p></div>		</li>
