<p>And in southern cultures people smile with their jaws open. To Americans it looks really weird and creepy.</p>

<p>Can you find an example?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to find examples because it's so weird to us. I believe Carmen Miranda, of star from the '50s who hailed from Brazil, used to do it a lot in movies and things. And there was recently an acai berry juice brand that had a full Cameron Miranda with the creepy smile as their logo.</p>
<p>you'll also see it mimicked on Saturday night live from time to time when they're talking about old movie stars that have gone crazy.</p>
<p>Sorry I can't do better right now... I'll keep looking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't find the Carmen Miranda juice logo, but found lots of other pictures of her.  She seems to open her mouth too wide when she smiles.  </p>
<p>I also came across this:
