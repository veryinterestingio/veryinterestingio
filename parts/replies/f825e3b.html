			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the serotonin system seems to be closely tied with visual (and non-visual) pattern recognition, which LSD enhances ridiculously. I'd say pattern recognition enhancement (again, not necessarily visual) is THE single most profound effect for me. I think it's the source of all &quot;hallucinations&quot; you see on normal doses.</p>
<p>In the same way you can look at a carpet and see sharp, huge patterns you had never even dreamt of before, I noticed that I can come up with strange ideas that combine ideas from vastly different topics in astonishing ways. Just like the patterns you see in the carpet are mostly illusory, the same holds for these ideas. They seem groundbreaking during the trip but pretty stupid afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing about LSD is that it doesn’t necessarily make your thought processes better or worse. They’re just <em>different</em> thought processes. Sometimes different is better, sometimes it isn’t. The important part is to objectively consider them after the trip is over, because you’ll sometimes have some legitimately good ideas while tripping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, definitely good for art, or just anything that requires thinking outside the box. I've heard it can be used to get past writer's block, which makes sense because it sort of tears you out the rut of thinking you're in (sometimes, unless you get stuck in a thought loop or something.) I read somewhere that MRIs of people on LSD or Psilocybin show less activity in the frontal cortex, where thoughts are &quot;directed&quot;, which leads to some of the sporadic thinking, noticing tiny details your brain has filtered out in the past, etc. I can't tell you how many times I've walked down my atreet tripping, same street I walked down hundreds of times, and noticed a cool tree or something I somehow never saw in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I think it's very similar to how children's imaginations work. They see mysteries and stories in everything around them. And if an adult takes acid - suddenly these hidden meanings all appear, and make sense! Until they don't. And then you laugh about it. It's a great drug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the way it likely binds to those serotonin receptors is interesting... It’s believed that the receptor essentially “hugs” the molecule, and envelops it. LSD is actually a very fragile molecule, and breaks down incredibly quickly in (or even outside of) the body. But that receptor hug essentially shields the molecule from the compounds in the body that would break it down. So even though LSD breaks down in like 20 minutes in the bloodstream, a trip can last upwards of 12 hours while those molecules are shielded by the receptor hug.</p>
<p>This hug also likely has a secondary effect; It basically causes a positive feedback loop in the receptor. The receptors are basically like a light switch; They’re on or they’re off, depending on whether or not they’re actively receiving a serotonin signal. And while it’s hugging that molecule, it’s stuck on. Eventually the receptor will get tired, lose its grip on the molecule, and the molecule will be broken down. This is likely what causes the “crash” where people feel extremely exhausted and lethargic after a trip - The receptors are all tired out, and aren’t picking up on the actual serotonin that the body is releasing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I'm not positive, but I've heard MDMA affects the receptors much more intensely than LSD, causing even more lethargy days following. </p>
<p>I've done both multiple times, and lethargy is very prevalent after taking MDMA, not so much for LSD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe MDMA floods the brain with available serotonin.  So afterwards, you need some time to replenish the serotonin tanks.</p></div>		</li>
