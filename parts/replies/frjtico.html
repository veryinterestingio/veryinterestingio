			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is literally it.   &quot;Do A otherwise Do B&quot; aka 1 or 0 can turn into a massively complex system with multiple threads of operations constantly processing bits back and forth from machine language and into machine language.  </p>
<p>You have several different languages and architectures that work together for you to see the usable human interface.</p>
<p>I would recommend taking a look at the OSI model for a greater understanding of the breakdown of the full loop if you are interested in the internet/telecommunications part as well. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI\_model" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI\_model</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is it possible that humanity will one day forget how the ones and zeros are turned into code, and we'll just understand the higher languages but the origins of turning the binary into code will be lost to time, or maybe subsumed by an AI who writes an impossible to understand codebase that all technology is based on from then on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not likely that humanity will forget. But it is already the case that there are far fewer programmers in the world today who are fluent in machine language. It’s like Latin in the sense that many languages are founded upon it, but few people still speak it.</p>
<p>But as each programming language becomes more programmer friendly, it tends to incur more computational overhead which is a limiting factor in developing new programming languages. I would speculate though that there will be a day with sufficiently powerful computers where the programming language was no different than natural language. In fact, one might argue that natural language processing (a branch of AI) does just that. </p>
<p>Imagine an AI that understands your spoken language perfectly. It can process anything you say and compute it appropriately. In that case, you are technically writing a program for it as you speak!</p>
<p>You could program a video game by just talking to your AI and telling it exactly what you want.</p></div>		</li>
