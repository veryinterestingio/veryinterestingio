			<div class="markdown"><p>I was diagnosed with &quot;growing pains&quot; for years and complained of joint pain from age 6-16 every time I went to the doctor. The doctor did an x-ray every year which didn't show anything. I left high school early crying from pain after having run the mile in gym. My mom took me straight to the doctor and literally begged him for an MRI. Turns out my hips are quite badly deformed, which caused weird motion in my knees and ankles when I walk causing them to wear away in places. The hip deformity also causes pretty severe back pain from my SI joint. Worst part of it is that it would have been likely been correctable as a child, but as an adult I just have to deal with deformed joints and try to manage symptoms.</p>
<p>Don't dismiss a child's pain, people don't just complain for the hell of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the exact same thing! One of my hips was deformed, giving me a limp and pain in my knee. One of my legs was bigger than the other because I favoured it. It was dismissed a lot as growing pains but my parents took it seriously. Finally a doctor discovered what it actually was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As one of my professors says, growing pains is only ever a diagnosis of exclusion (as in, rule absolutely everything else out before you say it’s just growing pains)... because you don’t want to be the guy who tells someone their pain is normal when it’s actually a disease/disorder/pathology.</p>
<p>And, like you said, people don’t just complain for the hell of it. Pain is not really normal and always has some sort of cause (even if we don’t know what it is in that moment)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another one is joint hypermobility or EDS. I had &quot;growing pains&quot;. I still get the exact same pains and now know it's when I hurt or stressed my joints. Today I had the cheek to walk a mile so I'm lying here with aching hips, knees and feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting enough, 5 or so years after the discovery of my hip deformity I was actually diagnosed with EDS too. My doctor believes it likely contributed to my joint deformity or at least exacerbated it. So I can totally relate to the suffering after doing something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I complained about aches and pains my whole life. Some glorious days I would even say &quot;wow! Nothing hurts today!&quot; And my mom's despite being an occupational therapist, never really had it investigated. I'm still not specifically diagnosable but it's either RA or AS, so it may not have made a ton of difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right?! Scientific consensus is that growing pains are actualy pain from overuse or other underlying conditions. Growing pains as colloquially understood do not exist.</p>
<p>This is why no one should get their info from a reddit comment.</p></div>		</li>
