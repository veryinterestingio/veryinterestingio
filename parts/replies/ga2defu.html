If you refused to take the money even after signing the contract you may be able to prevent them from using the footage. </p>
<p>It would be similar to hiring someone to stand in front of your store with a sign. You cannot pay them for the work they did and then weeks later decide that you regret that because you sales didn't go up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting look at the man behind the curtain... How does he do it? What's his secret?! </p>
<p>Oh... he pays people to say stuff. And to agree that he can then edit the footage in any way he wants to, even if it completely misrepresents what happened.</p>
<p>In other words, he looks for people willing to humiliate themselves for $350.</p>
<p>It is kind of mind-boggling he still manages to hook celebrities, though, since they presumably don't need the $350. Is it ignorance of popular culture? Ego? Does he just pay (&quot;donate&quot;) more for access?</p>
<p>But also, I don't think most people realize just how <em>incredibly</em> difficult it is for a public figure to successfully sue someone for defamation in the US. (In particular in comparison to the UK, where libel and slander laws are incredibly unfriendly towards authors and publishers - something Trump is a huge fan of: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/opinion/trump-britain-libel-laws.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/opinion/trump-britain-libel-laws.html</a>) And any vigorous  complaints or lawsuits over the (pervasive) deceptive editing and fabrication are far more likely to cause the Streisand Effect than help their reputation. </p>
<p>Slate - of all places - has an extensive breakdown of just how fake most of the Giuliani scene most likely is... <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2020/10/borat-giuliani-sacha-baron-cohen-video-analyzed.html" target="_blank">https://slate.com/culture/2020/10/borat-giuliani-sacha-baron-cohen-video-analyzed.html</a></p></div>		</li>
