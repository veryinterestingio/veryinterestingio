			<div class="markdown"><p>IDK man, based on the several dermatologists and my anatomy and physiology classes, I have been told by numerous authorities that skin oil (sebum) production actually <em>does not</em> change based on how dry the skin is, that it can only change via hormonal changes-- both through day to day life and of course also major hormonal changes like puberty and pregnancy. I was specifically told multiple times in recent years that the whole &quot;skin overproduces oil to compensate for what's missing&quot; bit was actually a myth. Which makes sense, cause like, how do the living oil secreting cells know how much oil is on the dead skin in the outer layer? How does it tell the difference between skin oil and lotion?</p>
<p>I think it probably doesn't, and that all of the people who told me that oil production isn't related to skin dryness are correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that’s actually a misunderstanding of what the actual truth is: that getting regular trims will help your hair grow longer. If you get split ends and don’t trim it then the split ends can travel farther up the strands causing your hair growth to stagnant because it’s breaking off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IDK, don't trust me. Trust one of the legion of people who want to angrily yell at me about how much healthier their hair feels without washing.</p>
<p>I'm just a guy sitting there listening to my doctors with a basic understanding of science. And also hygiene, because not washing your body for days on end is unsanitary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to use a water based moisturizer to hydrate my face after cleansing with a scrub and benzoyl peroxide. I would still flare up all the time. I just clean my face without using the moisturizer and it seems to better. Diet and stress level seem to be the biggest contributing factors to whether I break out or not.</p>
<p>If I'm stressed out and also eating greasy and acidic foods, I break out </p>
<p>If I'm relaxed and not eating processed foods, I don't break out and my face stays relatively clean. </p>
<p>I'm 25 and still get whiteheads when Im stressed. Sucks cuz it gives a visual cue to other people that you're stressed.</p></div>		</li>
