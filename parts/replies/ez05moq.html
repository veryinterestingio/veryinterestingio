<p>I'd like to know more about them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are the only headaches I ever get. Don't get them very often but I do its always as if someone stabbed in the forehead with a hot knife and it's always in the same spot. Makes me worry that I've got an aneurysm or something there. But unfortunately I'm an American and deductibles exist so I guess there's only going to be one way for me to find out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question for you if you dont mind answering. I've had 3 kidney stones in my life, two of which happened just last month. First time they put an IV in me and gave me morphine I think. That didnt work, I still had lots of pain. So then they gave me dualidad (I think) and that worked. While I was in pain I would throw up quite a bit which actually helped with the pain. Any idea on why we puke when we're in pain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get cluster headaches. Several neurologists misdiagnosed me as getting migraines (migraine meds did nothing for me) until a neurologist who specializes in headaches diagnosed me with cluster headaches.</p>
<p>Cluster headaches come in &quot;clusters&quot; or cycles. I get mine during seasonal changes, usually spring into summer, and they hit me around 2 am. The pain can last as little as 5 minutes or as long as 3 hrs. That's actually one way cluster headaches differentiate from migraines. Migraines are 3+ hrs, while cluster headaches are generally under 3 hrs.</p>
<p>My doctor has me on a pretty effective protocol. When I go into cycle, I take verapamil, which somehow lessons severity and duration of the cycle, and I take a nasal imitrex at the onset of a headache. </p>
<p>Because cluster headaches can come and go so fast, conventional abortive migraine meds don't get in our system fast enough to stop the headache. The nasal imitrex gets in the body pretty quick.</p>
<p>Cluster headaches suck. Took me years to get the correct diagnosis. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get clusters in the fall. Not every year, but often enough.  My clusters seem symbiotic with neck pain. The tension from the clusters (pressing on my eye and temple to try and lesson pain) cause neck pain. The neck pain causes more clusters. My go to move to abort an oncoming cluster is to sit, close my eyes, lean my head forward and just try to relax, almost meditate, through it. If I can actually fall asleep, even better. That will usually get rid of it in 5 to 15 minutes.
If it geta to hurting too bad that i cant relax, i am in for a 30 minute to 1 hour world of pain. Hot showers help a little, but not much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly relief to hear they last less than three hours. Starting about a year ago I get a nasty migraine behind my left eye every once in a while but it lasts for up to 24 hours. Luckily a strong cp of coffee will usually do the trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have clusters. The pain for me is directly behind my eye, makes my eye hurt so bad that it puffs up and waters a little. I literally get the sensation that removing my eyeball may help a bit, lol. Also, the area surrounding my eye gets very sensitive to touch. The only way I can generally cope is to very firmly massage that whole surrounding area, which hurts like hell, but distracts from the portal to hell behind my eyeball. What seemed to be key to my diagnosis was the regularity. When I get in a cycle, it's almost like clockwork. The same time every day. Whatever it is, I wish you luck in dealing with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sometimes get a sharp pain behind my eye. It used to happen a lot about 12 years ago and I don't get these headaches so frequently now. I may get a cluster headache about once in a few months. The only thing that works is lightly pressing a cloth against my eye and going to sleep for hours. I take some paracetamol for pain relief. If I eat anything during a headache, I end up vomiting. This headache lasts for hours and it feels better after I throw up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i feel like this would be a somewhat appropriate place to ask</p>
<p>i have migraines on the daily, last most of the day and makes it hard to focus because there is this pounding behind my eye. pc doc gave me a laundry list of things to try to do to eliminate other things (new glasses, magnesium gluconate, mri, etc) and finally told me to go to a neurologist. still happens, but im only allowed to have a max of 3 naproxen pills a week ( i believe due to long term effects?).</p>
<p>however i try to exercise, like walking for long periods of time can cause very severe migraines that will not go away. not with water, food, showers, sleep, medication, gatorade/electrolytes, or anything. it just kinda has to run its course for about a day or so until it decides to stop. i try to sleep through it because i cant feel it when i'm asleep, but it's still there when i wake up.</p>
<p>i'm having trouble with the exercise part quite a lot because i do need to lose weight, but the migraines discourage me from doing so. i can't afford more visits to the doc or neuro either, so i am trying to get advice (reddit is probably the last place to ask for vague medical solutions) where i can and trying out what would work best.</p>
<p>tldr: very bad migraines with exercise, won't go away no matter what i do, is there anything i could try?</p>
<p>edit: probably should have mentioned i'm a 16 year old female and have no control over the bad financial situation my family is in.</p>
<ol>
<li>no, menstruation isn't a trigger</li>
<li>yes i'm getting enough sleep</li>
<li>trying to eat healthier, very difficult but trying</li>
<li>yes i take naproxen magnesium gluconate</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor but a migraine sufferer who went from 5/week to maybe 2/month on average. Ask your doctor/neuro about Amitriptyline or Noratriptyline, those made a HUGE difference for me and are at least worth trying if your doc thinks it's safe for you. And in terms of non-medical advice that helps with migraines, focus on your posture, stretch every morning and night, look at screens less, eat cleaner, eat less (especially since you wanna lose fat, exercise is not gonna help, most people just eat more to compensate for calories burned, you need to count calories and consume less than your TDEE), and finally when all of these are mostly routine, you can start including exercise. Take all these things one at a time and watch them improve nearly every aspect of your life, including migraines. I'm not perfect with any of them but focusing on constantly improving all of them is important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor, but someone that went from 12 to 15 a month to one every few months.  Avoiding known triggers is always the first defense.  Then cutting most all processed foods, especially sugar and gluten, lots of greens and fiber, and moving around a lot. I take all the supplements my Neuro recommend, CoQ10, Magnesium, Vitamin D.  I also take fish oil, which is anti-inflammatory.  This was all through self experimentation and small iterative changes, I'd recommend a similar approach.  It it totally beatable, but it takes some work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you said you can’t afford to see a doctor or neurologist again but look into beta blockers for preventing migraines. They’re originally made for lowering blood pressure so you can’t have too low of blood pressure, but if you take them daily they do a great job of preventing migraines altogether. And the pills themselves are cheap ( but I realize getting that prescription may not be). I was getting migraines 3-4x a week and since starting the beta blockers I’ve had about 1 a month</p></div>		</li>
