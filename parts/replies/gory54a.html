			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly the same with me. My dad loves to cremate the steak beyond all flavour and use no seasoning. That's what I thought steak was and was confused when I saw people on tv go on about how great it was. Now I cook my own rare or sometimes blue and I love it, especially with some seasoning.</p></div>		</li>
