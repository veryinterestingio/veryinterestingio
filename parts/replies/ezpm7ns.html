			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the top post is better. There's no reason why we can't emulate the system at a faster clock speed. They just <em>choose</em> not to because it would actually mess things up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And for what it’s worth, emulating hardware is very resource intensive. That’s why a modern cellphone may have more power than a Nintendo Wii U but you aren’t running Splatoon or Smash Bros. any time soon.</p></div>		</li>
