			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, in general, all living organisms use enzymes as a catalyst for life sustaining chemical reactions. Enzymes are particularly delicate structures, and have a very specific area called the &quot;active site&quot; that binds with a single type of molecule and does stuff to it. Increase in heat alters the shape of the active site such that it can no longer bind to the molecule which it should be binding to. This heat alteration mechanic is nearly impossible to evolve out of as it fundamentally breaks down the bonds between atoms in the enzyme.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay, so just double up on my sweatpants, down a couple shots of bourbon, and ride it out. Got it. </p>
<p>Truth be told, when I was in college and got sick (sore throat, cough), I would just throw back some Jaeger (because i jokingly reasoned that it tastes like cough syrup anyway) and push through.  It generally worked, but most likely due to a strong immune system. The Jaeger did seem to help the symptoms though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An element of response towards this could be that, usually, when an organism gains an ability (e.g. heat resistance) it loses something somwhere else, in a process called trade-off. It could mean for example that the virus' ability to last in the environment is reduced, or whatever else really. This happens quite a lot with drug-resistant bacteria. It's been shown for example that drug-resistant bacteria residing in the guts will be overtaken by the not-resistant strain when conditions are back to normal (= when the human stops taking its antibiotics) and sometimes disapear completely, simply because a little bit of their energy is still being directed towards synthetising that specific protein that gives them antibiotic resistance, which is a net loss of energy compared to the non-resistant strain. </p>
<p>Besides the trade-off, as someone else explained, heat is very hard to defend against, simply because heat targets protein folding, which is a fundamental part of any micro-organism meaning that even if the virus &quot;finds a way&quot; around it, it still needs to infect a cell to survive, a cell that will have trouble giving the virus what it needs since its proteins don't work as well when heated. This parameter is outside of the virus' control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At what temp will an otherwise healthy adult start to feel delirious? Or does this vary by individual?</p>
<p>Last time I remember getting sick, I started off just not feeling great, but at one point the fever spiked and within a couple hours started to feel weak, delirious, confused, couldn't focus on anything, and legitimately felt like I'd die if I didn't do something about it. Finally took some Advil and 30 minutes later I was right as rain. Don't have a thermometer so couldn't check my temp. Was going to just let it run its course until I had that feeling of dread pass over me. Was always curious how high it got, or could have been, that day...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Virus can't spread above a certain temperature range.</p>
<p>If you dont take the medications, your body temp will be above that range and the virus cant spread.  </p>
<p>If you do take these meds, you will interfere with your immune systems attempts to stop the virus from spreading.  This caused you to be sick and contagious longer.  </p></div>		</li>
