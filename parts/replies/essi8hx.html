			<div class="markdown"><p>At some point, you get diminishing returns...so it stops mattering in a realistic way if you get more protection.  </p>
<p>Think of SPF as dividing the &quot;power&quot; of the sun instead of multiplying the amount of time you can be in the sun.  </p>
<p>Sun without sunblock = 100%</p>
<p>Sun blocked by SPF 15 = 100 /15 = 6.6%</p>
<p>Sun blocked by SPF 30 = 100/30 = 3.3%</p>
<p>Sun blocked by SPF 100 = 100/100 = 1%</p>
<p>In reality, everything SPF 30+ about as effective.  The measurable clinical difference between 3% and 1% exposure is so small compared to the 100% exposure of the sun without sunblock at all that it likely does not matter for most people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're not expecting much sun exposure but still get it daily, 15 SPF is good for everyday wear.</p>
<p>Lower SPF is cheaper to buy and often applies easier on the skin. This is especially true for physical sunscreen that uses zinc. Most high SPF versions can feel like smearing paste.</p>
<p>For high SPF chemical sunscreens, I know I get some skin reactions to SPF 55 but not to 45. Higher SPF means more concentrated chemicals so your mileage may vary with how your body reacts to stronger sunscreen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To reiterate, the SPF rating only applies if you follow all the directions especially about reapplying</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, note that you're supposed to put sunscreen on \~15 minutes before going outside (it will say on the package how long they recommend)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>V important: 60 is not twice as good as 30. They even say not to use higher spf not to give oneself false sense of safety.</p>
<p>For most uses 30 is enough.</p></div>		</li>
