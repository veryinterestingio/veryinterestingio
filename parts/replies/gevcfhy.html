			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer, thanks!</p>
<p>I am thinking about neutron stars, yes; in particular I'm thinking about strange stars, and I want to make sure I understand the simpler and actually agreed-upon case first.  In the case I'm talking about, it seems like it <em>may</em> be that the quarks <em>are</em> disassociated at the core, but that this is not confirmed, and not a necessary condition for this transition to take place?</p>
<p>I've thought of virtual particles as more like interference patterns in the quantum fields, where there's an initial stable-ish state in the quantum fields (up = 1, electron = 1, everything else = 0), a final stable-ish state (down = 1, neutrino = 1, everything else = 0), and in the time between those states there's a mess of perturbations in all fields, which <em>could</em> be quantized/collapsed into excitations for each of these virtual particle pairs but with convergingly small probabilities for each expansion?  Is that a reasonable if fuzzy way to think about it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I won't comment on strange stars, because I don't know much about that. But it's certainly not <em>necessary</em> for the protons to dissociate into quarks. Electron capture decays happen here on Earth under non-exotic circumstances, and there's no need for them to break apart. One of the quarks just goes through the process I described above while the others just stay around as spectators.</p>

<p>Virtual particles are just all the extra operators which show up in the series expansion. If you interpret each term in the series as a progression through time, you'll see that there are operators corresponding to the creation and subsequent destruction of various particles. And they're constrained to carry whatever energy, momentum, charge, etc. is necessary to obey conservation laws. But if you try to interpret these particles as things which physically exist, you find that they can have the wrong masses, or unphysical polarization states. Or if you look at it the opposite way and assume the virtual particle has its physical mass, then it can't conserve energy and momentum between the initial and final states. They're said to be &quot;off the mass shell&quot;. The &quot;shell&quot; is the hyperbola in momentum-space defined by m^(2) = E^(2) - <strong>p</strong>^(2). If a particle exists on its mass shell, then the quantity E^(2) - <strong>p</strong>^(2) gives its physical mass (squared). But if the particle is off-shell, it has whatever E and <strong>p</strong> are required to satisfy conservation laws, but E^(2) - <strong>p</strong>^(2) doesn't give its correct mass. It's not obeying its usual free-particle equation of motion. </p>
<p>Real particles are on-shell, virtual particles are off-shell.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a really concise way to put it; the distinction seemed kind of arbitrary to me initially but that makes a lot of sense and gives me a cool mental model to boot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation of virtual particles makes me think of the expansion of a square wave into its constituent sine waves of differing frequency/amplitude. Wonder if thereâ€™s some underlying principal at work there...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean Quantum Mechanics does not explain how exactly the transition happens, but instead merely describes accurately the final state based on the initial state?</p>
<p>In university I had a class called Modern Physics and I have to say I was a bit disappointed when my professor gave us the Copenhagen Interpretation after some intro to Quantum. Schroedinger's equation time dependant and independent on some very basic form was also introduced, and while I actually wanted to learn a bit more about the nature of the psi wave and the collapse of the wave under measurement, the professor limited himself to discussing these &quot;philosophical endeavours&quot; for a couple minutes by the end of one class. &quot;Was the electron always at this energy level, or did it collapse to it when we measured? I am not saying my opinion, but you can say yours&quot;.</p>
<p>Long story short. I was disappointed at my Modern Physics class because they only seemed to care about predicting the final result based on the initial result, whereas I thought I would actually understand the weirdness of the quantum world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first three (or four, or five) quantum mechanics courses usually just focus on how to calculate things, and not on different interpretations. A lot of physicists view those things as unimportant; you just need to be able to calculate a result, and that doesn't depend on interpretations.</p>
<p>But some really think deeply about these things. This area is called &quot;quantum foundations&quot;. I'm sure you can find papers and texts about it if you look around for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot for your recommendation. I will check it out. Is there significant research (or any at all) in this discipline? I have heard bad things about HEP job market, specially theory.</p>
<p>The job market and my little aforementioned disappointment have led me to consider switching to engineering and self learn physics on the side to fulfill my curiosity. I hope I will learn enough to understand papers on these quantum foundations, because damn, that is the most fascinating aspect of contemporary science IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If, as you describe, electron capture e + u -&gt; d + v, then does d -&gt; u + e +!v also occur without the W boson? If so, why do we need the weak force at all to describe things? What's the point of the W boson if it doesn't have to be included to make sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that transition - which is responsible for beta decay - is impossible without the weak force, since neutrinos don't couple to the electromagnetic or strong forces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that makes sense. One more question, if you don't mind. Where does the mass of the W boson come from and go to? If a down quark has 1/20000 the mass of a W boson, where does the energy com from to create it? And if the W boson has 100,000 times the mass of an electron, why is always exactly one electron created, not 100,000?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is also a weak transition, yes. The weak force is needed to change flavors of quarks and to do anything involving neutrinos (neglecting gravity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. Is the weak force interaction best described through coupling of fields? It never made sense to me that fundamental particles could change or be destroyed / created (aside from anti-matter interactions). Also, can you take a look at my question to the previous reply about masses?</p></div>		</li>
