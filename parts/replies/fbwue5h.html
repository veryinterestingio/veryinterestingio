			<div class="markdown"><p>The Schwarzchild radius is the size any object would have to be compressed to, in order to form a black hole. Everything has a Schwarzchild radius. The sun's is 3km, the Earth's is 9mm. If you were to take the sun and compress all of its mass to a ball with a radius of 3km, it would become a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I also just want to point out some funny phrasing in the wiki article:</p>

<p>It doesn't correspond to any sort of physical object as far as we know, no.  But it does correspond to something that is physically meaningful, in the sense that it is a point of no-return beyond which you can no longer interact with the rest of the universe in the future even in principle.</p>

<p>Yep, indeed it is!</p>

<p>Well, we aren't truly sure what happens there.  The real answer will depend on a proper theory of quantum gravity, which we don't have.  There may be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(physics\)" target="_blank">firewall</a> there if certain quantum-field-theoretic arguments are correct (even Steven Hawking seems to have wavered back and forth on this idea), or there may be some sort of either hard or soft boundary such as the exterior of a string-theoretic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzball_(string_theory\)" target="_blank">fuzzball</a> or a something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_star" target="_blank">Planck star</a>.  Being totally honest, we have neither observational data enough nor soundness of theoretical predictions enough to confidently hypothesize about what happens at the event horizon of a black hole.  Even in canonical general relativity, at the inner horizon (Cauchy horizon) of a black hole -- which corresponds to the same location as the outer event horizon in the case of a Schwarzschild black hole -- <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-disprove-conjecture-made-to-save-black-holes-20180517/" target="_blank">spacetime loses a smoothness condition that's necessary for solutions to the Einstein field equations to even be valid</a>, so even pure general relativity outright fails at this point (and any predictions of things like singularities, closed timelike curves, wormholes, etc. must be absolutely distrusted).  So we really just cannot say much about what happens right now. :(</p></div>		</li>

<p>a microscopic black hole could exist with a mass on the order of the Planck mass and a Schwarzschild radius on the order of the Planck length.</p>

<p>Objects like that lead you into an entirely more complex rabbit hole of quantum gravity.</p>
