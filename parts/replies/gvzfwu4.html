			<div class="markdown"><p>So I write porn for a living, and I once got a commission from someone who asked me for a fairly standard story, but one thing that he specifically requested was that the woman in question was wearing a big, eighties-style hair scrunchie. Not the weirdest request I've ever had, so sure. Your money, your choice. Whatever works for you.</p>
<p>I wrote this story, I got my money, all was good -- but I couldn't for the life of me figure out where a fetish like that comes from. That was until I saw a Reddit post about someone who confessed that one of his biggest turn-ons was seing his girlfriend pull her hair into a ponytail, because she only time she wore it like that was before she went down on him. That was great, until she started going to the gym with him (or running, I can't remember which) and wearing it that way while she worked out, and all of a sudden he was just hard all the damn time. My theory is that this guy had a similar experience, but instead of the ponytail he just latched onto his girlfriend's scrunchie instead.</p>
<p>Conditioning is <em>weird</em>, man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Growing up, I lived in a household that made me feel like a burden. Because of this I learned to make as little noise as possible and this extended to my bathroom habits. One, my hand never left the seat as I raised it to avoid bumping the tank or dropping back down. And two, the reason this applies to this thread, is because I always aimed for the side of the bowl to avoid any splashing noises.  Thus, I never associated running water sounds with kidney evacuation. Everything that happens to a child, sometimes even the smallest events, will affect them like ripples in pond for the rest of their lives.</p></div>		</li>
