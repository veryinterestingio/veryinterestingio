<p>When I was seeing a therapist a little while back, that was exactly what he told me I was doing. None of your other characterizations seem to fit (though who knows if I bored him, I suppose I wouldn’t know that) </p>
<p>But that was a regularly occurring theme in our conversations; my tireless, unwavering, though obviously futile, pursuit of perfection. I got diagnosed w ADHD about 6 months ago, which was why I sought out therapy, I honestly was just looking for hacks for my brain; that’s how I would characterize my actions anyways. I’m pretty sure both of my parents are/were narcissists so I wonder if I inherited some of it by proxy. Anyway, that was an interesting read. Got the wheels turning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Symptom is not a syndrome. All people have narcissistic traits, narcissistic drive is about achieving and showing off, it's normal. Narcissistic traits are on a spectrum, the more one has and overwhelming they, the closer the person to a personality disorder. If one has it, they would be called &quot;a narcissist&quot;.
Coming to therapy with a desire of self improvement is a common thing, this is one the reason why some therapists call our society narcissistic - it values improvement and change for achievement over other things and has increased number of people showing off</p></div>		</li>
