			<div class="markdown"><p>Alumni with IT degree here.  Can confirm this is pretty accurate.  RITs &quot;how do I make the computers do the business stuff good&quot; Classes (at the time UI design + needs assessment) are the things I get the most use of on a daily basis.  I've been variously a coder, technical writer, project manager, product manager, and people manager with an it degree.  I have friends with the nominally same degree who are hardcore star wars shirt network dweebs.</p>
<p>Any of the degrees have a natural affinity, but what you focus your high level classes in and where your talent lies does a lot more to guide your career.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Software engineers love to think that they are computer scientists, but I will humbly suggest that they are not. Instead, I propose that Software engineers are to computer scientists as mechanical engineers are to physicists. CS is the theoretical science that study mathematical computation; SE is the applied science that takes the output from CS and turns it into every day useful things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely think the mechE/physics comparison makes sense for the actual fields and their relationship to each other - but I think the needed education is much more similar for CS/SE.  There's a reason why a CS degree is still the norm for software engineers.</p>
<p>An extensive physics knowledge doesn't often have much to offer a mechanical engineer though; they just need to know the laws of physics that pertain to their work.  Knowing astrophysics isn't going to do them much good.  Meanwhile, a physicist isn't going to care much about how to create a certain system under a given set of restrictions.  That has no place in furthering our overall understanding of physics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the most important skill that comes from a pure CS education is problem-solving skills.  Knowing ways to think about and approach problems, and how to analyze an attempted solution.  This is absolutely useful to a software engineer, but a pure SE education doesn't focus much on it, instead being more focused on design.  Unlike mechE and physics, the subfields and background information you need for them is mostly the same.  Where it differs is where you go from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d also add another relevant one here that benefits from the comparison: <strong>Electrical engineering/computer engineering</strong> focuses on the hardware side of how computers work—transistors, gates, circuits, binary arithmetic, SSDs vs HDDs, etc, sometimes with a few programming classes sprinkled in for breadth. There are a lot of EE folks rubbing shoulders with software engineers and they offer a very valuable perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I've always viewed it is that if a computer were a car, a computer scientist could tell you all about driving theory. They could tell you what inputs give the desired outputs. They could construct methods to execute a perfect drift or u-turn. Meanwhile, the computer engineer knows how the engine actually works. They might help design a better one. The electrical engineer is the guy that intimately knows how fuel turns into expanding gas and then into motion.</p></div>		</li>
