			<div class="markdown"><p>Reverse osmosis is fantastic for creating clean drinking water.  BUT it is NOT distilled water and should not be used for applications that require distilled water.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The only way to get distilled water is to distill it (properly).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but this is a humidifier we're talking about. I would use distilled water if I want proper lab results. But I don't care if my $20 amazon humidifier gets scale build up after a few years because I used water that has marginally less mineral content than distilled water. All I care is it doesn't leave white dust everywhere.</p>
<p>It's like if someone has buying 95% everclear to disinfect their table, and I suggested using isopropyl alcohol. It's true you can't just sub isopropyl alcohol for ethyl anywhere, but isopropyl alcohol will get the job done for cheaper.</p>
<p>Edit: Your source even says &quot; the difference between reverse osmosis and distilled water is slim when it comes to mineral removal &quot; and &quot; Distilled water is certainly purer than basic tap water but reverse osmosis gets the upper hand &quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ive heard drinking distilled water isnt good for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>only in fairly large quantities. all of your cells that come in contact with it freak out as the various minerals are ripped out of them and pulled into the water. which is why it tastes awful. </p>
<p>on the scale someone curious might taste it, that's harmless, but if you replaced a substantial part of your water intake with it, you'd get some weird effects.</p></div>		</li>
