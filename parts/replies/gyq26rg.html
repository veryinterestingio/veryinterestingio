			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you happen to know what animals have mosquitos as a significant portion of their diet?</p>
<p>Like, are mosquitos 80% of what a bat eats, or are they a small enough percentage that we could at least guess they would be fine eating other bugs instead?</p>
<p>Is there particular species that we are especially wary of if mosquitos were eradicated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ecology is not that simple and trying to reduce it to a number like that is extremely dangerous. Even if it's a relatively small percentage, if they react by replacing that portion of their diet with another species, that targetted species may not be able to keep up reproductively with the spike in death. This could cause food insecurity for another animal that relies on that food source, and ripple outwards in various directions. Nothing exists in a vacuum, so you cannot analyze them in a vacuum to measure their impact.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not trying to do that, I just want to learn more about what animals most directly rely on mosquitos</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Need&quot; is subjective and not really a germane issue when it comes to natural selection. Every organism that exists does something or it would not exist.  I'm not saying all life would end if you could somehow delete all mosquitos but it would result in major changes to the ecosystem.</p></div>		</li>
