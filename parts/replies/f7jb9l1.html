<p>35.74</p>

<p>Sounds like an arbitrary number, but i am sure it is not. how is 35.74 determined?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of convective heat transfer constants are empirically derived and as such are really ugly weird numbers.  Wind chill is an effort to correlate the difference between heat transfer off a person in still air compared to the heat transfer of moving air and as such is subject to those same types of odd correlations and coefficients.</p>
<p>I don't know precisely how the wind chill formula was derived as I don't work in that field, but that type of very precise coefficient is pretty common for other derivations of convective heat transfer rates for specific objects and shapes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole thing is basically a best fit curve.   </p>
<p>They used a series of heat transfer calculations as the base, and then really just got a bunch of people cold and blew wind on them and measured how their skin reacted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Australia has a far more complex one, involving humidity as well as wind velocity and ambient temperature.</p>

<p>As someone who lives in a city with an annual average humidity of +60% I can't emphasise enough how important it is the &quot;feels like&quot; I have traveled enough to be in places at 50 degree celcius that doesn't feel anywhere near as hot and as unbearable as my usual summer 42</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but if you are cold enough where windchill really starts to matter, the air is mostly dry.  100% relative humidity at 0F (-18C) is near bone dry air.  Relative humidity matters much more in the heat than in the cold.  As you mentioned, when you are hot in Australia, the &quot;feels like&quot; temp would be bogus if it didn't account for humidity, however, in a cold place you don't really need to consider humidity for a &quot;wind chill&quot; calculation.</p></div>		</li>
