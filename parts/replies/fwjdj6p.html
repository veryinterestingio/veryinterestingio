<p>So could you compare the oceans to a weird dynamic equilibrium of a constantly churning salt metathesis reaction? Like there's an influx of Na+ and Cl- from some sources, and then an influx of other counterions from the vents, which crashes the Na+ and Cl- out as insoluble salts and churns them through the earth, eventually spewing them out somewhere far away, where they repeat the process of falling into the ocean and crashing out again?</p></div>		</li>
