			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always the case about bring able to communicate though is it. What about someone with locked in syndrome? Or someone in a vegetative state? I'm in favour of assisted dying if done in the right way but it gets much herder for people with conditions that limit their communication ability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am always amused when these discussions are brought up. Whenever euthanasia is mentioned, people seem to lose all sense of history or current predicament.</p>
<p>Whatever happens today with people who are locked in or in a vegetative state? in what world does euthanasia law change the outcome for people in this situation?</p>
<p>e.g. when you are on life support and are unresponsive, and you would die if the machines are turned off, the choice will move to include family and the hospital team. If there is no family and family cannot be found, the decision moves to doctors.</p>
<p>This is no different in countries where euthanasia is legal.</p>
<p>Even if you have a condition where you already know you will end up in this vegetative state, you cannot sign a paper that says &quot;if i become vegetative, please kill me&quot;. It doesn't work that way at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you confusing locked in syndrome with being brain dead? If you are brain dead you are technically dead and there won’t be any argument regarding stopping life support.</p>
<p>However people with locked in syndrome can be cognitively intact but unable to to communicate with the outside world due to neurological deficits. Many are able to breathe independently and don’t require life support. Depending on the aetiology of the locked in syndrome, prognosis might be extremely poor and the chances of neurological recovery are extremely slim. </p>
<p>I suspect many of them are stuck in nursing homes, being fed through a feeding tube, having difficulty communicating with friends and family. </p>
<p>Many are able to communicate their wishes through eye movements. So if 2 doctors are able to verify that they are sound of mind and wish to end their life, I think euthanasia would be justified in their case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, just wanna point out that it does actually work that way in the Netherlands. I once knew a man with ms who committed euthanasia, he had lost the ability to speak already but he had a signed and notarized document where he very clearly noted the limits of his dignity. If he lost the ability to care for himself and to communicate entirely (he communicated with a computer) then he didn't want to live anymore. Although luckily for him he could still communicate even if he couldn't this document would have protected his rights here. </p>
<p>The most problematic thing about our euthanasia laws in my opinion is dementia. A person might state that if they don't remember their loved ones, they wish to die. But when they don't remember anymore they won't remember wanting to die, in fact they may still find joy despite not remembering. This is an ongoing debate here in the Netherlands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can fill in an &quot;Euthenasieverklaring&quot; (I think it translates to something like declaration of euthanasia) here in the netherlands. It's a list of questions you fill in when you are still healthy that for instance says you wouldn't want to continue living in a vegetative state. So there's still ways to be euthanised even if you can no longer directly communicate it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pets also don't have the mind to understand that painful times and treatments might lead to a better life later on. They live in the moment and don't understand that it might be for their good (though often it is for their owners who just can't let go even if it would be better for the poor animal).</p>
<p>They don't fear what happens either. Seeing the vet isn't great, getting pricked neither, but they don't know what is happening. And cuddled up to their humans, it's just going to sleep and never waking up again. </p>
<p>I'm of the &quot;rather two weeks too early than two days too late&quot; camp since a pet died under nightmarish conditions. He was young, there was hope he'd heal, but instead he slowly suffocated as we rushed him to the vet. How I wish I could have spared him that struggle and helpless panic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for sharing this. We had one who we clearly kept around for a little too long, and one who we still struggle with because maybe he had a few more good days in him. This really helps me process things and remember why we made the decision on the latter one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It hurts to lose them, today or next week, it's painful either way. It's a last gift to face the pain a bit earlier so they don't have to suffer.</p>
<p>My parents let their large dog walk around on an osteosarcoma in his wrist for weeks. It's a cancer that turns bone into something looking more like a sponge. Luckily it held until they finally gave in and let him go. But there was always the risk of his leg shattering any moment, and then go try to lift a screaming, thrashing 70kg dog into the car to get to the vet. &quot;But it hurts too much to lose him&quot; as much as we might want to, they don't live forever, we always lose them (unless you have a healthy parrot or tortoise). It's part of having a pet. I still wouldn't want to be without one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pets do know whats happening to them, they just cant do anything about it, so its up to us as their humans to make that tough decision for them when they tell us that they are ready to go. I only hope that by the time I am ready to go that there will be the laws in place for me to decide that the suffering has been enough. Pets are the lucky ones in that regard.</p></div>		</li>
