			<div class="markdown"><p>An RV has more roof area and travels less. If you park the RV for a week you would be able to charge it by some decent amount. And if we are already talking about camping there's no reason to limit ourselves to the roof of the vehicle. Flexible solar panels exist and would work well on an RV awning, easily doubling or trippling the available area.</p>
<p>You could probably make it work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An RV with solar panels wouldn't do much to get you down the road, because of the weight of the vehicle. </p>
<p>But it could be useful for running your household electrics like a light, a television or a minifridge.</p>
<p>The problem is that you would still need a generator or connection to the grid at night. I would guess RV manufacturers are hesitant to implement rooftop solar this because adding solar panels increases cost and complexity in the wiring, without providing owners much benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bad news is, under optimal conditions, you get about 1000 W of solar energy per square meter.  That's less than 2 horsepower.  It <em>might</em> someday be a tertiary power source for a car, but it will never be the primary one.</p>
<p>Current solar panels will get you about 20% of that, but even with 100% efficiency, their utility for vehicles is limited.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To clarify this point, you're speaking about a car-sized footprint. Solar powering of a car is completely possible now, but it takes a much larger collection area.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Efficiency barely moves the needle, compared to that, for something like putting solar panels on a car.  As others have pointed out, even with 100% efficiency, you're barely putting a dent in the range of an EV.</p>
<p>Now, if you could cheaply integrate solar into the curved surfaces of the car like a layer of paint?  Then it becomes a &quot;why not&quot;.  Current panel technology means installing a panel comes at the expense of something structural, so it's hard to justify.</p></div>		</li>
