			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question: I’ve had a 2013 MacBook Air for a while; it’s been reliable except for an issue where, when unplugged and I close the MacBook, it shuts down. When I open it up, I have to reboot it and when I do this, ~40% of the time the clock is reset to jan 1 2000 at 7pm.</p>
<p>Do you think this related to the battery powering the counter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is a pretty clear indication that CMOS battery (the name for that battery) is probably dead. Technically it isn't that the dead battery is stopping the clock from running causing the time to reset, it's the loss of power to the BIOS memory storage causing it to be erased when power is removed that resets the time and date, but effectively its the same.</p></div>		</li>
