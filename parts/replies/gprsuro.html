			<div class="markdown"><p>There is just 1 fMRI study, of 1 person in 1 lucid dream, so we are just beginning to explore what's happening in the brain. EEG gives important information too, but not yet with the precision to explain clearly how lucid dreaming differs from nonlucid dreaming. One possibility that has been examined is that there is greater frontal lobe function during a lucid dream, which is in keeping with the literature on cognitive deficits after damage to the frontal lobes. We think future studies will be able to make progress with this, given that we have better ways to induce lucid dreaming now.<br />
About waste-clearance during sleep, that is a fascinating hypothesis, so far based mostly on animal research. Given that in humans its unclear exactly how to measure this phenomenon (the so-called glymphatic system) , we can't say much about what effect lucid dreaming might have on it. [Ken]</p></div>		</li>
