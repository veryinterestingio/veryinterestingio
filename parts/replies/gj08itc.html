			<div class="markdown"><p>Exact same as you. What surprised me the most was the the grass is made up of a ton of different shades of green, instead of just 1-3 shades of green. Same with bushes and trees.  </p>
<p>Also red seemed to pop out a lot more for me. I struggle sometimes to tell whether green apples are perfect or on their way out, same with strawberries. The glasses clearly indicate the difference.  </p>
<p>The last surprising one was skin color - My wife is very pale and blushes red, but that red was not as noticable as I anticipated. Also, everyone seemed a few shades darker than I was used to, I guess because the red in everybody's skin was not being received correctly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Green is the color for which human eye is most sensitive. We see most of green shades. If you live in savannah or jungle there is lot of greens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colorblind here as well, same exact experience with the glasses! What shocked me was how insanely bright restaurant and store signs are when driving down the street. Itâ€™s almost distracting how bright they are with my glasses, although the colors chosen for these signs makes a lot more sense now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first time putting them on, I saw a stoplight and said &quot;How do people run red lights? These are so easy to see!&quot; And the stopsign was so bright! I can't tell you how many times I slam on my brakes from seeing a stopsign at the last minute, if in a highly bushy area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same experience for me, I realized I have red-green &quot;colorblindness&quot; (Deuteranopia) when I was 18 during the mandatory military examination in Germany. Failed the Ishihara test brutally. Up to that point I never even remotely considered something is off with my vision. </p>
<p>I can't say it has ever affected me really. In my early 20s I had a job that involved a lot of work in Photoshop and Indesign, making adverts that got printed full page in very large magazines incl. Newsweek and Playboy. I did the color-proofing of those too, without any problems. </p>
<p>It's not that we cannot see the colors, it's more like they wash into each other when they are close together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term color-blindness is quite misleading. Any color someone names, you and me would point to the same color on a palette. I scored a 0 (the highest possible mark) on the <a href="https://www.xrite.com/hue-test" target="_blank">Farnsworth Hue test</a>, but cannot see <a href="https://www.colour-blindness.com/CBTests/ishihara/Plate19.gif" target="_blank">any number at all in the Ishihara segments for deuteranopia</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. The way OP thinks we perceive colors feels insulting. I'm not a damn alien and color blindless is not that hard to understand. It's just less shades visible to us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I was taking the test, I legitimately didn't comprehend that me not seeing the numbers meant I was colorblind. At first I thought it was somewhat humorous that I could only read like the first two slides that everyone can read.</p>
<p>Wasn't so funny when it became time to choose my job and the list of potential jobs went from being wide open to a small handful (I wound up talking to my recruiter and decided not to join based on the career paths that were available to me due to the colorblindness). It was a major blow considering how hard I trained for that day, but my life has turned out good!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I joined the military a similar thing happened. I wanted to join as a &quot;Tech&quot; aka fixing radios and electronics and stuff. Upon being able to see only the first number on one test, and completely failing the blinky colored lights test, it was determined I was colorblind and my options got much smaller. I ended up going into communications..... Which involved tipping Cat 5 and OC cables.... With tiny striped colored wires... And I did the job just fine. Turns out I dodged a bullet because &quot;Techs&quot; don't fix anything anymore they just keep track of warranty paperwork and send to vendors for repair.</p>
<p>And now I make pcbs and work on micro electronics as a hobby and like before I still have no issues lol it's not like runs on PCBs are color coded and you can't follow paths. Never had an issue identifying resistors either (plus it's not like a multimeter can't just tell you what it is)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do video and really prided myself on being able to color grade and have even worked on a couple of projects as a colorist. When H3 dropped that Logan Paul video, I learned about the test at 22 as well and was in shock! It felt like my life was a lie lol</p>
<p>It also feels like it's getting worse the older I get and the more I accept it</p></div>		</li>
