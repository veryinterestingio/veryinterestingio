			<div class="markdown"><p>I often think about how far we've come from primitive lifestyles yet our bodies haven't evolved to match. And how our society doesn't really account for that. It even encourages bad habits, long periods of sitting down, and unhealthy eating habits for a lot of people. I feel like I had to deprogram myself as I got older and learn how to eat well and exercise and shit instead of it just being part of life from the beginning out of necessity. Not sure what I'm getting at, but all the advancements come with a price.</p></div>		</li>
