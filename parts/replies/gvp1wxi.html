<p>Hasn't ever happened to you that, while horny, you've done or said some things you would regret later when you're not horny?</p>
<p>Maybe you nutted to something you consider disturbing and right afterwards you think to yourself &quot;what did I just do&quot; or you're sexting (or on the phone) with someone, you but and when you go read that conversation again you're filled with... cringe?</p>
<p>For me, I feel like the decisions I make when I'm horny are all related to nutting, but right after I've done it that all vanishes instantly and I'm suddenly able to think towards other goals or to regret what i may have done trying to nut</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever thought of starting a business, working out, or bettering yourself in any way when scrolling through instagram after nutting? I always do. I always tell myself ill quit drugs and alcohol and start living clean. Right up until 9pm the next day</p></div>		</li>
