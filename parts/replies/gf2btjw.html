<p>The speed of light isn't the speed of anything in particular about this phenomenon, it's just the speed of &quot;causality&quot;, eg the speed at which cause and effect happen in the universe. This is why it's a fundamental limit of the universe.</p>

<p>I like to imagine the universe would break if things could happen instantly. But then, why is the closest thing to &quot;instantly&quot; so slow? Eight minutes just for light to get from the Sun to Earth, and we might as well be stuck one to the other when looking at us from the scale of the universe. </p>
<p>Would we even have ever figured out that light had a speed if it were a billion times faster?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. And to be honest, this is true irrespective of two waves exchanging energy like electromagnetic ones do, for instance gravitational waves are self sustaining all by themselves. The true why we don't know, e.g we don't know what the electric/magnetic/gravitational field is made of  </p>

<p>We would probably still know due to the insane scale of the universe, some objects would still be red shifted to a measurable degree.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or would we even be here to see it? Maybe there have been other universes where the speed of light WAS faster, but  that universe didn't last long enough for life to exist. That the laws of that universe caused it to collapse. Or maybe the laws of our universe are just right for life to form. </p>
<p>Also, others may explain it better, but there's a weird line of thought that postulates that the universe is here because we can observe it, and that if we weren't here to observe it, would it even exist? We're approaching philosophy here, though. :)</p></div>		</li>
