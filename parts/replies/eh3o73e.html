<p>They'll absorb and store the heat and slowly dissipate it away. This video shows the ceramic tiles in action.</p>

<p>It's not about &quot;slowly dissipate it&quot;.  The surface dissipates immediately.  The key mechanism is insulation.  If you had a 4&quot; wall and  an exposed blast furnace on the other side, you wouldn't feel any heat at all for like 20 min.  Eventually you would, but the rate of heat flux is so low that the surface on the cool side only gets warm as the heat is being washed away into the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you're absolutely right. Since this was for a supposed 5 years old, I think it got the point across anyways: it releases heat slowly, so you can grab it with your hand. Of course, an adult with physics knowledge is not going to be happy with a lot of what I said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your answer, it's really helpful! However, why is it that if you google the temperature of the exosphere the number that shows up is up to 1700° and temperatures in the upper thermosphere can range from about 500° C (932° F) to 2,000° C (3,632° F) or higher.</p>
<p>(This was something she kept asking me, and although I'd like to say the fact that it's the top result doesn't make it most accurate, I wasn't sure if it really was true)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The absolute temperature is less important than the specific material's ability to transmit heat.</p>
<p>A silicone glove allows you to reach in to a 400°F oven and remove a pan.  When you reach your gloved hand in the oven, your arm follows (usually) and is not burned unless you touch something that conducts heat better than air.  The 400°F air is inefficient at conducting heat relative to the pan.  (See also, cooking times between metal and glass)</p>
<p>The upper atmosphere is less dense and has a lower specific heat than inside your oven, so spacecraft that are designed specifically for the purpose of dealing with these temperature deltas can transit relatively unscathed.</p>
<p>Thermal conductivity and specific heats:

<p>Helium's conductivity is ~.151W/mK
Hydrogen's is ~.182</p>
<p>Edits: changed oven example and added more measurements</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since other explanations seem way too confusing, the temperature can get to 1700 C, but theres not a lot of particles at that temperature (thin atmosphere) and so the hot particles are barely actually transferring much energy since there’s so few of them to do so</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to everything others have written, keep in mind that bog-standard pottery, like the kind you eat off of or warm up your coffee in the microwave in, is fired in kilns that reach temps exceeding 2500°F (porcelain), without &quot;melting&quot; ... now imagine a process of carefully controlling the makeup of a material to maximize it's thermal qualities and minimize it's weight, and firing it under tightly controlled parameters, and you're closer to understanding how ceramic tiles for spacecraft are constructed, never mind all the other things folks have mentioned.</p>
<p>I bought a little hobby kiln for my wife and even it can reach almost 2000°F, if memory serves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That same compression can separate the heat from the ship (Depending on  the general shape anyways, not all of them do this), thus you don't need  to survive the full temperature, just a fraction of it. </p>
