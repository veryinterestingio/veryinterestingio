			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that allergies have existed well before industrialization although it's definitely gotten worse since. Also, the immune mechanisms in allergies often differ from those for the flu, for example type 1 hypersensitivity which is responsible for pollen and animal allergies is mediated by mast cells and IgE while fighting the flu involves B (chiefly IgG, IgM) and T cell responses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair shout. The immune system is all about balancing opposing signals, and industrialization only tips the balance a little, it isnt a primary cause per se. </p>
<p>Also you are right that the type of immune response is very different for most allergies vs most viruses, though both can be severe or mild.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you had the flu? Im not sure I would call that response measured. </p>

<p>To add to that, there are times when the immune system is triggered by something like the flu to go considerably over the top. This often results in what's called hypercytokinemia, also known as a &quot;cytokine storm,&quot; when the immune system starts attacking the body's own tissues. It's <em>tons of fun</em>. I speak from experience. </p>
<p>Reactions like this are believe to be what killed a lot of victims of the 1918 flu pandemic, especially many young healthy adults who died.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly different, the covid-19 stem particle attaches itself to the ACE receptor found in the upper respiratory area and most major organs of the body. The ACE (and ACE II) effectively modulate blood clotting and blood pressure (and other stuff).</p>
<p>So A) An immunocompromised gets to have their organs turned into swiss cheese, and B) a normal person has a chance of experiencing random fun blood clots, and C) everyone has a chance if experiencing lasting damage and long term effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly. They're not sure yet. The thing is that cytokine storms tend to harm younger people with stronger immune systems, so it probably wouldn't have accounted for a large portion of deaths, but could still have crippled some people.</p></div>		</li>
