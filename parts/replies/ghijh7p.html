<p>Languages where every letter only can make one sound, like Spanish, is where you'll find phonetic consistency. But again, those rules dont apply to proper nouns, like names.</p>

<p>It depends on a language. In Ukrainian everything is spelled phonetically including proper nouns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, and that’s the same with Spanish too (and probably every other language with consistent sounding letters), but the reason I said proper nouns are exempt is because someone living in Ukraine might have a Belarus name, or an American name, which wouldn’t necessarily be spelled phonetically. </p>
<p>Names are spelled most often to the region they name originated, not the region the person necessarily lives or is from.</p>
<p>But beyond names, same goes with other proper nouns, like specific places or things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>... in which case the name would be transcribed into Cyrillic phonetically, cause nobody can be expected to learn thousands of years of history of all languages on the planet just to read an id.</p>
<p>Understanding why Ternopil is spelled with <em>i</em> while Tiraspol goes with <em>o</em> is exercise difficult enough to only do it once.</p></div>		</li>
