<p>For greater accuracy you can recalibrate your elevation at a known location</p>

<p>That's how it works for aircraft.  Prior to takeoff and landing, Air Traffic Controllers tell the pilot what the local pressure is so they can set it to get more precise altitude readings.</p>
<p>But on your phone?  Unless you are a hiker or otherwise traveling vertically in a non-pressurized vessel, I'm not sure this would be good for anything other than curiosity or amature weather forcasting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meteorologist here - as far as amateur weather forecasting goes, barometers are kinda useless. You can tell if a low pressure system comes through you might have more stormy weather And if their is high pressure you might have more sunny weather. The problem is that in different places these rules may not work as well. As an example, the American south tends to be in persistent higher pressure even in more stormy weather. The real strength of barometers comes from a network of them where you can create a surface map but to be honest those really only tell you what’s going on now. The pressure field really needs to ingested into a numerical model in order to determine a forecast (which are also imperfect and require interpretation).
TLDR: can’t really make a forecast with a single barometer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What happened to those weather maps that they used to have?  The ones with the cold fronts and the warm fronts (the lines with the triangles and semi-circles), the isotherms, and such.  Nowadays it's all precipitation radar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Barometers are used for sports tracking systems to show things like how high you have climbed while biking, hiking, etc.  It tends to be more accurate than the altitude component of GPS, which is used to initially calibrate the reference  barometric altitude.  I'm not sure of Strava will use the sensor in a phone at this point, but it certainly uses it from things like bike computers when available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the altitude &amp; barometric pressure can make a difference in 'make ball go far' type sports. Denver is notorious for a lot of home run balls, and you might get an extra couple feet off a field goal kick if the atmospheric pressure drops.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know Ride with GPS does, it even has a setting where you can enable/disable using the barometer to track elevation change. I've  noticed slight errors as weather systems move in, but those are nominal compared to any actual climbs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a sailor tracking changes, not the actual measurement, can give an idea of the weather and a short warning of impending changes to the weather. High pressures are clear and cold low pressures are usually rainy. The change in pressure will bring winds as one system rushes in to replace another. That change is usually referred to as a front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atmospheric pressure will also affect tide heights. An increase of 1 hPa will lower the water level by 1cm.</p>
<p>I believe tide tables assume an atmospheric pressure of ~1015 hPa. In Ireland, the highest recorded pressure was 1052 hPa while the lowest was 927 hPa. </p>
<p>That's a range of 125 hPa, or 1.25 meters, not an insignificant number if you want to clear a sand bar or squeeze under a bridge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>red sun at night, sailor delight&quot;</p>
<p>this is assuming a sailor in the northern hemisphere, above the tropics. a red sun means high pressure in that direction. to the west, where the weather is coming from, it means high pressure which usually means good weather. to the east, the high pressure is on the way out, so here comes the low and the storms</p></div>		</li>
