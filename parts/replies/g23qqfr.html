			<div class="markdown"><p>just a quick point here: Viral Load is the overall quantity of virus in a person's body.  The quantity of the initial infection is called &quot;infectious dose&quot; or &quot;exposure dose&quot;.</p>
<p>Viral load determines the severity of symptoms</p>
<p>Infectious dose influences whether you ever get a high enough viral load to develop symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. One term refers to the number of HIV particles it takes to trigger an infection in the recipient (e.g. how many strands of HIV RNA are required to be present on a needle for an accidental needle stick injury to cause a systematic infection in the recipient). The other is a measure of how many copies of the virus are present in an individual's blood stream.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two is that a person with a very low viral load cannot ejaculate an infective dose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, because not all of the infectious dose becomes viral load.</p>
<p>If i sneeze on you and transmit, say, 10 micrograms of COVID-19 to your skin, then the infectious dose is 10 mcg, but your viral load is 0 until some of that sneeze finds its way to an open cut or a mucous membrane, enters your bloodstream, and finds its way to a part of your body it can thrive in, at which point whatever made it through is now your &quot;viral load&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>exposure dose is how much you were exposed to - lets say i sneeze on you and expose you to 10 micrograms.</p>
<p>viral load is how much is actually in your system.  let's say that 1 mcg of that sneeze langs on a cut and is absorbed into your blood.  now lets say that 500 nanograms are immediately killed by your immune system.  the remaining 500 flows through your blood until it reaches a cell type that it can attack, lets say that another 250 ng is wiped on the way.  of the remaining 250 ng, suppose that 150 have malformed proteins and are duds, so they can't actually enter your cells.  the remaining 100ng enters cells and is now safe from your immune system while it reprograms the cell.</p>
<p>So, i exposed you to 10 micrograms, but the amount that actually took hold in your system was only 100ng.  </p>
<p>this is by the way, ridiculously oversimplified, but it should illustrate why the distinction between dose and load is important.  The amount of the dose that actually takes hold and becomes load is hugely variable.  you could have one exposure that results in 0% load, and another exposure that transmits 100% to load.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As far as anal sex is concerned, you do not need to be bleeding to get it. The cells that line the rectum are more susceptible to infection.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned that, the cells are much more susceptible to trauma during sex than cells of the vagina. My mistake!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even ignoring trauma rectal tissue is more susceptible to viral infection.   </p>
<p>The mouth and vagina are both structures that are designed to take material from outside of the body move it on to another part of the body. They both are resistant to absorbing materials and lined with a thickish layer fast shedding cells that if infected will likely die before the infection can spread.  </p>
<p>The rectum on the other hand is a thiner membrane that actively absorbs water from material that came to it from another part of the body. It simply does not have the same resistance to infection, it cannot and perform its function.  </p>
<p>This isn't an &quot;anal sex is unnatural&quot; argument hidden behind other terms, I'm Bi, i like anal sex, but nothing goes in my butt that isn't synthetic and recently cleaned or wrapped in a fresh condom. And that is with partners I know and trust.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this <em>any</em> infection? Or viral infections?</p>
<p>Since GI tract is not clean, and anal lining has increased risk of trauma, I would imagine a lot more bottoms ending up with severe infections, but don't typically see/hear about it.</p>
<p>One thing I want to research is long term issues with anal sex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel that many of these responses are forgetting the key factor here: HIV specifically needs the CD4-type white blood cell to breed. HIV doesnt need &quot;blood&quot; or &quot;micro tears.&quot; It needs fresh CD4 cells, which typically hang out around sites of infection. CD4 cells arent found in high numbers at simple tears and areas of friction and therefore, the micro tear and &quot;blood&quot; at the site isnt what's necessarily increasing risk. </p>
<p>This would at least partially help explain why people who screen positive for HIV also are at higher risk to screen positive for other STIs like gono, chlam, HSV, or syphilis. Those infections have something in common that simple &quot;microtears&quot; do not: CD4 cells swarm the sites of infection.</p>
<p>I feel that when we talk about &quot;microtears&quot; we're on the low demonizing and stigmatizing anal sex and thus MSM, which further perpetuates the problems inherent with getting individuals screened and ultimately treated. We have to just deal with it: people like butt stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. It's also the main reason people still get infected today. Almost all infections are from people who don't know they have it so aren't on meds.</p>
<p>There are some cases that may come from people who know they have it but stopped taking their meds for any number of reasons (see HIV Care Continuum)  and an even smaller number of cases that are due to treatment failure (they misuse their meds, or they become ineffective) so the virus returns to infectious levels.</p>
<p>Back then there was no way for people to suppress their viral load so infection rates were much higher than they are today. As someone else already pointed out, when someone gets infected with HIV they have no detectable viral load for about a week, after that it shoots up to (potentially) hundreds of thousands or millions before stabilizing at a lower level after a few more weeks. If left untreated, the number of CD4 (immune cells) cells will drop and the viral load will increase until it results in AIDS. You can see what this looks like by checking out HIV Viral Load Trajectory charts which will give you a better idea.</p></div>		</li>
