			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, &quot;elastic&quot; describes how good something is at conserving energy during compression. Play Dough isn't elastic, it just splats when you drop it.</p>
<p>Air and other gasses are <em>very</em> elastic. Under most circumstances if you compress air and then let it expand, you get almost all your energy back.</p>
<p>Rubber balls are in between. It loses a fair amount of energy squishing on impact, and you don't get all that back when it bounces. That's one reason flatter tires are less fuel efficient, you lose energy to deforming the tire as it rolls.</p>
<p>By filling up the ball, you're letting the air inside the ball store most of the energy and then give it back. And letting the ball squish less. Since the air is better at being elastic, less energy is lost and the ball bounces higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a dumb question, and I'm not sure if you'd have the answer, but let's say you had a pneumatic spring that didn't leak at all, and it was put under pressure repeatedly, would the air ever actually &quot;degrade&quot; and lose its elasticity? Like over a long enough period of time or enough pressure?</p>
<p>I figure enough pressure would make it combust, but that's not really the answer I'm looking for. I mean like would just repeated light pressure eventually cause it to more or less &quot;wear out&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The air wouldn't &quot;wear out,&quot; but depending on the amount of energy you're imparting on the spring and its ability to dissipate heat, it may overheat. That heat will make other parts of the system wear out instead of the air.</p>
<p>Compressed air will never lose its 'elasticity' from being compressed and released.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some sense everything wears out. But you seem to be asking about a very ideal scenario where it's not leaking, and the materials holding it are perfect and don't degrade. Just focus on the air?</p>
<p>The answer is mostly no.</p>
<p>Rubber is a bunch of long, complicated molecules that can stretch and twist and tangle. That's where the bounciness comes from, they can bend and bounce back. But that also means repeated use can break, rearrange, untangle those long molecules, ruining the elasticity.</p>
<p>Air is <em>very</em> simple. For example, nitrogen gas is most of our air and it's just two nitrogen atoms in a molecule. There isn't anything to break, deform, untangle.</p>
<p>Air pressure is those molecules flying around (because they're not so cold they're frozen) and bouncing off the walls of the container. As you compress the gas, you store energy by making the gas hotter, making them fly faster and bounce harder, raising the pressure. And then as you expand you get that energy back.</p>
<p>Because there's not much you can change about an N2 or O2 or CO2 molecule, it doesn't really break down. But it can leak, the molecules can occasionally break apart and then bind to the container, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The ground is absorbing some of the energy as heat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agree with the entire answer, but my nitpick would be that the thermal losses are mostly within the ball.  Contraction and expansion of air &amp; rubber is mostly causing kinetic-to-thermal energy conversion in those materials, rather than the (much stiffer) ground.  </p>
<p>Although the brief conductive contact between the rubber and the ground will bleed some heat into the ground.</p></div>		</li>
