			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty hard for us to adapt at this point as we have gotten so good at adapting our environment to suit us.</p>
<p>I was watching a show about these people who walked on all fours because of birth defects and people were studying their movements. They were explaining that apes used to have hands more like ours, that our thumbs more resemble ancestors of apes then current apes. The apes have adapted over the many years to be better in the jungle where humans appear to have retained our more primitive hands because they better suited using tools over adapting for increased mobility while walking on our arms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an oft-repeated misconception. You will reach the singularity in proper time. While the events you observe outside the event horizon will appear sped up significantly to you, it would be impossible to really make anything out, since all of the photons will be incredibly blue-shifted and, due to the extreme curvature, the singularity will appear to be in front of whatever direction you are traveling, making observation a difficult proposition.  </p>
<p>Finally, it would be impossible to survive transit through the event horizon for all but supermassive black holes due to tidal forces; even within supermassive black holes (the closest of which is &quot;only&quot; some \~40,000 light years away), you would be stretched to death (I hate the term &quot;spaghettified&quot;) by tidal forces before reaching the singularity anyway^(1), just after crossing the event horizon.  </p>
<p>^(1) citation needed; we have no way of ever knowing what happens beyond the event horizon of a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, human population size is so large it'd be hard to get any real changes off the ground in anything like 'real time'.  It'd probably take so long to come to equilibrium that a million other factors would come to play, not the least of which would be medical advances that may make obesity far easier to control.  I mean if we can get that working within a few <em>centuries</em>, you'd still be way ahead of any demonstrable shifts in population structure.  Evolution takes time, particularly for traits like this (meaning ones that don't kill you right away).</p></div>		</li>
