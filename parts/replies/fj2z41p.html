			<div class="markdown"><p>Define &quot;processed&quot;. The meaning of that word is so fuzzy that your statement means basically nothing. Now, if you wanted to say that foods processed with nitrites have been linked to higher rates of certain cancers, you'd be completely correct. But &quot;processed&quot;? Some processed foods are among the healthiest foods we know about. E.g., how about Japanese miso or Korean dweenjang? Those are heavily processed foods. </p>
<p>Please, though, don't use the word &quot;chemicals&quot; in a reply because that's just as lazy and illogical idea as &quot;processed&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
