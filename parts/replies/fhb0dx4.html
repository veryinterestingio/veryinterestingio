			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to add this and was surprised it's not voted higher. Convection currents are important in this context. To phrase it in an ELI5 way..</p>
<p>Warm air rises, cold air falls. If your warm air in your house touches the cold glass, it gets cold and falls. This brings more warm air in from above so it can get cold. You get basically a soft, invisible wind near your windows that makes it cool your house even faster. An important thing to know is that the bigger the difference in temperature between two things, the faster the warm one cools and the cool one warms. If the air by the glass wasn't moving, it would would cool down closer to the temperature of the cold glass and then the rest of the air couldn't cool so fast.</p></div>		</li>
