<p>Certainly, there are times when a deficiency in human conduct is the reason a plane crashed (See Air France 447, the primary cause of the incident is the actions of the First Officer).</p>
<p>But, flying is a complex task. When things go wrong, mistakes are made. Imagine you are driving on a highway and someone forces you into a paved shoulder. Waiting on that shoulder is a hitchhiker. You instinctively slam on the brakes, but your brakes lock up and you hit the hitchhiker.</p>
<p>The news will pick this up, look at the report, and credit the death to your mistake. Why? You didn't stop in as short a distance as you could have. The investigation determined that had you applied 2.6lbs less pressure on the brake pedal, the tires wouldn't have locked up, the car wouldn't have slid, and you would have come to a stop 33 feet sooner, well before the position of the hitchhiker.</p>
<p>Yes, the report mentions that you were reacting to a sideswipe situation, that you had no experience in that situation before. The shoulder had loose asphalt on it that made braking less predictable... But ultimately a small change in your reaction could have prevented tragedy.</p>
<p>That's what &quot;human error&quot; doesn't imply when you read about flying incidents.</p></div>		</li>
