			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: the burps go to other parts of your body where they get transformed into something your body can use. Your liver is very important for this as are the kidneys!</p>
<p>(Upon further research it seems also that actually most of our bodily organs have in some form the ability to metabolise lactates which is very interesting and I'm going to read more on!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question! I would like to point out that I'm not a PT I can only give you my personal opinion but for me there are two kinds of stretching: the yoga kind and the post workout kind (the pre-workout is kind of yoga-esque). Personally for me the post-workout stretching is best done warm and as close to the end of exercise as you can. Warm is pliable and that's good for the stretch. That being said I haven't had a cold shower before doing stretches so I can't say that it wouldn't be good... Just I haven't ever heard it suggested :-)</p></div>		</li>
