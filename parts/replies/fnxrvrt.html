			<div class="markdown"><p>Conversely, I remember a UK celebrity Bear Grylls series, where the guy who was in the best shape physically (believe he was a rugby player) was one of the first to have to leave the island. Great beach body, but very little to keep him alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people don't realize, but athletes and very fit people actually require more calories to maintain that level of fitness and weight. Mainly because they are burning a ton of calories to work out or perform at that level. And if you have exceptionally low body fat then your body has nothing to convert into calories. </p>
<p>Goes to show, we don't just get fat for no reason, thousands of years of adaptation and the people who survived and passed on their genes were people who could efficiently store extra calories as fat, for when times got rough and you didn't have enough food to go around. People who got fatter faster were going to have an advantage over those who didn't. </p>
<p>But these days when we have plenty of food and our modern sedentary lifestyles, our bodies are still operating like they did thousands of years ago when starvation was a daily reality. So people get fat, and then we have obesity related health problems we've not had to worry about quite as much in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From accounts I’ve read about forced starvation/labour situations, the young men are usually the first to die (prob’s because of faster metabolism, strenuous labour). In Luong Ung’s book ‘First they killed my father’ she noticed that even though the men and women were doing the same work and the women were giving most of their food to their children, the women lasted way longer than the men.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, to back Sam up a little bit... that experience was his second crack at the show - where he came in second place the first time. He did fatten up on purpose but to say he just sat on his ass does not do right by him. Sam busted his balls looking for food but could only eat mice, it was grueling. But in the end - he ate less food than any of the other contestants who even remotely came close - but he won! He wouldn't have done so without packing on an extra 70lbs. Kinda crazy. </p>
<p>P.s. Alone is awesome!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think his strategy was better overall. A lot of contestants burn way too many calories building their shelter and finding food. Sam had a simple shelter and his hunting trips didn't burn him out. Also many times people get tons of food but they are so tired mentally they don't end up eating it.</p></div>		</li>
