			<div class="markdown"><p>A sand sized stable black hole would destroy all life on earth if not the earth itself fairly quickly I would imagine. However the micro black holes talked about in this post if stable and non evaporating would pass through you without doing anything kind of like a neutrino, it wouldn't do anything to the earth in any meaningful timescale if ever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two kinds of micro black holes: black holes that could be created at a particle accelerator, and black holes that have a sub-stellar mass. </p>
<p>The first one would have a radius so small it would almost never interact with any matter, and probably dissipate from Hawking radiation almost instantly.</p>
<p>The latter scales in danger from &quot;not a problem&quot; to &quot;will destroy the Earth.&quot; You'd have to be more specific.</p></div>		</li>
