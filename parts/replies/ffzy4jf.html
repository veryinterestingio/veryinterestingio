<p>Or should I do that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay, I didn’t get a definition, so I’ll work from how I defined PT in my 2002 book and then answer the question. Hope that’s okay.</p>
<p>The most important factor in changing behavior is Ability — making something easy to do. So when technology makes something easy to do, it has the biggest impact:</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Buying on Amazon vs in a real store
Posting on twitter vs posting on your blog
Searching via Google via using portals from Yahoo or Altavista (or others who went out of business)</p>
<p>The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Simplicity changes behavior.</p>
<p>Whether that’s using Uber or doing Tiny Habits, that’s the key: Simplicity.</p></div>		</li>
