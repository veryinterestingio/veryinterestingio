			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is fascinating to me that as fancy as nuclear reactors are they still use steam turbines. I wonder if this would help some of the misconceptions about how they work by “spooky black magic”</p>
<p>The actual magic is:
1) When you put two pieces of magic rock together they heat up.
2) Use that to boil water
3) Release that steam through the massive cooling towers
4) Profit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another common misconception is that the cooling towers release steam - the steam actually condenses and is cooled via air rising in the cooling towers, and then is recycled back into the boilers - the thin wispy “steam” coming from the towers is actually from water vapor condensing in the cooler air outside of the towers, much like your breath on a cold day.</p></div>		</li>
