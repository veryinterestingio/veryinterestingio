			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as we know most if not all of them do. But so it is with large gravitationally bound systems. Heavier objects tend to move towards the center of the system. Even large agglomerations of stars like globular clusters tend to have stellar mass black holes towards their common gravitational centers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in the instance of galaxies that do not have a smbh at the center, what is providing the gravitational structure to said galaxy?</p>
<p>Edit: thanks to everyone who explained its actually not the black hole that provides structure, but instead dark matter and the mass of the galaxy itself</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scale we're talking about here is way beyond that - there's usually only one supermassive black hole per <em>galaxy</em>, although after a galaxy merger there can be more than one. So if the SMBH in the centre of our own galaxy isn't the biggest we've seen, we'll have to look millions or billions of light years away to other galaxies to look for bigger ones - well beyond the range where it can directly affect us.</p>
<p>It's debated whether an actively accreting supermassive black hole would have an effect on life or not, but Milky Way mass galaxies are actually very common, so there's no clear evidence of a bias. It's always hard to tell with a sample size of exactly one though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, the largest black hole in our neighborhood, the Virgo supercluster is called M87, and its black hole was the famous one that was imaged first in 2017 that we've all seen the picture of.  The largest black hole in the largest galaxy in our galactic neighborhood happens to have a plasma jet shooting out from its poles at near light speed, aimed DIRECTLY at us.  Hubble has imaged this jet in a brilliant blue color.  But as you say, it's so far away from us we don't have any ill effects.  The jet can be measured to 5000 light years long in optical wavelengths and 100,000 light years long in radio.  M87 is 55 million light years away.</p>
<p>Bonus, the blue color of the jet is caused by synchrotron radiation, which happens when super energetic electrons get pulled along magnetic field lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Kurzgesagt video discussed this. Basically, these incredibly massive stars were so large, that their cores could have collapsed into a black hole. Then, the extreme gravitational forces created massive radiation forces, which could have allowed for a sort of &quot;equilibrium&quot; where the star is able to stay stable while the black hole continues to consume the rest of the star. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d recommend watching the Kurzgesagt video OP mentioned, about the largest black holes and comparing black hole sizes.</p>
<p>To summarize, one idea (not a theory, not well-researched, hard to substantiate rn, etc) is that when the universe was so young that things were crammed so close together that everywhere you looked you had glowing hot plasma right in your face, around this time some truly enormous pockets of all that hot stuff collapsed on itself in such a way that a black hole was inside the core of a star-like object so big that at the center of the core fed the black hole while the rest of the core operated normally as the core of an absurdly large star-like object. </p>
<p>Normally black holes shred and fry anything they swallow up, and doing that actually drives away more potential black hole food past a certain point, so a black hole just hanging around normally can only absorb things up to a certain rate. The “quasi-star” idea is that if a black hole formed at the center of something that worked similar to a star, maybe the quasi-star could be so incredibly massive that it continued to cram more matter down into the black hole regardless of how much the black hole pushed back.</p>
<p>Now, this is my understanding from what I think was less than 10 seconds of explanation from an oversimplified edutainment video, and I’m a college dropout (not an expert), so don’t take any of that as gospel. To my understanding, it’s just one possible explanation for how something weird maybe might have happened and it isn’t an idea strongly agreed on within or preferred by the astrophysics community</p></div>		</li>
