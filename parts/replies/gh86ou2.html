<p>How is that even possible?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is fiber. I think on a single fiber you can carry something like 48 different colors of light, each of those is a different frecuency so they can travel in the same single fiber. So a single &quot;color&quot; can carry close to 1gbit/sec making a single fiber carry something stupid like 4tbits/s.. If you consider each cable that is run thru the ground or sea doesnt have 1 single fiber but dozens or hundreds.. Well yeah you get the point. </p>
<p>Also the 4tbit/s is what i think its being done right now afaik, but in the lab is much more stupid, like 50 tbits/s in a single fiber stupid. Thats why you see people saying data caps are hella idiotic over cable. </p>
<p>Ofc there is more nuance as of why we dont get 10gigabit to our homes but we should not be stuck in under 100mbps like we are right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Single fiber pairs are pushing 16-24 terabits per second these days for long haul, repeatered links. Depending on the specific tech you use, you can have 150+ channels going over 1 fiber.</p>
<p>For instance, Google is currently in the process of having the Dunant cable installed across the Atlantic. It's a 12 fiber pair system with a design capacity of at least 250 terabits per second.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The first cable was laid in the 1850s across the floor of the Atlantic from Telegraph Field, Foilhommerum Bay, Valentia Island in western Ireland to Heart's Content in eastern Newfoundland. The first communications occurred August 16, 1858, reducing the communication time between North America and Europe from ten days—the time it took to deliver a message by ship—to a matter of minutes. -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable</a></p>

<p>Lab speeds tend to be over pristine fibre over short distances.</p>

<p>Shared between everyone using that line, so it only takes 40,000 people to drop that to 100mbit.</p>
<p>But that's not even accurate in the first place.</p>
<p>The limiting factor on a fibre connection is the hardware on the ends, not the fibre itself and you don't have 4tb hardware at every exchange, most will be significantly lower. </p>
<p>And then of course most of the US doesn't have FttP so it's a moot point anyway.</p></div>		</li>
