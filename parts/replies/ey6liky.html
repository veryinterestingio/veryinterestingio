			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth pointing out that a lot (but not all) top level executives at large publicly traded companies, have their share purchases/sales on a schedule. Meaning they have a broker or accountant that buys and sells for them at predetermined times to avoid investors reading too much into &quot;insider buying and selling.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - any officer of the company or beneficial owner (&gt;5% iirc) shareholder has to file a a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form144.asp" target="_blank">SEC form 144</a> giving public notice of their intent to sell shares of their stock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, many executives are awarded options that mature at certain time.  Upon maturity they almost always sell off their stocks due to high taxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, you can find information about how many shares top executives are selling. Usually they are periodically unloading stock they gained by executing options that is part of their compensation. Thus a rule of thumb is that it doesn't say much about executives view of their company if they are selling stock, but it is generally a positive sign if you see executives buying up stock. At least I look at that as a positive sign</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe insider trading does not have to be done by an owner, employee, or other stake holder. If my best friend is the CEO of Very Large Corporation of America and he gives me information that has not been made public, I'm not allowed to act on that information, either.</p></div>		</li>

You can‚Äôt tip people off, and people that have been tipped off are not safe to use misbegotten info.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what nailed Martha Stewart. Unfortunately, members of Congress, who often pass laws that affect certain businesses and the price of stocks, are exempt from criminal prosecution for this type of insider trading. There was a big hoopla about it towards the start of the Great Recession, and that exemption was removed... then later, quietly added back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>months isn't really the timeline that credible voices have been discussing for a recession -- but a market correction/crash would likely happen in advance of a recession, b/c the stock market is driven by expectations.</p>
<p>last I looked, less than a majority of economists think one will happen before end of 2020 and a a significant majority think before end of 2021.  and pretty much all of them agree that trump's tariff war has increased/accelerated risk of recession.  almost impossible to happen in 2019 -- need two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, and hard to imagine we can be in August and not see the signs if it were happening this quarter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is very possible. Trump and his Republican cronies have used every cheap trick in the book for short term gains. The tax cut artificially inflated the stock market. They've kept interest rates artificially low at the Fed. All of this when a growing economy should be lowering the deficit and raising Fed interest rates. Our economy is going to crumble (likely right after the election), and there are going to be very few tools the government can use to bring it back. Republicans are eating their seed corn, and it is going to be the country as a whole that will starve because of it. The trade war is just another nail in the coffin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, it doesnt matter if youre a part of thay other company or not. If someone you know gave you a stock tip based on insider knowledge then its illegal for both parties. To simplify, my friend &quot;Steve&quot; tells me to invest in Company B because his company, Company A, is taking it over. I am not allpwed to invest in either company bevause of potential stock profit. Had &quot;Steve disclosed to the public that this was happening all would be i  the clear.</p></div>		</li>
