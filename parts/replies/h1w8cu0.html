			<div class="markdown"><p>If nothing else, you could have your liquid contain a notable percentage of large particles so that some are always sticking out of the liquid, causing a rough surface.  But this is not a pure liquid.</p>
<p>As far as I know, for a pure liquid without something actively disturbing the surface (such as wind) you'll always get a smooth shiny surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand, flat paint has some larger particles in it (often of the pigment substance itself) , and as the liquid evaporates away, these large rough particles are left sticking out of the surface, causing the rough matt finish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The act of paint drying is the solvent evaporating. The paint layer is shrinking, like how dried fruit turns wrinkly, and also getting more viscous, so surface tension has a harder time making things flow back to smoothness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that the particles in the paint or whatever must form some sort of irregular network of bonds as it dries/solidifies so that at the molecular level it ends up being all rough? I guess I don’t really know enough about the physics of materials like paint because I was under the assumption that it is some sort of solid pigment dissolved in a solvent? Idk lol this has brought up a whole hunch of new questions.</p></div>		</li>
