			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, worse.  The more places that are formed into antenna-like areas, the more arcing and sparking you get, which creates more areas of resonance which creates even more sparking.  While you probably won't get a catastrophic explosion of any kind, you will get a nice light show until heat or stray currents cause the electronics to burn themselves out.</p>
<p>This is probably extremely rare and highly unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, if you have a plain metal bowl that's open on the top and want to reheat soup in it, you'll be fine.  A little bit of radio waves will absorb into the metal, heating it, but that's okay because you're trying to heat the soup anyway.  Most of it will reflect off, bounce around, and end up landing in the soup from the top of the bowl.</p>
<p>The biggest problems with metal in a microwave are thin metal, like decorative metal accents on non-metal bowls (that can't support the amount of electric current the microwaves create in it), containers that are too closed (microwaves can't reach the food), or different pieces of metal near each other in the microwave (voltage differences between the pieces of metal can cause sparks).</p>
<p>If those situations don't occur, there probably won't be problems, but the safest policy is always just avoiding the situation in the first place.  If you don't have to use metal, don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can even put aluminum foil in the microwave as long as you make sure it's not crinkled.</p>
<p>Source - had to defrost a turkey in the microwave the night before Thanksgiving, using aluminum foil to ensure that the turkey was defrosted relatively evenly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metals don't absorb much, because the electrons in them are relatively free to move (i.e. they have a low electrical resistance). Microwaves just vibrate these electrons, and the effect of this in a metal is actually to reflect the incoming radiation. Something like water absorbs a lot more than it reflects, while something like a metal fork reflects a lot more than it absorbs. The specific shape of the item then changes the form of the electric field created around it, with points and sharp edges able to concentrate the field. If the field becomes concentrated enough, the electrons in the air become detached from their molecules and move freely- this is a spark, if it allows a substantial current to flow between two regions, or corona discharge otherwise.</p>
<p>Antennas are specifically designed so that the electron vibration has a resonance around the frequency you want to transmit or receive, and are a similar but slightly different idea - nothing is particularly resonant in the case of a fork in a microwave, but it doesn't need to be to cause the electrons to move around.</p></div>		</li>
