<p>How do we know that the decomposition rates will stay constant? Is it possible that right around year 325, for example the particles suddenly give way and that Tupperware turns to dust within the next 3 months?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very valid question. This method has its limitations. The decomposition rate is assumed constant which may not necessarily be true. For example, it assumes that the temperature throughout the period stays fixed (eg 25C).  We all know that's not true because the  temperature is hot in summers and cold in winters. With global warming we can expect breakdown rates to increase. But if the temperature doesn't shift too much from that 25C,  it still offers a reasonable prediction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not a crazy idea at all, there are plenty of things that behave the way you describe.  But one of the things we know about plastics is that they have this remarkable trait which is that their basic properties (including the ones that make them resistant to chemical breakdown) stay pretty much the same all the way down to a very small scale.</p>
<p>This is where you get all this talk about &quot;microplastics.&quot;  It's also something that (as far as I know) we have only been studying closely fairly recently, leading to a sudden surge in consciousness about the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say decompose, do you mean break down into other chemicals that are recycled by nature or are you just talking about breaking down into small micro plastics that would still be scattered everywhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By degrade/decompose/breakdown, I mean transforming plastics into &quot;small molecules&quot; I.e. chemical transformation, not breaking down dimensionally. For the most common plastics (polyolefins) this usually include conversion into carbon dioxide, water, hydrogen gas, methane. If the plastics are underground, this can catalyze due to pressure and geothermal heat, and if plastics are above ground, this can speedup through the action of sunlight and other chemicals in the air and environment (ozone, oxygen, moisture, free radicals).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this. I was under the mistaken impression that plastic just breaks down into smaller pieces. But it's good to know they actually go through a chemical transformation like most things do.</p></div>		</li>
