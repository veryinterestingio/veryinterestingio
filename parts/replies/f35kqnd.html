<p>So “ground” in this sense is just the lowest potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just adding to your explanation:</p>
<p>In a typical car you will see the ground/frame/body as zero, and cables will distribute mostly 12 V. (But there's also other voltage if you look hard enough.)</p>
<p>But it doesn't have to be like that. It used to be common to use the frame as the highest voltage. To some it's natural to say that the frame is 12 V and the cables are zero. To some it's more natural to say the frame/ground is zero and the cables are -12 V.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn’t answer your second question about the low potential electrons. And maybe made things worse because, well, in my analogy that low potential water needs to be stored somewhere.
In the chemical battery, the electrons are just used to push the potential around but in actuality don’t themselves move very far (like dominos - you can affect the far end of the chain without actually moving a domino from the front all the way to the back).
That’s the edge of where I can truly ELI5. Hopefully that helps!</p></div>		</li>
