			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a very cool GT-R Pikes Peak hillclimb car I think it may have been an R-33...Pennzoil livery, ran in the late 90s and did very well. That was a dirt GT-R. Too long wheelbase for WRC, too heavy. Also those cars were Japanese market only low production and expensive, making the rear wiper more likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been involved in rallying from club to interantional level, so i will say that you dont need a rear wiper. </p>
<p>It is a very japanese thing to have a rear wiper. But they arent actually on the homologation papers or class rules for rally cars so they get removed.</p>
<p>Example is a Ford Fiesta R2 which is a hatch comes with a rear wiper standard, but the R2 rules says you can remove it. But if the photos are there and there is no overising rule or homologation update you need it.</p>
<p>Funniest thing though, it was either the evo 7 or 8 that had the airconditioner still present in the homologation photos, so if you ran group N then you had to have an airconditioner. Didnt need to work, but had to be there.</p>
<p>So TLDR, not a rally thing, a japanese thing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I owned a '06 Mazda6 and I rarely used the rear wiper on it. Mostly to clear snow. My '15 Mazda3 is a whole other story.</p>
<p>I miss that 6. My wife and I would fold the seats down and lay in the back at the drive-in and have ample space.</p></div>		</li>
