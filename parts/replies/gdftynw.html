			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding water to an engine can in fact increase performance.<br />
In the 1950-60 water injection system was built into some aircraft. Early B52 bomber KC-135 tankers and even Boring 707 and Boeing 747 airlines use water injection at take off.<br />
The had tank with water and injected it into the engine to increase power at takeoff.</p>
<p>It increases power but if you look at the power vs the weight of fuel and water it is worse. So it can  be a good idea at takeoff but not something you like to use for long-distance flight</p>
<p>When a more powerful jet engine was available it was no longer needed at takeoff. The water system requires extra tanks, pumps, a ground operation so avoiding it can cost efficient.</p>
<p>It works in a piston engine too and some WWII fighters used it at takeoff to reach interception altitude fast. Others used it to get a bit of extra speed in combat. It is weight inefficient so you can use if all the time.</p>
<p>Even cars can use it. It has never been common but it can be done.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meth/water injection works if you have moderate power goals. If you are serious, you need a port injection spacer with extra fuel injectors. Upgrade your fuel pump to stage 3, turbos to stage 2/3, crank up the boost and blast 100% E85 for awesome-a powah!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, on a turbofan the majority of the air volume is not going through the engine, it's going through the fan on the front and around the outside of the engine. So there is a lot less air actually going into the actual engine than it appears.</p></div>		</li>
