			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything said here is correct. I would like to add a comment concerning fructose, though. </p>
<p>Yes, fructose tastes sweeter than glucose and yes, it is used in the food industry because of this property (usually as HFCS - high fructose corn syrup) combined with the fact that it is cheap. However, only our liver contains the enzymes needed to convert fructose to glucose.
This causes people that consume very high amounts of fructose to have a liver flushed with glucose over long periods of time, and be in higher risk for fatty liver and metabolic disease.</p>
<p>We are definitely not meant to have a lot of fructose in our diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Just to add more context, high fructose corn syrup means that it contains more than the normal amount, not that it is exclusively fructose. Ignoring water, it is at most 65% fructose (with the rest being glucose and short glucose chains). Normal corn syrup is mostly glucose, maltose, and other glucose chains.</p>
<p>Fructose is also found naturally in fruit, and is of course 50% of sucrose which is normal table sugar (which is also found in fruit). Fructose is still a perfectly natural part of our diet, just perhaps not in the amounts we normally consume. There is a substantial amount of evidence that we consume way too much of <em>any</em> kind of sugar, not just fructose.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that we should be mindful of what we consume, but fructose and HFCS are not <em>necessarily</em> bad for us per se, although we should almost certainly consume less of it than we do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once again, I agree with you. However, I highly suggest you run a search for 'fructose fatty liver' in your favorite publication search engine. There is a large body of evidence from the past 10 years concerning dietary fructose's connection to metabolic diseases.</p>
<p>We <strong>should</strong> be mindful of what we consume - especially fructose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we're talking about fructose, I want to add that there are some people who are fructose intolerance. There are several types of fructose intolerance. The main type is similar to lactose intolerance. People with fructose intolerance will shit themselves if they consume a lot of fructose. This is why some activists want the type of sugar labelled on food. Obviously, eating ANYTHING in excess will cause a stomach ache, and so people with easily upset bellies are also advised to have moderation of everything in their diet (another reason people keep track of things like fructose etc). There is however a bit of sillyness, some people will claim that fructose intolerance doesn't exist others will claim that fructose is the devil. A gastroenterologist should be able to medically diagnose fructose intolerance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the things I read about the FODMAP diet is that it isn't necessarily the fructose per se, but the balance of fructose to other sugars that causes the digestive issues</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I have diagnosed fructose intolerance, and it’s pretty severe. It’s kind of crazy how many people don’t believe it’s actually a thing. There’s a regimented test for it (they make you drink a fructose solution and then blow into a bag over a few hours to measure your body’s reaction), and yet a surprising number of people think I’m just being a trendy dieter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>6CO2+6H2O+sunlight energy= C6H12O6+6O2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, that’s the chemical formula for EVERY 6 carbon sugar. All carbohydrates are C(n)H(2n)O(n). So if you have 6 carbons (n=6), you get the famous C6H12O6. You have to see how the molecule is arranged to determine if it’s glucose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: early trees took over the planet quickly because nothing could digest lignin yet. When the trees died, they just laid there, not decomposing. That sequestered a <em>lot</em> of carbon, because the trees never rotted and never released their carbon before they got buried in sediment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I read about this. And now, since we keep on using fossil fuels, these carbons are now being released into the atmosphere, causing global warming.</p></div>		</li>
