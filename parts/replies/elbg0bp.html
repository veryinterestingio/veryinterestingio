			<div class="markdown"><p>There's absolutely nothing wrong with the post above.  Clearly it's what the readers prefer- a concise, non-descriptive answer.  Based on the sidebar, I thought I had to give an in-depth response or else it would get removed.  Comments like this are why I lurk; damned if you do, damned if you don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your original response to OP was great; don't let negative responses get you down.  I actually really like that both are the top 2 responses; yours gives more detail while the one this is in response to gives the bird's-eye view and gives a nice overview that helps to understand your more technical post better. Very interesting and helpful both!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that despite common misconception, lactate doesn't cause fatigue. Lactate is actually an important fuel source in the body, and it's buildup is more a marker of fuel use (being put very simply).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it is the end product? So if we unreasonably keep pushing beyond muscle failure, we end up vomitting and experience heavy nausea because it turns the blood acidic? So while it might don't cause fatigue, it doesn't seem beneficial. </p>
<p>Source: young ambitious me overdoing it :D (those rolemodels keep telling you to train as hard as you can and keep pushing, they never mentioned getting dizzy and throwing up :d)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relative to others of similar size, your stamina can be better or worse. The same person with more weight will have less stamina because moving more weight takes more work. </p>
<p>A heavier person who trains more could have more stamina than a lighter person who trains less, but losing weight is a great way to get more out of the stamina you have. This is especially true for running, where you're lifting your body weight every step.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Capilarisation of running muscles, cardiovascular efficiency and neuromuscular optimisation are all relatively independent of being overweight. if someone just trained without a caloric defecit they would remain overweight while being cardio vascularly fit </p>
<p>Anecdotally, I've encountered several runners in competitions who were grossly overweight but had been champion runners at a younger age and put a lot of weight but were still fast over 10k</p></div>		</li>
