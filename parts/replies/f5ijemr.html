<p>While the original backbone was DARPAnet (a military defense project coordination network) the size and scope of the internet is such that the US government is unable to control or police it anymore (and they've tried).  The US could shut down every router, backbone, and switch owned by American companies and everything inside the US border, and not only will nearly everything continue unabated, but the US would lose 95% of its high-tech companies' headquarters.  Google/Alphabet is able to set up in 48 hours in a half-dozen European countries, as many Asian ones, or Canada.  Ditto Facebook.    Microsoft is literally 6 hours from the Canadian border as is.  If some neo-Luddite in power in the US government even hinted at shutting down the internet, everything would be gone in weeks, and the American government knows it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider the impact China, or other such data restrictions countries face. Your country doesn't want you to take a road, they close it down. Same thing can happen on the internet. Can't close it for the whole world, but the person allowing you specifically to drive on that road can close it for you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know you're being hypothetical, but as someone who controls about 90,000 of the aforementioned for an enterprise ISP, if the gov asked us to do this the answer would be &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>We are required, both contractually and federally mandated, to keep our network running. Emergency services, hospitals, cellular networks, and even military services run over our network infrastructure. It's not really a choice, and if the government told us to shut it down there would have to be an imminent nuclear holocaust or something like to justify us throwing the proverbial switch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the clear explanation, I had a similar doubt about it last week and had to search a lot to find an answer. I didn't know whether the sender address was traveling all over along with the data packets. Then I realized about routing tables after a lot of searching. With your explanation I would have understood it in 1 minute.</p></div>		</li>
