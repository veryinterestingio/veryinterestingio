			<div class="markdown"><p>The main issue is farmers are not getting their soils tested. So they are guessing how much and what kind of fertilizer to apply. In some cases, the farmer will add too much of one nutrient (Potassium), and that negatively impacts yields and the availability of other micronutrients necessary for the crop.<br />
My goal is to introduce science-based research for farmers to follow. I hope to show them the results of my next in the field study, so they can see for themselves how better nutrient management practices could help them increase yield.</p></div>		</li>
