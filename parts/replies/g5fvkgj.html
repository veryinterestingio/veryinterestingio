			<div class="markdown"><p>So the math behind it is often called trigonometry, which kinda translates to the measurement of triangles, which is described above.</p>
<p>Here in South Africa, we have about 22 000 trig beacons across the country, and although they are not actively used anymore, they are always fun to try and hike to, since they are often on the highest points around, so there are great views to be had.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Australia recently spent a very decent amount of effort and money updating it's GPS data.They were a couple of decades old and not as accurate as they could have been. Turns out most of our trig points were 1 metre to the left of where they actually were.</p>
<p>Friend got a decent amount of work driving then hiking to lots of pretty sweet locations, setting up some equipment, hitting the on button and waiting.</p>
<p>Data scientists then mathhammered it all together and our maps and gps were updated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have them in the UK too. Here they're concrete plinths with a metal disc with three indentations on top. A theodolite (device for measuring angles and elevation) would be placed on top of this on a tripod and aimed at the trig points on nearby hills. They're marked on ordinance survey maps as a triangle with a for in the middle. I don't think I've ever seen one that wasn't at a local high point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was it a white base, with a black pole on top? The pole probably would have some black fins on it  </p>
<p>Edit: I just checked, and there's one on the ridge between Gansbaai and Franskraal, right on the edge on the mountain.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've got them in the UK in my town on the highest hills. 4 foot tall <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xe6bItWpbgY/WJh0hmQHqkI/AAAAAAAAI08/VW8UtgjDL-8xYSRf-IuAmW9UO9oRx0eMACLcB/s1600/v2-2040157-2.jpg" target="_blank">concrete blocks</a> with a<a href="https://trigpointinguk-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/079/P79905.jpg" target="_blank"> metal hole in the top</a>. As a kid my dad explained to me what they were (I imagined they were sleeping stone giants, if anyone remembers Earthfasts being on TV you'll understand). Slightly disillusioned I asked why they still needed to be there once the maps were made. I don't think I got an answer (my dad's a civil servant, not a cartographer).</p>
<p>So if anyone can answer that 20 year old question for me: Why did they need to be such permanent structures? Given that they were concrete and look similar to wartime anti-tank blocks I'd guess they were probably built early 20th century.</p>
<p>Were they just anticipating better technology coming along to make more accurate maps using the same points?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New buildings and roads need to be placed on the maps, and keeping the reference points around really helps.  Also, the points themselves will move a bit due to earthquakes, freeze thaw cycles, soils changing moisture content, floods, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a mapmaker, but from what I could figure out they were placed before GPS and similar systems, and were often used in land ownership conflicts. The government has a map that specifies where property lines begin and end, in context to &quot;permanent locations&quot; IE the beacons. It's easy for a farmer to slowly shift his fence over land, but you cant exactly move all the beacons around to the exact place they would need to be to show that the fence is in the right place.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: and when the inevitable collapse of society occurs, we can rebuild using them, since all the GPS satellites got lasered. Or something.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t speak for the UK, but in the US, we have similar objects (although they’re not several feet tall). They’re placed by the US Geological Survey at specific points where surveyors are able to get very good position fixes from the stars. They then serve as local fixed points when describing land ownership - if you can find one, you can then survey out the land using it as a fixed reference point. Most land surveying in the US refers back to at least one of them at some point.</p>
<p>Land in the East from Maine to South Carolina is done according to royal grants (which often contradicted themselves, oops), but most things west of the Appalachians were surveyed and platted under <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System" target="_blank">this system</a>. Yes, it’s complicated.</p></div>		</li>
