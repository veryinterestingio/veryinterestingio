			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to give a little more detail, in analyzing the water, they filter to concentrate particles in the virus-size range, then count the spots. By assuming the sample they melted is representative, they can can use the volume they melted and the particles counted to estimate the concentration of the viruses in the ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Too add a little more detail - the primary way they determine the viral species (and how they know that itâ€™s a newly discovered virus) is by sequencing segments of the collected DNA after concentrating the sample. They compare those segments to known genomes (they found already known viruses and bacteria as well) and filter the sequencing noise using a computational method. After all was said and done they also saw a number of hits that seem related enough to existing viruses to call it a novel virus.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A tiny detail worth mentioning - you're being showered with viruses all the time, there's tons of them in the air everywhere.  Most are 'not interested' in you and just land where they land, so the vast majority of these viruses are of no threat to anyone you know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big thank you to each of you for the details! Far too often, the articles or answers on other websites are way too high level, explaining these things as &quot;the scientists analyzed the ice for viruses&quot; and I just sit there thinking how TF do you analyze ice for micro/nanoscopic tiny AF nanobots (AKA viruses) and read the friggin MOLECULES of their DNA sequence?? Did they just sniff them out?? It's very unsatisfying to us curious folk.</p>
<p>Much appreciated. This is why /r/science is one of my top favorite subs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I think you could. The lab I worked in studied both viruses and bacteria in ice, and I only did the bacteria side, so I'm going on my discussions with my labmates who did the work on viruses. The lab only had intermittent access to a flow cytometer, so we did a lot of microscopy. But I think you could use flowcytometry, and think it would actually be best to use both: it's good to use two different methods, as they both have different drawbacks and error sources. If they agree, you can be fairly confident you're on the right track.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about preserving the ice-rods? Don't they keep samples of such from all around the world and from different depths (especially from the Antarctica)? </p>
<p>Do they need to melt them down too to check or do they have some other methods (such as taking a shaving from certain parts and inspecting them under microscopes or melting only the small part) to inspect the Ice?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do work similar to this, but not specifically with ice cores. With ice cores for microbiology, my understanding is that a second core samples the center of the first core. That way ice is preserved for future sampling if needed, and viral or bacterial samples are taken from the most &quot;pristine&quot; spot within the original core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nova has an amazing episode on the Chicxulub meteor impact. It involves rock cores but the core drilling and analysis part is worth a watch. Also seeing them lay the cores out in a line to study the layers as a whole is pretty cool.</p>
<p>Plus it's Nova, Nova is awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to know more abou might be interested in metagenomics. It's like genomics (the study of genetic material) but at a large scale. Basically, you take a cube millimeter of dirt (or ice) and you sample all the DNA and RNA in it. Then you analyse the results.</p>
<p>I had a friend who did this for French cheese. Pretty fun job</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same is true for anything that you'd want to sample. I do animal samples in which, for example, someone knows the animal died of something but it tested negative for every test available.  In that case, you'd do metagenomic sequencing to see if there was some novel or rare pathogen in there that there isn't a test for already.</p></div>		</li>
