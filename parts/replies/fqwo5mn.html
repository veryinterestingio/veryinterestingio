<p>While many places included occupation as family names. Naming systems were (and sometimes still are) actually a bit diverse around the world.</p>
<p>in Celtic paternal/maternal naming systems you have your surname derive from your father or mother, Mac or Mc being &quot;son of' or less common Na being &quot;daughter of&quot;, and eventually also included famous ancestors and septs (clans) with Ui or O' meaning &quot;descendant of&quot;.  -son as a suffix also functioned the same purpose in Nordic regions.</p>
<p>in many places, where you were from also functioned as a surname. Such as Leonardo da Vinci means Leonard &quot;of/from Vinci&quot;   </p>
<p>some places have different names for different periods in your life.
kunya in arabic are a type of nickname based the name of your children, Abu mean &quot;father /father of&quot;, so the name Abu Mohammad, means you are the father of Mohammad.</p>
<p>in Native American tribes, naming systems varied quite a bit, but it was common to have separate names for private and public life, and often had different names for being an adult verse a youth. some tribes would have an adult name based on a story or trait of about the individual, such an individual would be given the name Čháŋ Óhaŋ (Among the Trees) at birth, be called  Pȟehíŋ Yuȟáȟa (Curly) by his mother, and then as an adult be named Tȟašúŋke Witkó (Crazy Horse or ''His-Horse-Is-Crazy''). </p>
<p>Kennings (norse and celtic) like Alföðr (father of all) and Cúchulainn (Hound of Cullen) also function as names based on deeds or stories. </p>
<p>Cognomen (Roman) which were the third name after the surname (Gaius Julius Ceaser) was also like a kenning though it was inheritable and functioned to delineate families with the same name (i.e. different Julius families).</p>
<p>edit: grammar, spelling an roman examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Paternal naming systems are also common in Scandinavian names (Svensson: &quot;Sven's Son&quot;) and Welsh, where they either added an S to the end of the fathers name (Roberts, Williams, Jones) or added a B or P to the beginning of the father's name (Pritchard, Bowen, Price from Rhys, or Powell from Hywell).</p></div>		</li>
