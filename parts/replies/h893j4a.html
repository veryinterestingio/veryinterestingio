			<div class="markdown"><p>This combined with knowing the surrounding characters helps for words that someone knows in spoken Chinese but does not know or remember in written Chinese. It‚Äôs like reading the sentence ‚ÄúI have a pet _‚Äù and the blank rhymes with log. It‚Äôs easy to guess the blank must be dog even if you‚Äôve never seen that character. </p>
<p>Characters can also be made up of other characters (sort of) that can give hints about the meaning. Sometimes this means you can guess the meaning without knowing how it sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about an experiment on that in Japan some years back, in which people were shown &quot;invented&quot; characters that followed the normal rules of construction, but happened not to exist. Most people saw individual characters as having a degree of meaning, and there was a high degree of agreement on what the likely meanings were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Chinese/kanji dictionaries I've seen go by radical and stroke number. So you identify part of the character, and need to be proficient enough in the language that you can guess how many strokes it would take to write it. The internet has made handwriting search much easier, but see <a href="http://nihongo.monash.edu/cgi-bin/wwwjdic?1R" target="_blank">here</a> for an example of the old system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly right, but I would argue with your use of the word ‚Äòguess‚Äô. If you‚Äôre familiar with the radicals and stroke order, which you have to be to use a paper dictionary in the first place, it‚Äôs systematic and there‚Äôs no guessing involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that in these threads when people talk about &quot;radicals,&quot; they mean smaller parts of a certain character/ideogram. </p>
<p>Somebody more knowledgeable might correct some details here, but radicals are often the smallest meaningful part of a given character, and many times, they can stand on their own as a different (but not necessarily &quot;related&quot;) word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>chinese actually has something called pinyin which is basically the romanji of japanese (if you're more familiar with that)</p>
<p>essentially it's an 'alphabet' with the addition of those little accents on top of the word that described the general pitch.</p>
<p>as an example: moon in mandarin chinese is yu√® which would be broken up into 'yu' and 'e'. then you put the little accent emphasis and boom pronunciation</p></div>		</li>
