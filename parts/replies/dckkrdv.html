This would allow a check and balance that isn't there now.</p>
<p>The problem isn't that there is a secret court that protects secrets that need to be secret for the good of the nation. The problem is that we don't know if the secret court is used to protect secrets that their release would be good for the nation.</p></div>		</li>
