			<div class="markdown"><p>Option two is really great, too. It prevents the game from behaving erratically or causing weird glitches due to the excess clock speed. Just imagine trying to play a game that normally spawned enemies every 30 seconds of clock time when your own clock is running 1777% faster. Or trying to get into an event that happens every 10 minutes (on a day/night cycle, maybe), only to find that your clock speed makes it every 10 seconds. Oof!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is really important even for porting games. Famously, when Dark Souls 2 was ported to PC, weapon durability would degrade at twice the rate when the game ran at 60fps, as opposed to console 30fps. Funnily enough, From Software originally claimed that it was working as intended (which made no sense) and PC players had to fix it on their own. When the PS4/XBOne Schoalrs of the First Sin edition was released though, also running at 60fps, the bug was also present there, so From was finally forced to fix it...</p>
<p>Also, I remember when Totalbiscuit did a video on the PC version of Kingdom Rush, he discovered that it had a bug, where enemies would move based on your framerate, but your towers would only shoot at a fixed rate, so higher framerate basically meant higher difficulty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why Fallout Physics break at high FPS.</p>
<p>Just go look at 76 on release, you would literally run faster if you had a higher FPS.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes, Skyrim too and if they dont fix it technically any game on that engine will have the same issue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your knife damage was somehow bound to your framerate, Meaning higher frames equal more damage.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened too with Fallout. The engine was tied to the frame rate so you could uncap your frames, look at the ground and run like the Flash because your frames would be at 250.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny how this even plays into (somewhat) modern games. On older versions of the id engine, if you capped your FPS to certain values and your system could maintain them consistently, the game would allow you jump anywhere from 5-10% higher than others. Basic concept was that at certain values rounding errors would compound and calculate your jump speed as higher than it should be. Made the multiplayer interesting as some people would abuse this to skip &quot;checkpoints&quot; in the level. Ie, instead of needing to destroy a gate to get to an objective, you could just jump the wall and sneak in while the enemy team was trying to defend the gate.</p></div>		</li>

Playing the game without turbo was fine, but press turbo and the game would go into hyperdrive and you'd die almost instantly because no human could react that quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The button was made precisely to deal with these kind of issues; technically it's not a &quot;turbo&quot; button though, it actually slows down the processor to bellow it's normal speed, back to what older games expected, but calling it &quot;turbo&quot; was better for marketing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an example of how hardware can control game speed, we have Space Invaders. The aliens sped up due to a processor bottleneck that the player &quot;unblocked&quot; by killing aliens, freeing up processor bandwidth to calculate the movement of the other aliens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit of trivia from the old guard: the first run of DOS-era PCs ran at 4.77 MHz (yes, mega, not giga) and early games often used the clock speed to handle nearly <em>all</em> the timing in the game. When processors improved (to around 33 to 100 MHz when the Windows 3.1 era got into full speed), these older games would load faster, but everything else in the game was sped up as well.</p>
<p>This in turn led to a number of <a href="http://www.sierrahelp.com/Utilities/SlowdownUtilities.html" target="_blank">utilities designed to artificially slow down the CPU</a> to get the game to play correctly. (Nowadays, DOSBOX is capable of performing both functions -- emulation and timing fixes -- for most titles that need it.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember playing a DOS port of Rush'N Attack as a kid. It was designed for 4.77mhz and ran fine, until we upgraded to a 10mhz 80286 and the game ran so fast it was unplayable. This particular machine actually had 3 speed settings instead of the more normal two. 10, 8 and 6mhz. I turned it down to 6 and the game was still way too fast but I could sorta play it, but I tended to die in under  a minute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the Star Trek: 25th anniversary computer game and it was a little choppy on my old 286 but still playable. I still had it years later and installed it into a pentium system. You would get a cut scene and had to hover over the “Shields” button to not die in 2 seconds. Then the space combat was being done at what felt like Warp 9. Like you said, it was sorta  playable, but I tended to die quickly.</p></div>		</li>
