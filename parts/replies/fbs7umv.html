			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, so many people here trying to argue semantics by incorrectly stating an anti-inflammatory is a separate class of drug from analgesic. Any drug that relieves pain is an analgesic regardless of mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Analgesic = AN + ALG(ES) + IC </p>
<p>From Greek </p>
<p>An is not or without </p>
<p>Alg refers to pain </p>
<p>Ic is the form to make a noun into an adjective (which analgesic technically is) </p>
<p>So “analgesic” refers to the effect that removes pain and any painkiller falls into this category</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC there is some research that indeed shows that NSAIDs increase healing time but for most the additional comfort is worth it particularly because less pain can mean less stress.</p>
<p>So it’s not clear cut.</p>
<p>I’ll look later for links.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflammation is normally helpful. It's part of the healing process, it can prevent infection and make you heal faster.</p>
<p>However, sometimes stuff gets inflamed inappropriately (lupus and Rheumatoid arthritis are probably the most well known). Sometimes your body decides to inflamed the affected body part too much. Sometimes, the inflammatory response was 100% unnecessary.</p>
<p>Your body isn't consciously thinking &quot;how can I heal the fastest&quot; it's just a bunch of chemicals running around telling other parts of the body to do shit</p></div>		</li>
