			<div class="markdown"><p>And thermoplastics can usually be remolded a couple of times before the polymer chains degrade too far and the properties they were valued for (optical clarity, waterproof) become harder to achieve.  Plastic recycling can be done with a few plastics especially when you're changing form to a lower quality (like making bottles into plastic bags) but overall, it's a greenwashing scam that was put forth by the plastic companies to ensure their products would happily remain in production and everyone could feel <em>great</em> about it.  Most of the plastics you use daily will <strong>not</strong> be recycled, cannot be recycled.  Even if you toss it in the green bin.  Sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And what would be the alternative? Plastic coukd be very useful material in many uses and many industries. The root of the problem is that we are using material which could reused as one use only. Often because of oir lazyness as customers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how to describe thermoplastics best maybe like water? But the best way I've seen thermosetting described is like an egg. </p>
<p>A thermoset plastic acts like cooking an egg. Once you apply heat to the egg it changes there's no going back to a pre-cooked egg.</p>
<p>A thermoplastic maybe more like water. We can freeze it and make it take a solid form. We can apply heat to it, and it'll become liquid again. Allowing us to change the form again before letting it cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A thermoplastic is basically a load of chains which are all balled up and tangled with one another, a bit like when you get loads of cables tangled in a drawer. When they are cold, the chains are very well tangled together and can't move much. When you heat them up, they get more energy and the space between them expands until eventually they can move over one another. This is the glass transition temperature, basically the temperature at which a polymer becomes floppy and rubbery.</p>
<p>However, thermosets also have this transition. The difference is that if you keep heating a thermoplastic, eventually the chains fully entangle and they flow like a liquid. For amorphous (i.e. non-crystalline) polymers, this is different to melting because it happens gradually, and there isn't a sudden transition from liquid to solid at a set temperature. Some polymers can melt in the same way as ice does because they do have crystalline regions within them. In these cases, you'll see them go &quot;floppy&quot; when they get hot enough for the chains in the non-crystalline region to &quot;untangle&quot;, and then at a higher temperature, the crystals will melt like ice and the polymer will have a sudden decrease in viscosity.</p>
<p>Simplified picture, but hopefully helpful for visualisation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, I was trying to think of an example that would describe them better than &quot;it's a chemical change&quot; since it is ELI5. </p>
<p>Water is not the best example of a thermoplastic, as it is basically &quot;backward&quot; from how we handle plastics. The concept may be there but I still don't like it.     </p>
<p>Water turning to ice (and vice versa) = physical change = Thermoplastic       </p>
<p>A cooking egg = chemical change = thermoset plastic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever tried recycling plastic? (You can do it at home with a couple of tools, but do your research first)</p>
<p>It's not like water, it's a lot more viscous, more like Blu Tack. Getting it into the shape you want is an actual challenge. You can't just pour it into a mold because it doesn't pour.</p></div>		</li>

<p>“thermosetting” ones are made strong by complicated bonds that don’t break down with heat. They will catch fire first. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem isn't fire.<br />
If that were an issue you could simply remelt it in vacuum or in some type of inert gas.</p>
<p>The problem is that the material decomposes from heat.<br />
Aka. molceules in it get shaked apart by vibrating too much, before letting each other go. (Heat is basically a measure of how much energy is in the &quot;wiggling around&quot; of particles)</p></div>		</li>
