			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun is on the bigger end of the scale.  The vast majority (upwards of 75%) of stars are Red Dwarfs that are about half the Sun's mass or less.   </p>
<p>Yellow stars like the Sun are obviously smaller than the super-giants out there, but they're still in the top 80% or so of stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One method: We know how big the Sun is. We can assume all energy leaving the surface of the Sun is a result of the fusion at the core. We place a sensor at some distance from the Sun and measure all the particles, light, and radiation. We sum up all of that energy and consider the surface area of the sensor pad. The energy/unit area is the flux. We use the flux along with the distance of the sensor from the Sun to calculate the surface flux of the Sun. Now we know how much energy is coming off of the Sun, since we know the size of the Sun (Flux x Area = Total Energy). You can throw time into this to get a Flux rate and then an Energy rate (aka Power).</p>
<p>Now from experiments here on Earth we do know how much energy is released through the fusion of two hydrogen atoms. Total Energy/Energy per Fusion event = number of events. We also know much mass is converted into energy from the same fusion experiments (E=mc^2 - thanks Einstein!). Number of Fusion Events per unit time x Mass Lost per Event = mass loss per unit time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That figure is calculated. We know quite well how fusion happens not just from theory but from hydrogen bomb tests. By looking at the sun we can figure out how much energy it is outputting and from that determine how much material must be fusing. From the rate of fusion we know how much mass is being lost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d think we can go directly from energy output to mass loss, just from E=Mc^2 .  Then from there we can figure out how many H atoms are fusing into He etc. from our empirical knowledge of fusion reactions.</p></div>		</li>
