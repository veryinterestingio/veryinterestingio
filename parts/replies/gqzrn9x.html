<p>I like the first part of your answer.  Minor can also be yearning which is exactly happy but isn't sad either.  Minor keys are really interesting sounding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just a cultural thing. There was a time when minor wasn't &quot;sad&quot; but just &quot;having increased emotion&quot;.</p>

<p>I mean the problem is the simplification as teaching music as &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;sad&quot; when it should just be taught as bright or dark. Darker and brighter scales cover a range of feelings and it a lot more board than just calling a scale &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;sad&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
