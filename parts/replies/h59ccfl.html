			<div class="markdown"><p>All mammals basically derived from reptiles via a group called Synapsids. The current hypothesis is thst monotremes (which includes platypus and echidna) split off earlier from the Synapsids, which is why they retain a lot of ancestral reptilian traits such as laying eggs. On the other branch you have the other mammals, including thr marsupial and placental mammals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mammal and reptile lines split off a very, very long time ago, in the Carboniferous period, around 80 million years before the first dinosaurs even evolved. Our ancestors were the dominant land animals in the Permian, before dinosaurs took over for the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. But we have had our revenge!</p>
<p>Our ancestors way back then had already started to look like mammals, e.g. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgonopsia" target="_blank">these guys</a>. Platypi (platypuses?) and the other monotremes diverged from the marsupial/placental mammal line first, but still relatively recently (before the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs, though). All mammal ancestors prior to that point likely laid eggs like platypuses (platypi)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Asexually reproducing species of reptiles are actually a lot more common than people realize! It certainly isn't as common as sexual reproduction, but we have a lot of examples. A lot of research suggests that at least some asexual species originated as natural hybrids of two related species (Such as Aspidoscelis neomexicanus, which is fully asexual and is believed to be a long since established hybrid between A. inornatus and A. tigris, whose ranges overlap).</p>
<p>The genus of lizards Darveskia also has several parthenogenic species, as does another whiptail genus, Cnemoidophorus. There is increasing research about various snake species, including garters and some boas and pythons.</p>
<p>My personal favorite is Lepidodactylus lugubris, the mourning gecko. I started with 4 geckos two years ago and now I have well over a hundred-- and that's just the ones I have found in the terrariums. All female, with definite social interactions, they talk a lot. Super fun animals. The downside is that because they reproduce so well, they're been introduced to just about all of the tropics. But in captivity, that makes them super fun.</p></div>		</li>
