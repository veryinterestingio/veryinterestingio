			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, wolves were generalists too by season and not obligate carnivores, although, unlike us, can usually subsist on just meat like we can rice and beans, its not ideal. Dogs that came from those wolves kept eating more and more human friendly foods yet they haven't adjusted their diets by capability or abstention from smelling certain toxins as they evolved and migrated with us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. They’re mesocarnivores (as opposed to cats, who are hypercarnivores).</p>
<p>The different grades of carnivore and the question of where, exactly, on that sliding scale you draw a line and say “this is omnivore now” is a bit intensive of a discussion for an ELI5 about plant toxins.</p></div>		</li>
