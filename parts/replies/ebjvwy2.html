			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really.  There is a length where the loss of hair is approximately equal to the rate that it is being replaced at.  That's when it appears to stop growing.</p>
<p>When you shave it, it's all now below that length, so it all appears to grow, while in truth, it was growing all along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you still have the same number of hair follicles.  Unfortunately, you generally can't do anything to increase that number, there may be cosmetic tricks that you can do to make it appear thicker... but that's outside my area of expertise.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your hair is constantly cycling between growing, not growing and falling out. When it's long, the amount it grows on a daily basis is pretty small and longer hairs have a tendency to fall out, so it doesn't seem like it's growing. When you cut it short, it grows a lot more compared to how long it is.</p>
<p>Shaving may cause hair to grow more if you get irritation, though. The irritation causes increased blood flow, which triggers growth and bypasses your body's signals to grow hair since they just increase blood flow to the hair. This is what rogaine does.</p></div>		</li>
