If I want to whitelist my contact list, I need to pay extra per month.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And fixing that is a technological problem which is entirely in the remit of the ITU. So why aren't they doing it?</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Fixed-line termination rates are below 1 Â¢/min. The providers are free to negotiate termination rates as long as they are symmetric.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, you're an American telephone company who's been losing money on wireline telephone services for the past 20 years, service that you're federally mandated to provide by U.S. telecommunications law. Mobile phones and internet services are where most of the money is being made, but that doesn't mean you want to stop making millions of dollars terminating calls from VOIP providers being used by scammers.</p>
<p>All they have to do is change the VOIP caller-id protocol, and put in a feedback mechanism for regular users to report bogus calls back to the telco. If a VOIP provider exceeds a certain threshold of BS calls without taking action, they get disconnected. Easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thankfully, they've been doing more to stop it lately than they ever had before. Back in 2019 we signed a law that allows a lot of calls to be marked as &quot;spam risk&quot; or something similar, which was previously not permitted. If done correctly, deregulation can make some things a lot better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you just described is an example of just changing the regulations, not deregulation. But you're right, some deregulation cab be okay. I just wish politicians and people would be extremely specific when they say &quot;deregulation&quot; because most of the time, &quot;deregulation&quot; either hurts consumers or the environment in favor of large corporations or private interests.</p></div>		</li>
