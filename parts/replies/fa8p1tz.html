			<div class="markdown"><p>This exactly. If you built a spacecraft with an active nuclear reactor, the waste heat from it very well could kill the entire crew, melt the electronics and structure, etc, if the craft was not carefully designed to radiate that heat out to space and not let it flow into the crew compartment or spaces for equipment not designed for high heat.</p>
<p>We have never built a spacecraft with any really high-heat machinery, but it's been theorized that if we did, it might be a good idea to have two separate radiator/heat management systems - one for radiating away high-temperature heat from a reactor or huge laser or something, and another for getting rid of lower-temperature heat from the crew compartment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd definitely want separate circuits for that - you want each to radiate its heat away at as high a temperature as possible to minimise the radiator area (and thus mass). However, what might be worthwhile, depending on what temperature your reactor operates at and how efficient it is, is to use a heat pump to boost the room-temperature waste heat from the life support cooling circuit to that of the reactor's cooling loop (or do the same for the giant laser, where you'd likely be able to get even greater savings in radiator area due to lasers being typically very inefficient).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know Avatar isn't the bastion of science, but the interstellar ship they show briefly near the beginning is a good example of what you describe.</p>
<p>Essentially a giant radiator glowing orange like a toaster at the rear, and about 2 km ahead on a truss is the living area.  About 90% of the mass of the craft is radiator.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But clearly from the real-world example of the ISS, the radiators don't need to be 90% of the ship, and you need substantially larger solar panels.</p>
<p>edit: missed the interstellar part, obviously no solar panels needed if you're not near a sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More energy, more radiators. The ship in Interstallar is supposed to have a powerful engine, so naturally the radiators are big. The OP's question is specifically about nuclear rockets, and all the realistic fusion-powered ships are mostly radiator and fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Avatar's ISV Venture Star is actually not a bad example to cite.  You could say that the design of the ISV Venture Star is a crazy design that includes the things that a smartly designed ship would have.  That's not to say it is by any means realistic, just that Cameron gave it a lot more thought than an electric stove top heating element.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cool writeup by someone.  What I find interesting is that the ship needs the unobtanium they mine to be able to handle the heat and contain the matter/anti matter reaction that powers the engines, and to form the plume out the engines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that be a waste of energy though?</p>
<p>Wouldn't a better idea be to funnel the energy and use many thermoelectric generators, it's not efficient, but at least you wouldn't be wasting energy. In space you rarely use your thrusters. I guess weight would be a concern with thermoelectric generators.</p>
<p>For the ISS a thermoelectric generator isn't really that necessary, but I know on Voyager there is a generator. When you have time on your side, why waste energy unless you have to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thermoelectric generators require a temperature difference to function. Hot on one side, cold on the other. The sunlight can provide a heat source, but for the cold side you would need to get rid of the waste heat somehow, and that is what radiators accomplish.</p>
<p>I haven't personally run the numbers on using thermoelectric generators instead of solar panels, but I assume it is more mass-efficient to use solar panels for power generation.</p></div>		</li>
