<p>I think my main question is surrounded by your third paragraph regarding the pressure wave rupturing soft organs. Is it just simply there's so much force that they get popped like a water balloon? So this massive energy force collides with something that cannot resist it and just gets separated at like an atomic level? </p>
<p>That's just how I'm understanding it in my tiny little brain haha</p></div>		</li>

<p>When an explosion goes off, the enormous pressure differential just hits you like an invisible fist. You don't scatter into your component atoms but your soft bits don't hold together very well under that kind of force. They just tear, rupture and suffer other damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I had a reddit award to give you, but I think you've literally answered this question to a level that I can understand. </p>
<p>Case closed on my end, thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine hitting a bag of eggs with a baseball bat.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The outside of the bag will probably look fine, but the eggs inside also recieve the force, and break.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With most explosions, separation occurs at a macro level - it'll burst blood vessels, or organs will be broken apart.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Separation at an atomic level generally requires that the tissue has been turned into gas - vaporised.  This occurs in high energy explosions, such as nuclear explosions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gas doesnt explode, it conflagrates, or burns really fast.</p>
<p>Exploding isn't caused by fire, its caused by a chemical reaction, that puts off so much heat, in such a short time, that it heats the air around it, which becomes an extremely high pressure, and &quot;pushes&quot; outward.  Typically the container is made to easily break into a million little fragments to do more damage, but anything thats near the bomb will usually blow apart and become shrapnel</p>
<p>Bombs often do cause some fires, the super heated air can catch some things like wood on fire, but they are usually pretty small right after the bomb, as the air expanding creates a small vacuum in the area, which starves the fires of oxygen.  So a bomb puts out a lot of the fires it starts.</p></div>		</li>
