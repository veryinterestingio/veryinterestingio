			<div class="markdown"><p>It would, of course, be possible to suspend the rules in an emergency situation.... but in this specific case it's probably not safe to do so</p>
<p>And in any case it makes more sense to fly oxygen-producing equipment to India. &quot;Give a man a fish...&quot; and all that: a machine that can produce a tank of oxygen every day is better than a single tank of oxygen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, no.  IATA would have to be the body that did that and it is a very time consuming thing to change the regs.  It is not as simple as just saying, &quot;Oxygen cylinders are good to go.&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You then have to come up with a way to secure them that satisfies the air carriers that the risk has been mitigated (good luck), and get them to approve the change</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Further, the Captain of each individual aircraft still has final say over the manifest.  If he sees something he doesn't like, he can order it removed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genuine question, are military transports required to follow IATA regulations? They would surely want to follow them in normal time but I would guess that they have their own systems to be more flexible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of that is insurmountable - IATA don’t have to change the rules, they can suspend a rule if they wish for a humanitarian emergency. And I’m sure you could find a pilot willing to take the risk on a cargo flight (probably not pax)</p>
<p>More importantly, as another commenter noted, military flights are not bound to IATA rules</p></div>		</li>

<p>the trick is in the &quot;explain&quot; bit, we have a high bar for comments. If you want answers that are shorter and less complete you can try r/answers or r/nostupidquestions.</p></div>		</li>
