			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah competition is important. If there was one car company in the whole country, and there was somehow a car shortage, and they responded by increasing the price of their cars 20x, <em>that</em> would be price gouging</p></div>		</li>

<p>Where are you putting the gas? Not everyone already owns a car. </p>

<p>Used car prices have skyrocketed over the course of a couple months. Much more than new cars.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But there are still a whole spectrum of prices, including dirt cheap beaters available at the lower end of the market. Not being able to afford the car you WANT and having to go for something less nice is unfortunate, but unless every single car on the used market is suddenly $100k overnight due to a shortage, it’s not the same as price gouging on fuel.</p></div>		</li>
