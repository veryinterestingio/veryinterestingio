			<div class="markdown"><p>Cars with power steering generally have a different steering ratio and steering geometry that makes them hard to steer when the power steering fails.  </p>
<p>The car with power steering will take less turns of the wheel to go from lock to lock and there will usually be more caster angle which makes them harder to steer but increases self-centering.  </p>
<p>If you have 2 of the same model of car, one that came from factory with power steering and the other didn't, the one that never had it will be much easier to steer than the one with power steering if the power steering is not functioning.  </p>
<p>Old trucks and buses without power steering are hard work but the large wheel and the steering gear ratio makes it manageable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised the real answer is so far down.</p>
<p>Only way to turn a big vehicle without power steering, while sitting, is a big horizontal wheel.</p>
<p>We're stronger in push/pull than we are in raise/lower, and a vertical wheel that large doesn't fit if the driver has legs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lol. Now I'm picturing a bus being steered by a giant ship's wheel. Possibly by a retired pirate who wants to pick up some spending money and spend time near his grandson</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former bus driver here: this is what I was taught as the correct answer as well.</p>
<p>The first buses I trained on had much bigger and more horizontal wheels than the modern Nova buses, with a very light touch. We were trained to drive push/pull, and taught that this helped prevent repetitive motion injuries. Which I discovered to be true, as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You stand on a ship, so your legs aren't in the way.</p>
<p>You can stand off to the side in order to push/pull the top if you need more leverage.</p>
<p>Also allows you to put 2 people on it, one on either side.</p>
<p>Can't forget that a vertical wheel takes up less deck space, and room is always a concern.</p>
<p>The modern ones that use hydraulics can be much smaller, but the shape and angle has stuck around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My background is in aircraft dressing (edit: design but that was funny), where we design different types of controls for lots of reasons. But my understanding is that in ships the wheel is vertical so that it can be controlled by two sailors for exceptional cases like rough weather, damaged rudder and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, ships don't need to turn as fast (moving the rudder quickly isn't going to make a big ship turn on a dime). So ships have higher turn ratios, and they often had spots for a second guy to help turn it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. </p>
<p>The other answers claiming it’s about the driver’s position, relative to the front axle, have apparently forgotten that adjustable/telescoping steering columns have existed for decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These use multi-axis couplings that are engineered to meet the durability requirements for the vehicles they’re installed in, and yes, that includes heavy vehicles and machinery. You see adjustable columns on lots of new farm equipment, for that reason.</p>
<p>Source: I work for a company that builds them.</p>
<p>Non-adjustable columns are still used in semi-trucks and buses as a design safety choice. At highway speeds, you want the driver to be able to safely stop the vehicle, in the event of a power-assist steering failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, at a minimum nobody uses <em>solid</em> metal shafts any more.  Telescoping is required.</p>
<p>... Because otherwise you have a large metal spike with one end near the ground at the front of the car, and the other end distressingly close to your face and/or torso.  Not recommended in case of collision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't use flexible shaft sections!?? It's a single U joint that connects the steering assembly to the intermediate shaft, with a locking mechanism to keep the wheel in whatever tilt position you've set it. Not a big deal. <a href="https://s19526.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Electric-Power-Steering-System-Service-Feature.jpg" target="_blank">This is a nice graphic</a></p>
<p>If that sort of joint fails under any amount of torque you can apply by steering, either the joint was made from poor quality metal, or your power steering was FUBAR and somehow massively over torqued things. Not that the second of those will be of a concern for buses, since most of those will use hydraulic power steering rather than electric. The assist torque shouldn't even effect the joint, it's applied near the axle instead. </p>
<p>Infact this exact mechanism probably exists in most new buses. All the ones in my city have a tilt mechanism and you'll frequently see drivers use that to get in and out of the seat more easily. </p>
<p>The flexible part of a modern steering column has to do with compression. In a collision the whole thing acts as a shock absorber because it turns out a solid metal shaft placed directly in front of the driver is a pretty dangerous thing</p></div>		</li>
