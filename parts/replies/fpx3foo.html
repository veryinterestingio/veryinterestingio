<p>Edit: I may be wrong, so please correct me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>Yes: A coma patient is feed intravenously and doesn't poop.</p>
<p>No: They still pee and need a catheter.</p>
<p>It's not a good thing, though. Even after a fairly short while of disuse your digestive system can be hard to jump start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People can still poop when they stop eating ...though much less . 1/3 of your stool is bacteria, 1/3 dead cells lining the gut, 1/3 random things you swallowed. So even with IV feeding , still lots of poop!</p>
<p>Source: help manage IV feeding (TPN) and have seen just how much poop continues to pour out from people who are not eating anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but much of the waste is also from dead cells that the body has disposed of due to them reaching their natural end-of-life.  Much of your feces is old dead blood cells in addition to the food you ate.</p></div>		</li>
