			<div class="markdown"><p>I could recommend some dry textbooks (Kandell Principles of Neuroscience or Strogatz Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos), or some foundational academic papers (like Hodgkin and Huxley's original work in modeling the squid axon action potential or Izhikevich's neural excitability, spiking, and bursting ).
But instead I'll recommend an awesome piece of work at the meeting of AI, philosophy, mathematics and neuroscience. Douglas Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach, The Eternal Golden Braid. It's pretty weird, but it's one of my favorites on systems thinking and conciousness.
Also, a little drier, but still very interesting - Prerational Intelligence: Adaptive behavior and intelligent systems without symbols and logic.</p></div>		</li>
