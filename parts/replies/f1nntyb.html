<p>Edit: I have been corrected, he didn’t try to fence it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically Peruggia claimed that he was repatriating it to Italy, which he claimed was the rightful home of Da Vinci's masterpiece. (Though he was wrong about it being stolen by Napoleon; Da Vinci gifted it to the King of France centuries before Napoleon.) He wasn't some grubby art thief looking to fence a painting; he was an Italian patriot.</p>
<p>Peruggia just insisted on being handsomely rewarded for his selfless patriotism.</p>
<p>And he got pinched while patriotically negotiating the ransom he wanted for the Mona Lisa.</p></div>		</li>
