			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I understand it, it's more like a roadway with a fixed width, and multiple cars trying to use it at the same time.</p>
<p>In real roads, we have them divided into lanes that are much wider than the cars that drive on them. If cars could drive perfectly, we could make the lanes narrower, but we provide that extra buffer just in case a car ever swerves a bit, or hugs one side of its lane too closely.</p>
<p>So too we do with WiFi channels - a device will try to operate on a specific frequency, but it will be allocated a whole lane of frequencies around that target just in case (AKA a <em>band</em>, this is where the term <em>bandwidth</em> comes from). Wi-Fi has many channels, but a lot of those channels have overlapping bands. 2.4GHz Wi-Fi has 14 channels, but <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NonOverlappingChannels2.4GHzWLAN-en.svg" target="_blank">only 4 of them can be used at a given time with ample enough spacing to eliminate interference</a> (or 3 in North America, I believe because government activity brushes up against the highest channels and thus they are restricted). 5GHz Wi-Fi has 129 channels labeled 36 to 165, but only 23 devices can be connected at the same time with ample spacing.</p>
<p>You can connect more devices than these limits, but signal quality will start to dive quite drastically if any of the devices try to talk at the same time, which is very likely. Likewise, you <em>could</em> create a road where the lanes are smaller than the cars -- as long as two cars in adjacent lanes don't try to use the road at the same time it will be fine, but if they do, they will start crashing into each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah exactly, the bands are selected so that they are the resonant frequencies, but since all devices are imperfect they give a little leeway, which is termed as bandwidth.</p></div>		</li>
