			<div class="markdown"><p>The poster seems to be referring to a “first psychotic break [from reality]” that happens when one develops a “psychotic disorder.” A psychotic disorder is a specific group of disorders in the DSM-V, primarily schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. </p>
<p>These includes “positive” meaning hallucinations and/or delusions, and/or “negative” meaning the lack of something major needed to function like awareness and knowing who you are, cognition, sentence formulation, etc. </p>
<p>A psychotic disorder would only be diagnosed by a doctor or therapist. It is much different from the state of using recreational drugs or situational depression for example. </p>
<p>Another category in The DSM is “mood disorders.” You may have “psychotic features” with these disorders but it is rare. </p>
<p>Psychotic disorders usually happen in the early 20s. The reason for someone staying in a psychotic state without being treated might be  estrangement from family, family ignorance, misunderstanding and/or deliberately ignoring what is going on for example. </p>
<p>Also, many people stop taking their antipsychotic medications for various reasons such as side effects or poor memory. There may be barriers to care like lack of doctors in area and lack of funds.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The below poster did a good job of characterizing psychosis.  It’s a specific DSM definition.  Not really sure what else to say on that.  </p>
<p>This is the first I have ever heard of this reproducibility crisis which seems to mainly be related to social science applications.  I am unsure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basics of the reproducibility crisis come down the the fact that the common P value of 0.05 will naturally generate a lot of false positives (hence why everything both causes and prevents cancer according to some study somewhere), and then limited sample populations and the natural human biases of researchers can worsen that effect. It certainly is not limited to the social sciences and psychology and medicine are in fact likely to be among the worst affected due to the fact that the research is performed on humans. </p>
<p>A reasonable answer to /u/PronouncedOiler's question would be whether a meta-analysis of a large number of studies has been able to show that this effect is consistently demonstrated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Essentially the psychotic state does permanent damage. The longer they spend in psychosis, the worse the effect. As well, future episodes further degrade their cognitive ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have any references for this? As far as I have learned, this kraepelinian neurodegeneration hypothesis is not well substantiated. It's important to substantiate it as well, because such a message evokes anxiety, hopelessness and pessimism in the very subjects we are talking about.</p>
<p>The understanding I have learned is that there are indeed drops in cognitive functioning but that to a very large extent these are confined to the time around the first episode and a bit before it.</p></div>		</li>
