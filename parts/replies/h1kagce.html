			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a muscular abnormality in my eyes that causes them to basically be unfocused by default. Seeing...anything... is a conscious effort. Always. Forever. It's not a very fun game. My eyes and brain are tired all the time.  </p>
<p>Though i can basically manually change my depth of field by focusing on things at different distances. It's interesting, but still not that useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this same problem. I work on computers everyday and would often get headaches. Apparently, each eye focuses independently, and one of my eyes worked better than the other and compensated for it. Well according to my eye doctor, my good eye is tired of compensating for the other, so it loses focus for both, causing me to strain and get headaches. I now only wear glasses while working to help focus and not make my eyes strain and stay headaches free. 100% recommend.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! Can someone tell us if this makes sense?
I know that they can test your vision after giving you some drops that inhibit the focusing muscle, so the idea should exactly be to measure your eye when your muscles are not focusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The drops don't inhibit the muscles that focus your eyes. They only dilate (open up) your iris so the doctor can see inside your eyes through your pupil better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first part is incorrect. While the dilating drops do enlarge your pupils, they also have a secondary effect which is paralyzing your focusing muscle. This is why near vision can be very blurry for people after the dilation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I received a free exam to see if I was a candidate for LASIK, my doctor put drops on my eyes which I think she said would relax my muscles and therefore make focusing difficult for 24rs. I think she said this gave her a more accurate measurement of my prescription when my eyes werenâ€™t strained. I literally could not focus on things near or far from me.  Focusing returned to normal after 24 hrs. It was pretty interesting</p></div>		</li>
