			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose that was why - urine is pretty corrosive, right? I was only a kid the last time I saw them, and remember at one point being told that they were nickel (which, when I was writing that last night, I decided must have meant nickel-plated). </p>
<p>Though maybe they were stainless steel? </p>
<p>How concerned about allergens were they in the 1920s?</p>
<p>I really don't know. If someone on Reddit knows more about the history of medical instruments than I do, I'd welcome more information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nickel plated tools are used to this day for their corrosion resistance, though they may be falling out of favor for the allergy issue. That said, nickel allergies aren't an immediately dangerous problem in an operating theater most of the time to my knowledge, though uncomfortable for the patient afterwards. Nickel allergies do get dangerous when considering implants though, like a catheter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nickel is one of the most common and readily available element for corrosion resistance. Aluminum is just as resistant, if not more so, but it wasn’t easily produced until relatively modern times and it was still costly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an interesting contrast. I suppose the fundamentals of <em>manipulating</em> the body, as with working with wood or metals, haven’t changed all that much, because the body hasn’t changed either. It’s just that we have a much better understanding now of what’s going on inside, and why we might need to get in there and do things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a tricky topic because those tools are likely from before the bronze age collapse. Had the bronze age collapse not happened we may be far further ahead technologically today, than we really are. History unfortunately is not a smooth upwards progression, including technological history. The dark ages were called the dark ages for a reason, and medieval times were horrifically stagnant compared to the bronze age.</p></div>		</li>
