			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to semantics, fear and disgust are very similar but to me disgust is less about a rational fear and more of a subconscious fear. Take cockroaches for example, they can't harm you, but they can look similar to things that can, like spiders or scorpions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also really don’t like ants and will avoid plants that are covered in them. I believe the leading theory is that their trunks are very sensitive and they dislike the sensation of ants crawling on them. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i had an ant crawl on me a few days ago. it got pissed for some reason and started biting me. tiny ant, not one of the big ones with big teeth. tiny little one, pavement ant i think Americans call them.</p>
<p>it did hurt, in the inner side of my elbow. i bet lots of ants biting your sensitive trunk, crawling inside it and biting the inside and you cant get them out easy cause no hands, would suck.</p></div>		</li>
