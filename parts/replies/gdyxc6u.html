			<div class="markdown"><p>Treatment sure. Cure? No. Its damaged DNA. You can figure out ways to kill off or remove the damaged ones, and some work exceptionally well against specific cancers, but ultimately it's a DNA malfunction linked with a growth alteration that causes it. Eventually we will get better at treating them and mortality will continue to decline, but there never will be a single cure or treatment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>from a certain point on, that'll pretty much be a distinction without a difference. Right now we're just getting accustomed to wearables which monitor your vitals and have readily available statistics (not to mention feed into giant databases) â€” it's not hard to imagine a future when all kinds of diseases will be caught so early that what they'll need will feel like nothing more than a minor adjustment along the way, similar to today's &quot;Hey, it looks like you have a small vitamin X defficiency, better take this for the next couple of months.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Question is, is an automated Treatment a Cure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine the only way to have a single cure for all types of cancers is through the use of nanomachines.  Imagine if you could inject thousands of controllable machines, each no larger than a red blood cell, and control exactly what and where they attack.  Like a game of Asteroids, except with cancer cells.</p>
<p>Give it a century or two.</p></div>		</li>
