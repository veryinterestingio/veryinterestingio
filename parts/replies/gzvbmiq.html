			<div class="markdown"><p>It creates a waste disposal issue whereby a highly secure storage area needs to keep radioactive refuse away from people and the environment for 10,000 to 100,000 years. It's manageable, sure, but those are the timescales of hundreds of civilizations, so as you can imagine, it becomes a huge management issue and not really sustainable. That said, I'm still in favor of using it, but I thought you should know the issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly thought that green was a terminology meant to refer to energy sources that don't emit greenhouse gasses in the process of functioning. But I guess it makes sense for it to have the broader meaning of how negatively something effects the environment.</p>
<p>Lastly, I get that storing nuclear waste is a big issue, but would everyone still be talking about this issue that nuclear faces if Obama hadn't canned the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste facility?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;green&quot; is typically interpreted to mean &quot;renewable&quot; and nuclear energy, while very very clean relative to fossil fuel, isnt technically renewable.</p>
<p>also, the anti-nuclear propoganda has done a number on our willingness to trust nuclear energy not to blow up or irradiate everything.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thankfully the product created is more akin to hydrogen+ carbon dioxide not a product like gasoline, or worse, diesel which indeed contain a ton of other extremely toxic elements.</p></div>		</li>
