			<div class="markdown"><p>The spring return system is the source of the infamous Super Bounces in Halo 2 multiplayer. Certain areas of the maps you could fit into crouched, but not standing; you could use this to preload the springs to INSANE levels of force, as the game would register your head against a wall while your feet were in terrain and had to keep pushing harder and harder to get you out. When you walked out on your own, that force was remembered and when you clipped back into a part that required you to be sprung back out, it released the remembered force and sent you to the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you understood how the glitch worked, you knew you could trigger it on pretty much any edge to a surface with the right drop angle for multibouncing. </p>
<p>That little metal piece on the ground that holds the flag? Bounceable. The edge of the rock in between two buildings that is no mans land if you miss the bounce? Bounceable. Conveyor belt edge down at the bottom of the map but enemy spawn just across the chasm? Bounceable. I spent wayyy too many hours having wayyy too much fun superbouncing through ranked lobbies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could actually just keep superbouncing on the same spot over and over again.  Going higher and higher.  Gaining more and more speed from the fall.</p>
<p>My favorite example of this was on headlong near the OS spawn by the water.  There were these 3 tree planters right along the waters edge.  If you bounced off all 3 in a row, you could get on top of the tallest buildings in headlong.  Some of them were so high that bullets shot from the sniper would disintegrate before reaching anyone within the normal bounds of the map.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was playing old school Daggerfall on PC. It was the early days of procedurally developed dungeons. So, I went into some dungeon, it had some really tough bad guys, so I saved (if you didn't save you were screwed). Then another pack so i saved again. Then, uh oh, my last save beyond that was like a week old.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the cave there was some puzzle door, which didn't have an alternative route to get out. Meaning I was stuck, and would have to lose a week of progress to get out of the cave. </p>
<p>Luckily, you could just jump like crazy in slanted hallways and clip through the top of the cave. So, I could walk on top of the tunnels in the 'void' and once I got that done I was able to find my way out pretty easily. Saved my ass a ton of frustration.</p>
<p>TLDR: fought bugs with bugs. I think some other glitch caused me to quit later on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar glitch with GTA:SA where you can send cars flying across the map. Parking a monster truck tire on the hood of a car adds up physics interactions every frame then applies them all at once when the player interacts with the cars hitbox (aka getting into it).</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;What did you do at work today, honey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I jumped up and down at the same spot all day, because there's some way to do it that makes the player fall through the earth and then the game crashes.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then the engineers get this video where some dude managed to jump and fall infinitely through the ground.</p>
<p>And you go &quot;How the hell did you manage to do that?&quot; Trying it yourself doesn't seem to do anything. You jump in that same spot yourself over and over but never fall through the ground. So you close the ticket as &quot;Can't Reproduce.&quot;</p>
<p>Then overnight it gets opened again with another repro that's equally impossible to perform. And you start wondering how easy it would be to just program a keylogger that records and replays inputs exactly.</p>
<p>And then of course QA gives you tickets that go &quot;Hey something weird happened but idk why&quot; and you get to figure it out yourself. So it's have a little sympathy for QA and the engineers. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why the swingset in GTA IV would launch your car a mile through the air? Because of the &quot;springs&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. So there's two ways it can happen.</p>
<p>One is that the spring gets stretched too far. Springs pull back harder the farther you pull them, right? In real life, you pull too far, they break. On a computer when it's a made up spring, they just <em>keep getting stronger</em>. So a lot of times when the simulation gets in an &quot;impossible&quot; state, it tries to &quot;snap&quot; back all at once, and it's like releasing one of those water balloon launchers.</p>
<p>The other is when things collide too fast and end up in an &quot;impossible&quot; state. Like the car was going too fast and ran through the parts of the swingset. The game realizes this is wrong, but it can't figure out where either the car or the swings should actually be. So one part of the logic is adding springs to the car to move it one way, another part is adding them to the swings to move them another way... and it just piling up until suddenly it <em>is</em> enough to untangle everything and the car launches.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything in a game physics engine is modeled as shapes connected by springs. So when a dead soldier ragdolls, each piece of his arms/legs/torso is a shape, and the &quot;joints&quot; are like you tied them together with rubber bands.</p>
<p>The &quot;spring&quot; model of collisions extends this idea to places where things aren't connected but just touching. Instead of floating right through a wall when you get blown up by grenade, there is <em>temporarily</em> a spring pushing you away from the wall that is strong enough to keep you from going through it. When you back back and stop trying to going through the wall, the spring is removed.</p>
<p>The swingset is likely buggy because it is interacting on lots of systems at once. You have a lot of small geometry that is being modeled by the physics engine as a chain of springs (the swings, so they act like, you know, swings), and a fast-moving, much large object (a car) that intersects them. Additionally, the swingset itself is locked to the ground, so it can't just slide itself out of the way like another car would -- the swings have to <em>swing</em> clear, <em>and</em> the car has to move. So all of the logic to &quot;fix&quot; the collision for each individual piece of the swings just keeps fighting with the logic to model the swings and making it worse. The more &quot;constraints&quot; you apply to this problem at once (impossible collisions, stuff stuck in the ground , multiple linkages connected together), the harder it gets.</p></div>		</li>
