			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my mom is dyslexic in English, but not in Chinese. </p>
<p>It might be worth differentiating between Chinese (a symbol language) and, say, Korean, or Japanese hiragana/katakana, which are alphabets. Japanese in general (including kanji) would be a mix of symbols and alphabet. </p>
<p>I wonder if there's any difference between the way people have dyslexia experience it with these languages.</p>
<p>Edit: lol this is basically what the economist link says haha</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hangeul (script used by Koreans) is. Hiragana and Katakana are syllbaries though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh, Japanese writing isn't an alphabet as we who are used to the Latin script (or those who are used to the Cyrillic script) are used to.</p>
<p>Japanese katakana and hiragana are both syllabic writing systems. That is each character represents a specific complete syllable; e.g. &quot;マ&quot; is the complete syllable &quot;ma&quot;, and &quot;モ&quot; is &quot;mo&quot;. In an strict alphabet, like the Latin alphabet you can see we have specific characters to represent the /m/ consonant sound, as well as the vowel /a/ and /o/ sounds, whereas katakana (which is what was shown) has two distinct characters for the complete &quot;ma&quot; and &quot;mo&quot; consonant-vowel combinations. (Hiragana works the same.)</p>
<p>What gets more complicated, is that Japanese also uses the Chinese <em>hànzì</em> logograms (called &quot;kanji&quot; by the Japanese) mixed with with the two kana (syllabographic) scripts in their writings. O f course you already mentioned that Japanese uses the kanji logograms, but it bears repeating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Korean hangul meanwhile, is a weirdass, but very cool, mix of alphabet and syllabary. Namely, there are distinct consonant and vowel symbols in hangul, but they are combined into single character syllables. Imagine basically, taking the different letters of each syllable in a word and stacking them on top of each other, top to bottom; that's how hangul works. (Although for English that is a terrible idea, because we've kinda of got &quot;eh, fuck it&quot; with keeping sounds associated with specific letters. This would be more appropriate for a language where the spoken and written forms haven't diverged so much.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, what is a very interesting script to ask about, but which we are unable to know the answer to because it's speakers have long since died out, is the speakers of the various languages that used cuneiform several thousand years prior.</p>
<p>My own experience with cuneiform and those scripts is Akkadian (the language of the Babylonians), where there are multiple cuneiform signs that represent the same phonetic value, meanwhile cuneiform signs <em>also</em> have logographic meanings. For example the sign &quot;?&quot; is a logogram meaning: the god Anu, the word for sky &quot;šamû&quot;, the particle that clarifies the next word as being a God (both as a silent determinative, and as the proposition &quot;il-&quot;). It also is the syllabogram for &quot;an&quot; and the syllabogram for &quot;il&quot;.</p>
<p>It would be extremely interesting to know how dyslexia would have worked for the speakers of Akkadian. Then again, general literacy at the time was low, enough so that King Ashurbanipal being able to read and write made him famous, <em>for being able to read and write</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine there would be. Just anecdotal to those I know, but I believe dyslexia can do rather well with Latin as well. My reasoning is that word order doesn't matter in Latin so much as conjugation. The words themselves contain more information. </p>
<p>Think of it like base ten (our language) versus hex (Latin). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a dyslexic who's always been curious in learning foreign languages it makes me wonder then why they say Spanish is the easiest foreign language for a Native English dyslexic to learn. </p>
<p>It would seem then these Asian languages should then come easier to dyslexics than non-dyslexics.  I actually don't know to be sure, but I am curious if that holds any truth to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dyslexic or not, these languages would be more difficult to learn than Spanish if you're learning from a western-language perspective. It's not just about phonetics and reading. There's also grammar and cultural relevance to take into account. </p>
<p>There are a multitude of expressions, idioms, and grammar structures that simply don't translate without more and more cultural background knowledge you have to learn in little pieces before putting it all together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hardest part of learning Japanese as a native English speaker, for me, is how much of the language is <em>implied</em> but not spoken or written. In a way, I had to learn to <strong>think</strong> differently. Many languages can be translated 1:1 with some word order shifted around a bit, but with Japanese (and I'm sure some other languages) it's like you have to discard half the sentence but still <em>know</em> it is there. It can obviously be learned over time, but it's very alien to English speakers. Or at least it was for me.</p></div>		</li>
