			<div class="markdown"><p>Not Eli5 but, under no circumstances will the human body be crushed by increased pressure. The human body is mostly incompressible liquid/solids, and has no air cavities that cannot be equalized.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to a submarine with constant interior pressure which will crush when the exterior pressure applies enough force to break the structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Free divers who fill their lungs at the surface have them collapsed during deep dives because their lung air was just 1 atmosphere. </p>
<p>In a diving bell, the air pressure is x atmospheres and so the air breathed in will be at equal pressure. Feels like normal breathing, to my understanding.</p>
<p>The human body is mechanically robust across pressures of a few dozen atmospheres.  Dissolved gases are the big diving danger, not the pressure itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So your lungs can let air expand or contract! That allowed the pressure inside of them to match the exterior pressure. Even if your lungs are completely empty, your chest won’t collapse inward or anything. It’s not dissimilar from fully exhaling!</p>
<p>The opposite however can be very dangerous. Decreasing external pressure, like swimming up from depth, causing the air in your lungs to expand. If you do this with full lungs and hold your breath, the expanding air can make your lungs pop!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is very little gas in your stomach and intestines. So little that the expansion and contraction of it has never been noticeable to me as a diver. </p>
<p>That being said, if air in your intestines expands and needs to be released, you fart.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So what happens if you lie under the tire of a 16 wheeler raised up using a jack, and then the 16 wheeler is slowly let down to the ground again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I logically get why the air would be pressurized, but I've also heard that pressure is only calculated by what's directly above you in water. So why would the air need to be pressurized? The water would have to be exerting pressure upwards, which makes sense to me, but contradicts pressure being increased only from liquid directly above you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the bell as a cup and the air as a spring. The cup is being pushed down by gravity the the spring is compressed by the object below. The object will enter the cup. To keep the cup from being filled by that object you can add a second that will lift the cup up with both of the spring being compress but filling the same distance as one spring.</p>
<p>The water above is compressing the water next to the bell. If the pressure is higher it will travel to lower pressure compressing the air.</p>
<p>Take a cup to a pool, by about 10 feet, a sixth will be compressed.</p></div>		</li>
