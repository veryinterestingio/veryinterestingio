			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the <em>why</em> is (as always when it comes to things in your body) <strong>selective pressure.</strong></p>
<p>Everyone is born with scores of tiny variations for thousands of different things, hair growth being one. And usually insofar as the environment is concerned, they're entirely neutral.</p>
<p>But there comes a point where the individual hairs can be too long or too short. Such as body hair coverage being too thick to allow effective sweating. Reducing the health of the organism. Therefore reducing mating chances.</p>
<p>Especially relevant for us. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE_o" target="_blank">As our ability to chase things down and cool off through our lack of fur allowed us to hunt things others could not.</a></p>
<p>Compound that over tens of thousands of generations and you find an optimal hair length that's favored by the survivors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DNA and evolution.</p>
<p>Someone, tens of thousands of years ago, had a genetic mutation that caused them to grow less hair on their arms. </p>
<p>This was deemed sexy, either due to a survival advantage it offered or appearing 'exotic'. This person, due to that perceived sexiness, had babies.</p>
<p>Those babies had that less arm hair gene. That gene became dominant and popular. It spread. Now we all have it.</p>
<p>That's the ELI5 answer. It's evolution, baby</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather than being sexy, it's probably more because those with less hair are able to regulate body heat better as they cool down by evaporative cooling of sweat. Those who could stay cool while running for long periods of time have the advantage in long distance running. Couple this with high intelligence, and prey would end up with a relentless tracker which they could never escape from.</p></div>		</li>
