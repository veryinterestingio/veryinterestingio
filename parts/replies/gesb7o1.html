			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my therapist told me something similar. She said, how your mind responds to grief and trauma is its assessment of how much you can handle at the moment. It is its way of protecting you until you're ready.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I thought as well :) She said it in response to my concern of not processing my grief and trauma properly. I was upset that I was seemingly okay and not reacting to an incident the way I expected to. It did bother me but I was unable to cry, and felt dissociated from it and was going through the motions. I asked her how to process this the &quot;right&quot; way and she said this. It was reassuring to hear it because it validated my experience and my reaction and also reassured that my reaction doesn't undermine or downplay what happened and that it's legit and doesn't mean I care less. I really needed to hear that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so glad to have helped. Take your time with it and don't feel guilty for how you feel. Grief isn't linear, nor does it have a timeline. There are no rules how you should react, and how long you should take. And remember to take care and be gentle with yourself. Even surviving the day is an accomplishment and is a form of self care. </p>
<p>You may have already come across this, but just in case... I find this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2/" target="_blank">comment by Reddit user GSnow about grief</a> so helpful, I've revisited it time and time again. It really helped me get a new perspective on grief and I hope it helps you. Hang in there. Sending a virtual hug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a quote by Pat Rothfuss.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the greatest faculty our minds possess is the ability to cope with pain. Classic thinking teaches us of the four doors of the mind, which everyone moves through according to their need.</p>
<p>First is the door of sleep. Sleep offers us a retreat from the world and all its pain. Sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the things that have hurt us. When a person is wounded they will often fall unconscious. Similarly, someone who hears traumatic news will often swoon or faint. This is the mind's way of protecting itself from pain by stepping through the first door.</p>
<p>Second is the door of forgetting. Some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. In addition, many memories are simply painful, and there is no healing to be done. The saying 'time heals all wounds' is false. Time heals most wounds. The rest are hidden behind this door.</p>
<p>Third is the door of madness. There are times when the mind is dealt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is. There are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind. </p>
<p>Last is the door of death. The final resort. Nothing can hurt us after we are dead, or so we have been told.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. Never analysed that but can see parallels with Being physically ill, and being forced to rest. Also, the opposite, where, if under severe pressure, you persevere despite no real energy.</p></div>		</li>
