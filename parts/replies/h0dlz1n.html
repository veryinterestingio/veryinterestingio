			<div class="markdown"><p>It's in stage III trials... in India... where it has been hampered by a lack of volunteers. Wikipedia also says a non-profit in the US owns a patent for it and hasn't done anything with it for 8 years. RISUG gets posted on Reddit frequently and people think it's a for sure thing that's going to happen cause it makes sense. But it's not really close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on the mailing list for the US version, as of 2019 they were completing rabbit trials and i think beginning primate trials. I haven't heard much since then but I wouldn't be surprised if trials were put on hold in 2020. Also they said they would be sending out less frequent/detailed information when they get into human trials so no news might be good news here</p></div>		</li>
