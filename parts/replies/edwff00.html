			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s your answer.  It’s why thermography is used as a predictive maintenance tool to detect poor connections in power wiring.  Localized hot spots mean high resistance, increased voltage drop and higher likelihood of failure.  It exposes connection issues that a simple low current (DMM) ohmmeter can’t.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just about to reply and say the same thing.  You can see the area right under the cables turn red hot and shortly after the wrench turns red near it.  Then the the positive temperature coefficient causes higher resistance which means more power dissipation. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Only with a current source, which is unlikely. Higher resistance here almost certainly means less power dissipation total and anywhere in the circuit, though more difference between the two parts of the circuit if only one is increased. Low resistance is more power dissipation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct of course.   But still, the part of the wrench with higher resistance has higher power dissipation than the part of the wrench with lower resistance.  </p></div>		</li>
