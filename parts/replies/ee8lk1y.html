			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the premise of The Three Body Problem by Liu Cixin. The aliens are desperate to leave their home planet because it’s in a trisolar system, and this makes the orbit so irregular that it causes frequent extinction level events. They send out a signal to test for other planets that can support civilization and go to the first one that responds (in this case Earth.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll have to check that out - I love space conflicts/first contacts that aren't based around the &quot;agressive hive or war like species that is bent on destruction&quot; trope.  Maybe they'd try and carve out a little piece of earth and live peacefully with us, sharing their technology.  The inevitable tensions would make for some great storylines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally, I think <em>Three Body Problem</em> has the most plausible answer to OP's question. And the answer isn't exactly aliens looking for a new planet either. Instead, It poses a nuanced and very believable answer to why aliens would ever invade and at the same time a solution to the fermi paradox. Its hard to describe but I find the theory it presents believable in the same way <em>On the Origin of Species</em> is believable. You look around and it just fits. </p>
<p>But if you haven't read the book yet I don't want to spoil it because the way it builds up to the answer is one of my favorite reading experiences I can remember. </p>
<p>Also worth adding that the crux of Liu Cixin's theory is only revealed in the second book (<em>The Dark Forest</em>) and a lot of people, including me, found the beginning of the first book a little slow. So I would definitely recommend slugging through if you do find it slow, though it picks up very quickly and by halfway through the first book I already knew I was going to be reading the next two in the series back to back. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: 10/10 Would recommend.</strong> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a great book. The first one that OP mentioned is great but a bit slow in some parts and I felt the cultural differences with China / western world (which was actually interesting!!).</p>
<p>The second is just amazing. The Universe is a Dark Forest made me think about cosmic biology and sociology, things I’ve never pondered this way before, and it explains the dark forest theory so well! </p>
<p>Go for it, you won’t be disappointed!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Three Body Problem is the first in a trilogy of Chinese books translated to English. The first book is quite a difficult read, since it's more confusion and setting up for the plot, as well as detailing some Chinese history for context. The next two books are where the series becomes absolutely insane. One of the best, if not <em>the best</em>, hyper-realistic sci-fi trilogies out there. Written by a Liu Cixin, who use to be in the engineering field, so it actually has lots of basis in real science. </p>
<p>Like u/mrwazsx said 10/10 would recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to consider though on the same token, as advanced as they are, it would be trivial for them to conquer us. If they've solved interstellar traveling with an army, then their everything else technology is also lightyears ahead of us.</p>
<p>They might just see us as an easy target for easy resources. Maybe our planet being in the goldilocks zone is easier then terraforming a planet that isn't. Maybe they just conquer for the hell of it, just to explore and expand their empire. Humans have done the exact same thing on earth.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you're wrong at all, just that there are two sides to that &quot;they are way more advanced than us&quot; coin.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless of course the civilization is a religious one. Perhaps instead of our religions, one species has a religion that specifically advances the agenda to wipe out other civilizations. Perhaps it was based on the idea that demons inhabit the stars in their sky and are the cause of all their ills... and a faction decided to progress science to find and obliterate the demons. </p>
<p>I’d like to think that advancing technology would necessarily lead to less religiosity, but that isn’t necessarily the case. After all, it only takes one of a billion societies to do that and to have been motivated enough to advance beyond the societies that didn’t. Motivation is everything. Imagine if other advanced civilizations focused energy on fixing their own planetary issues before advancing outward.... they wouldn’t have the same restrictions or delay. An entire planet dedicated to one goal?  It’s plausible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All interstellar war requires is an unmanned probe to enter the solar system and hit the earth. Anything going fast enough for interstellar travel should have enough velocity to wipe out complex life. If your just interested in our extermination the jobs done. If you want the planter just wait a few thousand years and colonize.</p></div>		</li>

The benefit here is that these habitats are easier to travel to and from, since they don't have the &quot;gravity well&quot; associated with a high mass object like a planet, which takes a large amount of energy to escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are quickly learning that Goldilock zone planets aren't actually as rare as we one thought. That's not to say these other planets have what would be necessary to harbor life, but like many recent discoveries in space, universes, planets around distant stars, and now potentially habitable planets, much of what we thought was rare is actually not all that uncommon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be less about biomass and more about our bio diversity. We look through a few m\^2 of rain-forest and we find some new species. Do it enough and we find a new drug or treatment. It's reductive to think that they'd want something like medicine but the sheer variety that exists in life has the ability to create massively complicated molecules that could be tricky even for advanced aliens to reproduce under lab conditions. They might not find a cure for cancer but they could just find a molecule that makes their flobules trabulize 20% faster/better/harder/stronger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  But you don't need to &quot;invade&quot; for that.  You just hoover up some random selection of biologicals from all across the planet, sequence their DNA, and look for interesting compounds.  Offer to share the results with the locals and they'll help you do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting as a thought experiment but I still struggle to find it compelling because if biological evolved systems can assemble such molecules then a sufficiently advanced alien race would be able to engineer biological systems to do it for them. Humans are already able to do this (e.g. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/22/cannabis-from-yeast-synthetic-biology-cbd" target="_blank">THC yeast</a>) and we are very primitive by comparison to an interstellar race.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would probably be able to synthesise the molecule once they knew of it's existence, but given the effectively infinite ways in which atoms can interact and bond its fairly likely that they would find plenty of undiscovered molecules if they were to index a few species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, but life here is an ~4 billion year result of a lot of serendipity/contingency.  It would be a unique mix.  It would be kind of like travelling to a different country and finding an entire library full of books.  Sure, back home you have plenty of books of your own and there would probably be plenty of similar themes, but there might be some new &quot;gems&quot; in there.  Life would be similar.  Familiar but different.</p>
<p>Thing is, as other people have mentioned, there wouldn't really be a need to invade to sample the biological diversity.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of that would actually give a rationale for invasion are things like politics or religion (i.e. not a practical reason at all), or simply to occupy and use another liveable planet, which as other people have mentioned doesn't really seem justified either when you could build something more local from asteroidal materials if you compare the resource demands of interstellar travel.</p></div>		</li>
