			<div class="markdown"><p>Stage actors are paid a minimum of the rehearsal rate, which is negotiated by the state actors' union Actors Equity. They may get more if their agent can negotiate it.</p>
<p>Edit: two points for clarity:</p>
<p>1 - not all companies/theaters/shows are AE and so the talent might not get paid before opening week, and </p>
<p>2 - talent is not paid fir rehearsal after opening unless they work beyond the contracted hours in a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be surprised how little rehearsal time can be before the cast moves into the theatre and tech starts.  Three or four weeks in the rehearsal studio is pretty common.  Then they'll move to the theatre for tech, which will be another week or two.  Though those weeks in tech aren't for the cast to be learning their tracks, they're there to add in scenery, lighting, and costumes.</p>
<p>The other thing that I'm not seeing people touching on is the <em>how</em> of how cast and crew get paid.  In theatre (so Broadway and every tour that I've worked on) the producers will set up an LLC for the show itself.  If you're working on a show you'll be an employee of that LLC, and your paychecks and tax documents will come from the LLC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much everything forms an llc, whether it is for movies or tv or theater.  It is the foundation of hollywood accounting.  The studio then charges the llc for the use of its soundstages and equipement and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only do TV/film, but I guarantee they get paid for all that time! It may just be in a different scale, like 500/week for pre production and rehearsal, then 2000/week for performances (totally making up these numbers). I’ve only seen broadway director deals, never actors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are non union theater shops that the actor's don't get paid until the first actual performance.  It is far from the norm but it does exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah that’s a good point! I’m only talking like big time broadway here. For smaller productions/shops I’m sure it runs the gamut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work as an actor for a regional theater, big enough to afford a couple union contracts per show. It’s unique in the sense that everyone’s schedule is affected by those actors who are in the union. We have to take a certain amount of breaks for certain amounts of time, and we get paid differently. I get a stipend based on how many rehearsals I’m required to attend, which can max out. So if I go to more than 30 rehearsals I believe, I’m basically working for free. Then from there I get paid per show, after the show opens.</p></div>		</li>
