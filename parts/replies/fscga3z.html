			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably the same you reason you wear a seatbelt on a plane during landing and take off, being more secure during the most dangerous part of the journey.</p>
<p>If something happened and they would lose the oxygen/pressure of the cabin the helmet is already on and ready.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have there been situations in which an astronaut, strapped to a vehicle made of 98% fuel going 10 times the speed of sound, has survived an accident involving said vehicle because of the helmet? </p>
<p>Like I get the purpose of having it in case of depressurization, but I donâ€™t see it helping in any kind of say, impact-based accident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Challenger accident they recovered 4 emergency air packs, used to provide breathable air in an emergency situation. These could only be activated manually by the astronauts.</p>
<p>3 of the 4 had been activated. They were used at a significant amount of their capacity. Clearly none of the astronauts &quot;survived&quot; but it seems like they made it through the initial break up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ther are there to protect them is there is a leak and there is no longer a breathable atmosphere in the spacecraft. </p>
<p>The advantage of a space ship with the crew on top and not on the side like the shuttle is that everything explosive is behind you.</p>
<p>So you can have a launch escape system with extra small rockets that pull the crew capsule forward away from the exploding. So if a rocket fails and explode behind it should pull them to safety. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu5Ydz34oVc" target="_blank">It was tested</a> with the Crew Dragon  back in January</p>
<p>No crew has even died on top of a rocket with an escape system like that. A  Soyuz that caught fire just before launch and the escape system carried the crew to safety.</p>
<p>The sitting beside and not escape system was one of the main problems with the space shuttle. Challenge was destroyed when the tanks burst apart and exploded. Columbia was destroyed on reentry but the reason what that stuff fell of the tank and hit and damage the spacecraft, that could not have happened if it was ontop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know about the launch esacpe system and stuff it just seems like if something goes wrong a helmet isn't gonna make that much of a difference. It seems like the only thing the helmet would protect against is an air leak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>launch escape system is there to take the capsule out of harms way before the fireball happens. But there is still a chance of a pressure loss, or them bumping their head the wrong way, etc. and helmet's there to prevent that.</p>
<p>Even normal launch is quite the g load, and LES is even worse. Think an ejection seat, but for the whole Dragon capsule + the trunk underneath it.</p></div>		</li>
