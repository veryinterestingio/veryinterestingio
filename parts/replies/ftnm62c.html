<p>You can, however, get <em>extremely</em> close.  Considering various sized dust particles, particle adhesion goes roughly with surface area, as does drag, so those two will cancel out.  Thus, we are just left with larger particle extending further out into the airstream.  Increasing the velocity gradient increases the shear rate, which means you can establish a detaching force for lower diameter particles.  This is why e.g. an air nozzle on a pneumatic line can quite effectively blow dust off a surface, due to the few-hundred-mph/inch shear rate.</p>
<hr />
<p>That said, there <em>is</em> a limit in which you can actually remove all the dust.  It just requires that your mean free path be large enough that the no-slip condition no longer really applies.  This would be unusual to encounter in normal conditions, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: extremely low pressures.  You have so few particles around the object, that the incoming ones have a clear ballistic shot to travel straight and smash directly into the object.</p></div>		</li>
