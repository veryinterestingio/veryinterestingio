			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a little bit of cause-and-effect confusion with inflation from time to time.</p>
<p>The central bank (Federal Reserve) does not <em>directly</em> cause inflation.  No one ever issues a proclamation that says &quot;Everyone raise prices!&quot; which then somehow stimulates the economy.</p>
<p>What happens is that central banks make loans cheaper and easier to get.  This stimulates investment in the economy which boosts employment.  This in turn can lead to inflation as a side effect because an overheated economy can bid up the price of things.</p>
<p>What happens is that the central bank can choose not to worry about this side effect.  They can decide that the boost to the economy is worth the small increase in prices.  At some point, if prices keep going up, the central bank will start worrying about inflation again.  They'll decide they need to make loans more expensive and more difficult again -- slowing down the economy in order to control prices.</p>
<p>Where this point is located is always up for debate but many feel that low-but-nonzero inflation is where the balance is.  But it's not the inflation which directly causes the change in investment, it is the relative ease and availability of credit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, its generally not, especially when you want growth, you want things to move forward, if all you're doing is meeting basic needs, things aren't going to get better or change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What sort of interaction are banks and economists hoping for? Physical things like houses, cars? Or more abstract things like stocks or startups? If you don't have any desire for such things, is the solution to put money in hedgefonds or other complicated economic processes with a history of losing people money?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Construction for example is one of the biggest employers in my country, if people didnt buy houses/apartments, (many buy a Second as a investment) the sector would shrink and leave many unemployed, which in turn would result in many everyday services closing shop because less clients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You want a raise, so you can buy more stuff.  That means your employer has to raise prices to cover your raise.  Repeat a few million times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deflation was pretty much one of the biggest harms during the great depression in the 1920s, standing at around 5-10% during a long stretch.</p>
<p>Then we have inflation and the most agreed upon number is roughly 2% per year. What isnt taken into account in all of this at least from the side of politics is that a 2% inflation rate pretty much means the rich gets richer on par or slightly below inflation without even earning anything.</p></div>		</li>
