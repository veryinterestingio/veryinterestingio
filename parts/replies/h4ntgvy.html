			<div class="markdown"><p>I think part of the fundamental operations of the company account for the &quot;lost&quot; money of a share.  They use the 100 you gave them for the share in operations that they are hope are profitable.  If they make a good decision they turn the 100 into 110 and the value of your share goes up separately but correlated.  If they make a bad decision then 100 turns into 90 and the value of your share drops accordingly.  However like everyone said the belief or perception of value has a much stronger influence in the short term compared to long term sustainability and operational success.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the only thing that changes is belief.  People believe something's worth changed.  It doesn't have to be for any actual business reason.</p>
<p>Something can be fundamentally completely without any value, but if people believe it to have a high price, it'll cost a lot to buy.  This is how cryptocurrency works.</p></div>		</li>
