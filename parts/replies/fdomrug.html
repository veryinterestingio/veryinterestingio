Edit: I always imagined it would feel like water because of the density. You can't feel a gas, but can feel a liquid because of the density, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at the 'surface' you couldn't. The sun's photosphere has a density of around <strong>0.000000001 g/cm**</strong>^(3)<strong>, while its average density is around </strong>1.41 g/cm<strong>**^(3)</strong>.</p>
<p>For comparison, at sea level the earth's atmosphere has a density of around <strong>0.0012 g/cm**</strong>^(3)<strong>, and water has a denisty of </strong>1.0 g/cm<strong>**^(3)</strong>. So the sun's 'surface' is much less dense than air, while on average it's about one and a half times as dense as water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can feel a gas though, think wind. When you're talking about gases though you don't really think of it's particles per area in terms of density though that isn't directly related to why you don't feel a gas. </p>
<p>In order for you to &quot;feel&quot; something, you have to experience a change, or a force. Because gas particles are so light in terms of weight, and spread out with lots of flexibility to move around when displaced, you don't really feel a force when gas particles come into contact with your skin. The exception is when the interaction between the particles or your skin creates a great enough force for your nerves to pick up, like wind or if you're exercising. </p>
<p>To answer your question about whether or not you'd be able to feel a plasma essentially, yes, so long as the interaction that the particles have with your skin creates a strong enough force.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right, wave your palm back and forth real fast in front of you. You will feel the gas that you're bathing in right now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ooh, bad news here...</p>
<p>So it should strike you as a little odd when someone cites a modern paper with exactly one author - it certainly happens, but it can also be a red flag that you might be looking at someone that everyone else refuses to work with. More alarm bells should be going off when it's a reference to a non-peer-reviewed conference proceeding as in this case  - literally anyone can submit one of those so long as they pay the registration fee. Making it worse, the only peer-reviewed citations for this author are from &quot;Progress in Physics&quot;, a questionable Russian journal very far outside the mainstream that has a bit of a reputation for publishing research from quacks (cold fusion, alternative gravity, disproofs of relativity...that kind of stuff).</p>
<p>Digging a little deeper, it would seem this author is not actually a solar physicist or even an astronomer at all. He's a radiologist who used to be the director of MRI research at his university, until he was asked to step down for promoting non-mainstream beliefs outside his area of expertise. <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pierre-Marie_Robitaille" target="_blank">Not a good look.</a></p>
<p>I tried to get through one of his videos; his understanding of physics is so fundamentally flawed (e.g. &quot;a body with no surfaces cannot have gas pressure, because there's no surface for the gas molecules to bounce off&quot;) that I don't even know where to begin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Looks like your friend was told that the existence of a hypothetical state of hydrogen(an incredibly fascinating one which could revolutionize every aspect of society by solving the room-temperature superconductors problem and maybe make fusion power viable) had been confirmed real. </p>

<p>Uh,  researchers have been making metallic hydrogen in the lab for over 20 years now, usually creating it for a split-second with some kind of implosion. Citations start with <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.1860" target="_blank">Weir, et al (1996)</a>, conductivities were measured by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921452698013039" target="_blank">Ternovoi, et al (1999)</a>, deuterium was made metallic by <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.5564" target="_blank">Celliers, et al (2000)</a>, claims of <em>atomic</em> metallic hydrogen were made by <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/16/39/034/meta" target="_blank">Badiei, Holmlid (2004)</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>That said, in no way is the Sun made of metallic hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>
