			<div class="markdown"><p>Followup question:  How long does the resulting unstable molecule last?  For example, if water includes an H^3 atom, which decays to He^3 by positron emission, we have, briefly, a molecule of He^(3)HO or He^(3)HO^(+) depending on whether the beta^(+) particle escaped or annihilated with one of the electrons associated with the original water molecule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any radioactive decay basically obliterates the molecule. The energy involved in a decay is orders of magnitude higher than any chemical bond. Remember that momentum is conserved, so if an atom decays and emits a particle that shoots off in a direction with momentum p, the daughter atom will shoot off in the opposite direction with momentum p (if more than two are emitted, the sum of the momenta all three is zero). Because the decay has so much energy, the daughter particle recoils with a lot of energy, ripping it away from the parent molecule. The parent molecule is likely not even in 'one piece' and could further break apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That returns to statistical mechanics and chemistry for this. It depends on conditions first of all like pressure and temperature. Metals will be more stable. Follow standard reaction rates for this. However, remember the molecules are fully &quot;dissolved&quot;.  You will also have H+ and OH- groups in water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I missing something here?  How do you get from tritium to helium-3 via positron emission?  You have to turn one of the two neutrons into a proton, so that would beta-minus decay, wouldnâ€™t it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you're right.  It would be beta-minus decay.</p></div>		</li>
