With that in mind, they're naturally gonna want their business hours to work with the typical business hours of their big clients</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, my nearest bank branch for the business I work at has a dedicated business banking teller, as well as express banking options solely for business accounts. I can walk in and see a teller immediately to deposit store takings while the “regular” customers have to line up and can be waiting upwards of 20mins. This particular branch also gives certain accounts which turnover more than x amount a dedicated account manager we can call directly and get immediate service, rather than waiting in a phone queue to speak to a customer service rep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My local chase does this. There’s the entire line pole thing going on for the regular line and literally nothing for the business line. It sucks cause the business teller will help regular customers (totally fine) but then you get in the business line and you have to go next even while the people in the regular line we’re watching a regular person get helped by that teller then have to yield to you. </p>
<p>It’s such a flex and one that I don’t like so i usually just stay in the regular teller line anyways. Nothing against chase, they’re my favorite big branch bank, but boy does that feel weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is that it’s not mutually exclusive. </p>
<p>I’m currently switching to do my banking with metro bank. They’re open 363 days a year, and at hours that people and businesses can use.</p>
<p>Compare to Halifax, which has been my primary institution for pay and bills for the last 14 years. </p>
<p>Last month my debit card broke (the chip stopped working for chip and pin). I contacted them and said “I don’t have a payment card”. They said that a replacement card took a week and couldn’t be expedited, but if I needed cash I could go into a branch.</p>
<p>It broke on Saturday afternoon. Halifax shut at midday on Saturday, don’t open on Sunday and aren’t open outside 9-5 in the week. I work 9-5. I get a 30 minute lunch break and the nearest branch is a 20 minute drive away as I work outside town. Best case I could get there, get cash, get back was 50 minutes. </p>
<p>So for a week, I had no way to access my cash. In the end, I went to metro bank on Monday (because they’re open 8-8 in the week) when I got home from work.</p>
<p>I opened an account and they made me a debit card then and there. Guess which bank is the one who came out looking good? And which one is the one where I’m gonna keep the account open for the moment but relegate it to a secondary account and maybe close it in the near future? My business might not be worth as much as a 10m company, but it’s still lost business.</p>
<p>I’m not even saying Halifax need to open 8-8 like metro bank, but if they opened 8-6, non commercial customers would at least have a chance to get to branch when they need it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of Halifax branches have tried opening extended hours, and they've almost all cut back those extended hours (all 3 new Scottish branches that opened 5 years ago had Sunday opening initially) because there's not the demand for it.</p>
<p>Same with the extended hours that used to be commonplace on a Thursday for appointments after 5pm. Turns out people don't want to finish work at 5pm then spend 2 hours talking to a mortgage adviser before they eventually get home at half 7.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know about where you live but here its pretty much the same, banks have weird hours, they are starting to open on saturdays</p>
<p>Getting a new card is like 5 ish business days. </p>
<p>You could put your cards on Apple pay or android equivalent. Credit card and debit. </p>
<p>Pretty much all stores have now the option to Tap to pay. ( where a live at least )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which country is this?</p>
<p>In the UK I can't think of any bank/retailer on my local high street that isn't open on a Sunday... </p>
<p>Though Sunday Trading act be damned because I can't go to Sainsbury's past 5...</p>
<p>Edit: Upon doubting myself and checking Google maps it appears that most banks are in fact closed on a Sunday. Which is weird because I swear I've used a bank on Sunday before.... The weekend does have a tendency to merge into one though...</p></div>		</li>
