			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also add that they utilized a method of counting on your fingers that used the thumb to count the segments of the fingers so they counted 12 with one hand. They used the other hand to count sets of 12 so using two hands they could count to 156 (12 sets of 12 on one hand and a count of 12 on the other).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can count to 1023 if you use a binary system.  If the finger is up then its a 1 down its a 0.  The only thing you have to careful of is the number 4, 128, and 132 (those numbers represent only the middle finger extended).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if that explains why eleven is not called one-teen and twelve is not called two-teen. 11 and 12 get their own names because at one time they were full-fledged numbers in the base 12 system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense. You could then have &quot;thirty-eleven&quot;. </p>
<p>So ten, eleven, twelve, one-teen, two-teen........ eleven-teen..... twenty-nine.... twenty-ten, twenty-eleven.... </p>
<p>Wait. No. Because there wouldn't be a twelve. </p>
<p>So it'd be ten, eleven.... then the teens....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, it is also the reason why we have 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day. It is much easier to split time with those numbers. When the french revolution happened and they started to use base 10 to replace all the other wonky systems, they did so too with time. But the new time system never stuck, as it was overall less practical. They also created a decimal system for angles, called gradients, as others have explained in this thread, that is still somewhat used in certain fields.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar reason why a mile is 5280 feet.  That 8 furlongs (a rounding up of the 7 1/2 furlong Roman mile), which are each 660 feet, which is rounding to a multiple of 60 of the standard length of a plowed furrow in a British field.</p>
<p>Before the metric system, multiples of 60 were all the rage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great explanation. I just want to add my support for the term &quot;superantiprime&quot; to describe highly composite numbers like 36, 60, and 360. It just sounds cooler.</p>
<p>5040 is also a notable superantiprime because it's divisible by 60 numbers, including 1-10. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JM2oImb9Qg" target="_blank">Here is a Numberphile episode about it.</a></p>
<p>Also I want to recommend the movie, The Man Who Knew Infinity, which is about Ramanujan who understood antiprimes better than anyone before or since.</p></div>		</li>
