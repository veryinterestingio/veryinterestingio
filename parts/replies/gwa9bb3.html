			<div class="markdown"><p>YouTube automatically lowers quality regardless of if you’ve set the quality manually.</p>
<p>You can observe this even on fibre gig/gig if you just bandwidth limit any chromium browser with the integrated devtools. I’m still sour that firebug basically got integrated into every browser and spawned the remote JS debugger and devtools that are omnipresent these days, without the proper credit to the creators...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I really wish YouTube had a “stick with my chosen setting and buffer” option</p>
<p>For watching a Vlog lower quality is fine... but when watching a coding tutorial it’s totally useless when the text blurs beyond recognition</p></div>		</li>

<p>YouTube slows down by buffering, because who cares</p>
<p>Zoom slows down by dropping frames and quality randomly degrading so that you can keep up with the stream,</p>

<p>I don't think you know what you're talking about. Both services use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_bitrate_streaming" target="_blank">adaptive bitrate streaming</a> (as do basically all streaming/video conferencing services). Also, both services will &quot;buffer&quot; if they've shown the last frame of video that they currently have available and new packets haven't arrived yet, there's no other choice. Your program can ask for the lower bitrate streams all you want, but if the network is very congested and the next packets haven't come in yet, there's nothing to do but pause the video until more packets do come in... that's what buffering is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zoom is undoubtedly much more aggressive about downgrading your quality than YouTube, to preserve an uninterrupted stream. Furthermore Zoom doesn't really buffer in the same sense that YouTube does. If it drops too many packets in a row, it will not replay them but simply skip them as opposed to YouTube where you want to watch the whole video.</p></div>		</li>
