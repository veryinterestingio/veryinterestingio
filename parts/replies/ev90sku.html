			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be that guy, but I've also heard theories that, I think it's, Uranus (No jokes intended) could possibly be a captured interstellar planet due to is weird rotation. I could be completely wrong, or it could be an idea of random crazy person than an actual astrophysicist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious, these meteorites and other objects couldn't have just &quot;popped&quot; into existence 4.6 billion years ago, the matter they consist of would have existed somewhere before becoming the solar system. How exactly do we account for that? Might be a silly question but I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a valid question!  It's true that in the (simplified) context of 'the Sun and planets formed from space dust', the space dust must've clearly existed originally.  The answer to your question requires that I go into a bit more detail about the process of determining the age of space objects.</p>
<p>Certain elements are formed by certain astronomical phenomena.  It's believed that the formation of the solar system was likely kicked off by a nearby supernova whose shock wave compressed the 'space dust'.  A region of space dust got really compressed and therefore developed stronger gravity and attracted more space dust to itself; it eventually grew so massive that the pressure inside it triggered nuclear fusion, and it became the Sun.  </p>
<p>In this case, the 'certain astronomical phenomenon' is the supernova.  Certain elements, like potassium and uranium, are formed by supernovae--in other words, we can presume they wouldn't have existed prior to the event that led to the formation of the solar system.  So by examining the age of the potassium, uranium, etc. in meteorites etc., we can more or less estimate how long ago the most recent supernova in the vicinity of our solar system occurred, which would probably be the one that kicked off the solar system's formation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m no scientist but wouldn’t meteorites/asteroids/comets be a bad source to judge the age of the solar system by? Countless new foreign celestial objects enter our solar system all the time and they could’ve had no relation to the formation of our solar system.</p>
<p>I’d imagine they take the average age of objects around us cause I’m sure most of the ones that were part of the formation stuck around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard for large numbers of celestial objects or amounts of mass to be collected that way. In terms of orbital mechanics, something needs to be going at the right velocity and angle to reach a sustainable orbit. Too fast relative to the solar system, and the object likely  zooms off on a new trajectory. Too slow, and the object likely ends up falling in the sun or Jupiter. So while we get some matter this way, fhe vast majority of material in the sun's gravity well has been around since its duration.</p>
<p>My understanding is that we have enough samples to rule out the effect of any extrasolar material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, anything that's falling from outside the Sun's gravitational pull is <em>guaranteed</em> to have enough velocity to escape it again. The only way something from outside the Sun could end up orbiting the Sun is through a very unlikely series of gravitational interactions. So while no doubt it's happened in the Sun's past and will happen again, in general, things that are orbiting the Sun (as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua" target="_blank">things that aren't</a>) are almost certainly not interstellar interlopers.</p></div>		</li>
