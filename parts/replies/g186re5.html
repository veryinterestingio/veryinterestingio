			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer! It really make sense...</p>
<p>But in the last question I was talking about an &quot;ideal age&quot; in a biological sense, the age where the body is fully developed and capable of carry a pregrancy with out too much risk for the mother or the baby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn’t produce a perfect system, just what’s good enough.  Humans have risky childbirth in general, the babies just barely fit and mortality is high when no modern medicine is available.</p>
<p>This trade-off was made to give us enormous brains and narrow, efficient hips - taking the heavy childbirth mortality rates in exchange for building a species that could dominate all others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though the narrow hips were only possible because of shorter intestinal tracks....which were only possible after we learned to control fire to kill bacteria in foods....and the big brain wasn’t able to get big enough until intestines got smaller bc not enough blood to go around....weird stuff</p>
<p>(ofc very little of this is fully proven but it’s out there)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that the safest and easiest age to give birth is probably in the 20's too...</p>
<p>Why the 20's?</p>
<p>Simply because it's very difficult to grow a human from baby to adult in a shorter time.</p>
<p>Why can humans get pregnant before their 20's?</p>
<p>Just because humans were very unlikely not to survive into their 20's.</p>
<p>When you have to worry about everything trying to kill you, from the weather, to stronger beasts... the sooner the better.</p>
<p>It's riskier to wait and get eaten than it is to give birth and suffer complications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always found this interesting as it seems to contradict the age at which humans typically desire sex. It's thought that a man's libido peaks in their teens and early 20s, but its around 30-40s for women.</p>
<p>Though I have also read conflicting information for women - biologically, it seems like it should peak in the 20s, but personal accounts often point to 30s. I'd guess this would be due to external factors overriding hormonal urges... stress, birth control, etc.</p>
<p>Either way, you would think peak fertility would align with libido. Our biology seems  a little confused and overly sensitive to external factors to be particularly efficient. I mean there's enough children in the world, we're clearly not suffering as a species. Maybe we're just efficient enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please remember that this age is only for the first try. If you start at 12, you can have as much as 6 kids by the time you're 30. (Assuming 3 years wait between kids). If you start at 20, that's only 4 kids. Even if in most cases the mortality of babies is super high when starting early, this gives tiny edge for those who start early. And it compounds in the evolutionary scale... (Please note the 30y cut off is just arbitrary to show a simplified example)</p>
<p>Also, by the time you have 4th you have 12, 9, and 6 year old helping picking food and what not. Another tiny edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you start at 12, you can have up to 25 kids or more by the time you turn 30. Why stop at 6?  Humans can have twins/triplets/etc, and the gestation period means you can have multiple children within a given 12-month frame. (See: Irish Twins)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also as far as the age thing goes, humans have constantly grown larger (particularly skulls) and aging has downsides (from mobility and such things to an increase in birth defects- plus a shorter life cycle meant that when someone is 'middle aged' at 25 meant it would be common for the parent to die before the child would have had a chance to age to self sufficiency)</p></div>		</li>
