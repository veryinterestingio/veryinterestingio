			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're planning on making an impactful documentary, you need to learn how to get really good at color grading. While other aspects such as resolution and pacing do matter, if you really want to make an emotional appeal to the audience, you need really good color grading. It tells a story with no words. It has the power to turn an ordinary scene into a tragic one. Its abilities don't just stop at emotion, it also has the ability to remove what I call a &quot;milk filter&quot; over video to create better contrast ratios, turning a average scene of a campfire burning into a glowing inferno radiating its light into the dark void of night. Don't underestimate the power of it, so many people focus on special effects but neglect the power of color palettes and grading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lighting also has an effect of this. Cheap, fast productions will use really flat lighting instead of setting more stylized lighting between scenes or takes. Soap operas are a great example of how lighting effects the appearance of the colors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm surprised nobody mentioned a rather large part between the two. Movies are color graded to a higher degree, like in this example</p>

<p>Wow ok, I just wrote my response before scrolling down - and I used the Matrix as an example as well :P</p></div>		</li>
