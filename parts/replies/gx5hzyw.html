			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it a patch of discoloration in the center of the eye? You might have high intraocular pressure or perhaps it could indicate a risk of retinal detachment or an issue with the viscous humor in the eye tugging at the retina. If it is bothering you, run it by a medical professional.</p>
<p>I had that, specifically only in the early morning when I was in undergrad. It was caused by medication and having a big sugary energy drink for my early morning classes. It turned out fine though just had to make some little changes and it stopped happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll get a floater from time to time. I'm not sure if this is floaters though. It's a large solid shape like a kiss mark, and will change shape and color over time. And it doesn't follow where I look like floaters do ðŸ¤” pressure on my eyelids can make it appear too</p></div>		</li>
